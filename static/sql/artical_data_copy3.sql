Image segmentation can present misleading or even erroneous results if applied to continuous spatial changes in vegetation. Even methods that allow for multiple-class memberships of pixels presuppose the existence of ideal types of species assemblages that constitute mixtures-an assumption that does not fit the case of continua where any section of a gradient is as \'pure\' as any other section like in modulations of grassland species composition.   Thus, we attempted to spatially model floristic gradients in Bavarian meadows by extrapolating axes of an unconstrained ordination of species data. The models were based on high-resolution hyperspectral airborne imagery. We further modelled the distribution of plant functional response types (Ellenberg indicator values) and the cover values of selected species. The models were made with partial least squares (PLS) regression analyses. The realistic utility of the regression models was evaluated by full leave-one-out cross-validation.   The modelled floristic gradients showed a considerable agreement with ground-based observations of floristic gradients (R-2 = 0.71 and 0.66 for the first two axes of ordination). Apart from mapping the most important continuous floristic differences, we mapped gradients in the appearance of plant functional response groups as represented by averaged Ellenberg indicator values for soil pH (R-2 = 0.76), water supply (R-2 = 0.66) and nutrient supply (R-2 = 0.75), while models for the cover of single species were weak.   Compared to many other vegetation attributes, plant species composition is difficult to detect with remote sensing techniques. This is partly caused by a lack of compatibility between methods of vegetation ecology and remote sensing. We believe that the present study has the potential to increase compatibility as neither spectral nor vegetation information gets lost by a classifying step. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Meanwhile the frequency of the cloud systems exhibits the clear afternoon (similar to 1600 LST) peak over the land and the ocean that indicates that afternoon is the initiation times of land-based clusters over Bangladesh and water-based clusters in the analyzed ocean (87.44-93.33degreesE; 15.7-21.08degreesN).   Radar data from Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) for consecutive 135 days from 16 April 2000 over Bangladesh are utilized to obtain the diumal variations and characteristics of precipitation in relation to cloud activity. The nature of the diurnal cycle of precipitation in Bangladesh is that there is a morning peak at 0600 LST with minimum at noon. The frequency of the echoes exhibits two peaks-one in the afternoon (similar to 1500 LST) and the other in the morning (0600 LST) hours. The smaller echoes dominate in the afternoon while larger echoes develop in the early morning. The shape, lifetime, horizontal length and movement of the precipitation features in Bangladesh are also investigated using radar data. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

A careful selection of cloud-free measurements with a large directional coverage lead to about 22,000 sets of measured Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDFs). This data set is used to evaluate the ability of analytical models to reproduce the observed directional signatures. Among those evaluated, the best models appear to be the three-parameter linear Ross-Li model, and the nonlinear Rahman-Pinty-Verstraete (RPV) model. On the other hand, all models fail to accurately reproduce the sharp reflectance increase (hot spot) close to the backscattering direction. Based on physical considerations, we suggest a modification of the Ross-Li model, without adding a free parameter, to account for the complex radiative transfer within the canopy that leads to the hot spot signature. The modified linear model performs better than all others, including the RPV nonlinear model. Although the correction modifies the retrieved directional signature parameters, it does not change significantly the surface albedo estimates. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The current work deals with the use of the NOAA-AVHRR and Landsat-TM/ETM+ images to produce long-term NDVI data series characterising coniferous and broadleaved forests in a protected coastal area in Tuscany (Central Italy). Two methods to extract NDVI values of relatively small vegetated areas from NOAA-AVHRR data were first evaluated by comparison to estimates from higher resolution Landsat-TM/ETM+ images. The optimal method was then applied to multitemporal AVHRR data series to derive 10-day NDVI profiles of coniferous and broadleaved forests over a 15-year period (1986-2000). Trend analyses performed on these data series showed that notable NDVI decreases occurred during the study period, particularly for the coniferous forest in summer and early fall. Further analysis carried out on local meteorological measurements led to identify the likely causes of these negative trends in contemporaneous winter rainfall decreases which were significantly correlated with the found NDVI variations.

One of the earliest and perhaps most surprising results from orbital SAR images of the Sahara was that, under certain conditions, radar signals penetrated up to several meters of sand to reveal subsurface features such as ancient river channels. Subsequent studies of radar penetration of and sand deposits have dealt with factors that govern the ability of radar to penetrate a sand cover. This paper presents results from a laboratory experiment in which radar backscatter from a surface of rocks was measured under controlled conditions as a function of frequency, polarization, incidence angle, and sand cover thickness. The sand used in the experiment had a moisture content of 0.28 vol.% and caused calculated average attenuations of 4.2 +/- 1 dB/m for C-band and similar to 11 +/- 2 dB/m for X-band. Results from the experiment were compared to field measurements of sand thickness during acquisition of airborne radar images. In AIRSAR images, the extent of dry sand in a dune field appears best in C-band because longer wavelength L- and P-band signals penetrate thinner sand deposits. Images of wet sand (4.9 vol.%) suggest that L-band was able to penetrate thin sand even though that sand was wet. Together, these laboratory and field measurements contribute towards a better understanding of how a sand cover modifies the radar backscatter of a surface. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

This research evaluated three different methods of processing hyperspectral imagery: minimum noise fraction (MNF), continuum removal, and band ratio indices for mapping iceplant (Carpobrotus edulis) and jubata grass (Cortaderia jubata) in California\'s coastal habitat. Validation with field sampling data showed high mapping accuracies for all methods for identifying presence or absence of iceplant (97%), with the MNF procedure producing the highest accuracy (55%) when the classes were divided into four different densities of iceplant.

Two characteristics of flooded vegetation are observed: backscatter enhanced by approximately 1.2 dB at C-band, and 180degrees HH-VV phase differences at L-band. Both are indicative of a double bounce backscattering mechanism between the horizontal water surface and upright emergent vegetation. The mapping of inundated vegetation is demonstrated for both these signatures, using a statistical active contour model for the C-band enhanced backscatter, and median filtering and thresholding for the L-band HH-VV phase difference. The two techniques are validated against the waterline derived from tidal elevation measured at the time of overpass intersected with an intertidal DEM derived from airborne laser altimetry. The inclusion of flooded vegetation is found to reduce errors in waterline location by a factor of approximately 2, equivalent to a reduction in waterline location error from 120 to 70 m. The DEM is also used to derive SAR waterline heights, which are observed to underpredict the tidal elevation due to the effects of vegetation. The underprediction can be corrected for vegetation effects using canopy height maps derived from the laser altimetry. This third technique is found to improve the systematic error in waterline heights from 20 to 4 cm, but little improvement in random error is evident, chiefly due to significant noise in the vegetation height map.

Knowledge of community structure is essential to understanding many reef processes. To develop techniques for identification and mapping of reef bottom-types using remote sensing, we measured 13, 100 in situ optical reflectance spectra (400-700 nm, 1-nm intervals) of 12 basic reef bottom-types in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans: fleshy (1) brown, (2) green, and (3) red algae; non-fleshy (4) encrusting calcareous and (5) turf algae; (6) bleached, (7) blue, and (8) brown hermatypic coral; (9) soft/gorgonian coral; (10) seagrass; (11) terrigenous mud; and (12) carbonate sand. Each bottom-type exhibits characteristic spectral reflectance features that are conservative across biogeographic regions. Most notable are the brightness of carbonate sand and local extrema near 570 nm in blue (minimum) and brown (maximum) corals. Classification function analyses for the 12 bottom-types achieve mean accuracies of 83%, 76%, and 71% for full-spectrum data (301-wavelength), 52-wavelength, and 14-wavelength subsets, respectively. The distinguishing spectral features for the 12 bottom-types exist in well-defined, narrow (10-20 nm) wavelength ranges and are ubiquitous throughout the world. We reason that spectral reflectance features arise primarily as a result of spectral absorption processes. Radiative transfer modeling shows that in typically clear coral reef waters, dark substrates such as corals have a depth-of-detection limit on the order of 10-20 in. Our results provide the foundation for design of a sensor with the purpose of assessing the global status of coral reefs.

Besides its applications in physical geography, such as ran-off models and urban change studies, maps showing impervious surface distribution are essential for estimating socio-economic factors, such as population density and social conditions. In this paper, impervious surface distribution, together with vegetation and soil cover, is estimated through a fully constrained linear spectral mixture model using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data within the metropolitan area of Columbus, OH in the United States. Four endmembers, low albedo, high albedo, vegetation, and soil were selected to model heterogeneous urban land cover. Impervious surface fraction was estimated by analyzing low and high albedo endmembers. The estimation accuracy for impervious surface was assessed using Digital Orthophoto Quarterquadrangle (DOQQ) images. The overall root mean square (RMS) error was 10.6%, which is comparable to the digitizing errors of DOQQ images. Results indicate that impervious surface distribution can be derived from remotely sensed imagery with promising accuracy. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

MODIS 250 m surface reflectance data availability was limited both spatially and temporally in the first year after launch due to processing system constraints. To address this situation, the VCC algorithms were applied to available MODIS 250 m Level 113 radiance data to test the VCC change detection algorithms presented in this paper. Five data sets of MODIS Level 1B 250 m data were collected for the year 2000, representing: (1) Idaho-Montana wildfires; (2) the Cerro Grande prescribed fire in New Mexico; (3) flood in Cambodia; (4) Thailand-Laos flood retreat; and (5) deforestation in southern Brazil. Decision trees are developed for each of the VCC change detection methods for each of these six cases. These decision trees are to be used for updating the look-up tables required by the VCC production code. For these change detection cases, the VCC change detection methods worked reasonably well. In the Idaho-Montana wildfire case, a fire perimeter polygon data set compiled by the USDA Forest Service was used to validate the output of the VCC change detection methods. Although the VCC output identified only 32% of the burned pixels within the ground observed Idaho-Montana fire perimeter polygons, the detection accuracy of the VCC output did reach 99% when the VCC product is considered as an alarm system identifying the occurrence of the change in an area. For other cases, the detection accuracy in per-pixel terms of the VCC output ranges from 55% to 90% against reference change bitmaps that were created by image interpretation. Look-up tables created with AVHRR and Landsat Thematic Mapper data require modifications for the MODIS data due to differences in radiometric response between MODIS and the heritage instruments. The applications presented in this paper also evaluate the relative performance of each of the five change detection methods used as VCC algorithms. Conclusions reached in this paper will be used for future refinement of the VCC product. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.', 'Univ Maryland, Dept Geog, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

This instrument has been applied continuously during 17 days of water stress development to follow the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of a potted grapevine. Gas-exchange rates for H2O and CO2 and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of the same leaf were recorded concurrently. It was shown that: (1) Under well-watered conditions, before noon, a correlation was found between net photosynthetic rate and the rate of electron transport calculated from fluorescence measurements. After several hours of high light exposure, CO2 assimilation (A) started to decrease more than the rate of electron transport (ETR). Under drought conditions, the above-mentioned correspondence was lost: when A almost vanished due to high stomatal closure, the ETR was still about 50% of the control value. It is suggested that under these conditions, the ratio of photorespiration to CO2 assimilation increased (2) Light response of the quantum yield of ETR became increasingly different between,morning and afternoon as water stress progressed, thus serving as a good indicator of plant water status. (3) A simple fluorescence parameter, Fs, accurately reflected the plant physiological state. Over the range of light intensities used in this study, this parameter changed in parallel with irradiance in well-watered plants. With increasing water stress, Fs changed in opposite direction to irradiance changes. The response of Fs to rapid changes in irradiance was fast (within seconds). The potential of this parameter for remote sensing of water stress is discussed.

These numerical results are used to evaluate an analytic model for daily photosynthesis that requires daily total irradiance, recognizing that readily available global satellite data provide daily total irradiance rather than diurnal values of direct and diffuse irradiances. The analytic model is derived by considering the light response function for leaf photosynthesis to be a rectangular hyperbola. The evaluation was done by using field observations for 27 canopies representing four cultivated and seven uncultivated species and having a leaf area index between 0.6 and 5.9. The evaluation gives a mean maximum uncertainty of 32% for the analytic equation. The magnitude of uncertainty can be reduced by knowing the diffuse fraction of incident radiation.

The data for this study comes from ground-level hyperspectral reflectance measurements of cotton, potato, soybeans, corn, and sunflower. Reflectance was measured in 490 discrete narrow bands between 350 and 1,050 nm. Observed crop characteristics included wet biomass, leaf area index, plant height, and (for cotton only) yield. Three types of hyperspectral predictors were tested: optimum multiple narrow band reflectance (OMNBR), narrow band normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) involving all possible two-band combinations of 490 channels, and the soil-adjusted vegetation indices. A critical problem with OMNBR models was that of \"over fitting\" (i.e., using more spectral channels than experimental samples to obtain a highly maximum R-2 value). This problem was addressed by comparing the R-2 values of crop variables with the R-2 values computed for random data of a large sample size. The combinations of two to four narrow bands in OMNBR models explained most (64% to 92%) of the variability in crop biophysical variables. The second part of the paper describes a rigorous search procedure to identify the best narrow band NDVI predictors of crop biophysical variables. Special narrow band lambda (lambda(1)) versus lambda (lambda(2)) plots of R-2 values illustrate the most effective wavelength combinations (lambda(1) and lambda(2)) and bandwidths (Delta lambda(1) and Delta lambda(2)) for predicting the biophysical quantities of each crop. The best of these two-band indices were further tested to see if soil adjustment or nonlinear fitting could improve their predictive accuracy. The best of the narrow band NDVI models explained 64% to 88% variability in different crop biophysical variables. A strong relationship with crop characteristics is located in specific narrow bands in the longer wavelength portion of the red (650 to 700 nm), with secondary clusters in the shorter wavelength portion of green (500 nm to 550 nm), in one particular section of the near-infrared (900 nm to 940 nm), and in the moisture sensitive near-infrared (centered at 982 nm). This study recommends a 12 narrow band sensor, in the 350 nm to 1,050 nm range of the spectrum, for optimum estimation of agricultural crop biophysical information.

For example, the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 signals some of the dramatic socioeconomic and political decisions that may lie ahead concerning CO(2) emissions and global carbon cycle impacts. These decisions will rely heavily on accurate measures of global biospheric changes (Schimel 1998; IGBP TCWG, 1998). An array of national and international programs have inaugurated global satellite observations, critical field measurements of carbon and water fluxes, and global model development for the purposes of beginning to monitor the biosphere. The detection by these programs of interannual variability of ecosystem fluxes and of longer term trends will permit early indication of fundamental biospheric changes which might otherwise go undetected until major biome conversion begins. This article describes a blueprint for more comprehensive coordination of the various flux measurement and modeling activities into a global terrestrial monitoring network that will have direct relevance to the political decision making of global change.

In the first part of this article, we recall those six methods and show mathematically that they are almost equivalent to each other. Then, using simulated data for the TIMS (Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner) instrument, we analyze the sensitivity of those methods to different sources of error which may occur in real data such as errors due to 1) method simplification, 2) instrumental noise and systematic calibration error, 3) uncertainties on the estimation of downwelling atmospheric radiance, and 4) uncertainties of atmospheric parameters in atmospheric corrections. In terms of resulting errors in relative emissivity, the results show that: a) all methods are very sensitive to the uncertainties of atmosphere. An error of 20% of water vapor in midlatitude summer atmosphere (2.9 cm) may lead to an error of 0.03 (rms) for Channel 1 (worst case) of TIMS. b) The effect of the atmospheric reflection term is very important. If this term is neglected in method development, this may lead to an error of 0.03 (mns) for Channel 1 and midlatitude summer atmosphere. This Is the case for the alpha method. c) Instrumental noise commonly expressed by noise equivalent difference temperature (NE Delta T) from 0.1 K to 0.3 K results in an error on relative emissivity ranging from 0.002 to 0.005 for all methods. d) Error on relative emissivity due to the instrumental calibration error (systematic error;) is negligible. The study also shows that the relative emissivity derived with deviate atmosphere is linearly related to its actual value derived with correct atmospheric parameters. Based on this property, we propose three methods to correct for the errors caused by atmospheric corrections render horizontally invariant atmospheric conditions. A practical analysis with the real TIMS data acquired for Hapex-Sahel experiment in 1992 supports the results of this simulation.

The basic data came from an Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) image obtained during the regional dry season and two Landsat 5-Thematic Mapper (TM) images from the dry and rainy seasons. Principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to a set of 64 AVIRIS bands from the interval of 500-1100 nm in order to select the R-NIR band pair of greatest spectral contrast and respective endmember spectra for the R and NIR band variations. For the endmember spectra, modeled AVIRIS-derived NDVI values, obtained by changing the spectral positioning and bandwidths of R-NIR band pairs, were compared with NDVI calculated from simulated R-NIR band pairs of orbital sensors. Furthermore, the suitability of different positions and bandwidths was also examined employing, as criterion, the calculated NDVI contrast between the endmember spectra. The results revealed that the NDVI of the green vegetation was essentially affected by the proximity of the R and NIR bands to the spectral interval of the red edge and NIR bands to the spectral interval of the red edge (690-750 nm). The strongest effects were observed for the R bands that partly extended longwards the 690 nm wavelength. On the other hand, the NDVI of the nonphotosynthetic vegetation varied up to 100% within the studied interval, especially as a function of the R-NIR spectral distance. The largest NDVI contrast between given the 690 nm and 750 nm wavelengths, as predicted from PCA. Results from simulated orbital sensors demonstrated that bandwidths have no significant influence on the NDVI provided the R and NIR bands are not extended into the red edge domain. The variable NDVI contrasts along traverses presented the smallest values when associated with the conspicuous green vegetation, and the largest values when associated with the dried-out grasslands or exposed soils.

By normalizing reflectance data with the nadir reflectance as a reference, a strong influence of reflectance intensity on observed reflectance an isotropy is demonstrated for both vegetation canopies. This is explained by multiple scattering effects inside vegetation canopies as a function of canopy spectral absorbance characteristics. Two quantities based on canopy reflectances are utilized for characterizing the spectrally variable dynamics of BRDF effects: the anisotropy factor (ANIF), which is simply a normalization with nadir reflectance, and the anisotropy index (ANIX) defined as the ratio between the maximum and minimum reflectance values In the principal plane (or defined azimuth plane) per spectral band. Using these two quantities the study revealed that the basic physical reflectance mechanisms described by Kimes (1983) for broad spectral bands are extendable to hyperspectral bidirectional reflectance data. In addition, the influences of canopy geometry and multiple scattering on BRDF are clearly demonstrated for the erectophile grass lawn and the planophile watercress canopy. Since multiple scattering effects and canopy geometry are dominant factors regulating BRDF effects, vegetation canopy architecture parameters such as the leaf area index might be derived from hyperspectral BRDF data.

Simulations of principal plane spectral reflectances (0.5-0.6 mu m, 0.06-0.7 mu, 0.7-0.8 mu m, and 0.8-1.1 mu m), for vegetated canopies with LAI values ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 under solar zenith angles of 20, 30, and 45 degrees, were generated with the use of a one-dimensional radiative transfer model. The simulated reflectances were then fit with a simple model by using a least squares procedure. Plots of the resulting coefficients with LAI showed that the degree of curvature of the simulated principal plane reflectances, as represented by one of the coefficients, and the coefficient expressing interaction of view zenith angle and view azimuth angle were both related to LAI. This relation holds in all four spectral bands, including the 0.7-0.8 mu m band, despite a lack of relation between the constant coefficient (which is closely related to the nadir value) and LAI. Examination of the coefficients relating to solar zenith angle revealed a dependence on LAI. The coefficient for view zenith angle, or a related quantity, is suggested as a candidate for a bidirectional index that may be useful within the context of satellite-based vegetation classification and characterization schemes.

A procedure was developed and tested to divorce the laser and ground data collection efforts using three distinct data sets acquired in and over the tropical forests of Costa Rica. Fixed-area ground plot data were used to simulate the height characteristics of the tropical forest canopy and to simulate laser measurements of that canopy. On two of the three study sites, the airborne laser estimates of basal area, volume, and biomass grossly misrepresented ground estimates of same. On the third study site, where the widest ground plots were utilized, airborne and ground estimates agreed within 24%. Basal area, volume, and biomass prediction inaccuracies in the first two study areas were tied directly to disagreements between simulated laser estimates and the corresponding airborne measurements of average canopy height, height variability, and canopy density. A number of sampling issues were investigated; the following results were noted in the analyses of the three study areas. 1) Of the four ground segment lengths considered (25 m, 50 m, 75 m, and 100 m), the 25 m segment length introduced a level of variability which may severely degrade prediction accuracy in these Costa Rican primary tropical forests. This effect was more pronounced as plot width decreased. A minimum segment length was on the order of 50 m. 2) The decision to transform or not to transform the dependent variable (e.g., biomass) was by far the most important factor of those considered in this experiment. The natural log transformation of the dependent variable increased prediction error, and error increased dramatically at the shorter segment lengths. The most accurate models were multiple linear models with forced zero intercept and an untransformed dependent variable. 3) General linear models were developed to predict basal area, volume, and biomass using airborne laser height measurements. Useful laser measurements include average canopy height, all pulses ((h) over bar(a)), average canopy height, canopy hits ((h) over bar(c)) and the coefficients of variation of these terms (c(a) and c(c)). Coefficients of determination range from 0.4 to 0.6. Based on this research, airborne laser and ground sampling procedures are proposed for use for reconnaissance level surveys of inaccessible forested regions.

The results indicate that environmental events such as frost and rain can be monitored. However, care must be taken as some soil targets at high moisture contents may behave as specular reflectors at longer wavelengths, such as L-band at large incidence angles, thus masking soil moisture effects. The strongest correlation between radar backscatter and soil moisture (r=0.84) was obtained for the 0-2.5 cm soil profile at HH polarizations. The strength of the correlation was approximately the same at C- and L-band. All polarizations displayed a decrease in soil moisture correlation with increasing soil profile depth. It was observed that soil texture effects on the estimation of soil moisture from radar backscatter were relatively small and consequently can be neglected. Although the sensitivity to surface roughness is greater at HV and VV than at HH polarization, results indicate that roughness could be neglected when measuring soil moisture over relatively short periods of time at a given site, without significantly reducing the sensitivity of the relationship between radar backscatter and soil moisture.

In a previous study, we tested a method to calibrate area estimates of tropical forest cover by inverting a model of the influence of the forest spatial fragmentation on the spatial aggregation bias, as characterized by two nested regression models. This was based on a sample of high resolution land-cover classifications, distributed across the tropical belt. In this study, improvements of this previous model are sought, first, by better accounting for the spatial variability of landscape characteristics using texture measures and, second, by integrating spatial information in the mixed pixel estimator-that is, the modeling of spectral mixtures at the scale of coarse resolution pixels as a function of the proportion of land-cover types. These improvements were tested using NOAA\'s Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer data at 1.1 km resolution, Landsat Thematic Mapper-based classifications, and data simulated at the 250 m resolution of the forthcoming Earth Observing System\'s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The integration of spatial information into a correction model to retrieve fine resolution cover-type proportions from coarse resolution data can improve by up to 35% the reliability of the estimates. The results also demonstrate that the integration of spatial information in the mixed pixel estimator controls for the variability due to different landscape characteristics. This study improves our capability to estimate tropical forest cover from coarse resolution remote sensing data at a global scale.

Data have been acquired on the Melarchez subwatershed during the Orgeval \'89 campaign from March to December 1989. Radar backscattering measurements were provided by the French airborne scatterometer ERASME. Simultaneous ground measurements of soil moisture and roughness, leaf-area index, and water content of the canopy were conducted on 12 test fields. Using radar configurations close that of the ERS-1 SAR, the results clearly indicate that radar data cannot be easily converted into moisture estimates at field scale over a variety of bare sell, essentially due to the effect of roughness on radar response. Nevertheless, mean soil-moisture values measured within bare soil fields over the whole subwatershed, show a decrease in soil-surface moisture from March to October. The same feature is clearly obtained by averaged radar measurements over all bare-soil fields, indicating that ERS-1 could be used for monitoring the moisture state on a regional scale. Furthermore, the great variability of radar backscattering and radar-slope data, for a given soil practice, for example, ploughing or sowing, and for the same date of measurement over bare soil, suggests that, under natural field conditions, backscattering from a soil surface may not be sufficient to explain and understand the radar response and that volume scattering may have to be accounted for as well. Finally, concerning soil roughness, the standard deviation of surface-height slope discriminates the roughness states, which apparently is a pertinent parameter for analyzing the variation of the backscattering coefficient with incidence angle.', 'CEMAGREF,DIV HYDROL,ANTONY,FRANCE.

Usually these values are acquired from field measurements. However, the microclimatological effects in mountainous terrain greatly limit the potential for spatial extrapolation of such a set of values. This study overcomes the problem by using the upward radiance values registered on Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images and information on the geometry of the terrain extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM). Studies were performed in the Athabasca Glacier basin, one of the major glacier outlets of the Columbia Icefield in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. The methodology is composed, first, of an automated procedure for the physiographic description of the glacierized basin (cover type, elevation, slope, aspect, horizon profiles, sky-view factor, and the level of enclosing topography) in order to calculate the effects of topography on the radiation balance for each 30 m pixel. Because glacier surface covers usually have high reflective behaviors or distinct emission patterns, this study puts special emphasis on modelling the amount of terrain-reflected or terrain-emitted radiation received on a particular surface. Second, the topographic correction is applied to values of irradiance computed using the LOWTRAN-6 code, a spectrally based radiative transfer model, and atmospheric radiosonde measurements of the vertical temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity profiles. The measured upward radiance values from TM, corrected for path effects, are used to calculate surface-cover albedo and brightness temperature. Third, the daily net radiation field for snow and ice covers is computed to illustrate the contribution of the estimated surface radiative parameters to the glacier snow-and-ice melt analysis. The results show that the irradiance values are accurately modelled within 10% of the radiation values acquired from a field pyranometer.

A total of 510-575 reflectance spectra were obtained for each of the five phenophases studied and the extrema of the averaged curves of bidirectional reflectance factor (b(lambda)) were determined. The blue and red minima, as well as the relative maximum in the visible region, were positionally highly stable during the season (about 480 nm, 550 nm, and 670 nm, respectively). In the NIR region the b(lambda) curve rose smoothly between 750 nm and 1070 nm, and its steepness was probably determined by soil background reflectance. The values of b480, b550, b670, and b860 were the spectral variables chosen, and they were related, through canonical correlation analysis, to phytometric variables (dry above-ground phytomass, plant height, plant density, and percent plant cover) obtained from the corresponding ground-based agronomic measurements. There was a close relation between spectral and phytometric variables when the canopy was green (the first canonical correlation coefficient was 0.974 in the booting stage), but the closeness decreased with crop maturation. Canonical variables for spectral reflectance explained, at most, about 75% of the variance in phytometric variables while the first canonical variable for phytometric features accounted for 90% of the spectral variance. The NIR and red reflectances contributed most to canonical variables and had the highest correlations with the plant measurements. Among the phytometric variables, percent plant cover and dry above-ground phytomass related more closely to spectral reflectance than did plant height and plant density.

Simulations of satellite measurements of land surface temperatures are made using the atmospheric transmittance-radiance model LOWTRAN-7 for NOAA-11 AVHRR Channels 4 and 5. From these simulations the accuracies of linearizations have been checked. The dependence of the split-window coefficients on the aforementioned magnitudes has been analyzed. Thus, it has been demonstrated that the angular dependence can be avoided while the total water vapor dependence must be retained. Therefore, we have obtained a split-window equation for each atmosphere in which the emissivity dependence is linearized in terms of Channel 4 emissivity epsilon-4 and channel emissivity difference, epsilon-4-epsilon-5. The analysis of the emissivity influence shows that the emissivity measurement should be made with an accuracy of 0.005 in order to get an error below to 0.4 K on land surface temperature.

The use of simultaneous solarimeter readings when object measurements were taken under nonideal atmospheric conditions may be partly of help.RP EPEMA, GF (通讯作者)，AGR UNIV WAGENINGEN, DEPT SOIL SCI & GEOL, POB 37, 6700 AA WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 19, 9, 9, 0, 2, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Remote sensing has become the most practical means to map global/regional BAs. Space-borne coarse-resolution (250-1000 m) BA products play an essential role in fire-related science and applications, but small BAs are typically poorly represented due to resolution limitations. Moderate-resolution (10-30 m) imagery provides a more detailed spatial extent of BAs, but the various disturbances (e.g., plant phenology, cloud shading, flooding, harvesting, grazing, pests, and diseases) make application on a global scale challenging. Here, we propose an automatic BA detection algorithm based on time series images acquired by the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and the Google Earth Engine. Specifically: (i) We determined an optimal set of spectral indices for MSI images based on global sampling to mitigate the background heterogeneity and BA spectral diversity. (ii) We jointly used three temporal scales, i.e., the single-temporal, dual-temporal, and short-time series MSI images, to identify potential BA regions (i.e., BA candidates). (iii) We integrated multisource active fire (AF) products derived from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), Operational Land Imager (OLI), and MSI instead of singlesource products to refine BA candidates. (iv) We constructed an interannual time series to improve the BA candidates not confirmed by AF products. The proposed BA detection method was applied to different land cover and regional scales, including forests, grasslands, savannas, shrublands, and croplands at the regional (scene) and national levels (Portugal). Validation and inter-comparison with similar products demonstrated that the proposed method is reliable: the Dice coefficient of our detection results was improved by -7% and - 9%, respectively, compared to the moderate-resolution BA products (e.g., LBA_CU for the conterminous United States and FireCCISFD20 for sub-Saharan Africa in 2019). These results suggest that the proposed method can accurately and automatically map BAs, providing a foundation for fire monitoring programs and climate change research.', '[Liu, Peng; Liu, Yongxue; Guo, Xiaoxiao; Zhao, Wanjing; Wu, Huansha] Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

It is the fundamental driving force of surface energy, carbon, and hydrological circulations, and a key energy source for photovoltaic electricity. However, existing methods face significant challenges owing to cloud heterogeneity and their reliance on other satellite-derived products, which hinder the retrieval of accurate and timely DSR with high spatiotemporal resolution. In addition to the spectral features used in traditional approaches, deep learning (DL) can incorporate the spatial and temporal features of satellite data. This study developed and compared three DL methods, namely the DenseNet, the bidirectional gated recurrent unit without surface albedo as inputs (BiGRUnor), and the convolutional neural network with gated recurrent unit without surface albedo as inputs (CNNGRUnor). These methods were used to estimate DSR at 1 km and 10/15 min resolutions directly from top-of-atmosphere reflectance over the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard Himawari-8 and the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard GOES-16 coverage, achieving high accuracies. The instantaneous root mean square error (RMSE) and relative RMSE for the three models were 68.4 (16.1%), 69.4 (16.3%), and 67.1 (15.7%) W/m2, respectively, which are lower than the baseline machine learning method, the multilayer perceptron model (MLP), with RMSE at 76.8 W/m2 (18.0%). Hourly accuracies for the three DL methods were 58.6 (14.1%), 57.8 (14.0%), and 57.3 (13.8%) W/m2, which are within the DSR RMSEs that we estimated for existing datasets of the Earth\'s Radiant Energy System (CERES) (88.8 W/m2, 21.4%) and GeoNEX (77.8 W/m2, 18.8%). The study illustrates that DL models that incorporate temporal information can eliminate the need for surface albedo as an input, which is crucial for timely monitoring and nowcasting of DSR. Incorporating spatial information can enhance retrieval accuracy in overcast conditions, and incorporating infrared bands can further improve the accuracy of DSR estimation.', '[Li, Ruohan; Wang, Dongdong] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

Accurate mapping of coastal salt marshes is always the first step for their protection, management, and restoration. The inherent complexities of vegetation, dynamics of tides, and anthropogenic disturbances pose challenges for remote sensing-based approaches. Existing studies have utilized phenology information and various black-box algorithms to reduce misclassifications. However, the approaches with dual-temporal images containing phenology information have suffered from inefficiency; the misclassifications have been objectively postprocessed rather than considered in the method design, and the tacit knowledge of the trained black-box models has not been revealed. To address the above issues, we proposed a new approach with solid improvements in dual-temporal image construction, misclassification processing, and tacit knowledge analysis, including an efficient method to synthesize dual-temporal images based on the common divisor of the green-up season or senescence season resulting from latitudinal gradients in narrow coastal areas of China, a detailed classification scheme by interpretation of iteratively collected samples, and a key decision rule approximating the trained model. We applied the approach to Sentinel-1/2 images and DEM data, thus deriving a 10-m resolution coastal salt marsh map of China with an overall accuracy of 92.5%. A qualitative comparison showed that the map produced in this study was fitted well with actual salt marsh distributions, resulting in improved accuracy when compared to recently generated maps. The most important contribution is that the overall nature of the trained model observed from the training samples was approximated by a four-feature decision rule following the principle of explainable artificial intelligence, i.e., B8senescence/B4senescence < 2.06 & B4green/B8green < 0.78 & B12green/B11green < 0.72 & elevation < 2.13, and thus established a new potential classification mechanism for dual-temporal black-box algorithms, i.e., the water signal was covered up by flourishing vegetation, but the situation changed when vegetation withered. This study not only generates an accurate coastal salt marsh map at a national scale but also provides a classification mechanism for dual-temporal image-based coastal salt marsh identification and mapping.', '[Zhao, Chuanpeng; Jia, Mingming; Wang, Zongming; Mao, Dehua] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Environm, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China.

Different satellite sensors collect data at different spatial resolutions and therefore provide opportunities for multi-grain habitat measures. The dynamic habitat indices (DHIs), which are derived from satellite data, capture patterns of vegetative productivity and predict bird species richness well. However, the DHIs have only been analyzed at single resolutions (e.g., 1-km), and have not yet been derived from high-resolution satellite data (< 10-m). Our goal was to predict bird species richness based on measures of vegetation productivity (DHIs, NDVI median and NDVI percentile 90th) across a range of spatial resolutions both from different sensors, and from resampled high-resolution imagery. We analyzed bird species richness within 215 forest, grassland and shrubland plots (56.25 ha) located at 26 terrestrial field sites of the National Ecology Observatory Network (NEON), in the continental US. To obtain our multi-resolution measures of vegetation productivity, we acquired data from Planetscope (3-m), RapidEye (5-m), Sentinel-2 (10-m), Landsat-8 (30-m) and MODIS (250-m) from 2017 to 2020, generated time series of NDVI, calculated the three DHIs (cumulative, minimum and variation), NDVI median and the 90th percentile NDVI and calculated 1st and 2nd order texture measures. We evaluated the performance of the derived measures to predict bird species richness of habitat specialist guilds based on (i) univariate models (ii) multivariate models with single-resolution measures and (iii) multivariate models with multi-resolution measures. Single-spatial resolution measures predicted bird species richness moderately well (R2 up to 0.51) and the best performing spatial resolution and measure differed among bird species guilds. High -spatial resolution (3-5 m) measures outperformed medium-resolution measures (10-250 m). Models for all guilds performed best when incorporating multiple resolutions, including for all species richness (R2 = 0.63) and for forest (R2 = 0.72), grassland (R2 = 0.53) and shrubland specialists (R2 = 0.46). In addition, models based on multi-resolution data from different sensors performed better than models based on resampled high-resolution data for any of the guilds. Our results highlight, first, the value of the DHIs derived from high-resolution sat-ellite data to predict bird species richness and, second, that remotely-sensed vegetation productivity measures from multiple spatial resolutions offer great promise for quantifying biodiversity.', '[Silveira, E.

InSAR-derived ground displacements from Sentinel-1 C-band radar data indicate long-term subsidence of the intact and Active Raised Bog. Superimposed on the long-term displacement trends are annual oscillations that are linked to variations in rainfall and temperature and that are in phase with changes in soil moisture. We show that InSAR coherence is directly related to the change in soil moisture, with large changes causing coherence decrease or loss. The wildfire removed a 10-20 cm thick mossy vegetation layer across 60-70% of the intact bog area. The SAR backscatter intensity in VV polarisation increased after the wildfire, but the InSAR coherence, the InSARderived surface displacements and the soil moisture were not noticeably affected. We therefore infer that Cband radar waves attenuate in the active vegetation layer, but penetrate through it into the upper few cm of the underlying peat. The SAR backscatter occurs primarily at this level in the peat, where its coherence is controlled by the soil moisture. These findings underpin application and interpretation of radar for monitoring of peatlands, even if affected by wildfires, which are forecast to increase in both frequency and intensity due to global warming.', '[Hrysiewicz, Alexis; Holohan, Eoghan P.; Donohue, Shane] Univ Coll Dublin, SFI Res Ctr Appl Geosci iCRAG, Dublin, Ireland.

Combining optical and SAR data can provide the most usable observations in the tropics and hence has the potential to achieve more timely detection of forest disturbance than using any individual sensor system. A new algorithm (Fusion Near Real-Time, or FNRT) for near real-time monitoring of tropical forest disturbance by fusion of Landsat, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1 data fits a time series model to the data of each individual sensor system and produces a change score for each clear observation during the monitoring period. The change scores from the three different kinds of sensors are then combined for disturbance monitoring. Applying FNRT using all three data sources in eight selected sites in the Amazon Basin detected 69.8 & PLUSMN; 5% and 84.6 & PLUSMN; 4.1% of the forest disturbances within the first 30 and 60 days, respectively. FNRT using all three sensors reached a peak producer\'s accuracy of 91.6 & PLUSMN; 3.2% at approximately a 100-day lag time, compared to 86.4 & PLUSMN; 3.8% using the two optical sensors combined, and 71.7 & PLUSMN; 4.7% using Landsat only (the best-performing single-sensor). The user\'s accuracy of FNRT using all three sensors increased to 90.9 & PLUSMN; 3.3% when excluding false detections in non-forest areas. Overall, the model result using all three data sources had the highest detection rate with shorter lag times. Although modest, including Sentinel-1 data in the multi-sensor fusion approach improved the detection speed of some disturbance events.

Currently, airborne LiDAR remote sensing has been well established as an effective tool to characterize the structure of canopies and forest in-ventory variables. Radiometry and geometry are highly intertwined in LiDAR remote sensing of forest vegetation and phenology influences the geometric-optical properties of deciduous and evergreen trees causing seasonal variation in LiDAR observations. This variation may be considered as a nuisance or exploited in for example tree species identification. Airborne LiDAR data are also influenced by sensor functioning, acquisition settings, scan geometry and the atmosphere. Reliable estimation of subtle phenological effects calls for data in which the impact of the external factors is minimal. We experimented with such data and explored LIDAR waveforms (WFs) in boreal trees in winter, early summer and late summer. Our objectives were to i) assess the match of the multitemporal LiDAR data for observing true changes in vegetation; ii) quantify the influence of phenology in deciduous and evergreen trees; iii) study the effect of varying scan zenith angle (SZA) and canopy age on WF features in different phenostates; iv) assess the temporal feature correlation in individual living and dead standing trees. A WF-recording pulsed LiDAR sensor unit operating at the wavelength of 1550 nm was used in repeated acquisitions. WF attributes such as energy, peak amplitude and echo width were derived for each pulse and were localized vertically to crown, understory and ground components. Silver and downy birch, black alder, European aspen, Siberian larch, Scots pine, Norway spruce and dead standing spruce formed our strata. Results showed that phenology caused more variation in WF features of deciduous trees compared to evergreen conifers. Deciduous trees displayed substantial between-species variation that was linked with differences in branching pattern, leaf orientation and bark reflectance. Pine displayed a possible winter-early summer anomaly in canopy backscattering that may be linked with changes in foliage clumping or with the role of stamens in early summer trees. Trees displayed positive temporal correlation in WF features and correlations were the strongest in evergreen and deciduous conifers and decreased with time. SZA had minor influence on WF features whereas age exercised a strong effect on many features with parallel variation between species and phenostates. Structural changes following death, i.e. \'aging\' changed the geometric WF features of dead standing trees. Our results provide new insights for enhancing tree species identification by using WF LiDAR and for LiDAR time-series analysis of vegetation.', '[Korpela, Ilkka; Polvivaara, Antti; Holopainen, Markus] Univ Helsinki, Fac Agr & Forestry, Dept Forest Sci, POB 24, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.

Air pollution is often invisible to the eye which can make its detection challenging, unlike the destruction of the land or waterways. Given that air-quality monitoring stations are typically ground-based, their abilities to detect pollutant distributions are often restricted to wide areas. Satellites, however, have the potential for studying the atmosphere at large; the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus project satellite, \"Sentinel-5P\"is a newly launched satellite capable of measuring a variety of pollutant information with publicly available data outputs. This paper seeks to create a multi-modal machine learning model for predicting air-quality metrics with high precision so that it will be applicable to locations where monitoring stations do not exist. The inputs of this model will include a fusion of ground measurements and satellite data with the goal of highlighting pollutant distribution and motivating change in societal and industrial behaviours. A contemporary method for fusing satellite information with pollution measurements is studied, suggesting that simpler models can work as effectively as neural network models that are constructed with state-of-the-art architectures. A new dataset of continental European pollution monitoring station measurements is created with features including altitude, population density, environmental classification of local areas, and satellite data from the ESA Copernicus project. This dataset is used to train a multi-modal ML model, Air Quality Network (AQNet) capable of fusing these various types of data sources to output predictions of various pollutants. These predictions are then aggregated to create an \"air-quality index\" that could be used to compare air quality over different regions. Three pollutants, NO2, O3, and PM10, are predicted successfully by AQNet and the network was found to be useful compared to a model only using satellite imagery. It was also found that the addition of supporting tabular data improves predictions. When testing the developed AQNet on out-of-sample data of the UK and Ireland, we obtain satisfactory estimates though on average pollution metrics were roughly overestimated by around 20%.', '[Rowley, Andrew; Karakus, Oktay] Cardiff Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Informat, Abacws, Senghennydd Rd, Cardiff CF24 4AG, Wales.

However, high-resolution data on building height, especially at the national scale, are limited. Fortunately, high spatial-temporal resolution earth observations, harnessed using a cloud-based platform, offer an opportunity to fill this gap. We describe an approach to estimate 2020 building height for China at 10 m spatial resolution based on all-weather earth observations (radar, optical, and night light images) using the Random Forest (RF) model. Results show that our building height simulation has a strong correlation with real observations at the national scale (RMSE of 6.1 m, MAE = 5.2 m, R = 0.77). The Combinational Shadow Index (CSI) is the most important contributor (15.1%) to building height simulation. Analysis of the distribution of building morphology reveals significant differences in building volume and average building height at the city scale across China. Macau has the tallest buildings (22.3 m) among Chinese cities, while Shanghai has the largest building volume (298.4 108 m3). The strong correlation between modelled building volume and socio-economic parameters indicates the potential application of building height products.

A geodetic framework is implemented and combined with seismic and geological methods to provide an integrated model of faulting within the sequence. To retrieve coseismic displacements in the complex and high-gradient near-field area, an adaptive method is proposed based on image-alignment techniques applied to both SAR (Sentinel-1) and optical data (PlanetScope). A continuous deformation map is created by combining interferometric and pixel offset tracking results through principal component analysis. We jointly invert the geodetic data, including along-and across-track displacement maps, through a constraint-based Bayesian inversion process to optimize the source pa-rameters of the causative faults. The results reveal that the NE-dipping nodal planes, with variable slip peaks of 63 and 17.5 cm at depths of 5.5 and 9.1 km, best fit the data for the E1 and E2 events, respectively, whereas the E3 event was on a SW-dipping fault plane including -E- and NW-striking segments. The E3 plane was shallow with maximum slip of 1.2 m at a depth of 2.2 km. We relocate 93 events and use the InSAR slip distributions as constraints to indirectly calibrate the epicenter of the earthquake cluster, and obtain the local stress state from the inversion of the focal mechanism solutions of the ten largest events of the Hojedk cluster. The resultant compressional stress explains the dextral and sinistral components found on the western and eastern segments of the E3 rupture, respectively.

This is not consistent with the assumption that roughness is a static parameter in the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture retrieval algorithm. SMAPVEX16-IA, an extensive field campaign focused on calibration of SMAP retrievals in croplands, occurred during a period when roughness is theoretically at a minima. Satellite-scale measurements of rms height and correlation length collected via pinboard, gridboard, and lidar methodologies resulted in a ensemble of model roughness coefficients that, at h = [0.13, 0.97], is significantly rougher than the original SMAP assumption in croplands of h = 0.108. Comparing simulated brightness temperatures using the ensemble h to SMAP observations resulted in a best-fit angular sensitivity coefficient of N = -2 for both horizontal and vertical polarizations. Satellite-scale h is then retrieved for a four-year study period (excluding growing seasons) via the single channel algorithm from SMAP brightness temperatures and in situ observations of soil moisture and temperature. Roughness retrievals are highly variable in the spring as rainfall events decrease h followed by an increase during soil dry-down; h steadily increases in the fall post-harvest as fields are tilled across the network. Retrievals of h are effectively independent of polarization and demonstrate the potential to simultaneously retrieve soil moisture and roughness in the absence of crops. These soil roughness retrievals could provide new information on tillage and other soil management activities.', '[Walker, Victoria A.; Hornbuckle, Brian K.] Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Agron, Ames, IA 50011 USA.

Furthermore, independent test datasets are developed to test the generalization ability of the trained models across regions, sensors (IKONOS, GeoEye-1, WorldView-2, WorldView-3 and four different airborne camera systems) and tasks (normal water and flood water segmentation).

To address these challenges, we examined an adaptive optical approach that accounts for variability in composition of suspended particulate matter. We use the ratio of particulate organic carbon to suspended particulate matter concentration, POC/SPM, for optically discriminating water bodies with varying proportions of organic and mineral particles. Through the analysis of field data from the western Arctic seas that exhibit a broad range of water composition and optical properties, we developed empirical algorithms to estimate SPM and POC/SPM either from the particulate inherent optical properties (IOPs) of seawater, i.e., the spectral particulate absorption ap(lambda) or backscattering bbp(lambda) coefficients, or directly from the spectral remotesensing reflectance of the ocean, Rrs(lambda). The capability to retrieve POC/SPM from optical measurements was used to formulate the particle composition-specific algorithms for estimating POC from particulate IOPs or Rrs(lambda). The evaluation of algorithms with the development field dataset demonstrates that the algorithm formulations accounting for changes in POC/SPM provide significant improvements in POC estimates along the continuum of optically-complex Arctic waters compared with algorithms that do not account for variations in particulate composition, such as the current standard POC algorithm used for global satellite applications. The results of example application of the particle composition-specific algorithm and standard global algorithm to satellite observations are consistent with comparisons of these algorithms for our field dataset, which supports a conclusion that the standard algorithm tends to overestimate POC in Arctic waters that exhibit a broad range of particle composition. Although this study demonstrates the adaptive approach using data from the Arctic region, it has broader significance and is amenable to further enhancements by including other optically-derivable water constituent properties. Further validation analyses and efforts are needed towards a unified approach with improved representation of cause-and-effect relationships between water composition and optical properties to enable improved optically-based applications across a wide range of water bodies.', '[Stramski, Dariusz; Reynolds, Rick A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Marine Phys Lab, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.

Such delays are caused by the variations of pressure, temperature, and humidity of the troposphere, potentially leading to elevation-dependent phases in interferograms. The atmospheric heterogeneity makes the phase-elevation dependence vary in both space and time, posing challenges on empirical models that estimated the elevation-topography relationship in empirically predefined windows interferogram by interferogram. Moreover, the portion of the deformation that is correlated with topography can be mistaken as tropospheric delays and therefore degrade the performance of linear regression between the tropospheric phase and the elevation. The effectiveness of these methods is further limited by the requisite knowledge presumed of the user, particularly with regard to how to divide the scene and which observation model is suitable. These limitations make reliable isolation of tropospheric delay challenging. We present here a novel approach that combines tropospheric delay, deformation and possible topographic error to a joint model, enabling a precise separation of tropospheric delay. The rationale is rooted in the distinct temporal dependencies of these parameters. To avoid empirical setting of segmentation windows, we employ quadtree to adaptively control the spatial variability of tropospheric properties. We validate the proposed method at two volcanic areas, Bali and Hawaii, where tropospheric delay presents notable variability coupled with elevation-correlated deformation signals. Both ascending and descending Sentinel-1 data over the island of Bali show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional ones. The misfit standard deviation (STD) is reduced by similar to 50% at the island of Bali, where elevation-correlated deformation is simulated according to a predefined model. More impressively, at the island of Hawaii, the misfit STD between InSAR and ground truth (i.e., GPS displacements) decreases from 25.1 to 4.5 mm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in reducing the spatially variable tropospheric delay while preserving the elevation-correlated deformation signal.', '[Liang, Hongyu; Zhang, Lei] Tongji Univ, Coll Surveying & Geoinformat, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.

However, it is rare to find continuous tropospheric O3 profiles with high temporal and spatial resolutions without blind areas using current remote sensing technologies, with issues such as low near-surface sensitivity or systematic blind areas from satellite and LiDAR observations, respectively, being encountered. In this study, multi-source data including stratospheric O3 profiles from external datasets and local monthly dependent a priori profiles were fused in the retrieval algorithm, then vertical O3 profiles from the near-surface to the free troposphere were retrieved from multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements. With the aim of deriving a set of best practice recommendations for applying a profile inversion algorithm to long-term observations, we comprehensively investigated the influence of various settings on profile retrieval, with emphasis on the selection of a Fraunhofer reference spectrum and appropriate a priori profiles in the upper troposphere. These recommendations are essential for applying the algorithm to real long-term measurements. In this study, tropospheric O3 profiles were retrieved for operational MAX-DOAS observations in Beijing, and the results, especially for the boundary layer, were evaluated in detail with respect to well-established independent O3 datasets, including one-year ozonesonde profiles and tower-based in-situ measurements at different altitudes. A good level of agreement was found for both near-surface and elevated-altitude results, and the MAX-DOAS O3 profiles were able to reproduce the vertical distributions measured by ozonesonde. However, MAX-DOAS measurements are less sensitive to the upper troposphere and converge to the a priori profile, and the smoothing effect induced by the optimal estimation method makes it difficult to reproduce steep vertical gradients in real atmosphere.', '[Ji, Xiangguang] Anhui Univ, Informat Mat & Intelligent Sensing Lab Anhui Prov, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China.

We also aimed to determine the relationship between the identified thermal features and topography. The study area was a Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) dominated forest located in a Central European border region between the Czech Republic (Sumava Mountains) and Germany (Bavarian Forest). For more than three decades, forests in this area have experienced widespread defoliation due to the spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.). We determined the forest\'s surface temperature (ST) between 1985 and 2015 from thermal Landsat time-series data and then normalized it (STn) to be comparable across the years in question. We plotted thermal trajectories for this period and then clustered them based on their variances. The resulting thermal trajectories well described both disturbance and recovery, showing a rise in the STn during the onset of the disturbance, the severity, and a decrease during recovery. The mean disturbance duration was 8.44 years (SD = +/- 3.775), with a maximum severity as indicated by the STn of 4.92 (SD = +/- 1.5) and a duration of 12.84 years (SD = +/- 3.38) until 50% recovery and 17.85 years (SD = +/- 1.74) until 80% recovery. Clustering of the thermal trajectories revealed clusters with similar year-groups of bark beetle attack and a spatially aggregated pattern closely related to topography. Severity showed a positive correlation with altitude, whereas the spatially aggregated patterns of disturbance and recovery duration can be attributed to more complex topographical characteristics. Our study demonstrates the ability of thermal infrared imagery to provide highly relevant data for assessing not only the main features of forest disturbance and recovery, but also bio-climatic canopy functions in terms of topography and other environmental variables.', '[Barta, Karola Anna; Hais, Martin] South Bohemian Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Ecosyst Biol, Branisovska str 1760, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.

Given the negative ecological impacts of biodiversity loss in grasslands, there is an urgent need for developing an operational biodiversity monitoring system that functions in these ecosystems. In this paper, we assessed the capability of airborne and spaceborne imaging spectroscopy (also known as hyperspectral imaging) to capture plant alpha-diversity in a large naturally-assembled grassland while considering the impact of common management practices, specifically prescribed fire. We collected a robust in -situ plant diversity data set, including species composition and percent cover from 2500 sampling points with different burn ages, from recently-burned to transitional and pre-prescribed fire at the Joseph H. Williams Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Oklahoma, USA. We expressed in-situ plant alpha-diversity using the first three Hill numbers, including species richness (number of observed species in a plant community), exponential Shannon entropy index (hereafter Shannon diversity; effective number of common species, where species are weighed proportional to their percent cover), and inverse Simpson concentration index (hereafter Simpson diversity; effective number of dominant species, where more weight is given to dominant species) at four different plot sizes, including 60 m x 60 m, 120 m x 120 m, 180 m x 180 m, and 240 m x 240 m. We collected full-range airborne hyperspectral data with fine spatial resolution (1 m) and visible and near-infrared spaceborne hyper -spectral data from DESIS sensor with coarse spatial resolution (30 m), and used the spectral diversity hypoth-esis-i.e., that the variability in spectral data is largely driven by plant diversity-to estimate alpha-diversity remotely. In recently-burned plots and those at the transitional stage, both airborne and spaceborne data were capable of capturing Simpson diversity-a metric that calculates the effective number of dominant species by emphasizing abundant species and discounting rare species-but not species richness or Shannon diversity. Further, neither airborne nor spaceborne hyperspectral data sets were capable of capturing plant alpha-diversity of 60 m x 60 m or 120 m x 120 m plots. Based on these results, three main findings emerged: (1) management practices influence grassland biodiversity patterns that can be remotely detected, (2) both fine-and coarse -resolution remotely-sensed data can detect the effective number of dominant species (e.g., Simpson diversity), and (3) attention should be given to site-specific plant diversity field data collection to appropriately interpret remote sensing results. Findings of this study indicate the feasibility of estimating Simpson diversity in naturally -assembled grasslands using forthcoming spaceborne imagers such as National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-tration\'s Surface Biology and Geology mission.', '[Gholizadeh, Hamed; Dixon, Adam P.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Geog, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.

Fusing these two missions will greatly increase the number of forest height samples and realize their geographical complementarity, providing unprecedented opportunities for global forest height mapping. However, ICESat-2 and GEDI use different LiDAR technologies, which may lead to inconsistencies in the forest height estimation between the two missions. This study aims to explore the potential of obtaining consistent forest heights from ICESat-2 and GEDI data in support of global forest height mapping. First, the accuracies of GEDI and ICESat-2 forest heights in four different scenarios (nigh/daytime and strong/weak beam) were validated and compared utilizing airborne LiDAR data. Second, we quantitatively evaluated the differences in the forest heights derived from the GEDI and ICESat-2 data within their overlapping footprints and analyzed the effects of the terrain slope, forest coverage, forest type and study site on these differences. Third, the forest height consistency models were built based on GEDI-derived forest heights and ICESat-2 feature parameters using stepwise regression (SR) and random forest (RF) algorithms as well as a combination of both SR and RF algorithms. Finally, we evaluated the transferability of forest height consistency models to different forest types and study sites, and further analyzed the potential of building a universally consistent model. The results showed that the accuracies of both GEDI and ICESat-2 derived forest heights differ among four different scenarios, and the accuracy of forest heights extracted from GEDI data (R2 = 0.93, RMSE = 2.99 m for power beams at night) is higher than that extracted from ICESat-2 data (R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 4.62 m for strong beams at night) regardless of scenarios. The forest height differences exist between these two missions, and show an apparent change trend with increasing forest coverage. By establishing the consistency models, the forest height difference between GEDI and ICESat-2 can be reduced. Compared to the forest height consistency models built by SR or RF algorithms, the consistency models established by combining the RF and SR algorithms have higher accuracy (average R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 2.56 m for ATL08). Additionally, the consistency models developed specifically for one forest type or study site are less transferable, while a universal consistency model is applicable for various vegetation types and study sites. After building a universal consistency model based on both SR and RF algorithms, the consistent forest heights were obtained from GEDI and ICESat-2 data. Overall, this study demonstrates the possibility of combining different modes of space-borne LiDAR data to obtain consistent forest height datasets.', '[Zhu, Xiaoxiao] China Earthquake Adm, Inst Geol, Key Lab Seism & Volcan Hazards, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.

However, the use of laser intensity simultaneously recorded during the scanning of caves remains unexplored despite it having promising potential for lithological mapping as it has been demonstrated by many applications in open-sky conditions. The appropriate use of laser intensity requires calibration and corrections for influencing factors, which are different in caves as opposed to the above-ground environments. Our study presents an efficient and complex workflow to correct the recorded intensity, which takes into consideration the acquisition geometry, micromorphology of the cave surface, and the specific atmospheric influence previously neglected in terrestrial laser scanning. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated on terrestrial LiDAR data acquired in the Gouffre Georges, a cave located in the northern Pyrenees in France. The cave is unique for its geology and lithology allowing for observation, with a spectacular continuity without any vegetal cover, of the contact between marble and lherzolite rocks and tectonic structures that characterize such contact. The overall accuracy of rock surface classification based on the corrected laser intensity was over 84%. The presence of water or a wet surface introduced bias of the intensity values towards lower values complicating the material discrimination. Such conditions have to be considered in applications of the recorded laser intensity in mapping underground spaces. The presented method allows for putting geological observations in an absolute spatial reference frame, which is often very difficult in a cave environment. Thus, laser scanning of the cave geometry assigned with the corrected laser intensity is an invaluable tool to unravel the complexity of such a lithological environment.', '[Novakova, Michaela; Gallay, Michal; Supinsky, Jozef] Pavol Jozef Safarik Univ Kosice, Fac Sci, Inst Geog, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.

In the fire-affected forest areas, understory and often tree canopies were burned, and in-situ observations in late 2020 reported rapid vegetation recovery, including grasses, shrubs, and tree canopies from burned-but-not-dead eucalyptus trees. Considering the strong fire resilience and resistance of eucalyptus trees and above-average rainfall in 2020, we assessed how much and how quickly vegetation structure and biomass changed from loss to post-fire and drought recovery in 2020 for all forest areas in Australia. Here, we analyzed space-borne optical, thermal, and microwave images to assess changes in the structure and function of vegetation using four vegetation indices (VIs), leaf area index (LAI), solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), gross primary production (GPP), and aboveground biomass (AGB). We found that all eight variables show large losses in 2019, driven by fires and climate (drought and high temperature), but large gains in 2020, resulting from the high resilience of most trees to fire and rapid growth of understory vegetation under wet condition in 2020. In 2019, the forest area has an AGB loss of 0.20 Pg C, which is similar to 15% of the pre-fire AGB. Attribution analyses showed that both fire and climate (prior and co-occurring severe drought and record high temperatures) are responsible for the AGB loss in 2019, approximately 0.09 Pg C (fire) and 0.11 Pg C (climate), respectively. In 2020, the forest area has a total AGB gain of 0.26 Pg C, composed of 0.22 Pg C from fire-affected forest area and 0.04 Pg C from fire-unaffected forest area. Fire-adapted Eucalyptus forests and above-average annual precipitation in 2020 brought by a moderate La Nina drove the recovery of vegetation cover, productivity, and AGB.

However, the large majority of remote sensing-based degradation assessments are trend-based, implying that they can only detect degradation that occurred after medium or high-resolution satellite imagery became available. This makes them less suitable to map long-term degradation in ecosystems that have been under high human pressure since before. The main goal of this study was to develop a robust operational approach to map forest degradation status in heterogeneous landscapes with a long-standing degradation history to inform the planning of restoration interventions. We hereby use the tropical dry forests of Lambayeque, Peru, as a case study. Instead of using a trend-based assessment, we evaluated forest degradation status by comparing current woody cover (WC) and aboveground biomass (AGB) estimates obtained from remote sensing imagery with benchmark values consisting of the 95th percentile WC and AGB values inside environmentally homogenous land capability classes. Using boosted regression tree models and a combination of optical (Sentinel-2) and synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel-1) data of different seasons, we mapped WC and AGB, using training data obtained through very high-resolution imagery and field measurements. Further, we aimed at assessing (i) whether the inclusion of Sentinel-1 data improves mapping accuracy in comparison to using only Sentinel-2 data, and (ii) whether the use of multi-seasonal data improves accuracy in comparison to single-season data. Models combining multi-seasonal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data resulted in the most accurate WC predictions (mean absolute error (MAE): 16%; MAE normalized by dividing by the inter-quartile range of training data: 26%) and AGB predictions (MAE: 28.6 t/ha; normalized MAE: 65%), but differences in predictive accuracy with single season models or models using only Sentinel-2 data were small. The most accurate models estimated an average WC of 41% and an average AGB of 23.4 t/ha. Average WC and AGB reduction due to degradation was 35% and 36%, respectively, indicating that these forests are highly degraded. The site-specific scaling of WC and AGB allows to efficiently estimate forest degradation status irrespective of the time when this degradation occurred, and to express degradation status against site-specific benchmarks. On the condition that there are still some areas that are sufficiently undegraded to be used as a benchmark, the approach can be used to prioritize forest restoration actions and inform targets for restoration in heterogeneous landscapes suffering the impacts of undocumented long-term degradation.', '[Fremout, Tobias; Limache-de la Fuente, Daniela; Bernardino, Paulo N.; Muys, Bart] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.

With TROPOMI aboard Sentinel-5 Precursor (S-5P), daily tropospheric NO2 observations have become available with an unprecedented spatial resolution of 3.5 km x 5.5 km. However, a systematic study of tropospheric NO2 patterns on a national scale and with preserved high spatial resolution is still pending. In addition, the increasing availability of area-wide, high-resolution data for large study areas presents new challenges for analyzing impact factors, such as spatial heterogeneity. Based on the annual mean tropospheric NO2 of Germany (September 2018 to August 2019) resampled to a 1 km x 1 km spatial resolution, the subject of this study was twofold: on the one hand a hot and cold spot analysis was performed, on the other hand, nonmeteorological factors influencing tropospheric NO2 were investigated within spatial regimes of different land use / land cover (LU/LC) compositions. A total of 24 national hot spots were identified with the majority located in urban areas. The spatial regime-based impact factor analysis revealed that most correlation coefficients between LU/LC and tropospheric NO2 are highly dependent on the location. Some other factors, however, were found to have a strong impact on tropospheric NO2 independent of the location (impervious surfaces, population and road density). Although this study is based on tropospheric column data, and meteorology has not been considered yet, the analyses demonstrate the contribution of Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI data to a better understanding of the high-dimensional and complex relationship between NO2, the atmosphere and the composition of the land surface and its use.', '[Mueller, Inken; Erbertseder, Thilo; Taubenbock, Hannes] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, German Remote Sensing Data Ctr, D-82234 Wessling Oberpfaffenhofe, Germany.

We investigated multisensor machine learning (ML) models to estimate desert grassland habitat suitability for a critically endangered species, the mask bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus ridgewayi). Contemporary habitat conditions are marked by a history of intensive livestock grazing, periodic drought, and changes in arid land hydrology. Historical land use and vegetation changes were accompanied by altered disturbance regimes that once supported recurrent fire important to maintaining grassland composition and structure. Habitat assessment plots were combined with multidate and multispectral Worldview-3 (WV3) satellite imagery and airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) metrics to model habitat suitability on the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge (BANWR). We used regression and structural equation models (SEM) to assess fire history, climate, and site biophysical effects on habitat suitability from 239 vegetation plots stratified by topography and fire frequency. We found that combined WV3/LiDAR models improved suitability predictions and consistency over WV3-only models comparing the root mean squared and mean absolute error from training data. Hyperparameter tuning for ML habitat models further improved performance. Gradient boosted regression trees and WV3/LiDAR habitat suitability models showed superior performance and correspondence to independent field validation data (F = 92.7, p <= 0.001, R-2 = 0.57). Comparisons between predicted habitat suitability and fire history variables from 84 management units showed a significant negative relationship with increased fire frequency (F = 27.6, p <= 0.001, R-2 = 0.41) and positive relationship with time since last burn (F = 41.3, p <= 0.001, R-2 = 0.34). SEMs established that masked bobwhite habitat occurrence was strongly associated with site biophysical conditions that supported greater woody plant cover important for nesting, thermal, and predator protection. Our results suggest that desert grasslands associated with low primary productivity may require recovery periods in excess of 20 years to develop a desired mix of herbaceous and woody plant cover for masked bobwhite, when >= 2 fires have occurred over the last 30 years. Multiple sensor types provided a unique set of variables describing horizontal and vertical habitat structure and composition, essential to understanding fire effects on masked bobwhite habitat suitability. Combined information from active and passive remote sensing systems can likely enhance mapping and monitoring applications necessary for assessing recovery needs for numerous other wildlife species with diverse habitat requirements.', '[Sesnie, Steven E.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Div Biol Sci, POB 1306, Albuquerque, NM 87102 USA.

Consequently, there is a pressing need to map the fine-scale temporal and spatial patterns of MHWs, for both historical and near real-time events. Satellite remote sensing of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) provides fundamental data for the mapping of MHWs. This study used high-resolution Himawari-8 SST and the Sea Surface Temperature Atlas of the Australian Regional Seas (SSTAARS) data, which have a spatial resolution of -2 km, to map recent and near real-time MHW events in waters around Australasia. The high-resolution MHWs mapping identified two broad areas of MHW hotspots that occurred between August 2015 and February 2019. The Tropical Warm Pool region (including the Great Barrier Reef and part of the Coral Sea) was affected by strong and prolonged MHW conditions for the greater part of 2016. The unusually strong 2015-16 El Nin similar to o event was believed to be the primary underlying driver for the MHWs, and the air-sea heat flux was likely the key local process controlling the heat budget. The south-east of the study area (including Australia\'s south-east coast, the Tasman Sea and New Zealand\'s east coast) suffered severe MHWs in 2015-16, 2017-18 and 2018-19. The 2015-16 summer Bass Strait and East Tasmania MHW event was likely due to the anomalous heat transported by the East Australia Current. The air-sea heat flux, however, was likely an important local driver for the MHW events in the Tasman Sea during the 2016 autumn, the 2017-18 summer and the 2018-19 summer. The anomalous heat flux into ocean was attributed to potential underlying climate drivers including ENSO teleconnections, positive SAM and their interaction. This mapping has not only enhanced our understanding of the spatio-temporal characteristics of several previously documented MHWs, but also identified and mapped several previously undocumented MHWs. Two case studies in the Beagle Marine Park located in north-eastern Bass Strait and the Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs situated -550 km east of the Australian coast within the Lord Howe Marine Park proved the value of Himawari-8 SST and SSTAARS data in mapping fine details of MHWs in a small area, which could not be captured by the broad-scale DOISST data. During the 2017-18 summer event, the case studies revealed much stronger MHW influence in the shallow waters east of the Beagle Marine Park where most of the important rocky reef habitats exist. During the same event, the case studies also confirmed more severe MHW impact on the Elizabeth Reef than the Middleton Reef which resulted in bleaching to selective coral species on the Elizabeth Reef. The near-real time MHWs mapping showed that both the GBR and the Coral Sea marine parks were experiencing MHW conditions in early March 2020, with most affected areas having strong MHW class.', '[Huang, Zhi] Geosci Australia, Natl Earth & Marine Observat Branch, Sydney, NSW, Australia.

However, it remains unclear whether and to what extent croplands warm or cool the land surface globally. Here we present new evidence of the temperature effects of global croplands based on high-resolution satellite observations of land surface temperature (LST). We find general daytime warming and nighttime cooling of crop-dominated lands (cropland intensity >= 90%) relative to other vegetation cover, with net daily cooling in the arid zone and net daily warming in all other areas. On a per-pixel basis, however, nearly half of the crop-dominated lands cool daytime LST and/or warm nighttime LST. The temperature effects vary greatly by location and season. The per-pixel intensity can exceed 10 degrees C likely due to the changes in surface evapotranspiration, albedo, and background climate. By extending the LST changes of crop-dominated lands to the full land surface, we find that croplands make large contributions to regional and global land surface warming. Daytime warming can reach 0.56 degrees C in Europe during spring. Nationally, China, India, and Brazil lead the warming due to their large cropland areas and strong local climate effects.

However, ground measurements provide only point estimates, which cannot be used for spatially explicit microclimate modeling. Canopy structures derived from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can overcome these limitations, but high point-density LiDAR is expensive and computationally challenging. Therefore, we explored whether unmanned aerial systems (UAS) processed with the structure-frommotion (SfM) algorithm could serve as an alternative source of canopy variables for forest microclimate modeling. Specifically, we compared the performance of the canopy cover and height derived from the ground measurements and passive (UAS-SfM) and active (UAS-LiDAR) remote sensing as predictors of air and soil temperature offsets (i.e. differences between the forest understory and treeless areas).   We found that the maximum air temperatures were substantially lower inside than outside the forest, with differences ranging from 9.0 to 12.5 degrees C. The soil temperatures under the canopy were also reduced, but the soil temperature offsets were lower and ranged from 1.1 to 2.8 degrees C. The air and soil temperature offsets both increased with increasing tree height and canopy cover. However, the prediction ability of tree height and canopy cover differed if they were ground-based or remotely sensed. The remotely sensed canopy indices explained air temperature offsets better (UAS-SfM: R-2 = 0.59, RMSE = 0.75 degrees C; UAS-LiDAR: R-2 = 0.57, RMSE = 0.76 degrees C) than ground measurements (R-2 = 0.51, RMSE = 0.80 degrees C). Ground-based metrics explained soil temperature offsets better (R-2 = 0.37, RMSE = 0.36 degrees C) than passive remote sensing approach (UAS-SfM: R-2 = 0.27, RMSE = 0.39 degrees C), but comparably to active one (UAS-LiDAR: R-2 = 0.35, RMSE = 0.37 degrees C).   Our results suggest that both UAS-SfM and UAS-LiDAR can substitute ground canopy measurements for air temperature modeling, but soil temperature modeling is more challenging. Overall, our results show that forest microclimate can be modelled at a very high spatial resolution using UAS equipped with inexpensive optical cameras. The increasingly available UAS-SfM approach can thus provide fine-resolution microclimatic data much needed for biologically relevant predictions of species responses to climate change.', '[Kaspar, Vit; Hederova, Lucia; Macek, Martin; Mullerova, Jana; Prosek, Jiri; Wild, Jan; Kopecky, Martin] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic.

Satellite-based remote sensing provides an important data source for quantifying forest disturbance change. Separating causes of forest disturbance is challenging, however, particularly in areas such as Central Europe where disturbance patches are small and disturbance agents interact strongly. Here we present a novel approach for the causal attribution of forest disturbance agents and illustrate its utility for 1.01 million disturbance patches mapped from Landsat data in Austria for the period 1986-2016. We gathered reference data on 2620 disturbance patches by conducting targeted field observations and structured interviews with 21 forest managers. We developed a novel indicator class characterizing the landscape context of a disturbance patch (i.e., the spatio-temporal autocorrelation of disturbance patches on the landscape), and combined it with other predictor variables describing the spectral signal, topography, and patch form of each disturbance patch. We used these predictors to identify the causal agents for disturbances mapped in Austria using Random Forest classification. Landscape context was the most important predictor of disturbance agent, improving model performance by up to 26 percentage points. Wind, bark beetles and timber harvesting were separated with an overall accuracy of 63%. Bark beetle patches were most difficult to identify correctly (producer\'s accuracy = 15%, user\'s accuracy = 30%), while regular timber harvesting was classified with highest certainty (producer\'s accuracy = 68%, user\'s accuracy = 82%). Harvesting dominates the disturbance regime of Austria\'s forests, with 70.5% of the disturbed area (76.7% of the disturbed patches) attributed to human causes and 29.5% (23.3%) to natural causes (wind: 23.0% [14.8%], bark beetles: 6.5% [8.5%]). Increases in disturbance since 1986 were driven by natural causes, with wind increasing by 408% and bark beetles increasing by 99% between the first and the second half of the observation period. Wind-disturbed patches were also considerably larger than those caused by bark beetles and harvesting (+102% and + 67%, respectively). Our novel approach to mapping causal agents of forest disturbance, applicable also to highly complex and interactive disturbance regimes, provides an important step towards a comprehensive monitoring and management of forest disturbances in a changing world.', '[Sebald, Julius; Seidl, Rupert] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU Vienna, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Inst Silviculture, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.

Development of novel approach to Monitor wildfire progressions in near real-time is therefore of critical importance for emergency responses. The objective of this research is to investigate continuous learning with U-Net by exploiting both Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MSI time series for increasing the frequency and accuracy of wildfire progression mapping. In this study, optical-based burned areas prior to each SAR acquisition (when available) were accumulated into SAR-based pseudo progression masks to train a deep residual U-Net model. Unlike multi-temporal fusion of SAR and optical data, the temporal fusion of progression masks allows us to track as many wildfire progressions as possible. Specifically, two approaches were investigated to train the deep residual U-Net model for continuous learning: 1) Continuous joint training (CJT) with all historical data (including both SAR and optical data); 2) Learning without forgetting (LwF) based on newly incoming data alone (SAR or optical). For LwF, a mean squared loss was integrated to keep the capabilities learned before and prevent it from overfitting to newly incoming data only. By fusing optical-based burned areas, SAR-based progression pseudo masks improve significantly, which benefits both data sampling and model training, considering the challenges in SAR-based change extraction attributed to the variability in SAR backscatter of the surrounding environments. Pre-trained ResNet was frozen as the encoder of the U-Net model, and the decoder part was trained to further refine the derived burned area maps in a progression-wise manner. The experimental results demonstrated that LwF has the potential to match CJT in terms of the agreement between SAR-based results and optical-based ground truth, achieving a F1 score of 0.8423 on the Sydney Fire (2019-2020) and 0.7807 on the Chuckegg Creek Fire (2019).

In contrast, land cover fraction mapping enables expressing the proportion of each pure class in each pixel, which increases precision and reduces legend complexity. To map land cover fractions, regression rather than classification algorithms are needed, and multiple approaches are available for this task. A major challenge for land cover fraction mapping models is data sparsity. Land cover fraction data is by its nature zero-inflated due to how common the 0% fraction is. As regression favours the mean, 0% and 100% fractions are difficult for regression models to predict accurately. We proposed a new solution by combining three models: a binary model determines whether a pixel is pure; if so, it is processed using a classification model; otherwise with a regression model. We compared multiple regression algorithms and implemented our proposed three-step model on the algorithm with the lowest RMSE. We further evaluated the spatial and per-class accuracy of the model and demonstrated a wall-to-wall prediction of seven land cover fractions over the globe. The models were trained on over 138,000 points and validated on a separate dataset of over 20,000 points, provided by the CGLS-LC100 project. Both datasets are global and aligned with the PROBA-V 100 m UTM grid. Results showed that the random forest regression model reached the lowest RMSE of 17.3%. Lowest MAE (7.9%) and highest overall accuracy (72% ? 2%) was achieved using random forest with our proposed threemodel approach and median vote. This research proves that machine learning algorithms can be applied globally to map a wide variety of land cover fractions. Fraction mapping expresses land cover more precisely, and empowers users to create their own discrete maps using user-defined thresholds and rules, which enables customising the result for a diverse range of uses. The three-step approach is useful for addressing the zero-inflation issue and mapping 0% and 100% fractions more accurately, and thus has already been taken up in the operational production of global land cover fraction layers within the CGLS-LC100 project. Furthermore, this study contributes to the accuracy assessment of land cover fraction maps both thematically and spatially, and these methods could be taken up by future land cover fraction mapping efforts.', '[Masiliunas, Dainius; Tsendbazar, Nandin-Erdene; Herold, Martin; Verbesselt, Jan] Wageningen Univ & Res, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.

Most current models are based on Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) algorithms that attempt to predict a set of leaf traits of several plant groups using leaf spectra. However, PLSR models tend to be inconsistent in describing the importance of absorption features when used to predict leaf traits. Likewise, the effect of contrasting absorption features of different plant groups on the prediction and evaluation of PLSR models is not well understood. Hence, this study focuses on using wavelet spectra to overcome current PLSR?s limitation and improve leaf trait predictions. Specifically, we explored the use of visible?near-infrared (0.45?1.0 ?m) and mid- long-wave infrared spectra (2.55?11 ?m) to predict three-leaf traits of lianas and trees: Leaf Mass Area (LMA), Water Content (WC), and Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT). We also compare the effect of life forms on the prediction of traits by using sun leaves collected from 14 liana species and 21 tree species (n = 700) from a Neotropical Dry Forest. On each leaf, reflectance measurements were performed for both selected spectral regions; then, leaf traits were estimated from a leaf segment. Leaf reflectance was first resampled and then processed using continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) to derive the wavelet spectra. PLSR models linking the leaf traits and the reflectance or wavelet spectra were compared. Our results reveal that PLSR models based on wavelet spectra require fewer components to predict traits (13?16) than those based on reflectance (25?29). In addition, PLSR models? performance (e.g., R2) of testing datasets tend to be higher for models based on wavelet spectra (LMA = 0.83; WC = 0.77; EWT = 0.68) than reflectance (LMA = 0.78; WC = 0.76; EWT = 0.49). Wavelet spectra models also seem to better characterize absorption features that drive the variability of leaf traits than models based on reflectance. However, life forms play an essential role in model performance, where the prediction of lianas? traits presenting lower R2 (R2 = 0.61 ? 0.25) than trees? traits (R2 = 0.69 ? 0.15) regardless of the type of spectra or leaf trait. Our findings highlight the use of wavelet spectra to overcome limitations of the PLSR models for predicting leaf traits and the need to explore potential bias associated with plant groups on the model evaluations.', '[Guzman, J.

At L-band, VOD is used to estimate the global biomass, a key component of the Earth\'s surface and of the carbon cycle. This study focuses on the behaviour of L-band VOD (L-VOD) retrieval algorithm over seasonally inundated areas, as some previous observations have shown an unexpected decline in VOD during flooding events. To analyse such variations, a passive microwave model was used to simulate the signal emitted by a mixed scene composed of soil and standing water. The retrieval over this inundated scene led to an overestimation of soil moisture (SM) and an underestimation of L-VOD. The phenomenon is more pronounced over grasslands than over forests, since low vegetation is mostly submerged under water and becomes invisible to the sensor; and since more standing water is visible to the sensor. The estimated L-VOD is typically reduced by similar to 10% over flooded forests and up to 100% over flooded grasslands. Such effects can distort the analysis of aboveground biomass (AGB) and aboveground carbon (AGC) dynamics based on L-VOD estimates. We evaluated that AGB can be underestimated by 15/20 Mg ha(-1) in the largest seasonal wetlands, which can represent more than 50% of the actual AGB of these fields, and up to higher values during exceptional meteorological years. Consequently, to better estimate the global biomass, surface water seasonality has to be taken into account in passive microwave retrieval algorithms.', '[Bousquet, Emma; Mialon, Arnaud; Rodriguez-Fernandez, Nemesio; Kerr, Yann H.] Univ Toulouse, Ctr Etud Spatiales Biosphere CESBIO, CNES, CNRS,INRAE,IRD,UPS, 18 Av Edouard Belin,Bpi 2801, F-31401 Toulouse 9, France.

While the mapping of green Leaf Area Index (LAI) is well established, current operational retrieval models are not calibrated for LAI estimation over senescent, brown vegetation. This not only leads to an underestimation of LAI when crops are ripening, but is also a missed monitoring opportunity. The high spatial and temporal resolution of Sentinel-2 (52) satellites constellation offers the possibility to estimate brown LAI (LAI(B)) next to green LAI (LAI(G)). By using LAI ground measurements from multiple campaigns associated with airborne or satellite spectra, Gaussian processes regression (GPR) models were developed for both LAI(G) and LAI(B), providing alongside associated uncertainty estimates, which allows to mask out unreliable LAI retrievals with higher uncertainties. A processing chain was implemented to apply both models to 52 images, generating a multiband LAI product at 20 m spatial resolution. The models were adequately validated with insitu data from various European study sites (LAI(G): R-2 = 0.7, RMSE = 0.67 m(2)/m(2); LAI(B): R-2 = 0.62, RMSE = 0.43 m(2)/m(2)). Thanks to the 52 bands in the red edge (B5: 705 nm and B6: 740 nm) and in the shortwave infrared (B12: 2190 nm) a distinction between LAI(G) and LAI(B) can be achieved. To demonstrate the capability of LAI(B) to identify when crops start senescing, 52 time series were processed over multiple European study sites and seasonal maps were produced, which show the onset of crop senescence after the green vegetation peak. Particularly, the LAI(B) product permits the detection of harvest (i.e., sudden drop in LAI(B)) and the determination of crop residues (i.e., remaining LAI(B)), although a better spectral sampling in the shortwave infrared would have been desirable to disentangle brown LAI from soil variability and its perturbing effects. Finally, a single total LAI product was created by merging LAI(G) and LAI(B) estimates, and then compared to the LAI derived from 52 L2B biophysical processor integrated in SNAP. The spatiotemporal analysis results confirmed the improvement of the proposed descriptors with respect to the standard SNAP LAI product accounting only for photosynthetically active green vegetation.', '[Amin, Eatidal; Verrelst, Jochem; Rivera-Caicedo, Juan Pablo; Pipia, Luca; Ruiz-Verdu, Antonio; Moreno, Jose] Univ Valencia, Image Proc Lab IPL, Valencia 46980, Spain.

However, the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the SIF retrievals from canopy radiance derived from images with medium and low spatial resolution remains uncharacterised. In images from forest and agricultural landscapes, the background comprises a mixture of soil and understory and can generate confounding effects that limit the interpretation of the SIF at the canopy level. This paper aims to improve the understanding of SIF from coarse spatial resolutions in heterogeneous canopies by considering the separated contribution of tree crowns, understory and background components, using a modified version of the FluorFLIGHT radiative transfer model (RTM). The new model is compared with others through the RAMI model intercomparison framework and is validated with airborne data. The airborne campaign includes high-resolution data collected over a tree-grass ecosystem with the HyPlant imaging spectrometer within the FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) preparatory missions. Field data measurements were collected from plots with a varying fraction of tree and understory vegetation cover. The relationship between airborne SIF calculated from pure tree crowns and aggregated pixels shows the effect of the understory at different resolutions. For a pixel size smaller than the mean crown size, the impact of the background was low (R-2 > 0.99; NRMSE < 0.01). By contrast, for a pixel size larger than the crown size, the goodness of fit decreased (R-2 < 0.6; NRMSE > 0.2). This study demonstrates that using a 3D RTM model improves the calculation of SIF significantly (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.03 mW M-2 sr(-1) nm(-1)) when the specific contribution of the soil and understory layers are accounted for, in comparison with the SIF calculated from mixed pixels that considers only one layer as background (R-2 = 0.4, RMSE = 0.28 mW M-2 sr(-1) nm(-1)). These results demonstrate the need to account for the contribution of SIF emitted by the understory in the quantification of SIF within tree crowns and within the canopy from aggregated pixels in heterogeneous forest canopies.', '[Hornero, A.; North, P.

It is also an important part of the planet\'s hydrological cycle. Accordingly, the investigation of its light scattering properties is essential for remote sensing applications employed in the estimation of changes in the current amount of snowpack. These wide-scale environmental changes are key indicators of future climate events affecting global sustainability. Viewed in this context, computational simulations of light interactions with snow can be used to increase the effectiveness-to-cost ratio of remote sensing initiatives in this area. More specifically, by enabling a controlled assessment of the effects of snow granular structure and composition parameters on its light reflection and transmission profiles, these simulations can be instrumental in the high-fidelity interpretation of data remotely acquired from snow-covered landscapes that pose sizable challenges for field work. In order to contribute to these interdisciplinary research efforts, this paper presents a novel light transport model for snow that can predictively simulate the spectral and spatial distributions of light interacting with this ubiquitous particulate material. While the former radiometric responses are quantified in terms of hyperspectral reflectance and transmittance, the latter are quantified in terms of BSDF (bidirectional scattering distribution function). The proposed model employs a first-principles simulation approach that accounts for the positional dependence of the scattered light in the quantification of its spatial distribution. Thus, this distribution can also be expressed in terms of BSSDF (bidirectional surface-scattering distribution function). The predictive capabilities of the proposed model are quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated by comparing modeled results with measured data obtained from in situ experiments and phenomenological traits reported in the literature, respectively.', '[Varsa, Petri M.; Baranoski, Gladimir V.

The method utilizes Sentinel-1 data and is thus suitable for continuous near real-time monitoring. The main challenge with the C-band VV-polarization signal is the sensitivity to vegetation and especially to forest canopies. A relatively simple zeroth-order model is used for the retrieval of the ground and the canopy backscatter contributions in 1 km cell size. These backscatter components are then used to identify the F/T state of the soil by comparing them to corresponding reference values representing frozen and thawed conditions. The classification algorithm is based on threshold values applied on the Euclidian distances between the retrieved backscatter and the reference values. The method is tested for three test areas across Finland, having different forest properties: Sodankyla, Nurmes and Tampere, located in northern, central and southern Finland, respectively. We first evaluated whether the use of canopy cover (CC) or stem volume (SV) as the parameter describing the forest conditions provide better model accuracy. We then assessed the Sentinel-1 based soil F/T estimates by comparing them to automatic in situ observations and the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) based soil F/T product. The model performance was generally better when SV was used as the forest parameter. Nevertheless, for both CC and SV, the RMSE between the modeled and the observed backscatter was considerably lower than the seasonal variation of the backscatter. In Sodankyla and Nurmes, the Sentinel-1 based F/T estimates were well in line with the in situ observations and the SMOS F/T product. The Sentinel-1 retrievals measuring the top soil layer were fast to react to air temperature changes between negative and positive Celsius degrees, showing similarity of 94-99% with the air temperature measurements. In Tampere the method showed weaker results; the similarity with the air temperature observations was 64%. Overall, a correct vertical freezing pattern of the soil was demonstrated in this study, with Sentinel-1 sensitive to the top soil layer, in situ sensors measuring at 5 cm depth, and SMOS reaching to 5-15 cm soil depth.

ET, however, remains one of the most uncertain hydrological variables at the global scale. In this study, we proposed a semi-mechanistic model for estimating terrestrial T by deriving an analytical solution between solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and stomatal conductance (g(c)) as well as vapor pressure deficit (VPD), combining theories on the photosynthetic pathway and optimal stomatal behavior. The relationships of SIF-ETR and ETR-gc center dot VPD0.5 was calibrated by the Soil-Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy (SCOPE) model. This model was validated by hourly canopy SIF and concurrent eddy covariance flux observations at both forest and cropland ecosystems. Results showed that the SIF combined with VPD can better predict gc than using SIF alone with a more consistent seasonal trends found in both SIF and gc center dot VPD0.5. The correlation between gc center dot VPD0.5 and SIF was stronger than those between gc and SIF and between gc and VIs. Canopy T was accurately predicted from SIF at both hourly (R-2 > 0.65) and daily (R-2 > 0.76) scales and was also successfully estimated using SIF observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) at cropland ecosystems. In comparison with empirical relationships of directly linking gc with SIF or VIs, the proposed model produced latent heat flux (lambda E) estimation in best agreement with measured values at all three sites. Our model could be a step forward in understanding the coupling of carbon and water cycles and may be used in ecosystem models for improving ET estimation over large areas.', '[Shan, Nan; Zhang, Yongguang; Chen, Jing M.; Ju, Weimin; Zhang, Zhaoying] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Geog Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

Despite the progress made in improving the accuracy of AOD retrievals, there are still major challenges, especially over land. A notable one for the so-called Dark-Target (DT) algorithms is building the surface reflectance (SR) relationships (SRR) to derive SR in the visible channels from SR in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) channel, mainly because these relationships are strongly subjected to entangled factors (e.g., viewing geometry, surface type, and vegetation state). In this study, we examine the benefits of a new method for deriving the SRR using deep learning techniques. The SRR constructed by the deep neural network (DNN) considers multiple related inputs, such as the SWIR normalized difference vegetation index (NDVISWIR), viewing geometry, and seasonality, among others. We then incorporate the DNN-constrained SRR into a DT algorithm developed at NOAA/STAR to retrieve AOD from the Advanced Himawari Instrument (AHI) onboard the new generation of geostationary satellites, Himawari-8. The revised DT algorithm with the deep learning technique (DTDL) de-monstrates improved performance over the study region (95-125 degrees E, 18-30 degrees N, a portion of the AHI full disk), as attested by significantly reduced random noise, especially for low NDVISWIR and high surface albedo cases. Robust independent tests indicate that this algorithm can be applied to untrained regions, not only to those used in training. The method directly benefits the algorithm development for Himawari-8 and can also be adopted for other geostationary or polar-orbiting satellites. Our study illustrates how artificial intelligence could significantly improve AOD retrievals from multi-spectral satellite observations following this new approach.', '[Su, Tianning; Laszlo, Istvan; Li, Zhanqing; Wei, Jing] Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.

Coarse spatial resolution scatterometer data has great potential for application in this field due to its high temporal resolution (approx. daily observations). In this study, we investigate the influence of sub-grid cell (12.5 km) surface water (ice free and ice covered) on freeze/thaw retrieval based on ASCAT data using a threshold algorithm. We found discrepancies related to the surface water fraction in the detected timing of thawing and freezing of up to 2 days earlier thawing for spring and 3.5 days earlier freezing for autumn for open water fractions of 40% resulting in an overestimation of the frozen season. Results of this study led to the creation of a method for correction of water fraction impact on freeze/thaw data.

State-of-the-art 1 km SM data from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, SMOS-BEC L4 version 3 are used for this purpose. A strategy is developed to prepare the SMOS-L4 surface soil moisture (SSM) product for the COnsortium for Small-scale MOdelling (COSMO) model initialization by applying a cumulative density function (CDF)-matching biascorrection and the exponential filter method to calculate corresponding SM profiles (L4-Expo). The processed satellite-derived product is validated with 38 observing sites from three in-situ SM networks REMEDHUS (19), SMOSMANIA (11) and VAS (8). All networks measure at a soil depth of 5 cm, only at the SMOSMANIA network additional measurements at 10, 20 and 30 cm are available. Four HPEs are selected to evaluate the impact of the high-resolution realistic initialization. The results show a high agreement index (AI = 0.91) and a low root-mean-square deviation (0.03 m(3)/m(3)) of the high-resolution, bias-corrected SMOS-L4 SSM product compared to in-situ observations. Moreover, the derived L4-Expo SM profile field agrees with ground-based observations and successfully removes the wet bias of the original COSMO simulated SM profile. Enhanced SM initialization with the SMOS-L4 SM derived profiles improves precipitation modelling in all selected HPEs as a consequence of improved near-surface 2 m-temperature and induced changes in the pressure field (-0.5 hPa), atmospheric humidity distribution (dqs = 5-15%) as well as wind circulations (dw(700hPa) = 25%), thus convergence/divergence fields. The sensitivity study, applying the same methodology for SM initialization for a SMOS-L3 (similar to 25 km), shows a weaker improvement of the precipitation forecast of an analysed HPE than the 1 km SMOS-4 product.

In this paper, we propose a persistent homology method applied on LiDAR-derived digital terrain model data to detect landslides for landslide inventory maps. In testing the hypothesis that persistent homology, a method for computing topological features of a space at different resolutions, can be used to accurately detect landslides, we applied the method on LiDARderived digital terrain models to detect shapes and patterns that are indicative of landslide surface expressions. We validated our test results by comparing them to currently available landslide inventory maps for selected locations in Pennsylvania, Oregon, Colorado and Washington. The results show a different performance for each state; the accuraces were 0.79, 0.71, 0.53, 0.69, and 0.77 for five study areas. Variations in performance are linked to varying surface roughness between different types of landslides, their size, shape, ages, composition, and a possible history of reactivations of landslides that would further pronounce surface expressions.

In light of this knowledge gap, several upcoming spaceborne missions aim to map forest aboveground biomass, and many new biomass products are expected from these datasets. As these new missions host different technologies, each with relative strengths and weaknesses for biomass retrieval, as well as different spatial resolutions, consistently comparing or combining biomass estimates from these new datasets will be challenging. This paper presents a demonstration of an inter-comparison of biomass estimates from simulations of three NASA missions (GEDI, ICESat-2 and NISAR) over Sonoma county in California, USA. We use a high resolution, locally calibrated airborne lidar map as our reference dataset, and emphasize the importance of considering uncertainties in both reference maps and spaceborne estimates when conducting biomass product validation. GEDI and ICESat-2 were simulated from airborne lidar point clouds, while UAVSAR\'s L-band backscatter was used as a proxy for NISAR. To estimate biomass for the lidar missions we used GEDI\'s footprint-level biomass algorithms, and also adapted these for application to ICESat-2. For UAVSAR, we developed a locally trained biomass model, calibrated against the ALS reference map. Each mission simulation was evaluated in comparison to the local reference map at its native product resolution (25 m, 100 m transect, and 1 ha) yielding RMSEs of 57%, 75%, and 89% for GEDI, NISAR, and ICESat-2 respectively. RMSE values increased for GEDI\'s power beam during simulated daytime conditions (64%), coverage beam during nighttime conditions (72%), and coverage beam daytime conditions (87%). We also test the application of GEDI\'s biomass modeling framework for estimation of biomass from ICESat-2, and find that ICESat-2 yields reasonable biomass estimates, particularly in relatively short, open canopies. Results suggest that while all three missions will produce datasets useful for biomass mapping, tall, dense canopies such as those found in Sonoma County present the greatest challenges for all three missions, while steep slopes also prove challenging for single-date SAR-based biomass retrievals. Our methods provide guidance for the inter-comparison and validation of spaceborne biomass estimates through the use of airborne lidar reference maps, and could be repeated with on-orbit estimates in any area with high quality field plot and ALS data. These methods allow for regional interpretations and filtering of multi-mission biomass estimates toward improved wall-to-wall biomass maps through data fusion.', '[Duncanson, Laura; Hancock, Steven; Silva, Carlos A.; Armston, John; Hofton, Michelle; Dubayah, Ralph] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

This study proposed a method for detection of the West Antarctic fast ice using the Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Array L-band SAR (ALOS PALSAR) images. The algorithm has combined image segmentation, image correlation analysis, and machine learning techniques (i.e., random forest (RF), extremely randomized trees (ERT), and logistic regression (LR)). We used SAR images with a baseline of 5 days that are not in the same orbit but overlap each other as overlaps between swaths in adjacent orbits are often available in the polar regions. The underlying assumption for the proposed fast ice detection algorithm is that fast ice regions in SAR images with a time interval of 5 days are highly correlated. The object-based approach proposed in this study was well suited to high-resolution SAR images in deriving spatially homogeneous fast ice regions. The image segmentation results using the optimized parameters showed a distinct difference in the backscatter temporal evolution between fast ice and pack ice regions. Correlation and STD of backscattering coefficients were found to be the most significant variables for the object-based fast ice detection from two temporally separated images. In overall, the quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrated that the algorithm was an effective approach to detect fast ice with high accuracies. The models well detected various fast ice regions in the West Antarctica but misclassified some objects. The misclassifications occurred toward the edge of fast ice regions with relatively rapid changes in backscattering between both data acquisitions. On the other hand, few fast ice objects were misclassified as uniform backscattering over time occurred by chance on very small objects far from the coast. Very old multi-year fast ice regions with high backscattered signals were also a source for some misclassifications. This may be due to the sensitivity of L-band to snow structure to some extent and a thinner ice over the region with either ice growth (no deformation) or closing (slight deformation) between both images. Heavy snow load on the ice could be another error source for some misclassification as well. The approach allowed for the reliable detection of fast ice regions by using L-band SAR images with a small local incidence angle difference.', '[Kim, Miae; Im, Jungho] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Urban & Environm Engn, Ulsan 44919, South Korea.

Remote sensing has become an important tool for monitoring large scale AIS, while it remains challenging for accurate extraction of AIS using optical datasets alone due to the high diversity of land covers over large scale. Previous studies indicated the complementary use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to improve the AIS estimation, while most of them were limited to local and small scales. The potential of SAR for large scale AIS mapping is still uncertain and under-explored. In this study, first, a machine learning framework incorporating both optical and SAR data based on Google Earth Engine platform was developed for mapping and analyzing the annual dynamics of AIS in China. Feature-level fusion for SAR and optical data across large scale was tested applicable considering the backscattering coefficients, texture measures and spectral characteristics. Improved accuracy (averaged 2% increased overall accuracy and averaged 4% increased Kappa coefficient) and better delineation between the bright impervious surface and bare land was observed comparing with using optical data alone. Second, comprehensive assessment was conducted using high-resolution samples from Google Earth, census data from China Statistic Yearbook and benchmark datasets from the GlobeLand30 and GHSL, demonstrating the feasibility and reliability of the proposed method and results.

Traditional methods to monitor above-ground biomass (AGB) rely on on-ground measurements, which are expensive, labour intensive and cover small spatial scales. Structure from Motion and Multi-View Stereo reconstructions from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles imagery (UAV-SfM) have the potential to increase fieldwork efficiency by providing a greater amount of spatial information in less time. However, there is still a need to assess the ability of UAV-SfM to retrieve structural information of mangrove forests, which could pose challenges in areas of high forest complexity and density.   In this study we successfully used UAV-SfM data to estimate height, canopy diameter and AGB of natural and rehabilitated mangrove forests across two regions of the southeastern coast of Australia. We used a variable window filter algorithm to detect trees with an 80% detection rate when considering the top canopy. Individual tree canopy segmentation was performed using a marker-controlled watershed segmentation with two sets of constraining markers: treetops and a minimum height below which a pixel is not considered part of a tree.   Direct comparison with on-ground measurements at the regional level showed no significant difference in tree height and AGB medians when only top canopy was considered. Similarly, median canopy diameters were not significantly different in natural areas of both regions, but significant differences were found in rehabilitated areas. UAV-SfM estimates of AGB were on average 15% lower in natural areas and 10% higher in rehabilitated areas when compared to on-ground measurements and followed a strong linear relationship close to the ideal one-to-one relationship.   Additionally, we performed a cost-benefit analysis of the two methodologies. UAV-SfM methods can save almost AU$ 50,000 per ha when compared to on-ground measurements and become cost-effective (based on total costs) after just 15 days of surveys. The methods described in this study open the possibility for easily repeatable, low-cost UAV-SfM surveys for local managers by providing a faster, more cost-effective approach for monitoring mangrove forests over larger areas than traditional on-ground surveys while maintaining forest inventory data accuracy in both natural and rehabilitated mangrove forests.', '[Navarro, Alejandro; Young, Mary; Allan, Blake; Ierodiaconou, Daniel] Deakin Univ, Fac Sci Engn & Built Environm, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Warrnambool, Vic 3280, Australia.

Despite continuing efforts to develop LAI estimation algorithms, LAI datasets still need improvement at spatial and temporal resolutions to meet the requirements of agricultural applications. Advancements in data fusion technique and the emergence of new satellite data provide opportunities for LAI data at higher resolutions in both space and time. In this study, we derived new LAI estimations by leveraging novel satellite remote sensing datasets, STAIR fusion (MODIS-Landsat fusion) and Planet Labs\' CubeSat data (through a reprocessed pipeline) for a typical agricultural landscape in the U.S. Corn Belt. The STAIR fused data and our reprocessed CubeSat data have both fine spatial resolutions (30 m and 3.125 m, respectively) and high frequencies (daily for both). To reliably estimate LAI from these advanced satellite datasets, we used two methods: inversion of a radiative transfer model (RTM), and empirical relationship with vegetation index (VI) calibrated from field measured LAI. Compared to the ground-truth LAI collected at 36 sites across the study region, reliable approximations were achieved by both LAI estimations based on PROSAIL RTM (STAIR: R-2 = 0.69 and root mean squared error (RMSE) = 1.12 (m(2) m(-2)), CubeSat: R-2 = 0.76 and RMSE = 1.09 (m(2) m(-2))), and LAI estimations based on Green Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (GrWDRVI) (STAIR: R-2 = 0.75, RMSE = 1.10 (m(2) m(-2)), CubeSat: R-2 = 0.76, RMSE = 1.08 (m(2) m(-2)), where validation ground-truth is independent from calibration data). Newly estimated high-resolution LAI data were aggregated at 500 m resolution and compared with MODIS and VIIRS LAI products, revealing substantial uncertainties and biases in these two products. We also demonstrated phenology stage estimation at fine spatial resolutions based on our high-frequency LAI data. The proposed LAI estimation methods at both high spatial resolution and temporal frequency can be applied to the entire U.S. Corn Belt and provide significant advancement to crop monitoring and precision agriculture.', '[Kimm, Hyungsuk; Guan, Kaiyu; Jiang, Chongya; Peng, Bin; Gentry, Laura F.; Wang, Sibo; Cai, Yaping] Univ Illinois, Coll Agr Consumer & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.

Part of the challenge is due to the lack of direct comparability among these SIF products as they are derived from various satellite platforms with different retrieval methods, instruments characteristics, overpass time, and viewing-illumination geometries. This study presents a framework that circumvents these discrepancies and allows the harmonization of SIF products from multiple instruments to achieve long-term coverage. We demonstrate this framework by fusing SIF retrievals from SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2) onboard MetOp-A developed at German Research Center for Geosciences (GFZ). We first downscale both original SIF datasets from their native resolutions to 0.05 degrees ((SIF) over bar (GOME2_005) and (SIF) over bar (SCIA_005) respectively) using machine learning (ML) algorithms imposed with regionalization constraints to account for the varying relationships between predictors and SIF in space and time. We then apply the cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching technique to correct the offset between (SIF) over bar (GOME2_005) and (SIF) over bar (SCIA_005) inherited from the original instrumental discrepancies to generate a harmonized SIF time series from 2002 to present ((SIF) over bar (005)). Finally, we quantify the uncertainty of (SIF) over bar (005). (SIF) over bar (005) is validated with 1) the original retrievals to ensure the spatial and temporal variabilities are preserved, 2) airborne SIF derived from the Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging Spectrometer (CFIS, R-2 = 0.73), and 3) ground-based SIF measurements at a subalpine coniferous forest (R-2 = 0.91). The SIFyield derived from (SIF) over bar (005) has high seasonal consistency with the ground measurements (R-2 = 0.93), suggesting that the harmonized product (SIF) over bar (005) carries physiological information beyond the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation. Additionally, (SIF) over bar (005) has a good capability for large-scale stress monitoring as demonstrated with several major historical drought and heatwave events. The framework developed in this study sets the stage for future development of even more advanced SIF products from all SIP-capable satellite platforms once issues related to inter-sensor calibration are resolved and SIF physiology is better understood.', '[Wen, J.; Yu, L.; Chang, C.

By coupling various Radiative Transfer (RT) models one can describe the soil, vegetation and atmosphere contributions in a \"bottom-up\" approach and, thereby, simulate top-of-atmosphere (TOA) spectral radiance data comparable to satellite-observed TOA radiances. This makes it possible to retrieve vegetation properties directly from TOA radiances rather than from atmospherically corrected top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance data. The advantages of this approach are that a separate atmospheric correction of the satellite images is not necessary, and that the anisotropic surface reflection can also be taken into account effectively. In this study, we coupled various RT models, including the brightness - shape - moisture (BSM) reflectance model of the soil, the optical radiative transfer (RTMo) model of vegetation and the \'MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission\' (MODTRAN) model of the atmosphere, to simulate an annual time series of Landsat satellite TOA radiances observed during a drought episode in California Mediterranean grasslands in 2004. The inversion of this coupled system through an optimization technique against Landsat TOA radiances resulted in direct retrieval of vegetation properties. We accommodated the surface anisotropic reflection in our coupled modeling and also defined a novel anisotropy index to quantitatively express the importance of this phenomenon in satellite image analysis for the first time. Our study showed that the coupled use of RT models was able to accurately reproduce the time series of observed TOA radiances collected under varying soil moisture contents during an extended drought episode. The proposed coupling approach is useful for successful retrieval of vegetation properties from time series of satellite TOA radiance data to produce maps of land surface properties and to monitor vegetation properties variations in an operational straightforward way. The approach can also be easily adapted for conducting multi-sensor time series studies, creating a much denser temporal sampling than would be possible for separate single sensors.', '[Bayat, Bagher; van der Tol, Christiaan; Verhoef, Wouter] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.', 'University of TwenteRP Bayat, B (通讯作者)，Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.', 'b.bayat@utwente.nl; c.vandertol@utwente.nl; w.verhoef@utwente.nlRI Bayat, Bagher/AAP-2573-2020', 'Bayat, Bagher/0000-0002-7761-9544; Verhoef, Wouter/0000-0003-4696-2144', 'ITC Faculty of the University of Twente IFP program [IFP17.1.2]; IMSRT   scholarship [4.81681]', 'We are very grateful to Prof. Dennis Baldocchi and Dr. Siyan Ma from the   University of California, Berkeley, USA, who provided the time series   ground measurements of soil moisture content and leaf area index for the   Vaira Ranch (US-Var) Fluxnet site during the course of this research.

Perhaps most importantly, time series analysis is expanding the kinds of land surface change that can be monitored using remote sensing. In particular, more subtle changes in ecosystem health and condition and related to land use dynamics are being monitored. The result is a paradigm shift away from change detection, typically using two points in time, to monitoring, or an attempt to track change continuously in time.

COLD can detect many kinds of land disturbance continuously as new images are collected and provide historical land disturbance maps retrospectively. To better detect land disturbance, we tested different kinds of input data and explored many time series analysis techniques. We have several major observations as follows. First, time series of surface reflectance provides much better detection results than time series of Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, and with some adjustments to the temporal density, time series from Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) is better than it is from the same Landsat scene. Second, the combined use of spectral bands is always better than using a single spectral band or index, and if all the essential spectral bands have been employed, the inclusion of other indices does not further improve the algorithm performance. Third, the remaining outliers in the time series can be removed based on their deviation from model predicted values based on probability-based thresholds derived from normal or chi-squared distributions. Fourth, model initialization is pivotal for monitoring land disturbance, and a good initialization stability test can influence algorithm performance substantially. Fifth, time series model estimation with eight coefficients model, updated for every single observation, based on all available clear observations achieves the best result. Sixth, a change probability of 0.99 (chi-squared distribution) with six consecutive anomaly observations and a mean included angle < 45 degrees to confirm a change provide the best results, and the combined use of temporally-adjusted Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and minimum RMSE is recommended. Finally, spectral changes (or \"breaks\") contributed from vegetation regrowth should be excluded from land disturbance maps. The COLD algorithm was developed and calibrated based on all these lessons learned above. The accuracy assessment shows that COLD results were accurate for detecting land disturbance, with an omission error of 27% and a commission error of 28%.', '[Zhu, Zhe; Zhang, Junxue] Univ Connecticut, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.

However, due to the complex information brought by the increased spatial resolution and the data disturbances caused by different conditions of image acquisition, it is often difficult to find an efficient method for achieving accurate land-cover classification with high-resolution and heterogeneous remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a scheme to apply deep model obtained from labeled land-cover dataset to classify unlabeled HRRS images. The main idea is to rely on deep neural networks for presenting the contextual information contained in different types of land-covers and propose a pseudo-labeling and sample selection scheme for improving the transferability of deep models. More precisely, a deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is first pre-trained with a well-annotated land-cover dataset, referred to as the source data. Then, given a target image with no labels, the pre-trained CNN model is utilized to classify the image in a patch-wise manner. The patches with high confidence are assigned with pseudo-labels and employed as the queries to retrieve related samples from the source data. The pseudo-labels confirmed with the retrieved results are regarded as supervised information for fine-tuning the pre-trained deep model. To obtain a pixel-wise land-cover classification with the target image, we rely on the fine-tuned CNN and develop a hybrid classification by combining patch-wise classification and hierarchical segmentation. In addition, we create a large-scale land-cover dataset containing 150 Gaofen-2 satellite images for CNN pre-training. Experiments on multi-source HRRS images, including Gaofen-2, Gaofen-1, Jilin-1, Ziyuan-3, Sentinel-2A, and Google Earth platform data, show encouraging results and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme to land-cover classification with multi-source HRRS images.', '[Tong, Xin-Yi; Xia, Gui-Song; Zhang, Liangpei] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab LIESMARS, Wuhan, Peoples R China.

In recent years, several fire detection products have been developed to provide information of fire radiative power (FRP), location, size, and temperature of fire pixels, but no information regarding fire burning phase is retrieved. The Day-Night band (DNB) aboard Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is sensitive to visible light from flaming fires in nighttime scenes. In contrast, VIIRS 4 mu m moderate resolution band #13 (M13), though capable of detecting fires at all phases, has no direct sensitivity for discerning fire phase. However, the hybrid usage of VIIRS DNB and M-bands data is hampered by their different scanning technology and spatial resolution. In this study, we present a novel method to rapidly and accurately resample DNB pixel radiances to the footprint of M-band pixels, accounting for onboard detector aggregation schemes and bowtie effect removals. The visible energy fraction (VEF) is subsequently introduced as an indicator of fire burning phase. VEF is calculated as the ratio of visible light power (VLP) to FRP for each fire pixel retrieved from the VIIRS 750 m active fire product. A global distribution of VEF values is quantitatively obtained, showing smaller VEF values in regions with mostly smoldering wildfires, such as peatland fires in Indonesia, larger VEF values in regions with flaming wildfires over grasslands and savannas in the sub-Sahelian region, and the largest VEF values associated with gas flaring in the Middle East. Mean VEF for different land cover types or regions is highly correlated with modified combustion efficiency (MCE). These results, together with a case study of the 2018 California Camp Fire, show that the VEF has the potential to be an indicator of fire combustion phase for each fire pixel, appropriate for estimating emission factors at the satellite pixel level.', '[Wang, Jun; Roudini, Sepehr; Xu, Xiaoguang; Garcia, Lorena Castro] Univ Iowa, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.

Moreover the synoptic view captured by satellite imagery over volcanoes can benefit hazard monitoring efforts. By monitoring, we mean both following the changing styles and intensities of the eruption once it has started, as well as nowcasting and eventually forecasting the areas potentially threatened by hazardous phenomena in an eruptive scenario. Here we demonstrate how the diversity of remote sensing data over volcanoes and the mutual interconnection between satellite observations and numerical simulations can improve lava flow hazard monitoring in response to effusive eruption. Time-averaged discharge rates (TADRs) obtained from low spatial/high temporal resolution satellite data (e.g. MODIS, SEVIRI) are complemented, compared and fine-tuned with detailed maps of volcanic deposits with the aim of constraining the conversion from satellite-derived radiant heat flux to TADR. Maps of volcanic deposits include the time-varying evolution of lava flow emplacement derived from multispectral satellite data (e.g. EO-ALI, Landsat, Sentinel-2, ASTER), as well as the flow thickness variations, retrieved from the topographic monitoring by using stereo or tri-stereo optical data (e.g. Pleiades, PlanetScope, ASTER). Finally, satellite-derived parameters are used as input and validation tags for the numerical modelling of lava flow scenarios. Our strategy is applied to the first historic eruption of Nabro volcano (Eritrea), occurred in June 2011. This eruptive event was characterized by the extraordinary quantity of SO2 emitted into the atmosphere and the extent of the long lava flows, which had a significant impact on the inhabitants of the Eritrea-Ethiopia border region despite the low population density. Because of its remote position, little was known about this eruption regarding the quantity of volcanic deposits and the timing and mechanisms of their emplacement. We found that the total volume of deposits, calculated from differences of digital elevation models (DEMs), is about 580 x 10(6) m(3), of which about 336 x 10(6) m(3) is the volume of the main lava flow that advanced eastward beyond the caldera. Multi-spectral satellite observations indicate that the main lava flow had reached its maximum extent (similar to 16 km) within about 4 days of the eruption onset on midnight 12 June. Lava flow simulations driven by satellite-derived parameters allow building an understanding of the advance rate and maximum extent of the main lava flow showing that it is likely to have reached 10.5 km in one day with a maximum speed of similar to 0.44 km/h.', '[Ganci, Gaetana; Cappello, Annalisa; Bilotta, Giuseppe; Del Negro, Ciro] Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Osservatorio Etneo, Sez Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Istituto Nazionale Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV)RP Ganci, G (通讯作者)，Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Osservatorio Etneo, Sez Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'gaetana.ganci@ingv.itRI Bilotta, Giuseppe/B-7129-2012; Cappello, Annalisa/M-3680-2019; Ganci,   Gaetana/I-8915-2016', 'Bilotta, Giuseppe/0000-0002-1406-4545; Cappello,   Annalisa/0000-0002-9947-8789; Ganci, Gaetana/0000-0002-9914-1107; Del   Negro, Ciro/0000-0001-5734-9025', 'ATHOS Research Programme; DPC-INGV 2012-2021 agreement', 'This work was developed at the Laboratory of Technologies for   Volcanology (TecnoLab) at INGV in Catania (Italy).

Nevertheless, such models can be strongly biased without a precise model of the internal structure of the volcano. In this study, we jointly exploited two interferometric techniques to interpret the 2011-2013 unrest at Campi Flegrei caldera (CFc). The first is the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique, which provides highly-resolved spatial and temporal images of ground deformation. The second is the Ambient Noise Tomography (ANT), which images subsurface structures, providing the constraints necessary to infer the depth of the shallow source at CFc (between 0.8 and 1.2 km). We applied for the first time a tool to delineate the deformation source boundaries from the observed deformation maps: the Total Horizontal Derivative (THD) technique. The THD processes the vertical component of the ground deformation field detected through InSAR applied to COSMO-SkyMed data. The patterns retrieved by applying the THD technique show consistent spatial correlations with (1) the seismic group-velocity maps achieved through the ANT and (2) the distribution of the earthquakes nucleated during the unrest at similar to 1 km. High-velocity anomalies, the retrieved geometrical features of the deformation field, and the spatial distribution of seismicity coincide with extinct volcanic vents in the eastern part of the caldera (Solfatara/Pisciarelli and Astroni). Such a coincidence hints at a significant role of the extinct plumbing system in either constraining or channeling the eastward propagation of magmatic fluids. Here, we demonstrated that a joint analysis of the InSAR patterns, seismic structures, and seismicity allows us to model in space and time the characteristics and nature of the shallow deformation source at CFc. Using published literature, we show that the effects of structural heterogeneities at shallow depths may have a more significant early-stage impact on the evolution of the surface displacement signals than deeper magmatic sources: these secondary structural effects may produce local amplification in the deformation records which can be mistakenly interpreted as early signals of impending eruptions. The achieved results are particularly relevant for the understanding of the origin of deformation signal at volcanoes where magma propagation within sills is expected, as at CFc.', '[Pepe, S.; De Siena, L.; Barone, A.; Castaldo, R.; Manzo, M.; Casu, F.; Lanari, R.; Tizzani, P.] Consiglio Nazl Ric CNR Italy, IREA, Via Diocleziano 328, I-80124 Naples, Italy.

Estimated VOD is often used as a biomass proxy or to investigate plant water dynamics on multiple scales, as it is dependent on the vegetation water content, dry woody biomass, and canopy structure. For most but not all microwave satellite remote sensing applications, VOD and omega are assigned a priori from auxiliary vegetation information and used as inputs to retrieve soil moisture. Alternatively, polarized brightness temperature has been used to estimate VOD and omega. Retrieval algorithms typically use the zeroth-order solution to the radiative transfer equation (tau-omega model) to simultaneously characterize surface and vegetation emission. In this study we investigate one year of estimated VOD and omega at L-(1.4 GHz), C-(6.9 GHz) and X-band (10.7 GHz), from SMAP and AMSR2 satellites respectively. Since VOD and omega describe absorption and scattering integrated over a path length, we derive estimates of relative absorption and scattering through normalization by a vegetation height derived from GLAS light detection and ranging (lidar) measurements.   We assess whether relative attenuation is independent of vegetation height and land cover class. We also test how the relative absorption and scattering estimates follow a spectrum across microwave frequencies. We apply this analysis globally and find relative canopy absorption and scattering to follow distinct patterns, relatively independent of the spatial distributions of vegetation height. We find that relative canopy absorption generally peaks for shorter vegetation (5-10 m) and high density (shrub lands) while high forest canopies have relatively lower values. The VOD values that include the path length (taller vegetation) however are higher for forests relative to shorter vegetation. Seasonal amplitudes of VOD are higher for C- and X-band than for L-band and have maxima in regions with strong rainfall seasonality.

Quantifying how production responds to variation in climate at local scales is essential to understand underlying ecological processes and inform land management decision-making, but has historically been limited in spatiotemporal scale based on the use of discrete ground-based measurements or coarse resolution satellite observations. With the advent of cloud-based computing through Google Earth Engine (GEE), production responses to climate can be evaluated across broad landscapes though time at a resolution useful for ecological and land management applications. Here, GEE was employed to synthesize a multi-platform Landsat time series (1988-2014) and evaluate relationships between the soil-adjusted vegetation index (a proxy for plant production) and climate across deserts and plant communities of the southwestern U.S. A \"climate pivot point\" approach was adopted in GEE to assess the trade-off between production responses to increasing wetness and resistances to drought at 30-m resolution. Consistent with a long-term seasonal climate gradient, production was most related to climate variance during the cool-season in the western deserts, during the warm-season in the eastern deserts, and equally related to both seasons within several desert areas. Communities dominated by grasses and deciduous trees displayed large production responses to an increase in wetness and low resistances to water deficit, while shrublands and evergreen woodlands had variable responses and high drought resistances. Production in plant communities that spanned multiple deserts responded differently to seasonal climate variability in each desert. Defining these plant production sensitivities to climate at 30-m resolution in GEE advances forecasts of how long-term climate trajectories may affect carbon storage, wildlife habitat, and the vulnerability of water-limited ecosystems.', '[Bunting, Erin L.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, 673 Auditorium Rd, E Lansing, MI 48825 USA.

Different successional stages have also different capabilities of re-establishing carbon stocks. Therefore, a successful discrimination of successional stages over wide areas can lead to an improved quantification of above ground biomass and carbon stocks. The reduction of the mapping uncertainties is especially a challenge due to high heterogeneity of the tropical vegetation. In this framework, the development of innovative remote sensing approaches is required. Forests (top) height (and its spatial distribution) are an important structural parameter that can be used to differentiate between different successional stages, and can be provided by Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) acquisitions. In this context, this paper investigates the potential of forest heights estimated from TanDEM-X InSAR data and a LiDAR digital terrain model (DTM) for separating successional stages (primary or old growth and secondary forest at different stages of succession) by means of a maximum likelihood classification. The study was carried out in the region of the Tapajos National Forest (Para, Brazil) in the Amazon biome. The forest heights for three years (2012, 2013 and 2016) were estimated from a single-polarization in bistatic mode using InSAR model-based inversion techniques aided by the LiDAR digital terrain model. The validation of the TanDEM-X forest heights with independent LiDAR H100 datasets was carried out in the location of seven field inventory plots (measuring 50 x 50 m, equivalent to 0.25 ha), also allowing for the validation of the LiDAR datasets against the field data. The validation of the estimated heights showed a high correlation (r = 0.93) and a low uncertainty (RMSE = 3 m). The information about the successional stages and forest heights from field datasets was used to select training samples in the LiDAR and TanDEM-X forest heights to classify successional stages with a maximum likelihood classifier. The identification of different stages of forest succession based on TanDEM-X forest heights was possible with an overall accuracy of about 80%.', '[Bispo, Polyanna Da Conceicao; Balzter, Heiko; Tansey, Kevin] Univ Leicester, Sch Geog Geol & Environm, Ctr Landscape & Climate Res, Leicester Inst Space & Earth Observat, Leicester, Leics, England.

The influences of increased [CO2]s ([eCO(2)]s) are typically investigated in Free Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment (FACE) studies via destructive sampling methods. This traditional approach is restricted to sampling plots and harvest dates, while hyperspectral approaches provide new opportunities as they are rapid, non-destructive and cost-effective. They further allow a high temporal resolution including spatially explicit information. In this study we investigated the hyperspectral predictability of 14 grassland traits linked to forage quality and quantity within a FACE experiment in central Germany with three plots under ambient atmospheric [CO2]s, and three plots at [eCO(2)]s (similar to 20% above ambient [CO2]s). We analysed the suitability of various normalisation and feature selection techniques to link comprehensive laboratory analyses with two years of hyperspectral measurements (spectral range 600-1600 nm). We applied partial least squares regression and found good to excellent predictive performances (0.49 <= leave one out cross-validation R-2 <= 0.94), which depended on the normalisation method applied to the hyperspectral data prior to model training. Noteworthy, the models\' predictive performances were not affected by the different [CO2]s, which was anticipated due to the altered plant physiology under [eCO(2)]s. Thus, an accurate monitoring of grassland traits under different [CO2]s (present-day versus future, or within a FACE facility) is promising, if appropriate predictors are selected. Moreover, we show how hyperspectral predictions can be used e.g., within a future phenotyping approach, to monitor the grassland on a spatially explicit level and on a higher temporal resolution compared to conventional destructive sampling techniques. Based on the information during the vegetation period we show how hyperspectral monitoring might be used e.g., to adapt harvest practices or gain deeper insights into physiological plant alterations under [eCO(2)]s.', '[Oberrneier, W.

Although MERIS\' equivalent 665 and 681 nm bands are able to better characterize chlorophyll a concentrations at LIS compared to MODIS, we show that it is a red band difference (RBD) algorithm relying on observing the maximum spectral difference between R-rs681nm-R-rs665nm and R-rs709nm-R-rs665nm from the MERIS sensor that is able to successfully capture the seasonal chlorophyll dynamics measured in situ. Such switching algorithms are useful in areas where the shape of the reflectance spectrum changes throughout the seasons associated with changes in the phytoplankton community structure, and provide seamless implementation compared to algorithms based on seasonal tunings. We apply the switching RBD algorithm to the 10 years of available MERIS data, and results reveal important spatial and temporal patterns that cannot be assessed from in situ data alone. These include the observation that the decreasing trend in surface chlorophyll concentrations between 2002 and 2012 is localized, and may be related to changes in the flow of Atlantic waters into the estuary rather than a result of active management against eutrophication. Following from past studies, we demonstrate how high sensitivity red bands are valuable to successfully determine proxies for phytoplankton biomass in coastal areas where optical properties are dominated by dissolved organic matter, and where the fluorescence peak may not accurately capture the dynamics of productive waters. Such switching RBD algorithms applied to data from the Sentinel or PACE missions may allow distribution of near-real time chlorophyll a products for coastal waters across winter and summer seasons.', '[Freitas, Fernanda Henderikx; Dierssen, Heidi M.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, Groton, CT 06340 USA.

Increasing trends in both expansion and logging of Moso bamboo have occurred over the past four decades due to its rapid growth rate and short harvest rotation period. The spatial and temporal distribution of bamboo forest is the basis for the study of the carbon cycle in bamboo forest ecosystems. Previous studies have consistently focused on different influences of scale, data and algorithms for bamboo forest mapping; however, there is still considerable uncertainty in bamboo forest mapping due to the unique on-year and off-year phenomena and their significant differences in spectral characteristics. Northwestern Zhejiang Province has the most widely distributed bamboo forest and was selected as the study area. Based on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 time-series data, changes in the spectral characteristics during the growth cycle of bamboo forest were analyzed and the optimum time window for the classification of the bamboo forest was determined. The seasonal index of the bamboo forest based on spectral differences was the proposed approach, and on-year and off-year bamboo forest mapping was conducted seasonally using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data. The results show that (1) the best period to distinguish bamboo forest from other forest types is April May, followed by December February, and the best month for distinguishing between on-year and off-year bamboo forests is May; (2) the spectral differences between bamboo forest and other forest types are mainly reflected in the red-edge 3 near-infrared (NIR) and NIR narrow bands (740-865 nm); (3) Sentinel-2 data have obvious advantages over Landsat 8 data in distinguishing the bamboo forest because of better spectral, temporal and spatial resolutions; and (4) the multi-temporal bamboo forest index has a better overall classification accuracy (OA = 91.2) for distinguishing on-year and off-year bamboo forests than the mono-temporal index and can be applied to other regions.', '[Li, Longwei; Lu, Dengsheng] Zhejiang A&F Univ, State Key Lab Subtrop Silviculture, Hangzhou 311300, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

Although multi temporal change detection techniques have contributed greatly to landslide inventory preparation, it is still challenging to generate quality change detection images (CDIs) for accurate landslide mapping. The recently proposed change detection-based Markov random field (CDMRF) provides an effective approach for rapid mapping of landslides with minimum user interventions. However, when CDI is generated by change vector analysis (CVA) alone, the CDMRF method may suffer from noise especially when the pre- and post-event remote sensing images are acquired under different atmospheric, illumination, and phenological conditions. This paper improved such CDMRF approach by integrating normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), principal component analysis (PCA), and independent component analysis (ICA) generated CDIs with MRF for landslide inventory mapping from multi-sensor data. To justify the effectiveness and applicability, the improved methods were applied to map rainfall-, typhoon-, and earthquake-triggered landslides from the pre- and post-event satellite images acquired by very high resolution QuickBird, high resolution FORMOSAT-2, and moderate resolution Sentinel-2. Moreover, they were tested on pre-event Landsat-8 and post-event Sentinel-2 datasets, indicating that they are operational for landslide inventory mapping from combined multi-temporal and multi sensor data. The results demonstrate that the improved delta NDVI-, PCA-, and ICA-based approaches perform much better than CVA-based CDMRF in terms of completeness, correctness, Kappa coefficient, and F-measures. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that NDVI, PCA, and ICA are integrated with MRF for landslide inventory mapping from multi-sensor data. It is anticipated that this research can be a starting point for developing new change detection techniques that can readily generate quality CDI and for applying advanced machine learning algorithms (e.g., deep learning) to automatic detection of natural hazards from multi-sensor time series data.', '[Lu, Ping; Qin, Yuanyuan] Tongji Univ, Coll Surveying & Geoinformat, Siping Rd 1239, Shanghai, Peoples R China.

This presents a source driven approach since it uses the amount of absorbed light, the main driver of photosynthesis, as a proxy for GPP. Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) estimates obtained from microwave sensors provide an alternative and independent data source to estimate GPP on a global scale, which may complement existing GPP products. Recent studies have shown that VOD is related to aboveground biomass, and that both VOD and temporal changes in VOD relate to GPP. In this study, we build upon this concept and propose a model for estimating GPP from VOD. Since the model is driven by vegetation biomass, as observed through VOD, it presents a carbon sink driven approach to quantify GPP and, therefore, is conceptually different from common source-driven approaches. The model developed in this study uses single frequencies from active or passive microwave VOD retrievals from C-, X- and Ku-band (Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observation (AMSR-E)) to estimate GPP at the global scale. We assessed the ability for temporal and spatial extrapolation of the model using global GPP from FLUXCOM and in situ GPP from FLUXNET. We further performed upscaling of in situ GPP based on different VOD data sets and compared these estimates with the FLUXCOM and MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP products. Our results show that the model developed for individual grid cells using VOD and change in VOD as input performs well in predicting temporal patterns in GPP for all VOD data sets. For spatial extrapolation of the model, however, additional input variables are needed to represent the spatial variability of the VOD-GPP relationship due to differences in vegetation type. As additional input variable, we included the grid cell median VOD (as a proxy for vegetation cover), which increased the model performance during cross validation. Mean annual GPP obtained for AMSR-E X-band data tends to overestimate mean annual GPP for FLUXCOM and MODIS but shows comparable latitudinal patterns. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential of VOD for estimating GPP. The sink-driven approach provides additional information about GPP independent of optical data, which may contribute to our knowledge about the carbon source-sink balance in different ecosystems.', '[Teubner, Irene E.; Forkel, Matthias; Vreugdenhil, Mariette; Moesinger, Leander; Dorigo, Wouter A.] TU Wien, Dept Geodesy & Geoinformat, Gusshausstr 27-29, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.

Providing three-dimensional data at a lower cost, digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) has emerged as an alternative to ALS. Previous studies have compared the utility of ALS and DAP data for predicting forest attributes, however none of those studies used data acquired as part of large-area operational inventories. We used ALS, DAP and field data obtained from 836 plots and five operational inventories conducted in southeastern Norway. We compared local and regional modelling approaches for predicting basal area, number of stems, volume, Lorey\'s mean height, and dominant height. First, we developed district-, forest type-, and data source-specific nonlinear prediction models for all forest attributes (local models). Second, we fitted forest type- and data-source specific nonlinear models with pooled data from all districts (regional models), in which we included dummy variables to account for district-specific effects. We compared the accuracies of ALS- and DAP-based predictions made with local and regional models. Finally, we assessed how a reduced number of calibration plots affected the accuracies of ALS- and DAP-based predictions made with regional models. In general, ALS-based predictions made with local models were most accurate. District-specific effects needed to be accounted for in the regional models. ALS models required substantially fewer calibration plots than DAP models. The accuracies obtained with regional ALS models fitted with 50% of the available data were better than the accuracies obtained with local DAP models fitted with all the available data. Thus, by fitting regional ALS models with data from multiple inventories, field efforts can be reduced substantially while still obtaining better prediction accuracies than by fitting local DAP models.', '[Noordermeer, Lennart; Bollandsas, Ole Martin; Orka, Hans Ole; Naesset, Erik; Gobakken, Terje] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, NMBU, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway.', 'Norwegian University of Life SciencesRP Noordermeer, L (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, NMBU, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway.', 'lennart.noordermeer@nmbu.noRI ; Orka, Hans Ole/A-8142-2014', 'Naesset, Erik/0000-0002-2460-5843; Gobakken, Terje/0000-0001-5534-049X;   Orka, Hans Ole/0000-0002-7492-8608', 'Norwegian Forest Owners\' Trust Fund; Norwegian Forestry Development fund', 'This work was supported by the Norwegian Forest Owners\' Trust Fund and   the Norwegian Forestry Development fund.

Daytime airborne drones or very high-resolution optical satellites are often used to create landslide maps. However, such imagery comes at a high cost, making long-term risk analysis cost-prohibitive. Despite the widespread use of open-access 30 m Landsat imagery, their utility for landslide detection is often limited due to low classification accuracy. One of the major challenges is to separate landslides from other anthropogenic disturbances. Here, we produce landslide maps retrospectively from 1998 to 2017 for landslide-prone and highly populated Taiwan (35,874 km(2)). To improve classification accuracy of landslides, we integrate nighttime light imagery from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), with multi-seasonal daytime optical Landsat time-series, and digital elevation data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). We employed a non-parametric machine-learning classifier, random forest, to classify the satellite imagery. The classifier was trained with data from three years (2005, 2010, and 2015), and was validated with an independent reference sample from twelve years. Our results demonstrated that combining nighttime light data and multi-seasonal imagery significantly improved the classification (p < 0.001), compared to conventional methods based on single-season optical imagery. The results confirmed that the developed classification model enabled mapping of landslides across Taiwan over a long period with annual overall accuracy varying between 96% and 97%, user\'s and producer\'s accuracies between 73% and 86%. Spatiotemporal analysis of the landslide inventories from 1998 to 2017 revealed different temporal patterns of landslide activities, showing those areas where landslides were persistent and other areas where landslides tended to reoccur after vegetation regrowth. In sum, we provide a robust method to detect long-term landslide activities based on freely available satellite imagery, which can be applied elsewhere. Our mapping effort of landslide spatiotemporal patterns is expected to be of high importance in developing effective landslide remediation strategies.', '[Chen, Tzu-Hsin Karen; Sabel, Clive E.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.

The model analytically expresses pCO(2) as the sum of physical (pCO(2),(mix)) and biological (Delta pCO(2,bio)) contributions which are the primary controlling factors associated with the pCO(2 )variability on the LCS. The SSS_sat, derived from a locally calibrated retrieval algorithm, was used in a two-end member river-ocean mixing model to estimate the concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) resulting from physical mixing. The mixing-induced DIC and TA were used together with SST_sat to calculate the pCO(2mix), resulting from the mixing processes at the in situ temperature. The biological uptake of pCO(2) through net community production (Delta pCO(2),(bio)) was derived from a previously validated local Chl-a(_sat) product along with the difference between the pCO(2mix), and the extensive in situ underway pCO(2) data. The satellite-derived pCO(2) agreed with in situ measurements with a median absolute difference of 37 mu atm, mean difference of -5 mu atm, and a root mean square difference of 58 mu atm for five summer cruises spanning 2006-2009. The semi-mechanistic remote sensing model differentiates physical and biological influences on the pCO(2) variability, which will help to better investigate the variability and the underlying controlling mechanisms of pCO(2) and CO2 flux on the LCS. This study demonstrates that the use of locally calibrated satellite products (Chl-a,(_sat), SSS_sat) should be promoted to improve the satellite estimation of pCO(2 )in coastal waters.

Wind speeds are estimated through the inversion of the C-band MODel 5.N (CMOD5.N) backscattering model. Both Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) and Extra Wide Swath (EW) Level 1 products were evaluated for wind fields retrieval at high (5 km) and medium (12.5 km) output spatial resolutions. SSW fields from Sentinel-1 were compared with Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models and in situ data. Exploitation of the LG-Mod provided wind direction with a related marginal error parameter (i.e., ME alpha ROI) which proved useful for selecting the optimal input pixel size of SAR data processing. When compared to in situ data, the selection of the optimal pixel size reduced the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values of LG-Mod wind directions up to 7 degrees and about 45 degrees for Wadden Sea and the Camargue site, respectively. In turn, such reduction provided a decrease of the wind speed RMSE values up to 0.7 m/s and 2.1 m/s, for Wadden Sea and the Camargue site, respectively. In addition, the LG-Mod gave better performance than the global NWP model European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in estimation of wind direction, at 12.5 km output spatial resolution, for both sites. The ME alpha ROI exploitation in the directional analysis of IW and EW products evidenced that at high resolution (5 km) the percentage of reliable wind directions from IW images (84.5%) resulted much larger than that obtained from EW images (30.1%). At medium resolution (12.5 km) instead, the percentage values resulted quite close to each other (99.2% and 86.3%, respectively). IW images proved optimal for high resolution SSW retrieval, whereas EW images suitable for medium resolution. With respect to NWP models, the spectral analysis confirmed the suitability of Sentinel-1 to represent the local wind fields spatial variability in coastal areas, at both high and medium output resolution. Our findings suggest that the combination of the LG-Mod algorithm with NWP models could better resolve spatially wind patterns in complex coastal areas.', '[Rana, Fabio Michele; Adamo, Maria; Blonda, Palma] CNR Inst Atmospher Pollut IIA, Bari, Italy.

As part of the SWOT mission, an airborne analog, AirSWOT, provides spatially-distributed measurements of WSEs for river reaches tens to hundreds of kilometers in length. For the first time, we demonstrate the ability of AirSWOT to consistently measure temporal dynamics in river WSE and slope. We evaluate data from six AirSWOT flights conducted between June 7-22, 2015 along a similar to 90 km reach of the Tanana River, AK. To validate AirSWOT measurements, we compare AirSWOT WSEs and slopes against an in situ network of 12 pressure transducers (PTs). Assuming error-free in situ data, AirSWOT measurements of river WSEs have an overall root mean square difference (RMSD) of 11.8 cm when averaged over 1 km(2) areas while measurements of river surface slope have an RMSD of 1.6 cm/km for reach lengths > 5 km. AirSWOT is also capable of recording accurate river WSE changes between flight dates, with an RMSD of 9.8 cm. Regrettably, observed in situ slope changes that transpired between the six flights are well below AirSWOT\'s accuracy, limiting the evaluation of AirSWOT\'s ability to capture temporal changes in slope. In addition to validating the direct AirSWOT measurements, we compare discharge values calculated via Manning\'s equation using AirSWOT WSEs and slopes to discharge values calculated using PT WSEs and slopes. We define or calibrate the remaining discharge parameters using a combination of in situ and remotely sensed observations, and we hold these remaining parameters constant between the two types of calculations to evaluate the impact of using AirSWOT versus the PT observations of WSE and slope. Results indicate that AirSWOT-derived discharge estimates are similar to the PT-derived discharge estimates, with an RMSD of 13.8%. Additionally, 42% of the AirSWOT-based discharge estimates fall within the PT discharge estimates\' uncertainty bounds. We conclude that AirSWOT can measure multitemporal variations in river WSE and spatial variations in slope with both high accuracy and spatial sampling, providing a compelling alternative to in situ measurements of regional-scale, spatiotemporal fluvial dynamics.', '[Altenau, Elizabeth H.; Pavelsky, Tamlin M.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geol Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.

Mapping the onset, duration, and severity of pollen is difficult, because of insufficient stations and/or monitoring networks at the national and international levels. To address this challenge, we evaluated the spatiotemporal relationship between satellite derived vegetation phenology and in-situ station derived information of pollen season during 2001-2015 at five stations in Canada. First, we calculated annual indicators of start of season (SOS) and start of pollen season (SPS) for birch from Landsat time series and pollen concentration data, respectively, at the five stations. Second, we explored the relationship between derived indicators of SOS and SPS and investigated the scale effect on the relationship. Our results indicate the Landsat based SOS is a good proxy for the indicator of SPS in the birch dominated area. The mean SOS and SPS in the study period are close (within 2.7 days) across the five stations. The interannual variability of SOS and SPS suggests the satellite derived phenology indicator can capture well the dynamics of pollen season in spring. Our analysis also indicates that the annual SOS at a finer resolution (30m) is more consistent with SPS as compared to the indicators derived from coarser resolution satellite observations. This study shows the potential of using fine spatial resolution satellite data (e.g., Landsat) to derive the pollen season indicators, which is important for predicting pollen season severity and risk, and assessment of their impacts on respiratory allergies in urban domains.', '[Li, Xuecao; Zhou, Yuyu; Meng, Lin] Iowa State Univ, Dept Geol & Atmospher Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA.

An inventory of 16,131 offshore platforms at the global scale is established, and then a novel method using the position-invariant characteristic of offshore platforms and the coherent characteristic of the geometric shift among tie-points (i.e. between sensed points from to-be-assessed images and the corresponding OLI-derived reference points) is developed for assessing the geometric accuracy of Landsat and other RS images. The method has been applied to 112,935 Landsat scenes (similar to 1.87% of the entire archive) over oceans. The results indicate an optimal performance of Landsat OLI images (both pre-collection and Collection-1) but a less reliable performance of Landsat TM/ETM + L1TP images. Approximately 50% of TM L1GS and ETM + L1GT images have at least 2 pixels of geometric error.

The focus is on the well-known regularization technique for spherical particles. It is well known that constraints in the range of refractive indices allowed in the inversion are essential, both for the real (m(r)) and imaginary (m(i)) parts, due to the under-determined nature of the problem. Usually these constraints are fixed for a given set of inversions. Using a large database of AERONET retrievals, correlations between retrieved m(r) and m(i) are observed and those correlations together with results from the GOCART model are used to define optimized, case-dependent, constraints in the stand-alone 3 beta + 2 alpha lidar inversion. For each inversion performed, the optimized constraints are computed from the 3 beta + 2 alpha data using a-priori information of extinction-to-backscattered ratio (LA) and the Angstrom exponent computed with a at 355 and 532 nm. The stand-alone 3 beta + 2 alpha lidar inversion with optimized, case-dependent, constraints is applied to airborne NASA LaRC HSRL-2 experimental measurements during DISCOVER-AQ. The optimized constraints selected from the measured 3 beta + 2 alpha are compared with the typing classification based on additional multiwavelength depolarization measurements, showing consistency between aerosol size and absorption range and aerosol typing. Evaluations of the SSA retrieved by the stand-alone 3 beta + 2 alpha lidar inversion with optimized constraints are done by comparisons with correlative airborne in-situ measured SSA. The agreement between both methodologies is satisfactory for most aerosol types as differences are within the uncertainties of each methodology.', '[Perez-Ramirez, Daniel] Univ Granada, Appl Phys Dept, E-18071 Granada, Spain.

The glacial mass budget over large land ice masses can be estimated by remote sensing techniques, but selecting an efficient remote sensing method for recognizing and mapping glacier facies in the Arctic remains a challenge. In this study, we compared several methods of distinguishing the facies of the Vestfonna ice cap, Svalbard, based upon Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and terrestrial high frequency Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) measurements. Glacier zones as determined using the backscattering coefficient (sigma0) of SAR images were compared against GPR data, and an alternative application of Internal Reflection Energy (IRE) calculated from terrestrial GPR data was also used for differentiating the extent of glacier facies. The IRE coefficient was found to offer a suitable method for distinguishing glacier zones and for validating SAR analysis. Furthermore, results of analysis of fully polarimetric Phased Array type L band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS PALSAR) and European Remote Sensing Synthetic Aperture Radar (ERS-2 SAR) images were compared with the IRE coefficient classification. Especially promising method is H-a segmentation, where the glacier zone boundaries corresponded very well with both GPR visual interpretation and IRE classification results. The IRE coefficient\'s simplicity of calculation makes it a good alternative to the subjective GPR visual interpretation method, where results strongly depend on the operator\'s level of experience. We therefore recommend for GPR profiles to be used for additional validation of SAR image analysis in studies of glacier facies on the High Arctic ice masses.', '[Barzycka, Barbara; Blaszczyk, Malgorzata; Grabiec, Mariusz; Jania, Jacek] Univ Silesia Katowice, Fac Earth Sci, Ul Bedzinska 60, PL-41200 Sosnowiec, Poland.', 'University of Silesia in KatowiceRP Barzycka, B (通讯作者)，Univ Silesia Katowice, Fac Earth Sci, Ul Bedzinska 60, PL-41200 Sosnowiec, Poland.', 'bbarzycka@us.edu.pl', 'Barzycka, Barbara/0000-0002-8788-4712; Blaszczyk,   Malgorzata/0000-0002-9702-0440; Jania, Jacek/0000-0002-8531-7394;   Grabiec, Mariusz/0000-0002-1991-3577', 'European Space Agency [C1P.9630]; Centre for Polar Studies, University   of Silesia (the Leading National Research Centre in Earth Sciences),   Sosnowiec, Poland; Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education as   part of the IPY-KINNVIKA field campaign [IPY/279/2006]', 'The authors would like to thank the European Space Agency for providing   the ERS-2 SAR image (Project. no.

However, its performance has not yet been fully evaluated for dense tropical forests with complex structure and very high biomass. Based on the TropiSAR campaign in French Guiana, we explored the challenges of the three most commonly used PolInSAR measures to capture AGB in tropical forests; coherence magnitude, interferometric phase, and backscatter. An improved AGB estimation approach was developed by integrating multiple information derived from single-baseline PolInSAR data. The approach involves ground-volume backscatter decomposition and combines volume backscatter with the retrieved forest height. Volume backscatter from the forest canopy was the best predictor of AGB for tropical forests, whereas the ground backscatter contribution was affected by the complex underlying surface and terrain slope. Both LiDAR- and PolInSAR-derived forest heights showed limited correlation with high AGB due to the varying forest basal area. The linear combination of PolInSAR-derived forest height and volume backscatter complemented each other and produced improved AGB estimates. Comparing three different PolInSAR data pairs, the proposed method produced an AGB map with an average R-2 of 0.7 and RMSE of 34 tons/ha (relative RMSE of 9.4%) at a spatial resolution of 125 x 125 m(2) for biomass between 250-500 tons/ha.', '[Liao, Zhanmang; He, Binbin; Quan, Xingwen; Qiu, Shi; Yin, Changming] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Resources & Environm, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.

The experiment was carried out in Yolo County, California, which has a very diverse irrigated agricultural system dominated by economic crops. For the challenging task of classifying summer crops using Landsat Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series, two types of deep learning models were designed: one is based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and the other is based on one-dimensional convolutional (Conv1D) layers. Three widely-used classifiers were also tested for comparison, including a gradient boosting machine called XGBoost, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. Although LSTM is widely used for sequential data representation, in this study its accuracy (82.41%) and F1 score (0.67) were the lowest among all the classifiers. Among non-deep-learning classifiers, XGBoost achieved the best result with 84.17% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.69. The highest accuracy (85.54%) and F1 score (0.73) were achieved by the Conv1D-based model, which mainly consists of a stack of Conv1D layers and an inception module. The behavior of the Conv1D-based model was inspected by visualizing the activation on different layers. The model employs EVI time series by examining shapes at various scales in a hierarchical manner. Lower Conv1D layers of the optimized model capture small scale temporal variations, while upper layers focus on overall seasonal patterns. Conv1D layers were used as an embedded multi-level feature extractor in the classification model which automatically extracts features from input time series during training. The automated feature extraction reduces the dependency on manual feature engineering and pre-defined equations of crop growing cycles. This study shows that the Conv1D-based deep learning framework provides an effective and efficient method of time series representation in multi-temporal classification tasks.', '[Zhong, Liheng] Dept Water Resources, Sacramento, CA 95814 USA.

Using our fusion method, we produced a continental -scale cropland extent map for North America at 30 m spatial resolution for the nominal year 2010. The total cropland area for North America was estimated at 275.18 million hectares (Mha). The overall accuracies of the map are > 90% across the continent.

As a consequence, many semi-empirical methods aim at inferring SMC from soil reflectance, but very few rely on physically-based models. This article presents a multilayer radiative transfer model of soil reflectance called MARMIT (multilayer radiative transfer model of soil reflectance) as a function of SMC given on a mass basis and a method called MARMITforSMC to estimate it from soil reflectance spectra. This model depicts a wet soil as a dry soil covered with a thin film of water. It is used to assess SMC over seven independent laboratory datasets gathered from the literature. A learning phase is required to link the thickness of the water film with the SMC. For that purpose, a sigmoid function, the parameters of which are related to soil physical and chemical properties such as porosity, grain size and mineralogy composition, is fitted. SMC can be inferred with good accuracy (RMSE approximate to 3%) if the learning step is applied soil by soil. The link between SMC and water thickness actually depends on soil texture and chemical composition. If the soils are divided into classes and if the learning phase is applied to a class, the RMSE slightly increases up to 5%. Finally, MARMITforSMC provides lower RMSE than any other existing semi-empirical or physically-based method.', '[Bablet, A.; Viallefont-Robinet, F.; Fabre, S.; Briottet, X.] Univ Toulouse, ONERA DOTA, 2 Ave Edouard Belin,BP 74025, F-31055 Toulouse 4, France.

LUEgreen in irrigated and rainfed sites were statistically indistinguishable showing low sensitivity to water availability. Seasonal changes of LUEgreen remained remarkably small over a wide range of water supply, leaf area index and weather conditions. The magnitude and composition of incident radiation affected the magnitude of the day-to-day LUEgreen change - increases in incident PAR caused statistically significant decreases of LUEgreen.

The poleward transport of this warm AW is a key component in maintaining a relatively mild climate in the northwestern Europe. Satellite remote sensing datasets from altimetry and the Gravity field and steady state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) mission, in combination with surface drifters, fixed current meter, and hydrographic data are used. The high-resolution mean dynamic topography (MDT) is shown to resolve the time-invariant surface currents in the inflow region. In addition to the improved MDT, we take benefit of the new reprocessed sea level anomaly data in the estimation of absolute dynamic topography. Analysis of the monthly surface velocities from 1993 to 2016 demonstrates significant influence of the large scale atmospheric forcing associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Furthermore, a significant increase in surface velocities along the slope current, front current and the Norwegian Coastal Current are found during winter. Finally, combining altimetry with hydrographic data, we demonstrate that the variability in surface velocities of the inflow region is also reflected in the deeper layers, and that altimetry therefore can be used to monitor the variability of the poleward transport of AW in this region.', '[Raj, Roshin P.; Nilsen, J.

Effective anisotropy (or directional variability) of thermal radiance causes remote sensing (RS) derived urban surface temperatures to vary with RS view angles. Here a new and novel method to resolve effective thermal anisotropy processes from LWIR camera observations is demonstrated at the Comprehensive Outdoor Scale MOdel (COSMO) test site. Pixel-level differences of brightness temperatures reach 18.4 K within one hour of a 24-h study period. To understand this variability, the orientation and shadowing of surfaces is explored using the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model and Blender three-dimensional (3D) rendering software. Observed pixels and the entire canopy surface are classified in terms of surface orientation and illumination. To assess the variability of exitant longwave radiation (M-LW) from the 3D COSMO surface (M-LW(3D)), the observations are prescribed based on class. The parameterisation is tested by simulating thermal images using a camera view model to determine camera perspectives of M-LW(3D) fluxes. The mean brightness temperature differences per image (simulated and observed) are within 0.65 K throughout a 24-h period. Pixel-level comparisons are possible with the high spatial resolution of M(LW)(3D )and DART camera view simulations. At this spatial scale ( < 0.10 m), shadow hysteresis, surface sky view factor and building edge effects are not completely resolved by M-LW(3D). By simulating apparent brightness temperatures from multiple view directions, effective thermal anisotropy of M(LW)(3D )is shown to be up to 6.18 K. The developed methods can be extended to resolve some of the identified sources of sub-facet variability in realistic urban settings. The extension of DART to the interpretation of ground-based RS is shown to be promising.', '[Morrison, William; Kotthaus, Simone; Grimmond, C. S.

Particularly for heterogeneous landscapes this is good news, given the drawback of medium-resolution sensors commonly used for phenology retrieval (e.g., MODIS) to properly represent the fine-scale spatial variability of vegetation types. The Sentinel-2 mission acquires spectral data globally at 10 to 60 m resolution every five days. To illustrate the mission\'s potential for studying vegetation phenology, we retrieved phenological parameters for the Dutch barrier island Schiermonnikoog for a full season of Sentinel-2A observations in 2016. Overlapping orbits resulted in two acquisitions per 10 days, similar to what is achieved globally since the launch of Sentinel-2B. For eight locations on the island\'s salt marsh we compared greenness chromatic coordinate (GCC) series derived from digital repeat RGB-cameras with vegetation index series derived from Sentinel-2 (NDVI and GCC). For each series, a double hyperbolic tangent model was fitted and thresholds were applied to the modelled data to estimate start-, peak-, and end-of-season (SOS/PS/EOS). Variability in Sentinel-2 derived SOS, when taken as the midpoint between minimum and peak NDVI, was well-explained by camera GCC-based SOS (R-2 = 0.74, MSD = 8.0 days, RMSD = 13.0 days). However, EOS estimates from camera GCC series were on average almost two months before NDVI-based estimates. This could partially be explained by the observed exponential relationship between GCC and NDVI, as well as by the combined effect of viewing angle differences and the presence of nonphotosynthetic elements in the vegetation canopy. A two-layer canopy radiative transfer model incorporating reduced chlorophyll levels in the upper layer provided a physically-based explanation of the viewing angle effect. Finally, we applied the phenology retrieval approach to NDVI series for all pixels of the island in order to map spatial patterns of phenology at fine resolution. Our results demonstrate the potential of the Sentinel-2 mission for providing spatially-detailed retrievals of phenology.', '[Vrieling, Anton; Darvishzadeh, Roshanak; Skidmore, Andrew K.; Wang, Tiejun; Zurita-Milla, Raul] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.

In this study, we assess atmospheric correction schemes, including NASA\'s NIR-SWIR approach, Acolite\'s NIR and SWIR approaches and the cloud-shadow approach. We provide the first comprehensive evaluation for Landsat-8 R-rs retrievals in optically shallow coral reefs, along with an investigation of Landsat-8 R-rs products in a temperate turbid embayment. The obtained Landsat-8 R-rs data products are evaluated with concurrent in situ hyperspectral R-rs measurements. Our analyses show that the NASA and the cloud-shadow approaches generated reliable R-rs products across shallow coral reefs and optically deep waters. This evaluation suggests that high quality R-rs products are achievable from the Landsat-8 satellite in optically shallow environments, which supports further application of Landsat-8 type measurements for coral reef studies.', '[Wei, Jianwei; Lee, Zhongping; Garcia, Rodrigo; Zoffoli, Laura; Shang, Zhehai; Sheldon, Patrick; Chen, Robert F.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Environm, Boston, MA 02125 USA.

Under the background of rapid global warming, it is still unclear whether there were significant changes in the extent and intensity of global vegetation browning during the past three decades. Taking satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as the proxy of vegetation growth, we investigated spatiotemporal variances in global vegetation trends during the period 1982-2013 using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method and two piecewise linear regression models. Our study suggests that increasing global vegetation browning is masked by overall vegetation greening. A > 60% increase in browning area was found during the study period, and the results consistently indicate that the expansion of browning trends has accelerated since 1994. After the late 1990s, browning trends increased in all latitudinal bands in the Northern Hemisphere. This increase was particularly pronounced in the northern mid-low latitudes, where the greening trends stalled or even reversed. Areas with browning trends increased in all land cover types, although the increase processes varied substantially. During 1982-2013, although most vegetated lands exhibited overall greening trends, greening-to-browning reversals occurred on all continents and occupied a much larger area than browning-to-greening reversals. Greening trends prevailed before the turning points, and browning trends largely expanded and enhanced thereafter. The increased browning trends resulted in a slowdown of the increase in global mean NDVI since the early 1990s. Since drought is likely the main cause of the increasing browning trends, global vegetation growth is at risk of reversal from long-term greening to long-term browning in the warmer future.', '[Pan, Naiqing; Feng, Xiaoming; Fu, Bojie; Wang, Shuai] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.

A method called \"spectranomics\" that maps the diversity of forest species based on species-driven leaf optical traits using imaging spectroscopy has been developed for tropical forests in earlier studies. In this study we applied the \"spectranomics\" method in combination with airborne hyperspectral (PHI-3 sensor with 1 m spatial resolution) and LiDAR ( > 4 points/m(2)) data to first identify interspecies variations in biochemical and structural properties of trees and then estimate the tree species diversity within the Shennongjia Forest Nature Reserve in China. Firstly, we used the watershed algorithm based on morphological crown control to isolate individual tree crowns (ITCs) from the LiDAR data. For each ITC, we then calculated seven vegetation indices (VIs) representing key biochemical properties from the hyperspectral data and additionally derived the LiDAR-based tree height which was identified to support the discrimination of the tree species in a preceding analysis. Finally we utilized the combination of the seven selected VIs and tree height as input to a self-adaptive Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm. The FCM algorithm was applied to fixed subsets of 30 m x 30 m and it was assumed that the number of clusters identified within a subset represents the number of occurring species. The species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity index calculated from the clustering outputs correlated well with the field reference data (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.25). The results show that forest species diversity can be directly predicted using the suggested clustering method based on crown-by-crown variations in biochemical and structural properties in the examined subtropical forest without the need to distinguish the individual tree species.', '[Zhao, Yujin; Zeng, Yuan; Zheng, Zhaoju; Dong, Wenxue; Zhao, Dan; Wu, Bingfang; Zhao, Qianjun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Key Lab Digital Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

The \"mark\" in the MPP represents the object being sought. Unlike most applications of MPP to object recognition, the mark used in our algorithm is computed from a 3D geometrical optical model artificially lit using the same illumination parameters as the image itself. Because trees differ in size, the process also incorporates a tree crown radius variable. The algorithm is tested on four sub-meter satellite images, each in a different environment. Validation was performed on both detection and delineation. The detection was based on tree crown counting and yielded an accuracy ranging from 0.81 to 0.95 for the four images.

Within the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), a model commonly used to describe soil erosion, the vegetation cover for grassland is expressed in the cover and management factor (C-factor). The site-specific C-factor is a combination of the relative erosion susceptibility of a particular plant development stage (here expressed as soil loss ratio SLR) and the corresponding rainfall pattern (here expressed as R-factor ratio). Thus, for grasslands the fraction of green vegetation cover (FGVC) determines the SLRs. Although Switzerland is a country dominated by grassland with high percentages of mountainous regions and evidence for high erosion rates of grassland exists, soil erosion risk modeling of grasslands and especially of mountainous grasslands in Switzerland is restricted to a few studies. Here, we present a spatio-temporal approach to assess the dynamics of the C-factor for Swiss grasslands and to identify erosion prone regions and seasons simultaneously. We combine different satellite data, aerial data, and derivative products like Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Land Cover, Swissimage false-color infrared (Swissimage FCIR), PROBA-V Fraction of green Vegetation Cover (FCover300m), and MODIS Vegetation Indices 16-Day L3 Global (MOD13Q1) for the FGVC mapping of grasslands.

The spatially derived results are then fused with the 10-day deviations of temporal FGVC derived by FCover300m. Following the original RUSLE approach, the combined FGVC are transformed to SLRs and weighted with high spatiotemporal resolved ratios of R-factors to result in spatio-temporal C-factors for Swiss grasslands. The annual average C-factor of all Swiss grasslands is 0.012. Seasonal and regional patterns (low C in winter, high C in summer, dependency on elevation) are recognizable in the spatio-temporal mapping approach. They are mainly explicable by the R-factor distribution within a year. Knowledge about the spatio-temporal dynamic of erosion triggering factors is of high interest for agronomists who can introduce areal and time specific selective erosion control measures and thereby reduce the direct costs of mitigation as well as erosion measures.', '[Schmidt, Simon; Alewell, Christine; Meusburger, Katrin] Univ Basel, Environm Geosci, Bernoullistr 30, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.

Yatsugatake, central Japan. The BRDF feature (strong/weak reflections in a backward/forward scattering areas) is related closely to the 3D structure and biophysical parameters of forests. However, because of the difficulty of observations, observational BRDF data of mature forests are scarce, except for those of Boreal Ecosystem -Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). We made BRDF observations 10 times during 2007 to ascertain BRDF characteristics in each season. For comparison to these BRDF data, a semi-empirical BRDF model (Ross-thick-Li sparse kernel model) was introduced. This model can reproduce the BRDF data fairly well under identical solar conditions in each season. Then, seasonal changes of the vegetation structure and possible relations with BRDF were discussed. They are summarized as follows: (1) The forest BRDF changes distinctly and seasonally depending on the phenology. (2) The forest BRDF is influenced primarily by clarity of the geometrical profile on the forest surface, which is affected by shadow. However, the forest BRDF might be influenced by other factors such as the physiological characteristics of leaves and slight change of vegetation structure such as forest floor conditions and leaf angles during summer. (3) Features of forest BRDF must therefore appear during summer when the crown shape is distinctive. Furthermore, BRDF features appear distinctly as seasons progress, e.g., by autumn leaves and defoliation, when the unevenness of forests increases. These findings can promote monitoring of vegetation using multi-angular satellite observations.', '[Hasegawa, Kouiti] Komazawa Univ, Sr High Sch, Dept Sci, Setagaya Ku, 1-17-12 KamiYoga, Tokyo 1588577, Japan.

Although data from the long running Landsat earth observation program (1972-present) have been previously utilized to characterize forest canopy cover, the variability in spatial and spectral resolutions between the Landsat sensors has generally limited analyses to readily comparable imagery from the TM and ETM + sensors, which omits large portions of the full temporal record. In this study, we present an R package, LandsatLinkr, which automates the processes for harmonizing Landsat MSS and OLI imagery to the spatial and spectral qualities of TM and ETM + imagery, allowing for the generation of annual cloud-free composites of tasseled cap spectral indices across the entire Landsat archive. We demonstrate the utility of LandsatLinkr products, further enhanced through the LandTrendr segmentation algorithm, for characterizing forest attributes through time by developing annual forest masks and maps of estimated canopy cover for the state of Minnesota from 1973 to 2015. The forest mask model had an overall accuracy of 87%, with omission and commission errors for the forest class of 17% and 10%, respectively, and 9% and 16% for non-forest classification. Our resulting maps depicted a significant positive trend in forest cover across all ecological provinces of Minnesota during the study period. A random forest model used to predict continuous canopy cover had a pseudo R-2 of 0.75, with a cross validation RMSE of 5%.

This paper demonstrates an approach that integrates ecological coral habitat mapping with empirical modelling to map the geomorphic zonation and benthic composition of the \"shallow offshore reefs\" of the GBR, using the Capricorn Bunker Group (CBG) as a case study. The approach combined environmental data sets and geo-ecological rule sets to identify geomorphic zones. The benthic composition of individual geomorphic zones was mapped for: shallow reef flat zones, using object-based image analysis with context driven rules based on coral reef ecology; and reef slope zones, using levels of wave exposure to predict the distribution of coral types. The environmental data sets used were field-based benthic composition data, Landsat 8 OLI satellite image-derived bottom reflectance, water depth and slope (15m x 15m pixel size) data, reef impact data, and modelled wave exposure. The study showed that the combination of geomorphic-ecological rules and models with remote sensing imagery provided robust mapping results over a large (similar to 2500 km(2)) reef system, of which 245 km(2) was mapped as shallow coral reefs and 88 km(2) of that was mapped as areas containing coral. Most importantly, the method produced defined the geomorphic zones and benthic composition of a study area that is significantly larger than the majority of coral reef remote sensing mapping projects previously published. With some modifications, the methods presented have the potential to be applied to the full extent of the shallow offshore reefs of the GBR, or any large reef globally. Monitoring and management of coral reefs for conservation and other purposes, at regional to global scales will benefit from the ability to produce and use this type of essential information on a regular basis.', '[Roelfsema, Chris; Kovacs, Eva; Phinn, Stuart] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Remote Sensing Res Ctr, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.

Although their value is now appreciated by the hydrological community, they are still limited by their uncertainties and their inability to close the water budget. In a previous study, we optimally integrated several datasets for each component (precipitation, evapotranspiration, storage change and discharge) to close this budget at a basin scale. Furthermore, an independent and simple calibration of each satellite dataset was designed to reduce the budget residual. In this paper, we extend the calibration procedure to the global scale. Pixels are first classified into surface types characterized by their NDVI and net precipitation values. We show that the global calibration transforms the original datasets towards a consensus that is hydrologically more coherent, with a budget residual reduced by 26%. The calibrated datasets are compared to ground-based observations, showing an improvement for more than 65% of the sites tested. This opens new perspectives to generate long-term datasets at global scale based purely on all available satellites observations, which describe all the terrestrial water components useful for climate purposes. Beyond the simple calibration presented here, inconsistencies among the various satellite datasets can be used as a proxy for satellite observation uncertainties. The quality of our calibration procedure is constrained by the availability of discharge measurements, and could therefore be improved in the future, as discharge measurement networks become more extensive.', '[Munier, S.; Aires, F.] Observ Paris, Estellus, 61 Ave Observ, F-74014 Paris, France.

One persistent drawback that prevents user communities from effectively and objectively using these data products more broadly, is the absence of thorough and transparent validation studies. This study develops a validation framework for accuracy assessment of multi temporal built-up land layers using integrated public parcel and building records as validation data. The framework is based on measures derived from confusion matrices and incorporates a sensitivity analysis for potential spatial offsets between validation and test data as well as tests for the effects of varying criteria of the abstract term built-up land on accuracy measures. Furthermore, the framework allows for accuracy assessments by strata of built-up density, which provides important insights on the relationship between classification accuracy and development intensity to better instruct and educate user communities on quality aspects that might be relevant to different purposes. We use data from the newly-released Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL), for four epochs since 1975 and at fine spatial resolution (38 m), in the United States for a demonstration of the framework. The results show very encouraging accuracy measures that vary across study areas, generally improve over time but show very distinct patterns across the rural-urban trajectories. Areas of higher development intensity are very accurately classified and highly reliable. Rural areas show low degrees of accuracy, which could be affected by misalignment between the reference data and the data under test in areas where built-up land is scattered and rare. However, a regression analysis, which examines how well GHSL can estimate built-up land using spatially aggregated analytical units, indicates that classification error is mainly of thematic nature. Thus, caution should be taken in using the data product in rural regions. The results can be useful in further improving classification procedures to create measures of the built environment. The validation framework can be extended to data-poor regions of the world using map data and Volunteered Geographic Information.', '[Leyk, Stefan; Uhl, Johannes H.] Univ Colorado, Dept Geog, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.

The inversion also provides estimates of model parameters describing the microwave attenuation within the canopy and the relative scattering contributions from canopy and soil surface.   Here, we investigate how vegetation characteristics including biomass, water content (VWC) and canopy structure are related to these parameters and provide a first assessment of the potential of estimating such characteristics using Pol-InSAR time series in L-, C- and X-Bands.   The overall attenuation for maize is positively related to total VWC in L- and C-Bands. Furthermore, larger attenuation in W than HH points toward the existence of anisotropic propagation effects due to vertical orientation of the stalks.   Conversely, for wheat in C- and X-Bands there is no consistent relation between attenuation loss and VWC. Rather, structural changes occurring within the plant growth cycle appear to have an appreciable polarization dependent effect on the observed attenuation changes.   In addition, the estimated normalized volume backscattering power NVP (a measure of the relative scattering contribution from the canopy compared to the underlying soil) is associated with wet biomass. However, the contrasting sign of this relation (negative for maize in L- and C-Bands; positive for wheat in C- and X-Bands) indicates again the role of crop structural properties in the Pol-InSAR measurements. For instance, the NVP for maize in L- and C-Bands appears to decrease with increasing biomass due to the increasingly important double bounce ground-stalk scattering contribution as plants become taller and thicker.   Overall, these results indicate the sensitivity of the Pol-InSAR parameters to canopy structure and biomass; this sensitivity is however dependent, amongst others, on crop type and radar frequency. When choosing an appropriate baseline/frequency configuration, the Pol-InSAR attenuation loss and NVP may complement the information of the estimated crop height, especially if the latter shows very little variation over the plant growth cycle (e.g. as for wheat).', '[Pichierri, Manuele; Rabus, Bernhard] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Engn Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.

New satellite sensors involving a high number of improved time, space and wavelength resolutions give rise to challenging computational problems. Standard physical inversion techniques cannot cope efficiently with this new scenario. Dealing with land cover classification of the new image sources has also turned to be a complex problem requiring large amount of memory and processing time. In order to cope with these problems, statistical learning has greatly helped in the last years to develop statistical retrieval and classification models that can ingest large amounts of Earth observation data. Kernel methods constitute a family of powerful machine learning algorithms, which have found wide use in remote sensing and geosciences. However, kernel methods are still not widely adopted because of the high computational cost when dealing with large scale problems, such as the inversion of radiative transfer models or the classification of high spatial spectral -temporal resolution data. This paper introduces to the remote sensing community an efficient kernel method for fast statistical retrieval of atmospheric and biophysical parameters and image classification problems. We rely on a recently presented approximation to shift-invariant kernels using projections on random Fourier features. The method proposes an explicit mapping function defined through a set of projections randomly sampled from the Fourier domain. It is proved to approximate the implicit mapping of a kernel function. This allows to deal with large-scale data but taking advantage of kernel methods. The method is simple, computationally very efficient in both memory and processing costs, and easily parallelizable. We show that kernel regression and classification is now possible for datasets with millions of samples. Examples on atmospheric parameter retrieval from hyperspectral infrared sounders like IASI/Metop; large scale emulation and inversion of the familiar PROSAIL radiative transfer model on Sentinel-2 data; and the identification of clouds over landmarks in time series of MSG/Seviri images show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed technique.

Instead of relying on distributed technologies, such as clustering or High-performance Computing (HPC), the SARIPA processor is designed to run on a single computer equipped with multiple GPUs. To exploit the computational power of the latter, while retaining a high level of hardware portability, SARIPA is written using the Open Computing Language (OpenCL) framework rather than the more widespread Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). This allows the application to exploit both GPUs and CPUs without requiring any code modification or duplication. A further level of optimization is achieved thanks to a software architecture, which mimics a distributed computing environment, although implemented on a single machine. SARIPA\'s performance is demonstrated on ENVISAT ASAR Stripmap imagery, for which a real-time performance of 8.5 s is achieved, and on Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wideswath (IW) raw data products, for which a near-real time processing time of about 1 min is required. Such a performance has the potential of significantly reducing the storage requirements for wide-area monitoring applications, by avoiding the need of maintaining large permanent archives of Level 1 (focused) imagery, in favor of lighter Level 0 (raw) products, which can be focused on-the-fly within the user\'s application processing pipelines at almost no overhead.

The MFmask algorithm, built upon the success of the Fmask algorithm (Zhu and Woodcock, 2012; Zhu et al., 2015), is designed for cloud and cloud shadow detection in mountainous areas, where the Fmask algorithm is not performing well. The inputs of the MFmask algorithm include Landsat Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, Brightness Temperature (BT), and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). Compared to Fmask, MFmask can separate water and land pixels better in mountainous areas with the aid of DEMs. Moreover, MFmask produces better cloud detection results than Fmask in mountainous areas after BT is linearly normalized by DEMs. To provide more accurate cloud shadow detection in mountainous areas, MFmask uses a double-projection approach to better predict cloud shadow shape on slope side. Additionally, MFmask applies a topographic correction to remove terrain shadows and estimates cloud base height with neighboring clouds. Both will reduce the possibility of cloud and cloud shadow mismatch and increase cloud shadow detection accuracy for places with large topographic gradient. To test the performance of the proposed MFmask algorithm, a total of 67 Landsat images acquired in mountainous areas from different parts of the world were selected for assessing the accuracy of cloud detection, in which 15 of them were used for assessing the accuracy of cloud shadow detection. Compared with Fmask, MFmask can provide substantial improvements in cloud and cloud shadow detection accuracies for places with large topographic gradient and also work well for relatively flat terrain.

In ecological studies, intensity of use has been assessed by means of three indicators: i) mowing frequency, ii) grazing intensity, and iii) fertilization input. A multidimensional approach is key for the understanding of intensification effects in terrestrial and water ecosystems. Remote sensing is a powerful tool to monitor management indicators. Nevertheless, interdependencies between remote sensing methods and between indicators require new approaches to assess intensity of use. The objective of this study is to monitor ecological indicators of land use intensity based on multispectral imagery using a multidimensional approach. We performed a multi-temporal analysis using a series of RapidEye images within a growing season in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland, in 2013. We defined mowing frequency classes distinguishing spectral changes between pairs of images. The analysis of the whole image sequence within the growing season helped differentiate grazing intensities. Furthermore, we analysed the suitability of modelled livestock density based on remote sensing derived products to determine fertilizer input. Three grassland management practices were distinguished: i) medium intensive (46%), ii) low intensive (37%), and iii) high intensive (17%). We discuss the combination of high mowing frequency and fields with high grazing intensity to define areas prone to nutrient surpluses. Finally, we demonstrate that the estimation of interrelated indicators of grassland use intensity could be carried out preserving independence between methods.

Although \"external\" usually means spatially or geographically external, it could also be used in the temporal sense that the model is constructed using data whose dates are temporally external to the dates of the data to which the model is applied. This study focuses on assessing the effects of such temporally external application data on model-based inference using remotely sensed auxiliary information. The study area was in Burkina Faso, and the variable of interest was firewood volume (m(3)/ha). A sample of 160 field plots was selected from the population and measured, and auxiliary datasets from Landsat 8 were acquired. Models were fit using weighted least squares; the population mean, mu, was estimated; and the variance of the population mean,Var((mu) over cap), was estimated using both an analytical variance estimator, <(<(V)over cap>)over bar>(mu) over cap (an), and an empirical bootstrap estimator, V (mu) over cap (boot). The estimates, (mu) over cap and (Var) over cap(mu) over cap, were compared for models constructed using calibration and application data of the same date and models constructed using calibration and application data whose dates differed. The primary results were twofold. First, for cases for which the dates of the model calibration and application data were the same, (mu) over cap, <(<(V)over cap>)over bar>(mu) over cap (an), V (mu) over cap (boot) and (Bias) over cap(mu) over cap were similar across datasets. These results suggest that the particular date of the dataset from which the calibration and application data are obtained may be mostly arbitrary assuming the relation between the dependent and independent variables does not change over time. Second, for a model for which the calibration and application data were obtained from temporally different datasets, (mu) over cap (an), V (mu) over cap (boot), and (Bias) over cap(mu) over cap were all greater than when the calibration and application data were not temporally different. Further, the criterion for screening candidate models must be based on estimation of (mu) over cap and (Var) over cap(mu) over cap rather than the model prediction accuracy or goodness of fit. The adverse effects of differing dates for the calibration and application data were exacerbated as the difference in dates increased. Finally, because the temporal differences also affected the analytical variance calculation, the bootstrapping procedure is recommended. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This paper describes a methodology used to create spectral similarity water indices (SWIs) to accurately retrieve leaf water content based on the similarity between the leaf reflectance spectra and the specific water absorption spectrum. The abilities of six common distance metrics to capture spectral features were tested using two in situ datasets (LOPEX93 and PANAMA) and one simulation dataset (PROSPECT). These three datasets were also used to determine the most appropriate spectral intervals and to verify the performance of SWIs against six frequently used spectral indices that were specifically designed to estimate vegetation water content. Our results demonstrate that the Spectral Angle Cosine (SAC) is the most effective metric to capture useful spectral information pertinent to the equivalent water thickness (EWT), and three spectral intervals (9701150, 1330-1350 and 1584-1760 nm) are suitable for the retrieval of leaf water content. The SWIs were then created based on the SAC distances in these three spectral intervals respectively. The results demonstrate that SWISAC indices are better indicators of leaf water content and more tolerant to species differences than the six spectral indices, including the Shortwave Angle Normalized Index (SANI), Shortwave Angle Slope Index (SASI), Moisture Stress Index (MSI), Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Maximum Difference Water Index (MDWI). In addition, the most accurate estimates of EWT were achieved from a single SAC distance with nRMSE of 4.08% ((R) over bar (2) = 0.98), 3.63% ((R) over bar (2) = 0.95) and 8.11% ((R) over bar (2) = 0.80) for PROSPECT, LOPEX93 and PANAMA, respectively. Models that combine two SAC distances from the near-infrared and shortwave infrared regions produce an even better overall performance. Spectral similarity metrics may be a new effective tool to capture useful spectral information pertinent to leaf biochemical components, not only EWT but also other components such as chlorophyll and nitrogen content and they have potential to be adapted to canopy level observations.

Two sky cameras are con-figured to take High Dynamic Range (HDR) images at Granada and Valladolid (Spain). Some properties of the cameras, like effective wavelengths, sky coordinates of each pixel and pixel sensitivity, are characterized. After that, normalized camera radiances at lunar almucantar points (up to 20 degrees in azimuth from the Moon) are obtained at three effective wavelengths from the HDR images. These normalized radiances are compared in different case studies to simulations fed with AERONET aerosol information, giving satisfactory results. The obtained uncertainty of normalized camera radiances is around 10% at 533 nm and 608 nm and 14% for 469 nm. Normalized camera radiances and six spectral aerosol optical depth values (obtained from lunar photometry) are used as input in GRASP code (Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties) to retrieve aerosol properties for a dust episode over Valladolid. The retrieved aerosol properties (refractive indices, fraction of spherical particles and size distribution parameters) are in agreement with the nearest diurnal AERONET products. The calculated GRASP retrieval at night time shows an increase in coarse mode concentration along the night, while fine mode properties remained constant. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) can be used to derive unbiased and non-destructive estimates of tree structure and volume and can, therefore, be used to address key uncertainties in forest AGB estimates. Here we review our experience of TLS sampling strategies from 27 campaigns conducted over the past 5 years, across tropical and temperate forest plots, where data was captured with a RIEGL VZ-400 laser scanner. The focus is on strategies to derive Geometrical Modelling metrics (e.g. tree volume) over forest plots (>= 1 ha) which require the accurate co-registration of 10s to 100s of individual point clouds. We recommend a 10 m x 10 m sampling grid as an approach to produce a point cloud with a uniform point distribution, that can resolve higher order branches (down to a few cm in diameter) towards the top of 30+ m canopies and can be captured in a timely fashion i.e. (similar to)3-6 days per ha. A data acquisition protocol, such as presented here, would facilitate data interoperability and inter-comparison of metrics between instruments/groups, from plot to plot and over time.

Satellite remote sensing is the most effective method of measuring LST at regional and global scales. Satellite thermal infrared (TIR) measurements are widely used to retrieve LST with high accuracy and high spatial resolution but are limited to cloud-free conditions due to their inability to penetrate clouds. By contrast, satellite passive microwave (PMW) measurements are capable of penetrating clouds and providing data regardless of the cloud conditions. However, PMW measurements have limitations, such as a low spatial resolution and low temperature retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, temperature retrieval from PMW measurements yields the subsurface temperature, which differs from the LST retrieved from TIR measurements (skin temperature). This study proposes a framework for the retrieval of all-weather LST at a high spatial resolution by combining the advantages of TIR and PMW measurements. Compared to the MODIS LST product, the all-weather LST reflects the spatial variations in LST accurately. In situ LST measurements at four sites in an arid area of northwest China were used to evaluate the accuracy of the all-weather LST. The root mean square error of the LST under cloud-free conditions was approximately 2 K, whereas that of the LST under cloudy conditions varied from 3.5 K to 4.4 K. The results indicate that the all-weather LST retrieval algorithm can provide an IST dataset with reasonable accuracy and a high spatial resolution under clear and cloudy conditions.

In this study, a two-step modeling approach was used to map the type and timing of forest disturbances occurring between 1984 and 2010 in ten Landsat scenes located in diverse forest systems of the conterminous U.S. In step one, Random Forest (RF) models were developed to predict the presence of five forest disturbance agents (conversion, fire, harvest, stress and wind) and stable (i.e. undisturbed) forest. Models were developed using a suite of predictors including spectral change metrics derived from a nonparametric shape-restricted spline fitting algorithm, as well as several topographic and biophysical variables which potentially influence the initiation and/or spread of forest disturbance agents. Step two involved applying a rule-based model to the spectrally-based shape parameters (e.g. shape type, year and duration) to assign a year to the disturbance types and locations predicted in step one. Out of bag (OOB) predictions from RF showed that across the ten scenes, overall agreement was highest when only causal agent was considered (avg = 80%, min = 69%, max = 86%), and was lowest when both agent and year (within 1 of the reference date) were required to be correct (avg = 71%, min = 56%, max = 80%). Across scene omission and commission errors for fire and stable forest classes were mostly around 10% to 20%, respectively. Harvests were also modeled well, as five of nine test scenes had error rates <26%. Accuracy of the wind and stress classes were much more variable with model errors ranging from 24% to 88%. The years assigned by the rule-based model were reasonably accurate, as 88% of all disturbances were assigned a year that fell within 2 years of the reference date. Fire disturbances were assigned the correct year 78% of the time, followed by harvest (69%) and conversion (54%). Although 17% and 63% of wind and stress disturbances were under-estimated by S or more years, the impact on overall accuracy was nominal given these two classes only accounted for roughly 5% of all disturbances. Our results also revealed that causal agent models summarized to broader disturbed/not disturbed classes were as accurate as models specifically constructed to predict binary disturbance, thus there appears to be no advantage to modeling disturbance prior to assigning causality. A relative evaluation of mean decrease in accuracy from RF showed that although a wide range of predictor variables contributed to the successful modeling of causal agents and stable forest (e.g. patch metrics, forest occurrence, and topography), disturbance variables (e.g. MTBS) and spectral change metrics (e.g. absolute and relative magnitude) were by far the most important. Modeled causality maps and annual disturbance rates were examined and found to be in good agreement with existing literature and other published data sets. Lastly, results are used to make recommendations for mapping forest disturbance agents nationally across the U.S. Published by Elsevier Inc.', '[Schroeder, Todd A.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Southern Res Stn, Knoxville, TN 37919 USA.

In particular, the high spectral resolution of imaging spectrometry could improve the discrimination of materials that have similar spectral signatures but are functionally dissimilar, such as turfgrass and trees. However, the amount of reflected energy needed to measure narrow-band reflectance with acceptable signal-to-noise ratios means that space-borne imaging spectrometry data will be collected at relatively coarse spatial resolutions, potentially limiting its usefulness for mapping urban composition. In this study, we use Airborne Visible Infra-Red Imaging Spectrometer-Classic and -Next Generation imaging spectrometry acquired in the summer of 2014 over the Santa Barbara, California area to quantify sub-pixel urban composition at fine (4 m) and coarse (18 m) spatial resolutions. We develop and compare spectral libraries of single- and multiple-resolution endmembers, and use Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis to estimate sub-pixel fractions of spectrally dissimilar materials (vegetation, impervious, pervious) as well as pairs of spectrally similar materials (turfgrass and tree, paved and roof, non-photosynthetic vegetation and soil) at both resolutions. Fractions were validated using 1 m orthophotography. Overall, fractional accuracy was affected by the spatial resolution of the spectral library and image, and the (dis)similarity of the measured classes. Spectral libraries of multiple-resolution endmembers performed better than single-resolution libraries, likely because they increase within-class variance by capturing multiple levels of material variability that occur across spatial scales. A positive relationship was observed between pixel size and the number of sub-pixel materials, however significant pixel mixing occurred at 4 m resolution, with an average of 48% of all pixels modeled by more than one endmember. Fractional estimates produced by the best performing libraries at 4 m and 18 m resolution correlated with validation fractions, with mean R-2 > 0.89 for spectrally dissimilar classes and mean R-2 > 0.76 for spectrally similar classes. These results demonstrate the scalability of fractional estimates of urban materials using imaging spectrometry, suggesting its potential for future global urban analyses. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Such knowledge is particularly needed in tropical regions where past and current disturbance rates have been high but regeneration is rapid. Focusing on three areas in the Brazilian Amazon (Manaus, Santarem, Machadinho d\'Oeste), this study aimed to evaluate the use of single-date Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data in the 2007-2010 period for i) discriminating mature forest, non-forest and secondary forest, and ii) retrieving the age of secondary forests (ASF), with 100 to x 100 m training areas obtained by the analysis of an extensive time-series of Landsat sensor data over the three sites. A machine learning algorithm (random forests) was used in combination with ALOS PALSAR backscatter intensity at HH and HV polarizations and Landsat 5 TM surface reflectance in the visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared spectral regions. Overall accuracy when discriminating mature forest, non-forest and secondary forest is high (95-96%), with the highest errors in the secondary forest class (omission and commission errors in the range 4-6% and 12-20% respectively) because of misclassification as mature forest. Root mean square error (RMSE) and bias when retrieving ASF ranged between 4.3-4.7 years (relative RMSE = 25.5-32.0%) and 0.04-0.08 years respectively. On average, unbiased ASF estimates can be obtained using the method proposed here (Wilcoxon test, p-value > 0.05). However, the bias decomposition by 5-year interval ASF classes showed that most age estimates are biased, with consistent overestimation in secondary forests up to 10-15 years of age and underestimation in secondary forests of at least 20 years of age. Comparison with the classification results obtained from the analysis of extensive time-series of Landsat sensor data showed a good agreement, with Pearson\'s coefficient of correlation (R) of the proportion of mature forest, non-forest and secondary forest at 1-km grid cells ranging between 0.97-0.98, 0.96-0.98 and 0.84-0.90 in the 2007-2010 period, respectively. The agreement was lower (R = 0.82-0.85) when using the same dataset to compare the ability of ALOS PALSAR and Landsat 5 TM data to retrieve ASF. This was also dependent on the study area, especially when considering mapping secondary forest and retrieving ASF, with Manaus displaying better agreement when compared to the results at Santarem and Machadinho d\'Oeste.

To further this understanding at a landscape level or global scale, accurate remote sensing of photosynthetic light-use efficiency (LUE) is required to understand photosynthetic down-regulation and environmental constraints to plant photosynthesis. The past decade has seen advances in detecting both leaf-and canopy-level physiological stress behaviours using the photochemical reflectance index (PRI), a narrow-waveband normalized difference index that relates LUE to a xanthophyll-induced absorption feature at 531 nm. To date, however, much of this research has occurred using top of canopy measurements, while our understanding of the vertical distribution of LUE within the crown is limited. In this study, we demonstrate an approach which could be used to scale photosynthetic behaviour of vegetation vertically and horizontally using estimates of vertical canopy structure obtained from terrestrial Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data to predict proportions of shaded and sunlit canopy which are then linked to predictions of LUE. We apply the approach over a mature Aspen study site located in central Saskatchewan, Canada utilising full-waveform LiDAR data provided by the ground-based laser scanner system and canopy spectra obtained by the AMSPEC II spectro-radiometer. Agreement between predictions of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) using the developed approach compared to independent observations was highly significant at hourly intervals (R-2 = 0.80, p < 0.01) under clear sky conditions. A range of LUE vertical profiles for different stand structures across the growing season were developed providing estimations of how crown structure can impact LUE vertically in the crown. We conclude with a recommendation for ongoing research to verify these types of trends using concurrently acquired, independently derived leaf LUE from photosynthesis light-response curves, and forest structure variation from LiDAR, to provide a more exact quantification of these patterns.

However, due to the lack of timely available satellite datasets and the inherent noise in time series, little attention has been paid to real-time and short-term predictions of vegetation phenology. The successful launch of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument onboard operational Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite makes this research possible because it can provide land surface observations in a timely fashion. This study introduces an operational system that provides real-time and short-term predictions of vegetation phenology. Specifically, the system integrates timely available VIIRS observations and the climatology (expectation and standard deviation) of vegetation phenology from long-term MODIS data to simulate a set of potential temporal trajectories of greenness development at a given time for each pixel. These potential trajectories are then applied to identify spring green leaf development in real time, predict the occurrence of greenup onset, mid-greenup phase and maturity onset, and analyze the uncertainty of the prediction across a variety of ecosystems in North America. The accuracy of real-time and short-term predictions was evaluated by comparing with standard VIIRS detections and near-surface PhenoCam observations in both 2014 and 2015 across North America. The results showed that the real-time prediction of spring phenological metrics from VIIRS were all significantly correlated with those derived from PhenoCam datasets (R-2> 0.96, P< 0.01) and closely comparable to the standard VIIRS detections with a mean absolute difference of <10 days, 5 days and 5 days in greenup onset, mid-greenup phase and maturity onset, respectively. The mean absolute difference in the northern region for all three events was relatively smaller than that in the southern region. These findings demonstrate the capability of VIIRS observations to effectively predict temporal dynamics of vegetation phenology in real time at a continental scale. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, limitations in the range of UAV operations hinder their use in large scale applications. Use of partial-coverage UAV data in combination with field plots may increase precision of field-based estimates of forest resource parameters and may offer a cost-effective alternative to wall-to-wall acquisition. In this study, data from UAV collected in systematically distributed blocks and combined with field plots in a two-phase design with hybrid inference (UAV(HYB)) were used to estimate mean volume and its precision (standard error) for a 7330 ha forest area in Norway. Because in UAV(HYB) the field data do not necessarily need to come from a probability sample, the approach offers great flexibility in field data collection. The estimate of precision using UAV(HYB) was compared to two alternative inventory approaches differing in terms of sampling design and mode of inference, i.e., (1) single-phase probabilistic sampling relying only on field samples for which the design-based approach to inference using simple random sampling estimators was adopted (FIELDDB) and (2) a model-based approach independent from design assumptions for which wall-to-wall airborne laser scanning data were applied (ALS(MB)). Relative efficiency (RE), calculated as the ratio between the estimated variances of two different inventory approaches, was used as measure for improvement in variance for one approach over the other. Comparison of UAVHYB against FIELDDB revealed that the use of the former was up to four times more efficient than the latter (RE = 4.4). This translates to a need for 4.4 times as many field plots under simple random sampling for a FIELDDB estimate to be equally precise as the UAV(HYB) estimate. For ALS(MB) the increase in efficiency compared to UAV(HYB) was limited (RE = 1.6). The study also demonstrated that the precision under UAV(HYB) can be improved when including additional field data from other inventories to enhance the model. Cost estimates for each inventory approach were compared, revealing that UAV may be a cost-effective tool for large scale forest resource assessments.

A promising method for estimating LUE is through remote sensing of the photochemical reflectance index (PRI). However, there are internal (e.g. pigment concentrations) and external factors (e.g. environmental conditions and sun-target-view geometry) that affect PRI signals. Considering the reflectance difference between sunlit and shaded leaves, the ratio of observed canopy reflectance to leaf reflectance is used to represent the observed fraction of sunlit leaves, and the observed fraction of shaded leaves is calculated with a geometrical optical model. Thus, a canopy-level PRI observation is separated into sunlit and shaded PRI values, and a two-leaf canopy PRI (PRIt) is calculated as sum of these two values weighted by their respective sunlit and shaded leaf area indices. The usefulness of PRIt in assessing the canopy-level. LUE is evaluated with automated multi-angle PRI observations acquired on a flux tower from April to September 2013 over a sub-tropical coniferous forest in southern China. In each 15-minute observation cycle, PRI is observed at four view zenith angles fixed at (37 degrees, 47 degrees, 57 degrees) or (42 degrees, 52 degrees, 62 degrees) and the instantaneous solar zenith angle in the azimuth angle range from 45 degrees to 325 degrees (from the geodetic north). In both the half-hourly and daily time steps, PRIt can effectively improve (>50% and >35% increases in R-2, respectively) the ability as a proxy of LUE derived from the tower flux measurements over the big-leaf PRI taken as the arithmetic average of the multi-angle measurements in a given time interval. In the dry season from July to September, correlations of PRI with LUE at daily time steps are much stronger in the two-leaf case than in the big-leaf case. The correlation between PRIt and LUE is the strongest (R-2 = 0.785, p < 0.001) in July. PRIt is very effective in detecting the light and low-moderate drought stress on LUE at half-hourly time steps, while ineffective in detecting severe atmospheric water and heat stress, which is probably due to alternative radiative energy sink, i.e. photorespiration. Overall, the two-leaf approach well overcomes some external effects (e.g. sun-target-view geometry) that interfere with PRI signals. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

To fill the gap, this study proposes a physically-based method to normalize LST data for topographic-namely illumination and elevation-effects over mountainous areas. Both topographic effects are first quantified by inverting a dual-source soil/vegetation energy balance (EB) model forced by 1) the instantaneous solar radiation simulated by a 3D radiative transfer model named DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) that uses a digital elevation model (DEM), 2) a satellite-derived vegetation index, and 3) local meteorological (air temperature, air relative humidity and wind speed) data available at a given location. The satellite LST is then normalized for topography by simulating the LST using both pixel- and image-scale DART solar radiation and elevation data. The approach is tested on three ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) overpass dates over a steep-sided 6 km by 6 km area in the Atlas Mountain in Morocco. The mean correlation coefficient and root mean square difference (RMSD) between EB-simulated and ASTER LST is 0.80 and 3 degrees C, respectively. Moreover, the EB-based method is found to be more accurate than a more classical approach based on a multi-linear regression with DART solar radiation and elevation data. The EB-simulated LST is also evaluated against an extensive ground dataset of 135 autonomous 1-cm depth temperature sensors deployed over the study area. While the mean RMSD between 90 m resolution ASTER LST and localized ibutton measurements is 6.1 degrees C, the RMSD between EB-simulated LST and ibutton soil temperature is 5.4 and 5.3 degrees C for a DEM at 90 m and 8 m resolution, respectively. The proposed topographic normalization is self-calibrated from (LST, DEM, vegetation index and in situ meteorological data) data available over large extents. As a significant perspective this approach opens the path to using normalized CST as input to evapotranspiration retrieval methods based on LST. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A new surface-based multi frequency (Ku-, X- and C-bands) microwave scatterometer system is used quasi-coincident with in situ geophysical snow measurements. A multilayer snow and ice backscatter model is used to calculate the total co-polarized backscatter coefficient for two snow temperature conditions. The model provides the surface and volume scattering contributions for each snow layer, as well as the frequency-dependent penetration depth. These results aid interpretation of observed backscatter. Joint use of Ku-, X- and C-band microwaves provide an enhanced understanding of diverse variations in geophysical, thermodynamic and electrical state of snow/sea ice system. Our results indicate that the effect of dielectric loss associated with highly saline snow covers is the dominant factor affecting microwave penetration and backscatter from all three frequencies. The observed and modeled C band backscatter shows good agreement, followed by X- and Ku-bands, at both snow temperature conditions. Microwave backscatter shows greater sensitivity to variations in plot-scale surface roughness, for all three frequencies. Additionally, Ku-band wavelength exhibits greater sensitivity to snow grain radius, over X-, and C bands. Our results demonstrate the future potential of a multi-frequency approach towards the development of snow thickness and snow water equivalent algorithms on first-year sea ice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Targeting those enhanced capabilities we describe an active fire detection algorithm for use with Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) daytime and nighttime data. The approach builds on the fire-sensitive short-wave infrared channel 7 complemented by visible and near-infrared channel 1-6 data (daytime only), while also expanding on the use of multi-temporal analysis to improve pixel classification results. Despite frequent saturation of OLI\'s fire-affected pixels, which includes radiometric artifacts resulting from folding of digital numbers, our initial assessment based on visual image analysis indicated high algorithm fidelity across a wide range of biomass burning scenarios, gas flares and active volcanoes. Additional field data verification confirmed the sensor\'s and algorithm\'s ability to resolve fires of significantly small areas compared to current operational satellite fire products. Commission errors were greatly reduced with the addition of multi-temporal analysis tests applied toco-located pixels, averaging less than 0.2% globally. Because of its overall quality, Landsat-8/OLI active fire data could become part of a network of emerging earth observation systems providing enhanced spatial and temporal coverage of biomass burning at global scales.

Population growth is impacting the natural environment, mostly through land cover and land use change (LCLUC), and particularly associated with agriculture expansion and urbanization. Monitoring LCLUC is necessary in order to understand the overall dynamics of population, LCLU and quality of life. However, extensive cloud cover in the region complicates satellite-based monitoring of LCLUC. Our objectives are to evaluate an innovative \"dense stack\" approach to image classification with extremely cloudy, multi-temporal Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery, map and quantify LCLU within southern Ghana for circa 2000 and circa 2010, examine LCLU changes, and assess the utility of the approach for monitoring human induced change. Maximum value composite images (derived from the dense stacks) provide unique information for classifying the LCLU classes of interest, and accuracy assessment results indicate effective overall classification of the six LCLU classes mapped using semi-automated methods. A product we developed and refer to as the spectral variability vegetation index (SVVI) plays a major role in discriminating three natural vegetation classes and agriculture. Derived circa 2000 and circa 2010 LCLU maps indicate that approximately 26% of the study area exhibited LCLU change during the study period. Sixty-two percent (62%) of the changes are associated with conversion to Agriculture, with 33% from Secondary Forest, 26% from Savanna, and 3% from Forest. During the same period, 18% of circa 2000 land classified as Agriculture was fallow or abandoned by circa 2010. Change to Built represented 6% of the LCLU change, which includes 5% from Agriculture and 1% from Secondary Forest circa 2000. Freely available Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery and the time-series classification methods developed here may be used to further monitor LCLU change in the region and throughout the world, particularly in cloud prone equatorial areas.

Simulating LiDAR returns for different laser technologies and Earth scenes is fundamental for evaluating and interpreting signal and noise in LiDAR data. Different types of models are capable of simulating LiDAR waveforms of Earth surfaces. Semi-empirical and geometric models can be imprecise because they rely on simplified simulations of Earth surfaces and light interaction mechanisms. On the other hand, Monte Carlo ray tracing (MCRT) models are potentially accurate but require long computational time. Here, we present a new LiDAR waveform simulation tool that is based on the introduction of a quasi-Monte Carlo ray tracing approach in the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model. Two new approaches, the so-called \"box method\" and \"Ray Carlo method\", are implemented to provide robust and accurate simulations of LiDAR waveforms for any landscape, atmosphere and LiDAR sensor configuration (view direction, footprint size, pulse characteristics, etc.). The box method accelerates the selection of the scattering direction of a photon in the presence of scatterers with non-invertible phase function. The Ray Carlo method brings traditional ray-tracking into MCRT simulation, which makes computational time independent of LiDAR field of view (FOV) and reception solid angle. Both methods are fast enough for simulating multi-pulse acquisition. Sensitivity studies with various landscapes and atmosphere constituents are presented, and the simulated LiDAR signals compare favorably with their associated reflectance images and Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) waveforms. The LiDAR module is fully integrated into DART, enabling more detailed simulations of LiDAR sensitivity to specific scene elements (e.g., atmospheric aerosols, leaf area, branches, or topography) and sensor configuration for airborne or satellite LiDAR sensors.

The study was carried out along the Arava segment of the Dead Sea Transform north of the Gulf of Elat (Aqaba) using Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data with 6-12 m/pixel resolutions. Nineteen independently dated Quaternary morphostratigraphic alluvial units (5 to 1910 ka) from eight different sites with variable lithologies (carbonate/magmatic/chert) were examined in order to develop, test and validate the proposed approach. Expanding on previous studies that established the characteristic smoothing of desert alluvial surface through time and the capability of measuring such roughness variations with radar, we employed a pixel-aggregation approach that yielded a robust (R-2 = 0.95) power-law relation between the average radar bacicscatter value from the surface (\'AR\') and the abandonment age (\'T\') of the unit as measured with independent methods such as luminescence and/or cosmogenic radionuclide dating. We found that: 1) This AR-T correlation can be inverted to obtain calibrated radar-based T estimates as old as similar to 1.5 Ma with 35% uncertainty; 2) ALOS PALSAR 6 m/pixel images acquired at incidence angles of 34-38 degrees yielded optimal results; 3) a sample of at least 70 contiguous radar pixels was required to capture the natural roughness variability of the surfaces examined, and 4) surface lithology did not exert a primary effect on T inversions. Validation experiments yielded radar-based ages of 3 +/- 1, 91 +/- 32, 484 +/- 169 and 1604 +/- 561 ka that compare to Holocene, 56 +/- 14, 540 60 and 1590 250 ka ages previously determined for the same surfaces, respectively. We propose that with region-specific calibrations, spaceborne radar data can be used to quantitatively estimate the age of abandoned alluvial units across regional scales. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Multi-satellites include GPS Radio Occultation (GPS RO), Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and Sounding of the Atmosphere using the Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) onboard the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Dynamics (TIMED) mission. Emphasis have been made to investigate up to what latitudes the effect of SSW will be seen on these pauses. This study also presents the characteristics, intensity and duration of the SSW events. A total of 9 SSW events are identified out of the 12 winters. The altitude of tropopause is observed to have decrease by similar to 0.7 km during SSW events in NH high latitudes and restricted to 60 degrees N and above. As expected, significant increase in the stratopause altitude is noticed, which reaches to almost similar to 80 km when compared to non-warming years and this effect was observed up to 50 degrees N. Thus, SSW effects on the tropopause and stratopause noticed at polar latitudes may not be felt directly at the tropical latitudes. Interestingly, large reduction in the mesopause altitudes (by 3-4 km) is observed during SSW events, which propagates to the tropical latitudes in some of the SSW winters. The gravity wave (GW) activity is also examined during these SSW events. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

[Morillas, L et al. Using radiometric surface temperature for surface energy flux estimation in Mediterranean drylands from a two-source perspective, Remote Sens. Environ. 136, 234-246, 2013] evaluates the two-source model (TSM) of Norman et al. (1995) with revisions by Kustas and Norman (1999) over a semiarid tussock grassland site in southeastern Spain. The TSM - in its current incarnation, the two-source energy balance model (TSEB) - was applied to this landscape using ground-based infrared radiometer sensors to estimate both the composite surface radiometric temperature and component soil and canopy temperatures. Morillas et al. (2013) found the TSEB model substantially underestimated the sensible H (and overestimated the latent heat LE) fluxes. Using the same data set from Morillas et al. (2013), we were able to confirm their results. We also found energy transport and exchange behavior derived from primarily the observations themselves to differ significantly from a number of prior studies using land surface temperature for estimating heat fluxes with one-source modeling approaches in semi-arid landscapes. However, revisions to key vegetation inputs to TSEB and the soil resistance formulation resulted in a significant reduction in the bias and root mean square error (RMSE) between model output of H and LE and the measurements compared to the prior results from Morillas et al. (2013). These included more representative ground-based vegetation greenness and local leaf area index values as well as modifications to the coefficients of the soil resistance formulation to account for the very rough (rocky) soil surface conditions with a clumped canopy. This indicates that both limitations in remote estimates of biophysical indicators of the canopy at the site and the lack of adjustment in soil resistance formulation to account for site specific characteristics, contributed to the earlier findings of Morillas et al. (2013). This suggests further studies need to be conducted to reduce the uncertainties in the vegetation and land surface temperature input data in order to more accurately assess the effects of the transport exchange processes of this Mediterranean landscape on TSEB formulations.

A variety of orbital, sub-orbital, and field instruments have been used to retrieve optical spectral signals and to study different vegetation properties such as plant biochemistry, nutrient cycling, physiology, water status, and stress. Radiative transfer models (RTMs) provide a mechanistic link between vegetation properties and observed spectral features, and RTM spectral inversion is a useful framework for estimating these properties from spectral data. However, existing approaches to RTM spectral inversion are typically limited by the inability to characterize uncertainty in parameter estimates. Here, we introduce a Bayesian algorithm for the spectral inversion of the PROSPECT 5 leaf RTM that is distinct from past approaches in two important ways: First, the algorithm only uses reflectance and does not require transmittance observations, which have been plagued by a variety of measurement and equipment challenges. Second, the output is not a point estimate for each parameter but rather the joint probability distribution that includes estimates of parameter uncertainties and covariance structure. We validated our inversion approach using a database of leaf spectra together with measurements of equivalent water thickness (EWT) and leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA). The parameters estimated by our inversion were able to accurately reproduce the observed reflectance (RMSEVIS = 0.0063, RMSENIR-SWIR = 0.0098) and transmittance (RMSEVIS = 0.0404, RMSENIR-SWIR = 0.0551) for both broadleaved and conifer species. Inversion estimates of EWT and LMA for broadleaved species agreed well with direct measurements (CVEWT = 18.8%, CVLMA = 24.5%), while estimates for conifer species were less accurate (CVEWT = 53.2%, CVLMA = 63.3%). To examine the influence of spectral resolution on parameter uncertainty, we simulated leaf reflectance as observed by ten common remote sensing platforms with varying spectral configurations and performed a Bayesian inversion on the resulting spectra. We found that full-range hyperspectral platforms were able to retrieve all parameters accurately and precisely, while the parameter estimates of multispectral platforms were much less precise and prone to bias at high and low values. We also observed that variations in the width and location of spectral bands influenced the shape of the covariance structure of parameter estimates. Our Bayesian spectral inversion provides a powerful and versatile framework for future RTM development and single-and multi-instrumental remote sensing of vegetation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In summer, patches of cold water are formed in the river by groundwater seepage. These patches have strong ecological significance and extend to the surface water in a well-mixed riverine system. These patches can serve as thermal refuges for some fish species during summer. In this study, the temporal variability and spatial distribution of cold water patches were explored along a 50 km river reach (the lower Ain River, France) using thermal infrared airborne remote sensing. This study examines a new range of processes acting on cold water patches at different scales that have not previously been touched upon in the literature. Three airborne campaigns were conducted during the summers of 2010, 2011 and 2014. Based on these images, a large number of cold water patches were identified using an automated method. Four types of patches were observed: tributary plumes, cold side channels (former channels or point bar backwater channels), side seeps (located directly in the river channel) and gravel bar seeps (occurring at the downstream end of gravel bars). Logistic regression was used to analyze the longitudinal distribution of cold water patches according to geomorphologic indicators reflecting current or past fluvial process. Side seeps were found to be related to the local geology. Cold side channels were correlated to contemporary and past lateral river mobility. Gravel bar seeps were related to the current development of bars and are more prevalent in wandering reaches than in single-bed incised and paved reaches. The logistic model was subsequently used to evaluate gravel bar seep variability in the past. The model suggests larger numbers of seeps in the mid-20th century when bar surface area was higher. Interannual variability in the occurrence and spatial extent of side seeps and gravel bar seeps appear to be related to groundwater level fluctuations. Cold side channels exhibited greater interannual stability. Nonetheless, among all patch types, some are quite stable over time, while others are transient. These results can be used to target areas with high densities of stable and spatially extensive cold water patches that are considered ecological refuges, in the context of pronounced low flow and a rise in water temperature.

Here we present maps of glacier elevation change rates (dh/dt) and velocities at Novaya Zemlya that reveal evidence of the impact of both calving flux and surface melt on ice mass loss.   dh/dt are calculated by applying a weighted linear regression to stacked digital elevation models (DEMs) from a 1952 map and DEMs created from stereo-pairs of WorldView images acquired between 2012 and 2014. The similar to 60-year average mass change rate is -0.23 +/- 0.04 m w.e. yr(-1). The recent, short-term (2012-2013/2014) average mass change rate is -0.40 +/- 0.09 m w.e. yr(-1). We apply the same weighted linear regression to stacked WorldView DEMs and ICESat elevations from 2003 to 2009, as well as stacked WorldView DEM5 and ASTER DEM5 from 2000 to 2013. The dh/dt from both datasets confirm that thinning has been more rapid than the 60-year average since 2000. Average mass loss has accelerated at the lower elevations of land-terminating glaciers, suggesting that recent near surface warming and increased melt have led to greater thinning. Marine-terminating glaciers along the Barents Sea coast have substantially higher thinning rates near their termini in recent years than adjacent land-terminating glaciers, suggesting that calving flux is an important contributor to overall ice mass loss in the region.   Flow velocities are generated by feature tracking on optical and radar image pairs. Marine-terminating glaciers along the Barents Sea coast have the highest frontal velocities of any glaciers on NVZ. Our surface velocity measurements constrain the calving flux at the two fastest-retreating glaciers, Inostrantseva (INO) and Virkitskogo (VIS), which are both on the Barents Sea coast. We find that the calving flux is high enough to drive frontal thinning and retreat at those two glaciers. Summer terminus speeds at Inostrantseva Glacier have accelerated from a 2006 maximum of 3 m day(-1) to a 2012 maximum of 9 to 10 m day(-1) and the front has retreated by more than 3 km between 2006/06/27 and 2013/08/17.

We present an experimental validation of a physical PM2.5 remote sensing (PMRS) method which is not dependent on geographical location, based on ground-based remote sensing measurements at Jinhua City, a typical middle size city in East of China. The PMRS method is designed to employ currently available satellite remote sensing parameters as many as possible, including aerosol optical depth (ADD), fine mode fraction (FMF), planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) and atmospheric relative humidity (RH), and thus be capable of deriving PM2.5 from instantaneous remote sensing measurements under different pollution levels. The key processes of the PM2.5 method including size cutting, volume visualization, bottom isolation and particle drying are directly validated by comparing with reference parameters. We found that the size cutting of the PMRS method has a significant bias (about 0.86) resulting from the use of fine mode fraction to estimate PM2.5 among all size of aerosol particles, which should be systematically corrected. The validation results of the volume visualization and particle drying of the PMRS method are quite satisfied while the bottom isolation procedure brings currently the maximum uncertainty to the PM2.5 remote sensing. The improved PMRS method shows good performance on the remote sensing of hourly PM2.5 with an average error of about 38 mu g/m(3) and relative error of about 31%. The correlation coefficient between remote sensing and in situ hourly PM2.5 is about 0.67 with a linear slope of 1.03 and intercept of 11 mu g/m(3) while the means are very close (110.7 mu g/m(3) versus 118.6 mu g/m(3)). The validation study also helps find out future improvement directions and demonstrates the possible application to ground-based remote sensing data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Remote sensing techniques provide an unparalleled spatial and temporal coverage of landsurface attributes, and thus several studies have attempted to estimate net radiation by combining remote sensing observations with surface and atmospheric data. However, remote sensing provides instantaneous data, when many applications and models need information at other temporal scales. In this work, a new general methodology is proposed to estimate daily and daytime net radiation and to retrieve the diurnal cycle of net radiation. Four images were acquired on different dates, two corresponding to the TM sensor (Landsat 5) and two from EFM + (Landsat 7), and ancillary meteorological data covering the Tandil department (Argentina) were collected. The performance of the methodology at both local and regional scales is assessed by comparing the results with ground net radiation measurements. At local scale, estimation errors between +/- 4 and +/- 9%, biases close to zero, and good agreement between predicted net radiation values and ground-measured values were obtained. On the other hand, estimation errors between +/- 2 and +/- 4% were finally obtained using satellite data. Note that the methodology presented here is not restricted to a latitude, a date, or a time of satellite overpass, and therefore it can be applied to any satellite mission, provided it has visible, infrared, and thermal bands to obtain previously the instantaneous net radiation.

Despite the coarse spatial resolution of GRACE, its estimates were able not only to represent the hydrological regime of the entire basin but also its internal variability. The total water storage change estimates correlated well with precipitation (r = 0.87), evapotranspiration (r = 0.83), and vegetation greenness (r = 0.85), particularly when a two to three month time lag was considered. Likewise, the MODIS-derived vegetation greenness was consistent with variations in precipitation (r = 0.77) and evapotranspiration (r = 0.79). Nevertheless, we found that the water balance could not be closed with these data. Inferred runoff was greatly overestimated due mainly to an underestimation of ET. The uncertainty in the inputs and scarce validation data were limiting factors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Object-oriented classification (OOC) and normalized difference spectral indices of vegetation, moisture and soil redness (NDVI, NDWI and NDRSI) have been applied to sub-metric GeoEye-1 and Pleiades images to identify and map pyroclastic and lahar deposits and trace their spatio-temporal evolution over two years, following the 2010 eruption of Merapi Volcano, Indonesia. We could identify several categories of pyroclastic depositional areas, and also map the damaged forest and destroyed cultivated terraces and settlements in the Gendol and Opak River basins on the south flank of the volcano. More than 75% of erupted deposits were delineated semi-automatically unlike the ground geological map based on photo-interpretation of the 2010 GeoEye image and field observations. A temporal image analysis, using bivariate scatter diagrams of the three spectral indices between 2010 and 2012 and a combination of NDWI and NDVI, separated areas affected by surges from unscathed vegetation. Use of NDRSI and NDWI allowed us to differentiate overbank Pyroclastic Density Current deposits from wet lahar deposits. NDRSI values close to 0 refer to scoria-rich pyrodastic deposits.   About 40% of the devastated upper catchment was recolonized by vegetation between 2010 and 2012. The recovery also took place in the forested valley margins affected by ash-cloud surges. The morphometric analysis of the initial drainage network, digitized from the 2011-2012 images, demonstrated (1) the resurfacing of pristine 2010 PDC deposits by runoff and (2) incision or remobilization by lahars. It took two years following the eruption in the rugged upper catchment devastated by high-energy surges to fully develop the hydrographic network. It is, however, still rudimentary on gently sloping fans created by overbank PDC deposits in the middle valley, thus suggesting the importance of slope gradient, grain size, permeability and thickness of deposits. As much as 35% of the 2010 PDC deposits, emplaced in the vicinity of the river channels, were remobilized by lahars over the two post-eruption rainy seasons and also by constant mining activities. Studies on the erosion of the pyroclastic deposits after 2012 need to concentrate on the upper reach of the catchment on the south flank.

We simulated MOD21 product estimates over two different sandy deserts (i.e. White Sands and Great Sands) using a series of MODIS scenes from 2010 to 2013. The objective of this study was to evaluate the anisotropy of the thermal infrared emissivity over semiarid regions, since angular variations of thermal infrared emissivity imply important uncertainties in satellite 1ST retrievals. The obtained LSEs and their dependence on zenith viewing angles were analyzed. Results from the MOD21 simulated algorithm showed that band 29 LSE decreased up to 0.038 from nadir to zenith angle of 60 degrees, while LSEs for bands 31 and 32 did not show significant variation. MOD21 LSE for band 29 also showed mean differences between night and daytime retrievals of +0.027 for WS and +0.009 for GS. These differences can be attributed to the water vapor adsorption of the soil from the atmosphere. MOD21 nadir and off-nadir LSEs showed a good agreement with laboratory emissivity measurements, and were used to validate with satellite data a zenithal-dependent emissivity model proposed in a previous study.

The vertically resolved results are presented for winter months when the large scale biomass burning from nearby areas is minimized, and the aerosol loading is dominated by anthropogenic outflow from the city. The particulate depolarization ratio in the outflowing plume has high values and reflects the influence of mixing of the urban pollution with the ubiquitous dust around the city. This is consistent with the results from previous field campaigns in the city and leads to polluted dust being the dominant aerosol subtype as identified by the CALIPSO algorithm. A first order estimate of the mass flux on two episodes using the aerosol extinction profiles from CALIPSO indicates outflow of several hundred tons per day. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, such estimation depends critically on an established relation between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and ground level PMs. In this study we performed an experiment at Xi\'an to establish a relation between AOD and PM10. A first test of satellite AOD and PM10 data showed a low correlation between the two properties, especially in spring and summer seasons with relatively many high AOD values paired to low ground-level PM10 values, which hinted that AOD may \'contaminate\' by summer agricultural burning season and dust storm intrusion leading to much elevated aerosol. MODIS fire count and CALIPSO vertical feature mask data were used to detect fire emissions and elevated aerosol to substantiate this hypothesis. A later test showed that the correlation between ADD and PM10 has strongly been improved by excluding the paired AOD-PM10 data with known biomass burning and elevated aerosol layers. This result indicates that summer agricultural burning and aloft aerosol should be considered when the AOD-PM10 association is explored. Finally, a geographically weighted regression model was developed to further improve estimation of ground-level concentration by combining AOD with meteorological parameters. The results showed that the meteorological parameters can greatly improve model performance. The overall cross-validation R-2 is 0.77 and the root mean squared prediction error (RMSE) is 16.91 mu g/m(3). These results are useful for developing satellite AOD based model to estimate ground-level PMs especially for the region with known strong biomass burning events. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Despite the significant potential of VNIR/SWIR hyperspectral airborne data for topsoil property mapping, the transposition to satellite data must be evaluated. The objective of this study was to test the sensitivity of clay content prediction to atmospheric effects and to degradation of spatial resolution. This study may offer an initial analysis of the potential of future hyperspectral satellite sensors, such as the HYPerspectral X Imagery (HYPXIM), the Spaceborne Hyperspectral Applicative Land and Ocean Mission (SHALOM), the PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) and the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI), for soil applications. This study employed VNIR/ SWIR AISA-DUAL airborne data acquired in a Mediterranean region over a large area (300 km(2)) with an initial spatial resolution of 5 m. These hyperspectral airborne data were simulated at the top of the atmosphere and aggregated at six spatial resolutions (10, 15, 20, 30, 60 and 90 m) to correlate with the future hyperspectral satellite sensors. The predicted clay content maps were obtained using the partial least squares regression (PLSR) method. The large area of the studied region allows analysis of different pedological patterns of soil composition and spatial structures. Our results showed the following: (i) when a correct compensation of atmosphere effects was performed, only slight differences were detected between clay maps retrieved from the airborne imagery and those from spaceborne imagery (both at 5 m of spatial resolution); (ii) the PLSR models, built from data with 5 to 30 m spatial resolutions, performed well, and allowed clay mapping, although variations in clay content related to short scale succession of parent material was imperfectly captured beyond 15 m of spatial resolution; (iii) the PLSR models built from data with 60 and 90 m spatial resolutions were inaccurate, and did not enable clay mapping; and (iv) the two latter results could be explained by the combination of a small short-scale clay content variability and small field sizes observed in the study area. Therefore, in the Mediterranean and under the spectral specifications of the AISA-DUAL airborne sensor, most of the future hyperspectral satellite sensors (four of the five sensors examined in this study) will be potentially useful for clay content mapping.

Satellite data is widely used to monitor LSP over regional to global extents. Currently, there are many algorithms for generating satellite based LSP products. The Committee of Earth Observing System identifies performance assessments of these products as a pressing need. Performance assessment includes both validation in comparison to independent reference data and evaluation by comparison against estimates of noise free phenology indicators. This study proposes a novel methodology for evaluation of satellite based LSP algorithms and applies this methodology to evaluate three well-known LSP algorithms, Savitzky-Golay based filter (SGF), asymmetric Gaussian fitting (AGF) and logistic function fitting (logistic), using 20 years of daily Normalized Difference Vegetation Index composites for Canada and Northern USA. The three LSP methods were evaluated in terms of accuracy for start of season, maximum of season and end of season. Signal to noise ratio (SNR) and the temporal gap frequency (gaps) of the NDVI time series are shown to be proportional to the confidence level for clear sky labeling. The SGF and logistic methods were found to be more sensitive to the SNR than AGF. However, AGF require a minimum proportion of temporal samples for reconstruction. These results highlight the importance of evaluating the trade-off between gap frequency and SNR impacts on LSP methods and indicate that the performance of these methods will depend on both land surface condition and the clear sky identification approach adopted. The developed evaluation approach serves as a basis for assessing the uncertainty in satellite LSP products due to radiometric noise and missing data.

This quantification is challenging, both spatially and temporally, due to the sparseness of measurements. There has been a concerted effort to derive accurate estimates of phytoplankton photosynthesis and primary production from satellite data to fill these gaps; however there have been few satellite estimates of net community production (NCP). In this paper, we compare a number of empirical approaches to estimate NCP from satellite data with in vitro measurements of changes in dissolved O-2 concentration at 295 stations in the N and S Atlantic Ocean (including the Antarctic), Greenland and Mediterranean Seas. Algorithms based on power laws between NCP and particulate organic carbon production (POC) derived from C-14 uptake tend to overestimate NCP at negative values and underestimate at positive values. An algorithm that includes sea surface temperature (SST) in the power function of NCP and C-14 POC has the lowest bias and root-mean square error compared with in vitro measured NCP and is the most accurate algorithm for the Atlantic Ocean. Nearly a 13 year time series of NCP was generated using this algorithm with SeaWiFS data to assess changes over time in different regions and in relation to climate variability. The North Atlantic subtropical and tropical Gyres (NATL) were predominantly net autotrophic from 1998 to 2010 except for boreal autumn/winter, suggesting that the northern hemisphere has remained a net sink for CO2 during this period. The South Atlantic subtropical Gyre (SATL) fluctuated from being net autotrophic in austral spring-summer, to net heterotrophic in austral autumn winter. Recent decadal trends suggest that the SATL is becoming more of a CO2 source. Over the Atlantic basin, the percentage of satellite pixels with negative NCP was 27%, with the largest contributions from the NATL and SATL during boreal and austral autumn winter, respectively. Variations in NCP in the northern and southern hemispheres were correlated with climate indices. Negative correlations between NCP and the multivariate ENSO index (MEI) occurred in the SATL, which explained up to 60% of the variability in NCP. Similarly there was a negative correlation between NCP and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in the Southern Sub-Tropical Convergence Zone (SSTC), which explained 90% of the variability. There were also positive correlations with NAO in the Canary Current Coastal Upwelling (CNRY) and Western Tropical Atlantic (WTRA) which explained 80% and 60% of the variability in each province, respectively. MEI and NAO seem to play a role in modifying phases of net autotrophy and heterotrophy in the Atlantic Ocean. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Hence, data on seasonal and spatial variations of phytoplankton primary production (PP) is needed to estimate their ecological state. However, considerable difficulties arise when investigating the spatial and temporal variations of productivity in inland waters. Traditional in situ sampling approaches cannot provide the necessary data over large lakes or for lakes over large geographic regions. A solution can be to combine modelling with satellite data, by using different satellite products as inputs for a primary production model. The objective of this study is to evaluate and validate a lake primary production model based on satellite products. For that purpose we compared PP(sat) with PP(in situ) in two large, shallow, well mixed, and eutrophic Estonian lakes. A semi-empirical phytoplankton primary production model, derived by us earlier, was used. It allows estimating the values of phytoplankton primary production for lakes over large geographic areas. The primary production model operated well using MERIS products as input data. Our results show that spatial variability in primary production cannot be neglected in large lakes. Combining satellite data with model calculations allows monitoring of the state of lakes in space and time, providing a new perspective for lake primary production studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

To provide high-resolution precipitation estimates over un-gauged areas, great efforts have been taken to downscale low-resolution satellite precipitation datasets using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) based on the assumption that precipitation can be simulated by vegetation and topography proxies at various spatial scales. However, the non-stationarity of the relationship between precipitation and vegetation or topography has not been appropriately considered when low-resolution satellite precipitation datasets are downscaled using NDVI and DEM in previous studies. To overcome this limitation, a new downscaling algorithm was proposed in this study by introducing a regional regression model termed as geographically weighted regression (GWR) to explore the spatial heterogeneity of the precipitation-ND VI and precipitation-DEM relationships. The performance of this new downscaling algorithm was assessed by downscaling the latest version of monthly TRMM precipitation datasets (referred to TRMM 3B43 V7) over the eastern Tibetan Plateau and the TianShan Mountains from 025 (about 25 km) to 1 km spatial resolution, and the downscaled precipitation datasets were validated against ground observations measured by rain gauges. The validation results indicate that the high-resolution precipitation datasets obtained through the new algorithm not only performed better than the traditional downscaling algorithms, but also had higher accuracy than the original TRMM 3B43 V7 dataset Besides, we found that the performance of this new algorithm was largely dependent on the accuracy of the original TRMM 3B43 V7 data. We therefore recommend considering the non-stationarity of the precipitation-NDVI and precipitation-DEM relationships in the downscaling process, and demonstrate the possibility of downscaling satellite precipitation with NDVI and DEM at monthly temporal scale.

This study evaluates the potential of high-resolution ALOS/PALSAR mosaics data in the tropical forests of central Sumatra to improve AFCS estimates. The study region has an average AFCS (47% of the aboveground biomass) of 66 Mg C ha(-1) with a range of 1 to 334 Mg C ha-1 and consists of natural forests including peat swamp, dry moist, regrowth, and mangrove, and plantation forests including rubber, acacia, oil palm, and coconut. Field measurements of AFCS were carried out in 87 (ha(-1)) plots, where half of them were from plantation forests. Various possibilities including direct gamma naught back-scatters and their ratios and various types of textures of dual polarized mosaics from the years 2009 and 2010 were examined applying regression modeling in a five step framework. R-2, variable inflation factor (VIF), p-value, and root mean square errors (RMSE) were the major indicators considered for selection of best model in the calibration process. The potential models selected were cross validated by the leave-one-out (LOO) method where R-2, RMSE, mean deviation (MD), and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE, model performance indicator) were examined. The results indicate that a simple combination of backscatters and their ratios provides an AFCS estimate with a RMSE of 45 Mg C ha(-1), more efficient than the average of field measured AFCS (NSE of 0.54), and R-2 of 0.63. Inclusion of appropriate texture parameters derived from the high-resolution PALSAR mosaics further increases the potential for AFCS estimation by increasing R-2 and model performance (NSE) to 0.84 and 0.83, respectively and decreasing the uncertainty to 28 Mg C ha(-1). This SAR based method offers the low cost wall-to-wall forest carbon mapping with a high level of accuracy in the dense tropical forest regions of Southeast Asia where other methods are still rare.

Since existing K-d(PAR) models for the satellite ocean color data have wide regional variations, we need to improve the K-d(PAR) algorithm for global ocean applications. In this study, we propose a new blended K-d(PAR) model for both open oceans and turbid coastal waters. The new method has been assessed using in situ optical measurements from the NASA Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) Bio-Optical Archive and Storage System (SeaBASS) database. Next, the new method is applied to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) to derive Kd(PAR) products, and is compared with in situ measureinents. Results show that there are significant improvements in model-derived K-d(PAR) values using the new approach compared to those from some existing K-d(PAR) algorithms. In addition, matchup comparisons between MODIS-derived and in situ-measured K-d(PAR) data for the global ocean show a good agreement with mean and median ratios of 1.109 and 1.035, respectively. Synoptic maps of MODIS- and VIIRS-derived Kd(PAR) data generated using the new method provide very similar and consistent spatial patterns in the U.S. East Coast region, although there are some slight differences between two satellite-derived K-d(PAR) images (similar to 1-5% higher in VIIRS K-d(PAR) compared with those from MODIS-Aqua in the shallow water region), which are possibly due to differences in spectral bands and sensor performance (e.g., calibrations). Monthly maps of VIIRS-derived K-d(PAR) data for the global ocean are also generated using the new Kd(PAR) model, and provide spatial and temporal K-d(PAR) distributions that show consistent results with those from previous studies. Thus, results show that satellite-derived K-d(PAR) data using the new K-d(PAR) model, e.g., from MODIS and VIIRS, can provide more accurate K-d(PAR) data to science communities, in particular, as an important input for ocean-atmospheric circulation, biogeochemical, and ecosystem models.

The sensitivity of the model to two critical but uncertain parameters, the maximum carboxylation capacity V-cmo, and a stomatal parameter lambda (the marginal water cost of carbon assimilation) is discussed; it is shown that anisotropy displays limited sensitivity to both parameters for the experimental conditions met over a well-watered wheat field. The ability of SCOPE to simulate anisotropy is finally illustrated by a qualitative comparison against experimental measurements obtained over a mature pine stand using an airborne TIR camera.

However, these products lack information on the community structure of the phytoplankton, which is crucial for ecological modelling and ecosystem studies. To assess the usefulness of existing methods to differentiate phytoplankton functional types (PFT) or phytoplankton size classes from satellite data, in-situ phytoplankton samples collected in the Western Iberian coast, on the North-East Atlantic, were analysed for pigments and absorption spectra. Water samples were collected in five different locations, four of which were located near the shore and another in an open-ocean, seamount region. Three different modelling approaches for deriving phytoplankton size classes were applied to the in situ data. Approaches tested provide phytoplankton size class information based on the input of pigments data (Brewin et al., 2010), absorption spectra data (Ciotti et al., 2002) or both (Uitz et al., 2008).   Following Uitz et al. (2008), results revealed high variability in microphytoplankton chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficients, ranging from 0.01 to 0.09 m(2) (mg chl)(-1) between 400 and 500 nm. This spectral analysis suggested, in one of the regions, the existence of small cells (<20 mu m) in the fraction of phytoplankton presumed to be microphytoplankton (based on diagnostic pigments). Ciotti et al. (2002) approach yielded the highest differences between modelled and measured absorption spectra for the locations where samples had high variability in community structure and cell size. The Brewin et al. (2010) pigment-based model was adjusted and a set of model coefficients are presented and recommended for future studies in offshore water of the Western Iberian coast.

Several crown delineation algorithms have been developed to extract individual tree information from LiDAR point clouds or rasterized canopy height models (CHM), but many of these algorithms have difficulty discriminating between overlapping crowns, and also may fail to detect understory trees. Our approach uses a watershed-based delineation of a CHM, which is subsequently refined using the LiDAR point cloud. Individual tree detection was validated with stem mapped field data from the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC), Maryland, and on a plot and stand level through comparisons of stem density and basal area to delineated metrics at both SERC and a study area in the Sierra Nevada, California. For individual tree detection, the algorithm correctly identified 70% of dominant trees, 58% of codominant trees, 35% of intermediate trees and 21% of suppressed trees at SERC. The algorithm had difficulty distinguishing between crowns of small, dense understory trees of approximately the same height. Delineated crown volume alone explained 53% and 84% of the variability in basal area at the SERC and Sierra Nevada sites, respectively. The algorithm produced crown area distributions comparable to diameter at breast height (DBH) size class distributions observed in the field in both study sites. The algorithm detected understory crowns better in the conifer-dominated Sierra Nevada site than in the closed-canopy deciduous site in Maryland. The ability for the algorithm to reproduce both accurate tree size distributions and individual crown geometries in two dissimilar and complex forests suggests great promise for applicability to a wide range of forest systems.

Three regression models, ordinary least squares regression, support vector machine, and random forest, were all calibrated using Landsat TM/ETM + data and field observations from two sources: Environment Canada and the Weather Underground. Results based on cross-validation indicate that the random forest model produced the lowest prediction errors (RMSE = 2.31 degrees C). Some weather stations were consistently cooler/hotter than the reference station and were predicted well, while other stations, particularly those close to the ocean, showed greater temperature variability and were predicted with greater errors. A few stations, most of which were from the Weather Underground data set, were very poorly predicted and possibly unrepresentative of air temperature in the area. The random forest model generally produced a sensible map of temperature distribution in the area The spatial regression approach appears useful for mapping intraurban air temperature variability and can easily be applied to other cities.

This study investigates the consistency of two global satellite-based SSM datasets based on microwave remote sensing observations from the passive Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS; SMOSL3 version 2.5) and the active Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT; version TU-Wien-WARP 5.5) with respect to LSM SSM from the MERRA-Land data product. The relationship between the global-scale SSM products was studied during the 2010-2012 period using (1) a time series statistics (considering both original SSM data and anomalies), (2) a space time analysis using Hovmoller diagrams, and (3) a triple collocation error model. The SMOSL3 and ASCAT retrievals are consistent with the temporal dynamics of modeled SSM (correlation R > 0.70 for original SSM) in the transition zones between wet and dry climates, including the Sahel, the Indian subcontinent, the Great Plains of North America, eastern Australia, and southeastern Brazil. Over relatively dense vegetation covers, a better consistency with MERRA-Land was obtained with ASCAT than with SMOSL3. However, it was found that ASCAT retrievals exhibit negative correlation versus MERRA-Land in some arid regions (e.g., the Sahara and the Arabian Peninsula). In terms of anomalies, SMOSL3 better captures the short term SSM variability of the reference dataset (MERRA-Land) than ASCAT over regions with limited radio frequency interference (RFI) effects (e.g., North America, South America, and Australia). The seasonal and latitudinal variations of SSM are relatively similar for the three products, although the MERRA-Land SSM values are generally higher and their seasonal amplitude is much lower than for SMOSL3 and ASCAT. Both SMOSL3 and ASCAT have relatively comparable triple collocation errors with similar spatial error patterns: (i) lowest errors in arid regions (e.g., Sahara and Arabian Peninsula), due to the very low natural variability of soil moisture in these areas, and Central America, and (ii) highest errors over most of the vegetated regions (e.g., northern Australia, India, central Asia, and South America). However, the ASCAT SSM product is prone to larger random errors in some regions (e.g., north-western Africa, Iran, and southern South Africa). Vegetation density was found to be a key factor to interpret the consistency with MERRA-Land between the two remotely sensed products (SMOSL3 and ASCAT) which provides complementary information on SSM. This study shows that both SMOS and ASCAT have thus a potential for data fusion into long-term data records. (C) 2014 British Geological Survey (c) NERC.

Many studies have used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is calculated as the normalized ratio between near infrared and red spectral bands in satellite images, to evaluate the response of vegetation to drought. In this study, we examined the impacts of drought on three vegetation indices (NDVI, enhanced vegetation index, EVI, and land surface water index, LSWI) and CO2 flux from three tallgrass prairie eddy flux tower sites in the U.S. Gross primary production (GPP) was also modeled using a satellite-based Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), and the modeled GPP (GPP(VPM)) was compared with the GPP (GPP(EC)) derived from eddy covariance measurements. Precipitation at two sites in Oklahoma was 30% below the historical mean in both years of the study period (2005-2006), while the site in Illinois did not experience drought in the 2005-2007 study period. The EVI explained the seasonal dynamics of GPP better than did NDVI. The LSWI dropped below zero during severe droughts in the growing season, showing its potential to track drought. The result shows that GPP was more sensitive to drought than were vegetation indices, and EVI and LSWI were more sensitive than NDVI. We developed a modified function (Wsailar), calculated as a function of LSWI, to account for the effect of severe droughts on GPP in VPM. The GPP(VPM) from the modified VPM accounted for the rapid reduction in GPP during severe droughts and the seasonal dynamics of GPPvpm agreed reasonably well with GPP(EC). Our analysis shows that 8-day averaged values (temperature, vapor-pressure deficit) do not reflect the short-term extreme climate events well, suggesting that satellitebased models may need to be run at daily or hourly scales, especially under unfavorable climatic conditions.

Despite its importance, no accurate retrieval model has been specifically developed for both oceanic and coastal waters, but significant efforts have been made in regard to oceanic inversion models. The objectives of the present study are to evaluate the applicability of the quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) in deriving a(lambda) and b(b)(lambda) from oceanic and coastal waters, and to improve it using a neural network-based semi-analytical algorithm (NNSAA). Based on a comparison of the a(X) and bb(X) predicted by these models with field measurements taken from the national aeronautics and space administration bio-optical marine algorithm dataset (NOMAD), the Yellow Sea and China East Sea, it is shown that the NNSAA model (R-2 > 0.82 and mean relative error, MRE = 20.6-35.5%) provides a stronger performance than the QAA model (R-2 < 0.73 and MRE = 32.2-69.6%). The model was also applied to MODIS data after atmospheric correction using a near-infrared-based and shortwave infrared-based combined model. Through validation by field measurements, it was shown that the NNSAA model can predict a(lambda) and b(b)(lambda) with high accuracy (R-2 >0.77 and MRE < 39.9%). Finally, the NNSAA model was used to map the global climatological seasonal mean a(443) and b(b)(555) for the time range of July 2002 to September 2013. Except the coastal zones, it was shown that the a(443) and b(b)(532) in some high-latitude areas are much higher than in the mid- and low-latitude regions, due to the effects of spurious signals from neighboring sea-ice. In the equatorial oceans, the a(443) value in the surface water is considerably higher in the equatorial Pacific than in the equatorial Atlantic in the upwelling region, while the integrate a(443) is much higher in the Atlantic than in the throughout the entire tropical gyre areas. The difference between a(443) and b(b)(532) in the subsurface water is due to a pronounced deep biomass maximum existing in the equatorial Atlantic, which is associated with the higher nitrate in the lower euphotic zone.

Coastal zones are very dynamic and provide a number of critical ecosystem services, particularly in relation to flood mitigation but they have been found to be difficult to monitor using remotely sensed data. This research analysed combinations of S-band and X-band quad-polarimetric airborne SAR, elevation data and optical remotely sensed imagery. In total 30 variables were analysed. The SAR inputs included backscatter intensity channels and Cloude-Pottier, Freeman-Durden and Van Zyl decomposition SAR descriptors. Classification was carried out using Random Forest classifiers at two thematic resolutions which generated a general mapping of salt marsh vegetation and a high-resolution mapping of thematically detailed salt marsh vegetation habitats. The results indicate that Random Forest models are able to handle multi-source datasets and generate high classification accuracies. Models based on either SAR or optical RS variables alone were found to be less accurate than models that combining variables from multiple sources. The results show that X-band SAR data provided the best information to map vegetation extent and analysis showed that S-band SAR data was better able to differentiate between different vegetation habitats. The methods and analyses suggested in this paper extend previous research into remote monitoring of costal zones and illustrate the opportunities for mapping natural coastal areas afforded through combinations of radar and optical remote sensing data.

Automatic recognition of the debris is much more difficult than recognizing bare ice on optical remotely sensed images because the debris has almost the same spectral characteristics of the surrounding.terrain. In this paper, the scattering characteristics of the debris on the C-and L-band polarimetric SAR images are presented and analyzed to study the possibility of recognizing debris thickness and extent. The Koxkar glacier, in the central Tianshan Mountain Range, was selected as the study area. It was found that debris is distinct from bare ice in cross polarization (HV) of both the L-and C-bands. The L-band volume scattering component, acquired from target decomposition, increases with debris thickness when the debris is less than 25 cm deep, but the volume scattering does not increases if the debris is thicker than 25 cm. In contrast, the C-band SAR data does not appear to be sensitive to debris thickness. This difference may be caused by different radar penetration depth of the debris. On the basis of the polarimetric property analysis, two methods were developed to determine the extent of the debris. In the first method, the simple threshold to distinguish debris from non-debris areas is presented. Using this threshold, approximately 90% of the debris can be recognized. In the second method, by combining more polarimetric features and support vector machines, recognition of debris reaches an accuracy greater than 95%.

The amplitude of diurnal warming is computed from the difference between subskin and foundation temperature estimates derived independently from the Argo and SEVIRI data. The results demonstrate remarkable consistency between the observations, lending support for both products and the associated methodologies, particularly for the estimation of the foundation temperature. Individual subskin values agree to within an absolute mean difference of <= 0.1 K and standard deviations of the differences are <0.4 K. Statistics for comparison of the foundation temperatures are similar. Differences between the corresponding derived estimates of diurnal warming have negligible bias and standard deviations <0.25 K. The strong agreement of the diurnal warming estimates exists even when excluding nearly isothermal profiles, suggesting the differences are robust to small spatial offsets and point-to-pixel differences. The results particularly support the ability of the modified Argo floats to provide reliable, and highly valuable, measurements of the near-surface temperature, helping to argue for more modified floats. Moreover, the results suggest that the unpumped Argo data has the potential to provide an independent estimate of the foundation temperature for validation of SST analyses. The method for estimating the foundation temperature from SEVIRI represents a good compromise between data coverage and influences of cloud contamination and nighttime cooling. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Multiple current and planned satellite missions are designed to quantify atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations on a global scale, but most of these sensors do not have the spatial resolution necessary to resolve point sources such as fossil fuel power plants. Airborne imaging spectrometer data, such as those from the Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), can have multiple, contiguous bands covering shortwave infrared (SWIR) absorption features produced by carbon dioxide. Therefore, high spatial resolution data from AVIRIS-like sensors may offer a means for detecting plumes and retrieving carbon dioxide concentrations for point source emissions. The objectives of this study include modeling minimum carbon dioxide anomalies detectable in AVIRIS data under different conditions and applying a Cluster-Tuned Matched Filter for detection of carbon dioxide plumes in simulated data and in AVIRIS images acquired over power plants. Radiative transfer simulations were used to model the residual radiance produced by increased absorption by carbon dioxide as concentration was elevated above background levels within a 0-500 m layer. Carbon dioxide anomalies, surface reflectance, water vapor concentration, solar zenith angle, sensor height, and aerosol scattering were varied in simulation sets and the resulting residual radiance spectra were compared against noise equivalent delta radiance (NEdL) for the \"classic\" and \"next generation\" AVIRIS instruments. Sensitivity to carbon dioxide anomalies improved with increased surface reflectance and declined with increased water vapor concentration, solar zenith angle, sensor height, and aerosol scattering. Zero to 500 m concentration anomalies as low as 100 parts per milion by volume (ppm) for AVIRIS C and 25 ppm for AVIRIS NG produced residual radiance values that exceeded SWIR NEdL Carbon dioxide concentrations modeled for a generic power plant emissions scenario using a plume dispersion model were combined with randomly-generated reflectance spectra to create simulated images with varying surface reflectance and NEdL For these simulated images, true positive and false positive detection rates improved as background reflectance increased and as NEdL decreased. Apparent plumes were detected in all four AVIRIS C images acquired over power plants, although the characteristics of the plumes varied according to solar-plume-sensor geometry. Improvements in modeling may allow retrieval of plume concentration, providing a valuable means for quantifying point source emissions and a basis for comparison with column concentrations retrieved from in situ measurements and coarse resolution satellite data.

Its estimation however is complicated due to the large number of input variables such as height and arrangement of roughness elements on the surface, and its measurement relies on complex micrometeorological instrumentation that is typically unavailable. One remote sensing technology well suited to measuring the height of objects is light detection and ranging (LiDAR). This study demonstrates the use of pre- and post-harvest LiDAR data to quantify the aerodynamic roughness of a post-harvest forest surface. LiDAR data were acquired before and after clearcut harvesting of a 77-ha Douglas-fir dominated site on Vancouver Island, for which a micrometeorological tower provided direct year-long measurements of shear or Reynolds stress (i.e., momentum flux) and wind speed, thus permitting the independent assessment of z(0) using the logarithmic wind profile equation.   The LiDAR data were used to estimate z(0) based on the standard deviation of roughness element heights within the source areas of the micrometeorological tower. Estimated z(0) from the LiDAR analysis compared well to z(0) calculated using the micrometeorological measurements. The standard deviation of roughness element height estimated from the LiDAR analysis resulted in z(0) = 0.13 +/- 0.01 m (mean +/- SD) for neutral atmospheric stability conditions and z(0) = 0.13 0.01 m for all stability conditions. The value of z(0) calculated using the logarithmic wind profile equation was 0.13 0.13 m for neutral conditions and 0.12 +/- 0.30 m for all stability conditions after applying diabatic profile corrections. The results from this study demonstrate the potential of using LiDAR data to estimate z(0) across large areas and in complex situations where direct measurements of z(0) are impossible.

The present study makes progress in demonstrating the relationship between steady-state fluorescence and net photosynthesis measured under natural light field conditions both at the leaf and image levels. Ground measurements and airborne campaigns were conducted over two summers to acquire hyperspectral imagery at 40 cm resolution and 260 spectral bands in the 400-885 nm spectral region. This enabled the identification of pure vegetation pixels to extract their radiance spectra. The datasets were collected in August 2010 and 2011 in the western part of the area included in the Ribera del Duero Designation of Origin (Denominacion de Origen), in northern Spain. The experiments were conducted in twelve full production vineyards where two study plots per field were selected to ensure adequate variability in leaf biochemistry and physiological condition. The vineyard fields were selected on the basis of their gradient in leaf nutrition and plant water status and showed variability in leaf pigment values and stomatal conductance. Leaves were collected for destructive sampling and biochemical determination of chlorophyll a + b, carotenoids and anthocyanins in the laboratory. Leaf steady-state and dark-adapted fluorescence parameters, net photosynthesis (P-n) and stomata( conductance (G(s)) were measured in the field under natural light conditions. Such data were used as a validation dataset to assess fluorescence-photosynthesis relationships both at the leaf and the image level. The Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) principle based on three spectral bands (FLD3) was the method used to quantify fluorescence emission from radiance spectra extracted from pure vegetation pixels identified in the hyperspectral imagery. Fluorescence retrievals conducted using the FLD3 method yielded significant results when compared to ground-measured steady-state F-s (r(2) = 0.48; p < 0.01) and F-v\'/F-m\' (r(2) = 0.53; p < 0.01). The two-year assessment yielded consistent results on the relationship between P-n and F-s both at the leaf level and based on the airborne hyperspectral imagery. At the leaf level, significant relationships were found between leaf F-s and P-n (r(2) = 0.55; p < 0.001 for 2010; r(2) = 0.59; p < 0.001 for 2011). At the hyperspectral image level, the agreement between leaf P-n, and airborne F was consistent for both years separately, yielding significant relationships at p < 0.01 for 2010 (r(2) = 0.54) and 2011 (r(2) = 0.41) and a significant relationship at p < 0.001 for the aggregated years (r(2) = 0.52). Results show the link between net photosynthesis and steady-state fluorescence obtained under natural sunlight conditions at both leaf and airborne hyperspectral imagery levels.

The method uses a single digital camera to create a high-resolution digital terrain model (pixel size of similar to 1.32 mm) by means of a free open-source stereovision software. It is based on an auto-calibration process, which calculates the 3D geometry of the images, and an efficient multi-image correlation algorithm. The method is successfully applied to four different volcanic surfaces namely, a\'a lava flows, pahoehoe lava flows, slabby pahoehoe lava flows, and lapilli deposits. These surfaces were sampled in the Piton de la Foumaise volcano (Reunion Island) in October, 2011, and displayed various terrain roughnesses. Our in situ measurements allow deriving digital terrain models that reproduce the millimeter-scale height variations of the surfaces over about 12 m(2). Five parameters characterizing surface topography are derived along unidirectional profiles: the root-mean-square height (xi), the correlation length (L-c), the ratio Z(s) = xi(2)/L-c, the tortuosity index (t), and the fractal dimension (D). Anisotropy in the surface roughness has been first investigated using 1-m-long profiles circularly arranged around a central point. The results show that L-c, Z(s) and D effectively catch preferential directions in the structure of bare surfaces. Secondly, we studied the variation of these parameters as a function of the profile length by drawing random profiles from 1 to 12 m in length. We verified that xi and L-c increase with the profile length and, therefore, are not appropriate to characterize surface roughness variation. We conclude that Z(s) and D are better suited to extract roughness information for multiple eruptive terrains with complex surface texture. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Our ability to effectively monitor ecosystem change and the carbon cycle in this region depends upon the development of robust and reliable methods of extracting information about fire events and the characterization of fire impacts from remotely-sensed data. Previously developed and routinely applied remote sensing methods yield poor results in assessing the extent and severity of burning in tundra. Here we present an analysis of temporal trends in spectral signatures of burned and unburned areas of tussock tundra obtained from Landsat imagery within six fire events of the 2010 fire season in the Noatak Nature Preserve in Alaska. The analysis revealed a large variability in surface reflectance of burned and unburned areas across space and time. We established that spectral signatures of fire scars can be well separated by both single- and multi-date mapping approaches immediately after burning. However, the spectral signature of burned areas in tundra deteriorates rapidly and, in our study, is poorly distinguishable by the end of the first post-fire season. Our results showed that common mapping methods based on the normalized burn ratio were inferior to other spectral indices (Tasseled Cap Greenness and Brightness) and single Landsat bands (near-infrared) in separating burned and unburned areas as well as in mapping burn severity.

Shifts in marine ecosystem composition driven by changes in climate can in turn affect biogeochemical cycles, especially through their impact on air-sea fluxes of CO2 and trace gas concentrations in the atmosphere. However, the response of marine ecosystems to climate is difficult to assess at global scale due to the scarcity of large-scale in-situ biological monitoring programmes. Here, we combine and analyse remote-sensing observations, in-situ observations, and a global ocean biogeochemistry model to gain insight into interactions between marine ecosystem composition and climate variability over the last decade, in the North Atlantic and in the Southern Ocean. Our results show large-scale shifts in the dominance of diatoms, with mean anomalies 63.3% higher during extreme positive phases of North Atlantic Oscillation index compared to its extreme negative phases and with mean anomalies 134% higher during extreme positive phases of Southern Annular Mode in the Southern Ocean over the period 1998-2008. Significant changes in the frequency of diatom dominance are detected concurrently in the three data sources studied. Model outputs indicate that this increase is driven by nutrient supply from deep waters during windier and more turbulent climate conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Large-scale SCM practices are at the center of an environmental and legal controversy that has spawned lawsuits and major environmental investigations. SCM techniques extract multiple coal seams by removing an area of many square kilometers and creating serious environmental problems. Information about mining activities location is essential for environmental applications, specifically the temporal and spatial patterns of land cover/land use change (LCLUC). Advancements in satellite imagery analysis provide possibilities to investigate new approaches for LCLUC detection caused by SCM globally. However there is no study that analyzes the changes produced for SCM at a global scale. Our work examines three areas of coal extraction in the world: Spain, United States of America (USA), and Australia. We used Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) applied to Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data to map SCM affected area. Endmember spectra of vegetation, soil, and impervious surfaces were collected from the Landsat TM image with the help of a fine resolution orthophotographs and the pixel purity index (PPI). Reference endmembers from an Airborne Visible-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) spectral library were utilized as well. An unsupervised classifier was applied to the fraction images to obtain an estimation of active SCM affected area. Classification accuracy was reported using error matrixes and kappa statistic using active SCM affected area perimeters digitized from fine resolution orthophotographs as reference data. In addition, we compared the accuracy of the MESMA based estimation to estimates using Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA), and a spectral index traditionally used as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) testing statistical significance using a Z-test of their kappa Statistics. Results showed a Significant improvement in the accuracy Of the SCM affected area using MESMA with an average increase of the kappa statistic of 31%. We conclude that MESMA-based approach is effective in mapping SCM active affected area. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, vegetation sampling over large areas from a sufficient density of field plots to quantify fine-grained heterogeneity in canopy structure is logistically difficult, labor-intensive, time-consuming and costly, particularly in remote areas of tropical forests. We used airborne waveform light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data acquired over the southeastern Peruvian Amazon in combination with detailed field data on a population of bald-faced saki monkeys (Pithecia irrorata) to assess the utility of LiDAR-derived indices of canopy structure in describing parameters of preferred forest types for this arboreal primate. Forest structure parameters represented by LiDAR measurements were significantly different between home range areas used by sakis and those that were not used. Home range areas used by sakis represented a predictable subset of available forest areas, generally those containing the tallest and most uniform canopies. Differences observed within a 335-ha focal area occupied by five previously habituated and systematically followed study groups were consistent across the wider study landscape (6,400 ha): sakis were missing from areas of low-statured, heterogeneous canopies, but they occupied adjacent areas dominated by taller and less variable canopies. These findings provide novel insights into the relationship between vegetation structure and habitat use by a tropical arboreal vertebrate and demonstrate that high-resolution, three-dimensional remote sensing measurements can be useful in predicting habitat occupancy and selection by forest canopy species.

The objective of this paper is to estimate changes of agriculturally-relevant growing season parameters, including the start of the season, length of the growing period and the position of the height or peak of the season, in the primary regions with rainfed agriculture during the past 26 years. Our analysis found that globally, 27% of cereal crop areas have experienced changes in the length of the growing season since 1981, the majority of which had seasons that were at least 2.3 days per year longer on average. We also found both negative and positive trends in the start of season globally, with different effects of changing temperature and humidity being isolated depending on the country and region. We investigated the correlation between the peak timing of the growing season and agricultural production statistics for rain fed agriculture. We found that two thirds of the countries investigated had at least 25% of pixels with crop production that behaved differently than expected from the null hypothesis of no correlation. The results show that variations in the peak of the growing season have a strong effect on global food production in these countries. We show that northern hemisphere countries and states appear to have improved model fit when using phenological models based on humidity while southern hemisphere countries and states have improved model fit by phenological models based on accumulated growing degree days, showing the impact of climate variability during the past two and a half decades.

The objective of this study was to determine the most suitable algorithm, using hyperspectral reflectance data, for the regional assessment of CNC at a critical growth stage in paddy rice. Ground-based hyperspectral datasets were obtained during the panicle formation stage under a wide range of plant and environmental conditions in Japan and China using spectroradiometers. A hyperspectral airborne dataset was obtained over a typical rice-growing region in Japan using the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager 3 (CASI-3). On the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the hyperspectral data, significant spectral indices (SIs) such as the normalized difference spectral index (NDSI) and ratio spectral index (RSI) were explored to provide an accurate and robust assessment of CNC. The capability of multivariable regression approaches, such as partial least-squares regression (PLSR) using the whole hyperspectral data or interval PLSR (IPLSR) using selected wavebands was also examined. Among various SIs, a simple index, RSI (D740, D522) using the first derivative (D) values at 740 nm and 522 nm, was found to be most accurate and robust for the assessment of CNC. The predictive ability of the index was comparable to those of PLSR and IPLSR. Independent validation using the airborne dataset supported the robust applicability of the new SI. The CNC was closely related to the conventional diagnostic indicators based on direct plant measurements. The results demonstrated the operational applicability of hyperspectral measurements for diagnostic mapping of CNC on a regional scale. The investigation based on the precise dataset for rice will be a good basis for remote sensing of canopy nitrogen content in a wide range of vegetation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, the Radar-Lidar Geometrical Profile product (RL-GEOPROF) provides cloud vertical profiles from the combination of active lidar and radar. Based on this data product for the period July 2006 to March 2011, this paper presents a new cloud macrophysical property characteristic analysis for the Arctic, including cloud occurrence fraction (COF), vertical distributions, and probability density functions (PDF) of cloud base and top heights. Seasonal mean COF shows maximum values in autumn, minimum values in winter, and moderate values in spring and summer; this seasonality is more prominent over the Arctic Ocean on the Pacific side. The mean ratios of multi-layer cloud to total cloud over the ocean and land are between 24% and 28%. Low-level COFs are higher over ocean than over land. The ratio of low-level cloud to total cloud is also higher over ocean. Middle-level and high-level COFs are smaller over ocean than over land except in summer, and the ratios of middle-level and high-level clouds to total cloud are also smaller over ocean. Over the central Arctic Ocean, PDFs of cloud top height and cloud bottom height show (1) two cloud top height PDF peaks, one for cloud top heights lower than 1200 m and another between 7 and 9 km; and (2) high frequency for cloud base below 1000 m with the majority of cloud base heights lower than 2000 m.

Image-objects (IOs) were used as the tree species mapping unit. A stepwise masking protocol was developed to separate sunlit and shadow/shaded tree canopy IOs from the study area prior to tree species mapping. Comparative analyses examined average accuracies of tree species mapping results between four-band IKO imagery and three different band combinations of WV2 imagery: four \"traditional\" bands, four additional bands, and all eight bands. Linear Discriminant Analysis and Classification and Regression Trees were used to classify IOs using selected 10 features derived from IKO and band combinations of WV2 imagery. With the exception of sand live oak mapping result (due to phenological difference due to image collection dates), validation results indicate significantly improved mapping accuracies using all combinations of WV2 imagery (p<0.01). Results using independent validation samples demonstrated that average accuracy was increased by 16-18% using WV2 imagery compared to that using IKO imagery when considering mapping 6-species/group. Improved results with the WV2 sensor could be attributed to improved spatial resolution (4 m to 2 m) and additional bands (coastal, yellow, red-edge and NIR2). (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The relative RMSEs obtained for the TopEye and Optech data after leave-one-out cross-validation were, respectively, 8.8% and 9.5% for maximum tree height; 18.7% and 21.2% for above ground tree biomass; and, 16.8% and 18.7% for vertical canopy cover on plot level. The results were clearly improved by introducing a new procedure to compensate for unevenly distributed laser points. In conclusion, ALS has strong potential as a data source to map mountain birch biomass in the forest-tundra ecotone, even when using sparse point density ALS data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

At the same time, many countries are on a trajectory of increasing forest cover, and secondary, plantation, and scrub forests are a growing proportion of global forest cover. Remote sensing is a crucial tool for understanding how forests change in response to forest protection strategies and economic development, but most forest monitoring with satellite imagery does not distinguish old-growth forest from other forest types. Our goal was to measure changes in forest types, and especially old-growth forests, in the biodiversity hotspot of northwest Yunnan in southwest China. Northwest Yunnan is one of the poorest regions in China, and since the 1990s, the Chinese government has legislated strong forest protection and fostered the growth of ecotourism-based economic development. We used Landsat TM/ETM+ and MSS images, Support Vector Machines, and a multi-temporal composite classification technique to analyze change in forest types and the loss of old-growth forest in three distinct periods of forestry policy and ecotourism development from 1974 to 2009. Our analysis showed that logging rates decreased substantially from 1974 to 2009, and the proportion of forest cover increased from 62% in 1990 to 64% in 2009. However, clearing of high-diversity old-growth forest accelerated, from approximately 1100 hectares/year before the logging ban (1990 to 1999), to 1550 hectares/year after the logging ban (1999 to 2009). Paradoxically, old-growth forest clearing accelerated most rapidly where ecotourism was most prominent. Despite increasing overall forest cover, the proportion of old-growth forests declined from 26% in 1990, to 20% in 2009. The majority of forests cleared from 1974 to 1990 returned to either a non-forested land cover type (14%) or non-pine scrub forest (66%) in 2009, and our results suggest that most non-pine scrub forest was not on a successional trajectory towards high-diversity forest stands. That means that despite increasing forest cover, biodiversity likely continues to decline, a trend obscured by simple forest versus non-forest accounting. It also means that rapid development may pose inherent risks to biodiversity, since our study area arguably represents a \"best-case scenario\" for balancing development with maintenance of biodiversity, given strong forest protection policies and an emphasis on ecotourism development.

While industry is limited, over 70% of the territory is covered by forests, which can potentially be used to attract investment through forest-based projects that promote reductions in carbon emissions and sustainable management. These can be leveraged by producing accurate maps of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) at national level and by developing cost-effective mapping methods that allow reliable future updating for management and engagement in international mechanisms such as the United Nations (UN) Collaborative Program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) in developing countries.   Using data from Japan\'s Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), this study compared a semi-empirical and machine learning algorithm, with the latter based on bagging stochastic gradient boosting (BagSGB), for retrieving the AGB of woody vegetation thereby supporting estimation of national carbon stocks. AGB was estimated by using measurements of tree size collected from112 forest plots during two field campaigns (2007 and 2008) as input to published allometric equations.   The BagSGB outperformed the semi-empirical algorithm, resulting in a coefficient of correlation (R) between observed and cross-validation predicted forest AGB values of 0.95 and in a root mean square error (RMSE) of 26.62 Mg ha(-1). Furthermore, the BagSGB model produced also a measure of forest AGB prediction variability (coefficient of variation) on a pixel-by-pixel basis, with values ranging from 7 to 250% (mean = 42%). An estimate of total forest AGB carbon stock of 96.93 Mt C was obtained in this study for Guinea-Bissau, with a mean forest AGB value of 65.17 Mg ha(-1). Although the mean error associated with this forest AGB map is still undesirably high, several issues were addressed. The heterogeneity of forest structural types, presence of palm trees, and dimension and type of field plots were identified as potential source of uncertainty that must be tackled in future studies. This study represents a step forward regarding the information currently available for Guinea-Bissau. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Carreiras, Joao M.

The planned NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission has unique requirements compared to previous soil moisture satellite programs because both active and passive microwave observations are needed. The primary source of these combined observations has been an aircraft-based SMAP simulator called PALS (Passive and Active L-band System). This paper presents an overview of the field experiment data collected using PALS that spans 10 years. Data from the various campaigns were merged to form a single data set. Analyses showed that the data set contains an extensive range of soil moisture values collected under a variety of conditions and that the quality of both the PALS and ground truth data meets the needs of SMAP algorithm development and validation. The study suggests that the data set should be expanded in order to achieve globally representative land cover diversity and that more observations under dense vegetation conditions and longer time series would be desirable.

The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) is a promising sensor for measuring and monitoring grasslands due to its high spectral resolution, medium spatial resolution and a two- to three-day repeat cycle. However, thus far the multi-biome MERIS land products have limited consistency with in-situ measurements of leaf area index (LAI), while the multi-biome canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) has not been validated yet with in-situ data. This study proposes a single-biome approach to estimate grassland LAI (a surrogate of grass quantity) and leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and CCC (surrogates of grass quality) using the inversion of the PROSAIL model and MERIS reflectance. Both multi-biome and single-biome approaches were validated using two-season in-situ data sets and the temporal consistency was analyzed using time-series of MERIS data. The single-biome approach showed a consistently better performance for estimating LAI (R-2 = 0.70, root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.02, normalized RMSE (NRMSE) = 16%) and CCC (R-2 = 0.61, RMSE = 0.36, NRMSE = 23%) compared with the multi-biome approach (LAI: R-2 = 0.36, RMSE = 1.77, NRMSE = 28%; CCC: R-2 = 0.47, RMSE = 1.33, NRMSE = 84%). However, both single-biome and multi-biome approaches failed to retrieve LCC. The multi-biome LAI was overestimated at lower LAI values (<2) and saturated at higher LAI values (>= 4), and the multi-biome CCC was consistently overestimated through the whole data range. Similar temporal trajectories of grassland LAI and CCC estimates were observed using these two approaches, but the multi-biome trajectory consistently produced larger values than the single-biome trajectory. The spatio-temporal variation of grassland LAI and CCC estimated by the single-biome approach was shown to be closely associated with agricultural practices. Our results underline the potential of mapping grassland LAI and CCC using the PROSAIL model and MERIS satellite data. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, measuring vegetation structure across large areas is logistically difficult. Our goal was to evaluate the degree to which sample-point pixel values and image texture of remotely sensed data are associated with vegetation structure in a North American grassland-savanna-woodland mosaic. In the summers of 2008-2009 we collected vegetation structure measurements at 193 sample points from which we calculated foliage-height diversity and horizontal vegetation structure at Fort McCoy Military Installation, Wisconsin, USA. We also calculated sample-point pixel values and first- and second-order image texture measures, from two remotely sensed data sources: an infrared air photo (1-m resolution) and a Landsat TM satellite image (30-m resolution). We regressed foliage-height diversity against, and correlated horizontal vegetation structure with, sample-point pixel values and texture measures within and among habitats. Within grasslands, savanna, and woodland habitats, sample-point pixel values and image texture measures explained 26-60% of foliage-height diversity. Similarly, within habitats, sample-point pixel values and image texture measures were correlated with 40-70% of the variation of horizontal vegetation structure. Among habitats, the mean of the texture measure \'second-order contrast\' from the air photo explained 79% of the variation in foliage-height diversity while \'first-order variance\' from the air photo was correlated with 73% of horizontal vegetation structure. Our results suggest that sample-point pixel values and image texture measures calculated from remotely sensed data capture components of foliage-height diversity and horizontal vegetation structure within and among grassland, savanna, and woodland habitats. Vegetation structure, which is a key component of animal habitat, can thus be mapped using remotely sensed data. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The MODIS LAI product suite, containing the Terra Collection 4 (C4), Terra Collection 5 (C5) and Terra + Aqua combined C5, was analyzed, with considerable attention paid to the quality control (QC) information. The CYCLOPES V3.1 LAI product was similarly analyzed with regard to the status map (SM) layer. In general, the MODIS LAI has improved consistently over all releases. MODIS C5 data retrieved with the main algorithm (QC<64) and CYCLOPES data showed a similar range of uncertainties (1.0-1.2). Uncertainties for the best MODIS C5 (QC= 0) and CYCLOPES (SM =0) estimates were around 0.9-1.1. The overall mean differences between the best MODIS C5 and CYCLOPES were within +/- 0.10. The highest correspondence was obtained for woody biomes from the best MCD15 C5 data (RMSE = 0.80). Results indicate that the uncertainties in current LA! products (around +/- 1.0) are still unable to meet the accuracy requirement of GCOS (+/- 0.5). Although there are limitations, we recommend MODIS C5 retrieved with the main algorithm (QC<64) and CYCLOPES for the user community. This study demonstrates the necessity of exploring uncertainties related to the true and effective LA\'s separately, and reveals the importance of referring to the quality assessment information. More field measurements are required for further studies, which should focus on under-sampled biome types and areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

A comprehensive, tiered, three-step approach is proposed as the most effective and affordable means to determine the spatial extent and scale of SGD from coastal aquifers to the coastal margin. As the preliminary step, Sea Surface Temperature (SST) values derived from Landsat ETM + TIR are used to successfully detect plumes of colder water eventually associated with SGD in close proximity to the shoreline. Subsequently, potential sites of SGD are linked to geological features on land acting as possible sources, by combining within a Geographical Information System (GIS), mapped temperature anomalies with ancillary on-shore spatial datasets describing bedrock geology including aquifer fault lines. Finally, nearshore surveys mapping the activity of Rn-222 (radon) and salinity are carried out to verify the presence of SGD and provide a qualitative assessment of fresh groundwater inputs to the coastal zone.   Practical application of the complete approach in the context of coastal zone management is illustrated through a case-study of the Republic of Ireland. As part of this study, over 30 previously unidentified links between aquifers on land and the sea are shown along the Irish coast, hence illustrating the tight coupling between coastal waters and groundwater inputs at an unprecedented spatial scale. The study demonstrates the potential of the combined applications of remote sensing methods and geochemical tracing techniques for a cost-effective regional-scale assessment of groundwater discharge to coastal waters.

Levee geometric parameters (levee crown width, height and water and landside slopes) were extracted from 0.5 m resolution LiDAR derived digital ground models. Deviation of these parameters from minimum levee design standards was used to calculate a levee stability index. Stability maps were generated and those areas that did not meet USACE geometric shape standards were identified. Results show that 2 out of the 4 geometric parameters do not meet the minimum value required in 48% and 43% of profiles on the east (urban adjacent) and west (farmland adjacent) margins respectively. Most importantly, the crown width in 99% of the levee profiles located on the urban side was below the minimum required.

The spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) is an algorithm that fuses Landsat 30 m data with MODIS 500 m data to produce synthetic imagery at Landsat spatial resolution and MODIS time steps. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using STARFM to produce synthetic imagery over a dryland vegetation study site for the purpose of tracking phenological changes. We assembled subsets of six Landsat-5 TM scenes and temporally-coincident MODIS datasets spanning the 2006 April-October growing season in central-northern Arizona, which is characterized by large tracts of dryland forest. To investigate the effects of temporal compositing, BRDF-adjustment, and base pair timing on the accuracy of the resulting synthetic imagery, we employed a range of MODIS 500 m surface reflectance datasets (daily, 8-day composite, and 16-day Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR)) as well as initial Landsat/MODIS imagery pairs from opposite ends of the growing season. The STARFM algorithm was applied to each MODIS data series to produce up to twelve synthetic images corresponding to each Landsat image. We evaluated the accuracy of the synthetic images by comparing the reflectance values of a random sample of the vegetation pixels with the corresponding pixel values of the reference Landsat image on a band-by-band basis. Our results indicate that the NBAR imagery is the optimal dataset for use with Landsat-5 TM data in this area. The NBAR dataset consistently returned the lowest absolute difference values and the highest correlations. A comparison of landscape-scale maps of the timing and value of the peak NDVI derived from STARFM, Landsat, and MODIS (NBAR) time series across the full 2006 growing season shows the effect of the heightened spatial and temporal resolution offered by a STARFM-based dataset This work demonstrates the feasibility of using the STARFM algorithm to assemble an imagery time series at Landsat spatial resolution and MODIS temporal resolution in vegetated dryland ecosystems.

This paper describes the opportunities provided by the Medspiration system for facilitating the complementary use of SST products from AATSR and from other satellite sensors. It explains how, following the implementation by Medspiration of GHRSST procedures, data products and tools, AATSR data are now being used around the world to complement the use of other sources of SST and to facilitate bias adjustments between them. Despite the limited daily coverage of AATSR its broadly reliable accuracy and stability seem to be beneficial to SST analyses that merge all available observations. The new analyses are already contributing to improved ocean and weather forecasting. This represents an unforeseen but significant role for the ATSR series, through which it continues to make an important contribution to the operational uses of SST. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Often climate indices are used to relate Sahelian vegetation variability to large-scale ocean-atmosphere phenomena. However, previous research findings reporting on the Sahelian vegetation response to climate indices have been inconsistent and contradictory, which could partly be caused by the variations in spatial extent/definitions of climate indices and size of the region studied. The aim of this study was to analyze the linkage between climate indices, pixel-wise spatio-temporal patterns of global sea surface temperature and the Sahelian vegetation dynamics for 1982-2007. We stratified the Sahel into five subregions to account for the longitudinal variability in rainfall. We found significant correlations between climate indices and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the Sahel, however with different magnitudes in terms of strength for the western, central and eastern Sahel. Also the correlations based on NDVI and global SST anomalies revealed the same East-West gradient, with a stronger association for the western than the eastern Sahel. Warmer than average SSTs throughout the Mediterranean basin seem to be associated with enhanced greenness over the central Sahel whereas colder than average SSTs in the Pacific and warmer than average SSTs in the eastern Atlantic were related to increased greenness in the most western Sahel. Accordingly, we achieved high correlations for SSTs of oceanic basins which are geographically associated to the climate indices yet by far not always these patterns were coherent. The detected SST-NDVI patterns could provide the basis to develop new means for improved forecasts in particular of the western Sahelian vegetation productivity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The landslide boundary monitoring was achieved and zones of uplift and subsidence, volumes of removed and/or accumulated material, and average rates of vertical and horizontal displacement (retreat rate of the crown and advancement rate of the toe) were estimated. Deformation structures (scarps, cracks, folds) affecting the landslide in different times were also mapped: some of such structures represent precursors of impending instability processes or give information on the mechanism of emplacement. Various types of activity (e.g. rock-fall, flow) and geometry (e.g., channelized flow) are recognized and zones whose topographic features change with time due to artificial drainage and earth handling/removal work were detected.

A multisensor fusion approach is here proposed to improve the spatio-temporal continuity, consistency and accuracy of current satellite products. It is based on the use of neural networks, gap filling and temporal smoothing techniques. It is applicable to any optical sensor and satellite product. In this study, the potential of this technique was demonstrated for leaf area index (LAI) product based on MODIS and VEGETATION reflectance data. The FUSION product showed an overall good agreement with the original MODIS LAI product but exhibited a reduction of 90% of the missing LAI values with an improved monitoring of vegetation dynamics, temporal smoothness, and better agreement with ground measurements.

The technique is based on simple yet highly accurate approximations of the asymptotic solutions of the radiative transfer theory which have already been implemented in the forward radiative transfer model CLOUD. These approximations enable a solution of the equations of the corresponding backward model during runtime leading to a very fast computation speed. Since these asymptotic solutions are generally applicable to weakly absorbing media only, pre-calculated look-up tables for the reflection function of a semi-infinite cloud (and also the escape function) are used to overcome this restriction within this new retrieval. SLALOM is capable of retrieving the cloud optical thickness, the effective cloud droplet radius, the liquid and ice water paths, the particle absorption length as well as some other properties of water and ice clouds.

High elevation biomes cover twenty percent of the Earth\'s land surface and provide essential natural resources. These areas experience limited resource availability for plant growth, development, and reproduction, and are one of the first ecosystems to reflect the harmful impact of climate change. Despite this, the phenology of mountain ecosystems has historically been understudied due to the rough and variable terrain and inaccessibility of the area. In addition, although numerous studies have used synoptically sensed data to study phenological patterns at the continental and global scales, relatively few have focused on characterizing the land surface phenology in mountainous areas. Here we use the MODIS/Ferra + Aqua satellite 8-day 500 m Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance product to quantify the land surface phenology. We relate independent data for elevation, slope, aspect, solar radiation, and temperature as well as longitude and latitude with the derived phenology estimates. We present that satellite derived SOS can be predicted based on topographic and weather variables with a significant R(2)adj between 0.56 and 0.62 for the entire western mountain range. Elevation and latitude exhibit the most significant influences on the timing of SOS throughout our study area. When examined at both the local and regional scales, as well as when accounting for aspect and temperature, SOS follows closely with Hopkins\' Bioclimatic Law with respect to elevation and latitude.

This study investigated background influences on VIs applied to intertidal microphytobenthos, using a synthetic spectral library constituted by a spectral combination of three contrasting types of sediment (sand, fine sand, and mud) and reflectance spectra of benthic diatom monospecific cultures obtained in controlled conditions. The spectral database exhibited, for the same biomass range (3-182 mg chlorophyll am(-2)), marked differences in albedo and spectral contrast linked to sediment variability in water content, grain size, and organic matter content. Several VIs were evaluated, from ratios using visible and near infrared wavelengths, to hyperspectral indices (derivative analysis, continuum removal). Among the ratios, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) appeared less sensitive to background effects than VIs with soil corrections such as the Perpendicular Vegetation Index (PVI), the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), the Modified second Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI2) or the Transformed Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (TSAVI). The lower efficacy of soil-corrected VIs may be explained by the structural differences and optical behavior of soil vs. canopies compared to sediment vs. microphytobenthos biofilms. The background effects were minimized using Modified Gaussian Model indices at 632 nm and 675 nm, and the second derivative at 632 nm, while poor results were obtained with the red-edge inflection point (REIP) and the second derivative at 675 nm. The least sensitive index was the Phytobenthos Index which is very similar to the NDVI, but uses a red wavelength at 632 nm instead of 675 nm, to account for the absorption by chlorophyll c. The modified NDVI705, where the 705 nm wavelength replaces the red band, showed moderate background sensitivity. Moreover, the NDVI705 and the Phytobenthos Index have the additional relevant property of being less sensitive to the index saturation response with increasing biomass. Unfortunately, these VIs cannot be applied to broad-band multispectral satellite images, and require sensors with a hyperspectral resolution. Nevertheless, this study showed that the background influence was not a limitation to applying the ubiquitous NDVI to map intertidal microphytobenthos using multispectral satellite images.

All models adjust the surface resistances or provide ecophysiological constraints to account for changing environmental factors. Evaporation (or sublimation) over snow-covered regions is calculated consistently for all models using a modified Penman equation. Instantaneous fluxes of latent heat computed at the time of satellite overpass are linearly scaled to the equivalent daily evapotranspiration using the computed evaporative fraction and the day-time net radiation. A constant fraction (10% of daytime evaporation) is used to account for the night time evaporation. Interception losses are computed using a simple water budget model. We produce daily evapotranspiration and sensible heat flux for the global land surface at 5 km spatial resolution for the period 2003-2006. With the exception of wind and surface pressure, all model inputs and forcings are obtained from satellite remote sensing.   Satellite-based inputs and model outputs were first carefully evaluated at the site scale on a monthly-mean basis, then as a four-year mean against a climatological estimate of ET over 26 major basins, and finally in terms of a latitudinal profile on an annual basis. Intercomparison of the monthly model estimates of latent and sensible heat fluxes with 12 eddy-covariance towers across the U.S. yielded mean correlation of 0.57 and 0.54, respectively. Satellite-based meteorological datasets of 2 m temperature (0.83), humidity (0.70), incident shortwave radiation (0.64), incident longwave radiation (0.67) were found to agree well at the tower scale, while estimates of wind speed correlated poorly (0.17). Comparisons of the four year mean annual ET for 26 global river basins and global latitudinal profiles with a climatologically estimated ET resulted in a Kendall\'s tau>0.70. The seasonal cycle over the continents is well represented in the How-libeller plots and the suppression of ET during major droughts in Europe, Australia and the Amazon are well picked up. This study provides the first ever moderate resolution estimates of ET on a global scale using only remote sensing based inputs and forcings, and furthermore the first ever multi-model comparison of process-based remote sensing estimates using the same inputs.

In these semi-arid and cold regions with sparse meteorological networks, remote sensing and topographic modeling are of potential interest for understanding how physiography influences the local climate regime. After integrating night land surface temperature from the MODIS satellite, and physiographic descriptors derived from a digital elevation model, we explored how regional and landscape-scale features influence frost occurrence in the southern altiplano of Bolivia. Based on the high correlation between night land surface temperature and minimum air temperature, frost occurrence in early-, middle- and late-summer periods were calculated from satellite observations and mapped at a 1-km resolution over a 45,000 km(2) area. Physiographic modeling of frost occurrence was then conducted comparing multiple regression (MR) and boosted regression trees (BRT). Physiographic predictors were latitude, elevation, distance from salt lakes, slope steepness, potential insolation, and topographic convergence. Insolation influence on night frost was tested assuming that ground surface warming in the daytime reduces frost occurrence in the next night. Depending on the time period and the calibration domain. BRT models explained 74% to 90% of frost occurrence variation, outperforming the MR method. Inverted BRT models allowed the downscaling of frost occurrence maps at 100-m resolution, illustrating local processes like cold air drainage. Minimum temperature lapse rates showed seasonal variation and mean values higher than those reported for temperate mountains. When applied at regional and subregional scales successively, BRT models revealed prominent effects of elevation, latitude and distance to salt lakes at large scales, whereas slope, topographic convergence and insolation gained influence at local scales. Our results highlight the role of daytime insolation on night frost occurrence at local scale, particularly in the early- and mid-summer periods when solar astronomic forcing is maximum. Seasonal variations and interactions in physiographic effects are also shown. Nested effects of physiographic factors across scales are discussed, as well as potential applications of physiographic modeling to downscale ecological processes in complex terrains.

Crop residue retention is considered a soil conservation practice given that it reduces soil losses from water and wind erosion and promotes sequestration of carbon in the soil. Spectral unmixing estimates the fractional abundances of surface targets at a sub-pixel level and this technique could be helpful in mapping and monitoring residue cover. This study evaluated the accuracy with which spectral unmixing estimated percent crop residue cover using multispectral Landsat and SPOT data. Spectral unmixing produced crop residue estimates with root mean square errors of 17.29% and 20.74%, where errors varied based on residue type. The model performed best when estimating corn and small grain residue. Errors were higher on soybean fields, due to the lower spectral contrast between soil and soybean residue. Endmember extraction is a critical step to successful unmixing. Small gains in accuracy were achieved when using the purest crop residue- and soil-specific endmembers as inputs to the spectral unmixing model. To assist with operational implementation of crop residue monitoring, a simple endmember extraction technique is described.

The wakes were formed of not only meandering disturbances but also a series of eddies with diameters on the order of those of the islands. The Kuroshio flowed near these islands in the summer of 2006, indicating that the island wakes were induced by a Kuroshio-island interaction. Satellite sea-surface temperature (SST) and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) images observed during the summer of 2006 revealed low-SST and high Chl-a wakes, some of which included low-SST eddy trains. It is thus inferred that the phenomenon entailed upwelling and mixing processes and biological productivity known as the \"island-mass effect.\" High-spatial-resolution SST derived by combining a LANDSAT infrared channel and AVHRR SST clearly revealed a well-defined SST front associated with the island wakes and a 1 km-scale low-SST wake pattern. A numerical simulation was performed to investigate the formation mechanism. The simulation qualitatively reproduced the cold-eddy pattern, with eddy-driven mixing developing a mixed layer down to 200 m, causing low-SST island wakes. The shedding frequency and spacing of the model-produced eddies were roughly close to those of the Karman vortex theory, suggesting that Karman-type cold-eddy trains are commonly formed behind the islands when the Kuroshio strong flow impinges on them.

The microalgal biomass present in the photic zone of the sediment is a key parameter for ecological and photophysiological studies on microphytobenthos, and has been routinely estimated using hyperspectral reflectance indices based on the chlorophyll (Chl) a red absorption peak at 675 nm, usually the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This study reports that red region-based biomass indices measured on microphytobenthos biofilms can be significantly affected by the enrichment of reflected light with solar-induced Chl fluorescence emitted by the microalgae. Chl fluorescence emission peaks at 683 nm, counterbalancing the decrease in reflectance centered at 675 nm, thus causing the underestimation of NDVI. The interference of Chl fluorescence was found to be easily identified by a conspicuous double-peak feature in the 670-700 nm region of the second-derivative reflectance spectra. The fluorescence-induced NDVI underestimation was shown to be most pronounced for high surface biomass levels and low incident solar irradiance. Particular aspects of microphytobenthos biofilms, such as the increase in surface Chl fluorescence due the contribution of emission by subsurface layers, and vertical migratory responses by motile microalgae to changes in ambient light, further complicate the effects on biomass estimation using NDVI-like indices. By comparing NI)VI with a fluorescence-independent biomass index for a wide range of natural light conditions, it was found that Chl fluorescence interference may cause the underestimation of microalgal biomass to reach over 25%, with errors above 10% being expected for more than half of the measuring occasions. These results indicate that the use of NDVI may compromise the correct assessment of important aspects of microphytobenthos ecology, such as the characterisation of migratory behaviour or the determination of biomass-specific productivity rates, and call for the use of alternative biomass indices, not based on the Chl a red absorption peak.

Studies in this issue necessarily confront the universal challenges of scale, both spatial and temporal, and the sometimes tenuous link between observed patterns and significant ecological process. A clear message is that the information needs of resource managers require information across scales, and these information demands will continue to motivate advances in the collection and analysis of remotely sensed data. This compilation of papers is unusual in (1) articulating a basic, if somewhat technical, foundation of remote sensing that is required for resource managers to effectively collaborate with remote sensing specialists, and (2) providing a framework for addressing monitoring resource issues that is likely to be of interest to many remote sensing specialists.

Optical remotely sensed imagery (e.g., Landsat TM/ETM+), is well suited for capturing horizontally distributed forest conditions, structure, and change, while Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data are more appropriate for capturing vertically distributed elements of forest structure and change. The integration of optical remotely sensed imagery and LIDAR data provides improved opportunities to characterize post-fire conditions. The objective of this study is to compare changes in forest structure, as measured with a discrete return profiling LIDAR, to post-fire conditions, as measured with remotely sensed data. Our research is focused on a boreal forest fire that occurred in May 2002 in Alberta, Canada. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), the differenced NBR (dNBR), and the relative dNBR (RdNBR) were calculated from two dates of Landsat data (August 2001 and September 2002). Forest structural attributes were derived from two spatially coincident discrete return LIDAR profiles acquired in September 1997 and 2002 respectively. Image segmentation was used to produce homogeneous spatial patches analogous to forest stands, with analysis conducted at this patch level.   In this study area, which was relatively homogenous and dominated by open forest, no statistically significant relationships were found between pre-fire forest structure and post-fire conditions (r<0.5; p>0.05). Post-fire forest structure and absolute and relative changes in forest structure were strongly correlated to post-fire conditions (r ranging from -0.507 to 0.712; p<0.0001). Measures of vegetation fill (VF) (LIDAR capture of cross-sectional vegetation amount), post-fire and absolute change in crown closure (CC), and relative change in average canopy height, were most useful for characterizing post-fire conditions. Forest structural attributes generated from the post-fire LIDAR data were most strongly correlated to post-fire NBR, while dNBR and RdNBR had stronger correlations with absolute and relative changes in the forest structural attributes. Absolute and relative changes in VF and changes in CC had the strongest positive correlations with respect to dNBR and RdNBR, ranging from 0.514 to 0.715 (p<0.05). Measures of average inter-tree distance and volume were not strongly correlated to post-fire NBR, dNBR, or RdNBR. No marked differences were found in the strength or significance of correlations between post-fire structure and the post-fire NBR, dNBR, RdNBR, indicating that for the conditions present in this study area all three burn severity indices captured post-fire conditions in a similar manner. Finally, the relationship between post-fire forest structure and post-fire condition was strongest for dense forests (>60% crown closure) compared to open (26-60%) and sparse forests (10-25%). Forest structure information provided by LIDAR is useful for characterizing post-fire conditions and burn induced structural change, and will complement other attributes such as vegetation type and moisture, topography, and long-term weather patterns, all of which will also influence variations in post-fire conditions.

The remotely sensed data were sub-optimal due to high and mid-level cloud covers. Critical to the correct interpretation of the resultant coastal bathymetry map was the development of a quality control procedure based on additional outputs of the integrated physics based mapping approach and the characteristics of the instrument. These two outputs were: an optical closure term which defines differences between the image and model based remote sensing signal; and an estimate of the relative contribution of the substratum signal to the remote sensing signal. This quality control procedure was able to identify those pixels with a reliable retrieval of depth and to detect thin and thick clouds and their shadows, which were subsequently masked out from further analysis. The derived coastal bathymetry in depths ranging 4-13 m for the mapped area was within +/- 15% of boat-based multi-beam acoustic mapping survey of the same area. The agreement between the imaging spectrometry and the acoustic datasets varies as a function of the contribution of the bottom visibility to the remote sensing signal. As expected, there was greater agreement in shallower clear water (+/- 0.67 m) than quasi-optically deep water (+/- 1.35 m). The quantitative identification and screening of the optically deep waters and the quasi-optically deep waters led to improved precision in the depth retrieval. These results suggest that the physics based mapping approach adopted in this study performs well for retrieving water column depths in coastal waters in water depths ranging 4-13 m for the area and conditions studied, even with sub-optimal imagery.

Many limitations still exist to accurately characterizing wetland hydrology over large spatial extents, especially in forested wetlands. Imaging radar has emerged as a viable tool for wetland flood mapping, although the limitations of radar data remain uncertain. The influence of incidence angle on the ability to detect flooding in different forest types was examined using C-HH Radarsat-1 data (23.5 degrees, 27.5 degrees, 33.5 degrees, 39.0 degrees, 43.5 degrees, and 47.0 degrees) during the leaf-off and leaf-on seasons. The ability to detect flooding under leaf-on conditions varied much more according to incidence angle while forest type (open canopy tupelo-cypress, tupelo-cypress, and bottomland hardwood) had a greater effect during the leaf-off season. When all forest types were considered together, backscatter generally decreased with increasing incidence angle under all conditions (2.45 dB between 23.5 degrees and 47.0 degrees flooded, leaf-off; 2.28 dB between 23.5 degrees and 47.0 degrees not flooded, leaf-off; 0.62 between 23.5 degrees and 43.5 degrees flooded, leaf-on; 1.73 dB between 23.5 degrees and 43.5 degrees not flooded, leaf-on; slope was not constant between incidence angles), but the distinction between flooded and non-flooded areas did not decline sharply with incidence angle. Differentiation of flooded and non-flooded forests was similar during the leaf-off and leaf-on seasons. The ability to detect inundation under forest canopies was less than expected at smaller incidence angles and greater than expected at larger incidence angles, based on the results of previous studies. Use of a wider range of incidence angles during the entire year increases the temporal resolution of imagery which may, in turn, enhance mapping of inundation beneath forest canopies.

Several variables related to fire ignition, propagation and its effects are included in fire risk analysis. Life Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC) is one such variable, which is highly related to fire ignition, and propagation. A wide variety of methods have been applied to estimate LFMC, including field sampling and meteorological indices. Given the limitations of these methods, satellite images are a Sound alternative for estimating LFMC because of their capability to spatially and temporally monitor the vegetation status.   This paper aims to improve previous empirical models to estimate LFMC from satellite images, by considering meteorological information. The Original models proposed by Clurvieco et al. [Chuvieco, E., Cocero, D., Riano, D., Martin, M.P., Martinez-Vega, J., et al., (2004). Combining NDVI and surface temperature for the estimation of live fuel moisture content in forest fire danger rating. Remote Sensing of Environment, 92, 322-331] for grasslands and shrublands were used as starting point for this research. High over-estimation of LFMC values from those models was found when applied to dry years. Consequently, the new models proposed in this paper use a simple drought index to discriminate between dry and wet years at the beginning of the spring season. A different harmonic function Was fitted to each group of hydrological years, to take into account the inter-annual variations in LFMC seasonal trends. Subsequently, two empirical models, one for grasslands and one for shrubs (Cistus ladanifer), were derived based on multivariate linear regression analysis of the data collected at Cabaneros National Park (Central Spain). Determination coefficients greater than 0.8 for grasslands and 0.7 for Shrubs were found. The models showed good performance too when applied to other plots of grasslands (R-2=0.76) and shrubland (R-2=0.71) with similar environmental characteristics to the calibration site.

While the past decade has seen progress in the remote estimation of c at the leaf, canopy and stand level using the photochemical reflectance index PRI (based on the normalized difference of reflectance at 531 and 570 nm), little is known about the temporal and spatial requirements for up-scaling PRI to landscape and global levels using satellite observations. One potential way to investigate these requirements is using automated tower-based remote sensing platforms, which observe stand level reflectance with high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution. Prediction of epsilon from PRI diurnally or over a full year requires observations of canopy reflectance over multiple view and sun-angles. As a result, these observations are subject to directional reflectance effects which can be interpreted in terms of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) using semi-empirical kernel driven models. These semi-empirical models use a combination of physically based BRDF shapes and empirical observations to standardize rnulti-angular observations to a common viewing and illumination geometry. Directional reflectance effects are thereby modeled as a linear superposition of mathematical kernels, representing the bi-direction variation in reflectance from isotropic, geometric, and volumetric scattering components of the vegetation canopy. However, because variations in plant physiological conditions can also introduce bidirectional reflectance variations, we introduce an approach to separate bidirectional effects arising purely from plant physiological status from other effects by stratifying PRI observations into categories based on environmental conditions for which the expected physiological variability is low. Within each of these PRI strata, the derived physically based BRDF shapes were used to standardize multi-angular PRI measurements to a common viewing and illumination geometry. The method significantly enhanced the relationship found between PRI and epsilon (from r(2)=0.38 for the directionally uncorrected case to r(2)=0.82 for the directionally corrected case) from data measured continuously over the course of 1 year over an evergreen conifer forest using an automated platform. Results show that isotropic PRI scattering is highly correlated to changes in epsilon, while geometric scattering can be related to canopy level shading. Instrumentation and approaches such as the one demonstrated in this study may be integrated into current efforts aiming at predicting epsilon at global scales using satellite observations.

Satellite measurement of fire radiative energy (FRE) release rate or power (FRP) enables distinction between fires of different strengths. Based on a 1-km resolution fire data acquired globally by the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) sensor aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites from 2000 to 2006, instantaneous FRP values ranged between 0.02 MW and 1866 MW, with global daily means ranging between 20 and 40 MW. Regionally, at the Aqua-MODIS afternoon overpass, the mean FRP values for Alaska, Western US, Western Australia, Quebec and the rest of Canada are significantly higher than these global means, with Quebec having the overall highest value of 85 MW. Analysis of regional mean FRP per unit area of land (FRP flux) shows that at peak fire season in certain regions, fires can be responsible for up to 0.2 W/m(2) at peak time of day. Zambia has the highest regional monthly mean FRP flux of similar to 0.045 W/m(2) at peak time of day and season, while the Middle East has the lowest value of similar to 0.0005 W/m(2). A simple scheme based on FRP has been devised to classify fires into five categories, to facilitate fire rating by strength, similar to earthquakes and hurricanes. The scheme uses MODIS measurements of FRP at 1-km resolution as follows: category 1 (< 100 MW), category 2 (100 to < 500 MW), category 3 (500 to < 1000 MW), category 4 (1000 to < 1500 MW), category 5 (2:1500 MW). In most regions of the world, over 90% of fires fall into category 1, while only less than 1% fall into each of categories 3 to 5, although these Proportions may differ significantly from day to day and by season. The frequency of occurrence of the larger fires is region specific, and could not be explained by ecosystem type alone. Time-series analysis of the proportions of higher category fires based on MODIS-measured FRP from 2002 to 2006 does not show any noticeable trend because of the short time period.

We compared several approaches for imputing the response variables BA and TD, aggregated at the plot-scale and species-level, from topographic and canopy structure predictor variables derived from discrete-return airborne LiDAR data. The predictor and response variables were associated using imputation techniques based on normalized and unnormalized Euclidean distance, Mahalanobis distance, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Canonical Correlation Analysis (aka Most Similar Neighbor, or MSN), Canonical Correspondence Analysis (aka Gradient Nearest Neighbor, or GNN), and Random Forest (RF). To compare and evaluate these approaches, we computed a scaled Root Mean Square Distance (RMSD) between observed and imputed plot-level BA and TD for I I conifer species sampled in north-central Idaho. We found that RF produced the best results overall, especially after reducing the number of response variables to the most important species in each plot with regard to BA and TD. We concluded that RF was the most robust and flexible among the imputation methods we tested. We also concluded that canopy structure and topographic metrics derived from LiDAR surveys can be very useful for species-level imputation.

In order to face this issue ESA\'s high performance computing Grid. on-Demand (G-POD) is used. We assimilate Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) based radio occultations (RO). RO data in general exhibit some favorable properties, like global coverage, all-weather capability expected long-term stability and accuracy. These properties and the continuity of data offered by the Meteorological Operational Satellite (MetOp) program and other RO missions are an ideal opportunity to study the long term atmospheric and climate variability. This paper investigates the assimilation of RO refractivity profiles into first guess fields derived from 21 years of ECMWF\'s ERA40 dataset on a monthly mean basis divided into four synoptic time layers in order to take the diurnal cycle into account. In contrast to NWP systems, the assimilation procedure is applied without cycling, thus enabling us to run our 3D-Var implementation within G-POD parallel for different time layers. Results indicate a significant analysis increment which is partly systematic, emphasizing the ability of RO data to add independent information to ECMWF analysis fields, with a potential to correct biases. This work lays the ground for further studies using data from existing instruments within a framework based on a mature methodology. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The Priestley-Taylor model is relatively simple, and has proven to be remarkably accurate and theoretically robust for estimates of potential evapotranspiration. Building on recent advances in ecophysiological theory that allow detection of multiple stresses on plant function using biophysical remote sensing metrics, we developed a bio-meteorological approach for translating Priestley-Taylor estimates of potential evapotranspiration into rates of actual evapotranspiration. Five model inputs are required: net radiation (R.), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), maximum air temperature (T-max), and water vapor pressure (ea). Our model requires no calibration, tuning or spin-ups. The model is tested and validated against eddy covariance measurements (FLUX-NET) from a wide range of climates and plant functional types-grassland, crop, and deciduous broadleaf, evergreen broadleaf, and evergreen needleleaf forests. The model-to-measurement r(2) was 0.90 (RMS = 16 mm/month or 28%) for all 16 FLUX-NET sites across 2 years (most recent data release). Global estimates of evapotranspiration at a temporal resolution of monthly and a spatial resolution of 1 degrees during the years 1986-1993 were determined using globally consistent datasets from the International Satellite Land-Surface Climatology Project, Initiative II (ISLSCP-II) and the Advanced Very High Resolution Spectroradiometer (AVHRR). Our model resulted in improved prediction of evapotranspiration across water-limited sites, and showed spatial and temporal differences in evapotranspiration globally, regionally and latitudinally.

It is a common approach to invert LAI based on canopy reflectance models using optimization method. Radiative transfer model for continuous vegetation canopy such as SAIL models is widely used for crop LAI inversion. However, crops are mostly planted as row structure in China and they don\'t fit the assumptions of continuous vegetation especially at the earlier growth stages. What kind of models should be used to invert LAI for typical row-planted crops at different growing stages? Taking corn as an example, the factors which influence the row planted crop LAI estimation are investigated in this paper. Using the computer simulated BRDF data sets, different models for LAI inversion at different growth stages are evaluated based on parameter sensitivity analysis. Bayes theory is used to introduce a priori knowledge in the inversion process. In 2005, a field campaign is carried out to validate LAI inversion accuracy during corn\'s growing stages in Huailai, Hebei Province, China. Inverted LAI from both the measured Canopy Reflectance (CR) data and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are very promising. The results show that at least two kinds of models should be adopted for corn canopy at different growth stages, i.e., row structure model for early growth stage (before elongation) and homogeneous canopy model for later growth stage (after elongation).

In one year (2003), smoke aerosols are associated with an increase of cloud fraction and a decrease of cloud effective radius. These effects amplify the cooling at the surface and at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) caused by the aerosol extinction. However, in another year (2002) the cloud fraction decreases with increasing aerosol optical depth. Such a decrease of cloud fraction could offset the effect of increased reflection of solar radiation by the aerosols both at the surface and at TOA. The changes in radiative fluxes between these years would contribute to interannual changes of surface energy fluxes and radiative balance at the top of the atmosphere and influence variability of the wet season onset in the basin. In 2003, the atmosphere was more humid and less stable. These conditions may be relatively favorable for the activation of aerosol particles into cloud condensation nuclei and hence cloud droplets. In 2002, the clouds were less extensive and thinner in a relatively dry atmosphere and presumably dissipated more easily. This study suggests that the aerosol-cloud relation can be influenced by atmospheric structure and convective motions, in addition to changes in aerosols properties. An adequate characterization of aerosol-cloud relationship would require a longer time series of data that includes a variety of climate conditions. The caveat of this analysis is that differences in aerosol absorption and its vertical distribution may have contributed to the observed interannual change of smoke-cloud relationship but could not be determined due to lack of adequate measurements.

To date, remote sensing tools, especially in the microwave domain, have shown their potential for monitoring this parameter. However, operational use at the regional and global scales needs further improvements. Strong uncertainties remain, mainly due to snow metamorphism as well to the presence of vegetation cover. The objective of this paper is to use the semi-empitical Helsinski University of Technology (HUT) snow emission model to estimate SWE with a minimum number of ancillary ground information. Non linear inversion techniques were used to compute SWE considering snow grain size as a free parameter, and initializing the inversion process with rough values of snow depth and density. Results were validated by comparing SWE estimations derived from airborne and spaceborne 19.35 and 37.0 GHz brightness temperatures to ground based SWE measurements over Central Canada. We showed that remotely sensed SWE estimations, retrieved with an average root mean square error of 24 mm, permit the monitoring of the seasonal snow pack evolution, as well as interannual variation (tested over 11 years), useful for hydrological applications.

This is the case of the MODIS radiometer both on EOS Terra/Aqua platforms, with observation angles of up to 65 at the surface, for which the split-window equation has been developed in this study. The algorithm takes into account the angular dependence of both the atmospheric correction (due to the increase of the atmospheric optical path with angle) and the emissivity correction (since sea surface emissivity (SSE) decreases with observation angle). Angular-dependent coefficients have been estimated for the atmospheric terms, and also an explicit dependence on the SSE has been included in the algorithm, as this parameter has values different to a blackbody surface for off-nadir angles, the SSEs also being dependent on surface wind speed. The proposed algorithm requires as input data at-sensor brightness temperatures for the split-window bands (31 and 32 of MODIS), the observation angle at each pixel, an estimate of the water vapor content (which is provided by the MODIS MOD07/MYD07 products) and accurate SSE values for both channels. The preliminary results show a good agreement between SSTs estimated by the proposed equation for off-nadir viewings of MODIS-Terra images and in situ SST measurements, with a root-mean square error (RMSE) of about +/- 0.3 K, for which the MODIS SST product gives an RMSE larger than +/- 0.7 K.

This paper reports on an investigation of radiometric calibration errors due to differences in spectral response functions between satellite sensors when attempting cross-calibration based on near-simultaneous imaging of common ground targets in analogous spectral bands, a commonly used post-launch calibration methodology. Twenty Earth observation imaging sensors (including coarser and higher spatial resolution sensors) were considered, using the Landsat solar reflective spectral domain as a framework. Scene content was simulated using spectra for four ground target types (Railroad Valley Playa, snow, sand and rangeland), together with various combinations of atmospheric states and illumination geometries. Results were obtained as a function of ground target type, satellite sensor comparison, spectral region, and scene content. Overall, if spectral band difference effects (SBDEs) are not taken into account, the Railroad Valley Playa site is a \"good\" ground target for cross calibration between most but not all satellite sensors in most but not all spectral regions investigated. \"Good\" is defined as SBDEs within +/- 3%. The other three ground target types considered (snow, sand and rangeland) proved to be more sensitive to uncorrected SBDEs than the RVPN site overall. The spectral characteristics of the scene content (solar irradiance, surface reflectance and atmosphere) are examined in detail to clarify why spectral difference effects arise and why they can be significant when comparing different imaging sensor systems. Atmospheric gas absorption features are identified as being the main source of spectral variability in most spectral regions. The paper concludes with recommendations on spectral data and tools that would facilitate cross-calibration between multiple satellite sensors. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

It can be used to estimate aboveground biomass and carbon pools stored in the vegetation, and predict timber yield for forest management. Polarimetric SAR interferometry (PolInSAR) uses polarimetric separation of scattering phase cderived from interferometry to estimate canopy height. A limitation of PollnSAR is that it relies on sufficient scattering phase center separation at each pixel to be able to derive accurate forest canopy height estimates. The effect of wavelength-dependent penetration depth into the canopy is known to be strong, and could potentially lead to a better height separation than relying on polarization combinations at one wavelength alone. Here we present a new method for canopy height mapping using dual-wavelength SAR interferometry (InSAR) at X- and L-band. The method is based on the scattering phase center separation at different wavelengths. It involves the generation of a smoothed interpolated terrain elevation model underneath the forest canopy from repeat-pass L-band InSAR data. The terrain model is then used to remove the terrain component from the single-pass X-band interferometric surface height to estimate forest canopy height. The ability of L-band to map terrain height under vegetation relies on sufficient spatial heterogeneity of the density of scattering elements that scatter L-band electromagnetic waves within each resolution cell. The method is demonstrated with airborne X-band VV polarized single-pass and L-band HH polarized repeat-pass SAR interferometry using data acquired by the E-SAR sensor over Monks Wood National Nature Reserve, UK. This is one of the first radar studies of a semi-natural deciduous woodland that exhibits considerable spatial heterogeneity of vegetation type and density. The canopy height model is validated using airborne imaging LIDAR data acquired by the Environment Agency. The rmse of the LIDAR canopy height estimates compared to theodolite data is 2.15 m (relative error 17.6%). The rmse of the dual-wavelength InSAR-derived canopy height model compared to LIDAR is 3.49 m (relative error 28.5%). From the canopy height maps carbon pools are estimated using allometric equations. The results are compared to a field survey of carbon pools and rmse values are presented.

We assess the applicability of altimetric and radiometric data for ice/water discrimination, and discuss the drawbacks and benefits of each type of sensor. An ice discrimination method, based on the combined use of the data from the four altimetric missions and SSM/I, is proposed and validated using available in situ observations and MODIS imagery. The method is applied to the entire satellite data set and used to define specific dates of ice events (first appearance of ice, formation of stable ice cover, first appearance of open water, complete disappearance of ice) and associated uncertainties. Using these satellite-derived estimates, we can extend the existing time series of ice events in the Southern Baikal up to 2004 and provide new information on the Middle and Northern Baikal, regions where no recent in situ ice cover observations are available. Our data show that over the last 10-15 years, trends towards earlier ice formation and later ice break-up result in a tendency for longer fast ice duration over the whole Lake Baikal. The methods proposed here have been tested for Lake Baikal, but they are applicable for other lakes and water bodies with seasonal ice cover. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We apply the SAR Interferometry (InSAR) algorithm referred to as Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) approach that allows us to generate mean deformation velocity maps and displacement time series for the investigated area. The results presented in this work represent an advancement of previous InSAR studies of the area that are mostly focused on the deformation affecting the caldera. In particular, the proposed analysis is based on 21 SAR data acquired by the ERS-1/2 sensors during the 1992-2000 time interval, and demonstrates the capability of the SBAS procedure to identify and analyze displacement patterns at different spatial scales for the overall area spanning approximately 5000 km(2). Two previously unreported localized deformation effects have been detected at Paoha Island, located within the Mono Lake, and in the McGee Creek area within the Sierra Nevada mountains, a zone to the south of the Long Valley caldera. In addition a spatially extended uplift effect, which strongly affects the caldera, has been identified and analyzed in detail. The InSAR results clearly show that the displacement phenomena affecting the Long Valley caldera have a maximum in correspondence of the resurgent dome and are characterized by the sequence of three different effects: a 1992-1997 uplift background, a 1997-1998 unrest phenomenon and a 1998-2000 subsidence phase. Moreover, the analysis of the retrieved displacement time series allows us to map the extent of the zone with a temporal deformation behavior highly correlated with the detected three-phases deformation pattern: background uplift-unrest-subsidence. We show that the mapped area clearly extends outside the northern part of the caldera slopes; accordingly, we suggest that future inversion models take this new evidence into account. The final discussion is dedicated to a comparison between the retrieved InSAR measurements and a set of GPS and leveling data, confirming the validity of the results achieved through the SBAS-InSAR analysis.

The technique makes use of correlation between depth of the snow pack and satellite-derived subpixel fractional snow cover. Previous efforts to infer snow depth from satellite data with this technique were focused oil grasslands and croplands, where the snow depth/snow fraction relationship is most pronounced. In this paper we improve the retrieval algorithm to extend snow depth estimates to forested areas. The enhanced algorithm accounts for the tree cover fraction and for the type of forest, deciduous or coniferous. The developed technique was used to derive maps of snow depth over mid-latitude areas of North America during winter seasons of 20032004 and 2004-2005. Satellite-based snow depth maps were produced daily at 4 km spatial resolution. To validate the retrievals we compared them with surface observations of snow depth and with the snow depth analysis prepared at the NOAA National Operational Hydrological Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC). The estimated retrieval error was about 30% for snow depths below 30 cm and increased to 50% for snow depths ranging from 30 to 50 cm. Snow depth retrievals were limited to scenes with less than 80% deciduous forest cover fraction and less than 50% needle leaf forest cover. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we estimate the background portion from the bidirectional reflection observed by Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument which scans the earth in nine different view angles in an oblique plane relative to the sun. The nadir and 60 degrees forward directions of the MISR images were used to derive the reflectivity of the forest background based on the probabilities of viewing the illuminated tree crown and background on those view angles. The probabilities were estimated using the Four-Scale model. In the study, background reflectivity mosaic images in red and NIR wavelengths covering the BOREAS region during winter and spring seasons were obtained. The mosaic images of winter show high background reflectivity in both wavelengths, and in most of the areas the reflectivity was more than 0.3. In mosaic images of spring the spatial variations in the background reflectivity were considerable. The seasonal changes in the background reflectivity were also studied with multi temporal MISR data, and a similarity in the temporal pattern was found between the retrieved forest background reflectivity and grass land reflectance. These spatial and temporal patterns of the background component retrieved from MISR would be critically important in retrieving the biophysical parameters of vegetation and in ecosystem modeling.

The combination of thermal infrared data with these vegetation indices is often plotted as a triangular scatterplot. One such relationship uses the radiant temperatures versus the NIR/blue ratio developed for a semiarid area from Landsat Thematic Mapper data. Given that the thermal range of this index was invalid when applied to a humid temperate region, this study evaluated the utility of using the NIR/blue ratio alone as an indicator of land use/land cover (LULC) separability under spatially varying moisture conditions. It also explored the additional information gained from using multiple view angles (MVA) of this ratio. Results indicate that for the Howland Forest, Maine study site in August 2003, the MVA version of the NIR/blue ratio discriminated among moisture-driven LULC variations, wetland types and moisture stress extent. Separability was best captured by forward view angles and the optimum multi-angular composite was the An/Af/Bf RGB. The multi-angular ratio was sensitive to variations in species type and vigour, water/vegetation proportions and moisture gradients across emergent wetlands. The study extends the original NIR/blue ratio to include wetlands, aquatic vegetation and other temperate LULC types and has the potential to avoid false change detection while contributing to improved mapping and land cover classifications.

The present technique, which essentially rests on the enhancement of reflectance in the green part of the spectrum when sediments are present, accounts for the improved knowledge regarding the relationship between the chlorophyll concentration and the scattering coefficient in oceanic case-1 waters. It also accounts for the bidirectional character of the light field emerging from a water body and thus for the sensitivity of the water-leaving radiance to the observational conditions (viewing angle and sun angle). Therefore, the thresholds, above which the turbid waters can be detected, are not constant. They depend on the chlorophyll concentration and on geometry (on the zenith-sun angle). The practical way of implementing such a discriminating tool is explained. Examples of the application of this technique are provided for level-2 and level-3 satellite data (SeaWiFS and MERIS).

These statistical projections are based on parameterized satellite rainfall estimates (RFE) and relative humidity demand (RHD).

For key fire-affected forest, bush and savanna environments (Australia, Benin, Borneo, Brazil, Canada-US, Portugal and Siberia) BIRD data allows FRP estimation to within 30% in 75% of fires examined, and for the first time from space BIRD is able to allow estimation of fireline length, effective fireline depth and radiative fireline intensity for the more pronounced fire fronts. Some indication of the predominant combustion regime (smoldering or flaming), which has implications for the relative concentrations of emitted pollutant products, is possible through use of the T(F) parameter. This experience demonstrates the advantages of the new infrared sensor technologies employed in BIRD, and offers suggestions for future fire monitoring sensors based on similar technologies.

In order to obtain accurate values of land surface temperature, atmospheric, emissivity and angular effects should be corrected. This paper focuses on the analysis of the angular variation of canopy emissivity, which is an important variable that has to be known to correct surface radiances and obtain surface temperatures. Emissivity is also involved in the atmospheric corrections since it appears in the reflected downwelling atmospheric term. For this purpose, five different methods for simulating directional canopy emissivity, have been analyzed and compared.

Over surfaces with sparse and low vegetation cover, high angular variations of canopy emissivity are obtained, with differences between at-nadir view and 80 degrees of 0.03. Over fully vegetated surfaces angular effects on emissivity are negligible when radiative transfer models are applied, so in these situations the angular variations on emissivity are not critical on the retrieved land surface temperature from remote sensing data. Angular variations on emissivity are lower when the emissivity of the soil and the emissivity of the vegetation are closer. All the models considered assume Lambertian behaviour for the soil and the leaves. This assumption is also discussed, showing a different behaviour of directional canopy emissivity when a non-Lambertian soil is considered. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

This process is mainly controlled by the occurrence of ice jams. Flood forecasting is of very important in mitigating social and economic damage. This study investigates the potential of a rating curve model for flood forecasting. The proposed approach is based on the use of a Water Surface Fraction derived from SSM/I passive microwave images and discharge observations. The rating curve model is based on an existing correlation between flooded areas and measured discharge. However, a time lag can be observed between these two variables. Thus, the rating curve model has been modified by the introduction of a lag term that could vary depending on the flooding intensity and the features of the basin. Hence, the lag term is computed dynamically using a cross-correlation function between Water Surface Fraction values which are derived from SSM/I observations and the discharge vectors. The rating curve model is based on two empirical parameters that depend on the site features, which vary in both space and time. To overcome this dependency, the rating curve model was linked to a Kalman filter in order to dynamically estimate the empirical parameters according to the forecasting errors encountered at each time step. With the Kalman filter, the dynamic rating curve model continuously readjusts its parameters to satisfy the non-stationary behavior of hydrological processes. The model is thus sufficiently flexible and adapted to various conditions. Simulations were carried out over the Mackenzie River Basin (1.8 million km(2)) during the summers of 1998 and 1999. NOAA-AVHRR images were used to validate the forecast WSF values. The predicted flooded areas agree well with those derived from the NOAA-AVHRR images. Further simulations were carried out from 1992 to 2000 using the rating curve model to predict discharge at a downstream location. Even though an interannual variability of the water surface fractions was observed over the PAD area, the modified model was sufficiently flexible to be readjusted and to reproduce satisfactory results. This implies that a combination of passive microwave data and discharge observations presents an interesting potential in flood and discharge prediction. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, the formation of the new-(frazil/pancake)-ice \'Odden\' (8 degrees W, 75 degrees N) March 11th-18th, 2001, is used in the study. The results of the ice cover classification in the Greenland Sea are compared to model parameters from a sea ice model. The classification of each ice pixel is performed using its backscatter and radiative properties as reflected in the polarisation ratio. Our results based on these comparisons show that the transformation into older mature (sheet) ice occurs within 5 - 10 days. During one day the new-ice cover increased by 33 000 km(2). The new-ice appears in March 2001 as a peninsula (maximum extent 56000 km(2)) appended to the belt of older ice drifting along the East Coast of Greenland. These results are consistent with the ice model and with Radarsat images. Furthermore, using the ice model it is demonstrated that the new-ice/mature ice threshold in the classification corresponds to the physical transition of the ice cover from pancake ice to a consolidated young-ice sheet. The classification of each pixel into ice or water is done using two scatterometer parameters, namely the polarisation ratio and the daily standard deviation of the backscatter.

The derived 1 km spatial resolution burned area maps were compared with 30 m spatial resolution maps obtained with 13 Landsat ETM+ scenes, through linear regression analysis. The procedure quantifies the bias in burned area estimation present in the low spatial resolution burned area map. Good correspondence was observed for seven sites, with values of the coefficient of determination (R-2) ranging from 0.787 to 0.983. Poorer agreement was observed in four sites (R-2 values between 0.257 and 0.417), and intermediate values of R-2 (0.670 and 0.613) were obtained for two sites. The observed variation in the level of agreement between the Landsat and VGT estimates of area burned results from differences in the spatial pattern and size distribution of bums in the different fire regimes encompassed by our analysis. Small and fragmented burned areas result in large underestimation at I kin spatial resolution. When large and compact burned areas dominate the landscape, VGT estimates of burned area are accurate, although in certain situations there is some overestimation, Accuracy of VGT burned area estimates also depends on vegetation type. Results showed that in forest ecosystems VGT maps underestimate substantially the amount of burned area. The most accurate estimates were obtained for woodlands and grasslands. An overall linear regression fitted with the data from the 13 comparison sites revealed that there is a strong relationship between VGT and Landsat estimates of burned area, with a value of R-2 of 0,754 and a slope of 0.803. Our findings indicate that burned area mapping based on I kin spatial resolution VGT data provides adequate regional information. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

When these data were compared with active fluorescence measurements performed on needles they revealed the same trend. During sunny days fluorescence and reflectance signals were found to be strongly influenced by shadows associated with the canopy structure. Moreover, chlorophyll fluorescence variations induced by rapid light changes (due to transient cloud shadows) were found to respond more quickly and with larger amplitude under summer conditions compared to those obtained under cold acclimation conditions. In addition, ChlF at 760 nm was observed to increase with the chlorophyll content. During this campaign, the CO2 assimilation was measured at the forest canopy level and was found remarkably well correlated with the PRI index. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The chromophoric dissolved organic matter absorption coefficient has the highest contrast and is therefore the most visually evident inherent optical property (while the phytoplankton absorption coefficient and backscattering coefficients are respectively less discernible). For use as an analytical tool, comparisons suggests that the chromophoric, dissolved organic matter absorption coefficient has a similar to 10x higher contrast (i.e., similar to 5% vs. 50%) in the Middle Atlantic Bight making eddy events detectable over longer time periods than with SST imagery.

Intercomparison of these two products, with the SNOTEL data sets as the ground truth, shows that (1) the MODIS 8-day product has higher classification accuracy for both snow and land; (2) the omission error of misclassifying snow as land is similar for both products, both are low; (3) the MODIS 8-day product has a slightly higher commission error of rnisclassifying land as snow than the MODIS daily product; and (4) the MODIS daily product has higher omission errors of misclassifying both snow and land as clouds. Clouds are the major cause for reduction of the overall accuracy of the MODIS daily product. Improvement in suppressing clouds in the 8-day product is obvious from this comparison study. The sacrifice is the temporal resolution that is reduced from 1 to 8 days. The significance of the results is that the 8-day product will be more useful in evaluating the streamflow response to the snow-cover extent changes, especially from the long-term point of view considering its lower temporal resolution than the daily product. For clear days, the MODIS daily algorithm works quite well or even better than the MODIS 8-day algorithm. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

To achieve a complete description of each class in feature space, a large training set is typically required. It is not, however, always necessary to have training statistics that provide a complete and representative description of the classes, especially if using nonparametric classifiers. For classification by a support vector machine, only the training samples that are support vectors, which lie on part of the edge of the class distribution in feature space, are required; all other training samples provide no contribution to the classification analysis. If regions likely to furnish support vectors can be identified in advance of the classification, it may be possible to intelligently select useful training samples. The ability to target useful training samples may allow accurate classification from small training sets. This potential for intelligent training sample collection was explored for the classification of agricultural crops from multispectral satellite sensor data. With a conventional approach to training, only a quarter of the training samples acquired actually made a positive contribution to the analysis and allowed the crops to be classified to a high accuracy (92.5%). The majority of the training set, therefore, was unnecessary as it made no contribution to the analysis. Using ancillary information on soil type, however, it would be possible to constrain the training sample acquisition process. By limiting training sample acquisition only to regions with a specific soil type, it was possible to use a small training set to classify the data without loss of accuracy. Thus, a small number of intelligently selected training samples may be used to classify a data set as accurately as a larger training set derived in a conventional manner. The results illustrate the potential to direct training data acquisition strategies to target the most useful training samples to allow efficient and accurate image classification.

Although it is well known that shrubs have increased over time, we have little quantitative information related to the non-linear nature of this vegetation change over a particular period. On the Jornada Experimental Range (JER; USDA-ARS) and the adjacent Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC; New Mexico State University) in southern New Mexico, shrub increase has been measured with various ground survey techniques extending back to 1858. For this study, we used 11 aerial photos taken between 1937 and 1996 that covered a 150-ha study area and had sufficient resolution for shrub detection. A QuickBird satellite image provided coverage for 2003. We used image segmentation and object-based classification to monitor vegetation changes over time. Shrub cover increased from 0.9% in 1937 to 13.1% in 2003, while grass cover declined from 18.5% to 1.9%. Vegetation dynamics reflected changes in precipitation patterns, in particular, effects of the 1951-1956 drought. Accuracy assessment showed that shrub and grass cover was underestimated due to the constraint of the pixel size. About 87% of all shrubs >2 m(2) were detected. The use of object-based classification has advantages over pixel based classification for the extraction of shrubs from panchromatic aerial and high-resolution satellite imagery. Incorporating both spectral and spatial image information approximates the way humans interpret information visually from aerial photos, but has the benefit of an automated classification routine. Combining several scales of analysis in a hierarchical segmentation method is appropriate in an ecological sense and allows for determining shrub density in coarser level classes. Despite encountering difficulties in analyzing a greatly varying aerial photo data set, including variability in spectral and spatial resolutions, moisture conditions, time of year of observation, and appearance of grass cover, aerial photos provide an invaluable historic record for monitoring shrub encroachment into a desert grassland.

Therefore, an algorithm for locating the most suitable spatial areas for environmental noise equivalent retrieval in a remote sensing image was developed and validated, first on a custom-built monochromatic image and then on a multi-temporal, hyperspectral data set. The algorithm, Automated Local Convergence Locator (ALCL), successfully identified areas in the custom-built image where known amounts of added noise equivalents could be accurately retrieved. Applying ALCL to the hyperspectral data (four Hyperion scenes of the same tropical coral reef scene) confirmed that noise equivalent characteristics vary limitedly on a scene-by-scene basis. The four Hyperion noise equivalent spectra collected in locations identified by ALCL as suitable showed consistency in both shape and magnitude despite being acquired 6 months apart, and differed from equivalent spectra from image locations identified as not suitable for noise estimation. The ALCL algorithm and associated methodology required limited user input while objectively determining the areas in an image most suitable for noise equivalent estimation. The ALCL methodology is applicable to studies where noise equivalent quantities in remote sensing imagery need to be objectively determined, such as feasibility studies, environmental monitoring, and sensitivity analysis.

Differences in the extent and location of areas burned among products generated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Systeme Pour l\'Observation de la Terre (SPOT-VEGETATION), and Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR-2) data are significant and result in different emissions estimates for woodland and grassland land cover types. Due to the different emission profiles in woodlands and grasslands, favoring relatively more products of incomplete combustion in woodlands compared with products of complete combustion in grasslands in the late dry season, these changes are not proportional to the differences in the burned area amounts. The importance of accurate burned area information not just in terms of the total area but also in terms of its spatial distribution becomes apparent from our modeling results. This paper highlights the urgent need for satellite data producers to provide accuracy assessments associated with satellite-derived products. Preferably, these accuracy data will be spatially explicit, or defined in a way that can be applied in a spatially explicit modeling context, to enable emissions uncertainties to be defined with respect to different landscape units in support of greenhouse gas emissions reporting.

An evaluation of the most suitable wavelengths for separation of urban land cover identified specific spectral features that provided the best separation.

For this paper, we define old conifer forests as >150 years and mature conifer forest between 50 and 150 years. We offer a new Optimal Iterative Unsupervised Classification (OIUC) procedure for mapping late seral conifer forests over an eight-ecoregion area. The key steps of the OIUC classification were: (1) fully using the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) 15 m panchromatic channel merged with other 30 in bands 3 and 5 to make a pan-sharpened false color composite for high resolution image interpretation; (2) splitting the ETM+ scene by ecologically distinct areas, or ecoregions, to create relatively homologous images for classification; (3) using a procedure similar to cluster busting where multiple iterative manipulation of the ISODATA clusters was employed; and (4) edge matching of sub-scenes to form ecoregions, then later merged together to form a map for the entire PNW. Supporting data and information included ancillary spatial GIS data layers, aerial photos, Digital Ortho Quad images (DOQs), field investigations, and previously reported forest age results. Classification accuracy was assessed using 2081 stratified random locations on 105 individual DOQs covering the entire region. Approximately 4.7 million ha (similar to19%) of the PNW was classified as old conifer forest (>150 years). Another 4.8 million ha (similar to19%) was classified as mature conifer forest (50-150 years). Over 9.48 million ha (similar to 38%) of the PNW was late seral conifer forest. The extent of late seral forests (old and mature conifer cover classes) varied greatly between the eight ecoregions. The Central and Southern Cascades and Klamath-Siskiyou ecoregions contained the highest amount of late seral forest in the region. The results showed high accuracy of the late seral forest classification for the PNW with an overall accuracy of 90.72% and KAPPA test K value 0.8534. Producer\'s (Omission) accuracy for old and mature forests were 91.36% and 80.40%, User\'s (Commission) accuracy were 89.42% and 80.59%, respectively. Accuracy levels differed for the different ecoregions examined. In general, mature conifer forests exhibited higher levels of confusion than did old conifer forests, due to the spectral influences of high-density young conifer stands and terrain shadow effects. The results fill an important data gap needed for ongoing conservation planning purposes throughout the region. We found that for relatively large geographic areas the OIUC method is an efficient and cost-effective alternative that yields high quality results. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The two images cover the same area and were acquired under equivalent conditions. Three comparison tests were designed and implemented, each with separate objectives. First, a comparison was conducted band by band by examining their spectral statistics and species by species by inspecting their textural roughness. The IKONOS image had a higher variance and entropy value in all the compared bands, whereas the QuickBird image displayed a finer textural roughness in the forest canopy. Second, maximum likelihood classification (MLC) was executed with two different band selections. When examining only multispectral bands, the IKONOS image had better spectral discrimination than QuickBird while the inclusion of panchromatic bands had no effect on the classification accuracy of either the IKONOS or QuickBird image. Third, first- and second-order texture features were extracted from the panchromatic images at different window sizes and with different grey level (GL) quantization levels and were compared through MLC classification. Results indicate that the consideration of image texture enhances classifications based on the IKONOS panchromatic band more than it does classifications based on comparable QuickBird imagery. An object-based classification was also utilized to compare underlying texture in both panchromatic and multispectral bands. On the whole, both IKONOS and QuickBird images produced promising results in classifying mangrove species. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Corresponding metrics derived from the two different flying altitudes were compared. Only I of 54 metrics derived from the first pulse data differed significantly between flying altitudes. For the last pulse data, the mean values of the height percentiles were up to 50 cm higher than the corresponding values of the low-altitude data. The high-altitude data yielded significantly higher values for most of the canopy density measures. The standard deviation for the differences between high and low flying altitude for each of the metrics was estimated. The standard deviations for the height percentiles ranged from 0.07 to 0.30 cm in the forest stands, indicating a large degree of stability between repeated flight overpasses.   The effect of variable flying altitude on mean tree height (h(L)), stand basal area (G), and stand volume (P) estimated from the laser-derived height and density measures using a two-stage inventory procedure was assessed by randomly combining laser data from the two flying altitudes for each individual sample plot and forest stand. The sample plots were used as training data to calibrate the models. The random assignment was repeated 10,000 times. The results of the 10,000 trials indicated that the precision of the estimated values of h(L), G, and V was robust against alterations in flying altitude. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

U.S. Commercial Remote Sensing Policy. White House, Washington, DC). The science and applications users have been skeptical of this move to commercial sources of observations both because of uncertainty over the capabilities of the private sector and the unsatisfactory outcomes of previous efforts to commercialize satellite-acquired land remote sensing observations. In an effort to more fully explore the potential of commercial remotely sensed land data sources, the NASA Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) implemented an experimental Scientific Data Purchase (SDP) that solicited bids from the private sector to meet ESE-user data needs. The SDP activity spanned nearly 5 years and supplied many US and international researchers with sources of land remote sensing observations that had not been previously available. The images from the Space Imaging IKONOS system provided a particularly good match to the current ESE missions such as Terra and Landsat 7 and therefore serve as focal point in this analysis.   Throughout the SDP process, there have been many lessons learned concerning interactions between US industry, government agencies and the science user community. The specifies of the Space Imaging IKONOS experience under the NASA SDP are most valuable with respect to possible future uses of commercial vendors to supply NASA ESE user needs for space-acquired land observations. Areas where valuable lessons were learned included the technical, scientific, proprietary and management aspects of the interactions. As this activity has evolved, user confidence in the technical and scientific qualities of the IKONOS measurements has increased substantially. There are still areas where further progress could be achieved, with respect to proprietary and management aspects of scientific commercial data buys.   To date, the NASA scientific and applications users who have examined the IKONOS imagery have found the data to be of high quality, providing substantial value to their specific pursuits. They have found that the novel attributes of IKONOS, particularly in the spatiotemporal domain have introduced new analysis challenges not previously experienced with EOS sensors such as Landsat and MODIS. The technical qualities of the observations have been substantially improved during the SDP activity as a result of independent validation and verification by the Joint Agency Commercial Imagery Evaluation (JACIE) of the IKONOS observations.   The experience gained from the Space Imaging IKONOS SDP activity, suggests that US private sector is technically capable of meeting the needs of NASA ESE science and application users. The future success of such interactions between industry, government and users appears to be far more dependent on the organizational and legal aspects of such arrangements than technical capabilities of the data providers.

While the biophysical and observational factors driving variations in apparent shadow are known, little quantitative information exists on the magnitude and variability of shadow in remotely sensed data acquired over tropical regions. Even less is known about shadow effects in multispectral observations from satellites (e.g., Landsat). The IKONOS satellite, with 1-m panchromatic and 4-m multispectral capabilities, provides an opportunity to observe tropical canopies and their shadows at spatial scales approaching the size of individual crowns and vegetation clusters.   We used 44 IKONOS images from the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) data archive to quantify the spatial variation of canopy shadow fraction across a broad range of forests in the Brazilian Amazon and savannas in the Brazilian Cerrado. Forests had substantial apparent shadow fractions as viewed from the satellite vantage point. The global mean (+/-S.D.) shadow fraction was 0.25 +/- 0.12, and within-scene (e.g., forest stand) variability was similar to interscene (e.g., regional) variation. The distribution of shadow fractions for forest stands was skewed, with 30% of pixels having fractional shadow values above 0.30. Shadow fractions in savannas increased from 0.0 +/- 0.0 1 to 0.12 +/- 0.04 to 0.16 +/- 0.05 for areas with woody vegetation at low (<25% cover), medium (25-75%), and high (>75%) density, respectively.   Landsat-like observations using both red (0.63-0.70 mum) and near-infrared (NIR) (0.76-0.85 mum) wavelength regions were highly sensitive to sub-pixel shadow fractions in tropical forests, accounting for similar to30-50% of the variance in red and NIR responses. A 10% increase in shadow fraction resulted in a 3% and 10% decrease in red and NIR channel response, respectively. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of tropical forests was weakly sensitive to changes in shadow fraction. For low-, medium-, and high-density savannas,a 10% increase in shadow fraction resulted in a 5-7% decrease in red-channel response. Shadows accounted for similar to15-50% of the overall variance in red-wavelength responses in the savanna image archive. Weak to no relationship occurred between shadow fraction and either NIR reflectance or the NDVI of savannas. Quantitative information on shadowing is needed to validate or constrain radiative transfer, spectral mixture, and land-surface models used to estimate material and energy exchanges between the tropical biosphere and atmosphere.

The maximum likelihood (ML) procedure is, for many users, the algorithm of choice because of its ready availability and the fact that it does not require an extended training process. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are now widely used by researchers, but their operational applications are hindered by the need for the user to specify the configuration of the network architecture and to provide values for a number of parameters, both of which affect performance. The ANN also requires an extended training phase.   In the past few years, the use of decision trees (DTs) to classify remotely sensed data ha\'s increased. Proponents of the method claim that it has a number of advantages over the ML and ANN algorithms. The DT is computationally fast, make no statistical assumptions, and can handle data that are represented on different measurement scales. Software to implement DTs is readily available over the Internet. Pruning of DTs can make them smaller and more easily interpretable, while the use of boosting techniques can improve performance.   In this study, separate test and training data sets from two different geographical areas and two different sensors-multispectral Landsat ETM+ and hyperspectral DAIS-are used to evaluate the performance of univariate and multivariate DTs for land cover classification. Factors considered are: the effects of variations in training data set size and of the dimensionality of the feature space, together with the impact of boosting, attribute selection measures, and pruning. The level of classification accuracy achieved by the DT is compared to results from back-propagating ANN and the ML classifiers. Our results indicate that the performance of the univariate DT is acceptably good in comparison with that of other classifiers, except with high-dimensional data. Classification accuracy increases linearly with training data set size to a limit of 300 pixels per class in this case. Multivariate DTs do not appear to perform better than univariate DTs. While boosting produces an increase in classification accuracy of between 3% and 6%, the use of attribute selection methods does not appear to be justified in terms of accuracy increases. However, neither the univariate DT nor the multivariate DT performed as well as the ANN or ML classifiers with high-dimensional data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Negative impacts often attributed to urban sprawl are traffic congestion, loss of open space, and increased pollutant runoff into natural waterways. Definitions of \"Urban Sprawl\" range from local patterns of land use and development to aggregate measures of per capita land consumption for given contiguous urban areas (UA). This research creates a measure of per capita land use consumption as an aggregate index for the spatially contiguous urban areas of the conterminous United States with population of 50,000 or greater. Nighttime satellite imagery obtained by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program\'s Operational Linescan System (DMSP OLS) is used as a proxy measure of urban extent. The corresponding population of these urban areas is derived from a grid of the block group level data from the 1990 U.S. Census. These numbers are used to develop a regression equation between Ln(Urban Area) and Ln(Urban Population). The \'scale-adjustment\' mentioned in the title characterizes the \"Urban Sprawl\" of each of the urban areas by how far above or below they are on the \"Sprawl Line\" determined by this regression. This \"Sprawl Line\" allows for a more fair comparison of \"Urban Sprawl\" between larger and smaller metropolitan areas because a simple measure of per capita land consumption or population density does not account for the natural increase in aggregate population density that occurs as cities grow in population. Cities that have more \"Urban Sprawl\" by this measure tended to be inland and Midwestern cities such as Minneapolis-St. Paul, Atlanta, Dallas-Ft. Worth, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Surprisingly, west coast cities including Los Angeles had some of the lowest levels of \"Urban Sprawl\" by this measure. There were many low light levels seen in the nighttime imagery around these major urban areas that were not included in either of the two definitions of urban extent used in this study. These areas may represent a growing commuter-shed of urban workers who do not live in the urban core but nonetheless contribute to many of the impacts typically attributed to \"Urban Sprawl\". \"Urban Sprawl\" is difficult to define precisely partly because public perception of sprawl is likely derived from local land use planning decisions, spatio-demographic change in growing urban areas, and changing values and social mores resulting from differential rates of international migration to the urban areas of the United States. Nonetheless, the aggregate measures derived here are somewhat different than similar previously used measures in that they are \'scale-adjusted\'; also, the spatial patterns of \"Urban Sprawl\" shown here shed some insight and raise interesting questions about how the dynamics of \"Urban Sprawl\" are changing.

Several upwelling zones in the Taiwan Strait are noted for their high fisheries production; these upwelling zones have been studied in the past decade, but we have no overall picture on the size and temporal changes of these upwelling zones due to only limited in situ observation over short periods of time. The present paper investigates upwelling in the Taiwan Strait with satellite remote sensing data of NOAA-derived Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and SeaWiFS-derived Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and shipboard measurements during summer 1998. Results reveal five upwelling zones: (1) coastal upwelling near Pingtan Island (PTU), (2) coastal upwelling between Meizhou and Xiaman (MXU), (3) big coastal upwelling near Dongshan Island (DSU), sometimes extending to offshore, (4) small occasional upwelling near the Penghu Island (PHU) and (5) an intensive upwelling in the Taiwan Bank (TBU). TBU was extensively studied over summer 1998. Results showed that the TBU looks like a banana in shape in the southern edge of the Taiwan Bank; it intensifies in its southeastern edge. The size of TBU was about 2500-3000 km(2), with a mean value of 2796 km(2). The temperature difference between the upwelling and non-upwelling areas was about 2.5-3.5 degreesC for early August with a mean value of 2.3 degreesC on July to October. Series of images indicated a short-term variation of TBU and showed that high Chl-a concentrations (up to 0.8-2 mg m(-3)) zones coincided with low SST (25-26 degreesC) zones in terms of location, time, and shape. These upwelling zones change with size and intensity center from time to time. Field measurements of water temperature, salinity, and Chl-a in 1998 are consistent with satellite measurements.

Based on estimates of the channel-dependence error and noise equivalent temperature difference (NEDT) and the calibration accuracy of MODIS thermal-infrared data, the impact of instrument performance on the accuracy of LST is discussed. A double-screen scheme based on the difference between the 5-km LST retrieved by the day/night LST algorithm and the aggregated 1-km LST retrieved by the generalized split-window algorithm, and the difference between daytime and nighttime LSTs, is proposed to remove the LSTs contaminated with cloud effects. The accuracy of daily MODIS LST product at 1-km resolution, which was produced by the generalized split-window algorithm, was validated in 11 clear-sky cases with in situ measurement data collected in field campaigns in 2000 and 2001. The MODIS LST accuracy is better than 1 K in the range from 263 to 300 K over Lake Titicaca in Bolivia, Mono Lake, Bridgeport grassland, and a rice field in Chico, CA, and Walker Lake, Nevada (NV), in the atmospheric column water vapor range from 0.4 to 3.0 cm. It is difficult to validate the daytime LST product over land sites rather than lakes with ground-based measurements alone because of the high spatial variations in the in situ LST measurement data, which was verified by the daytime data of the MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS) over a grassland in Bridgeport, CA, on October 6, 2000. In six cases over a silt playa in Railroad Valley, NV, the 1-km MODIS LSTs are a few Kelvin degrees lower than the in situ measured LSTs because the surface emissivities inferred from land cover types in the split-window LST method are often overestimated in semi-arid and arid regions. After a correction with the difference between the 5-km LST retrieved by the day/night LST method and the LST aggregated from 1-km LSTs retrieved by the split-window method, the MODIS LSTs agree with in situ measured LSTs within 1 K in the range 263-322 K for the six cases in Railroad Valley and one case of snowcover in Bridgeport, CA, leading a recommendation for use of the 5-km LST product retrieved by the day/night LST method in bare and sparse vegetated areas.

We show that as long as the calibration error at 865 nm less than similar to 10% in magnitude, the post-vicarious-calibration-corrected radiances are sufficiently accurate to retrieve useful water-leaving reflectances at moderate aerosol optical depths. This is completely independent of the initial calibration error in the shorter-wave bands, but assumes an atmospheric correction approach similar to that currently used with ScaWiFS. Retrievals are only slightly improved by reducing the magnitude of the error at 865 nm below similar to 5%. The simulations immediately suggest that pre-launch calibration is necessary only to the extent required to set the sensitivity of the instrument in the desired range. Rather than trying to achieve a highly accurate pre-launch calibration, e.g., uncertainty <5%, we assert that resources would be better expended on improved radiometric stability (and its monitoring) and complete characterization of the instrument, e.g., polarization sensitivity, out-of-band response, etc. However, these assertions assume the existence of a permanent vicarious calibration facility, e.g., the Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY).

Modelling and empirical studies have been used to better understand this relationship for the remote sensing of foliar biochemical concentration. The success of these studies have been predicated on two implicit assumptions; first, that variability in biochemical concentration and reflectance within any one canopy is small. and second, that foliar samples from a point (usually the top) of the canopy could be used to represent the canopy as a whole. To evaluate these two assumptions the three-dimensional variation of various biochemical and reflectance characteristics of a Sitka spruce canopy were examined. Biochemical concentrations varied with canopy depth and needle age: chlorophyll and cellulose concentrations increased slightly with canopy depth, water and lignin concentrations were greatest in the lower canopy, and nitrogen concentrations were similar throughout the canopy. Reflectance in visible wavelengths decreased with canopy depth, as did reflectance at the \'red edge\'. Biochemical concentration also varied with needle age: chlorophyll concentration increased with needle age; lignin and cellulose concentrations were similar for all ages of needles though variations in water and nitrogen concentration were more complex. Overall. however, these variations in biochemical concentrations were slight and it was concluded that foliage samples taken from near the top of the canopy and incorporating needles of a variety of ages would be representative of the canopy as a whole for the purposes of the remote sensing of foliar biochemical concentration. This paper also explores the strength of the relationships between biochemical concentration and reflectance and found them all to be weak, with the exception of those between chlorophyll concentration and reflectance.

Spectral unmixing produces images of the fractional amount of the spectral endmembers, which were green vegetation, nonphotosynthetic vegetation, soil and \"shade,\" which includes topographic shading and shadows. Changes in endmember fractions correspond to changes in surface composition (as viewed from above). Unresolved shadows comprise the primary indicator of canopy structure and hence, regrowth stage. To isolate shadows, shading predicted from a digital elevation model was removed from the image before mixture analysis. As stands regrow, the surface cover shifts from initial high proportion of slash and exposed soil, and low proportions of green vegetation and shadows, to low fractions of stems and soil with high fractions of green vegetation and shadows. This shift in surface composition defines a regrowth trend in an endmember fraction data space. Projection of data onto this line allows estimation of structural stage and stand age, and provides a framework for remote mapping and monitoring of forest regrowth. Field analysis of 495 forest stands, representing stand structural stages ranging from newly replanted cuts to stands greater than 250 years in age, was used to assess the accuracy and precision of predicted structural stages and stand ages. The spectral unmixing approach can be used to evaluate and monitor forest regrowth quickly over large areas of the Pacific Northwest forests, and is extendible to mapping basic vegetation community type as well as structural stage.

For heavily vegetated surfaces, there is little problem since the emissivity is relatively uniform and close to one. For and lands with sparse vegetation, the problem is more difficult because the emissivity of the exposed soils and rocks is highly variable, With multispectral thermal infrared (TIR) observations, it is possible to estimate the spectral emissivity variation for these surfaces. We present data from the TIMS (Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner) instrument, which has six channels in the 8- to 12-mum region. TIMS is a prototype of the TIR portion of the ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection radiometer) instrument on NASA\'s Terra (EOS-AM1) platform launched in December 1999. The Temperature Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm, developed for use with ASTER data, is used to extract the temperature and six emissivities from the six channels of TIMS data. The algorithm makes use of the empirical relation between the range of observed emissivities and their minimum value. This approach was applied to the TIMS data acquired over the USDA/ARS Jornada Experimental Range in New Mexico. The Jornada site is typical of a desert grassland where the main vegetation components are grass (black grama) and shrubs (primarily mesquite) in the degraded grassland. The data presented here are from flights at a range of attitudes from 800 to 5000 in, yielding a pixel resolution from 3 to 12 in. The resulting spectral emissivities are in qualitative agreement with laboratory measurements of the emissivity for the quartz rich soils of the site. The derived surface temperatures agree with ground measurements within the standard deviations of both sets of observations. The results for the 10.8- and 11.7-mum channels show limited variation of the emissivity values over the mesquite and grass sites indicating that split window approaches may be possible for conditions like these.

Here we present a simple, practical method to separate the water-column reflectance from the total reflectance at 765 nm and 865 nm. Assuming the type of aerosol does not vary much over relatively small spatial scales (similar to 50-100 km), we first define the aerosol type over less turbid waters. We then transfer it to the turbid area by using a \"nearest neighbor\" method. While the aerosol type is fixed, the concentration can vary. This way, both the aerosol reflectance and the water-column reflectance at 765 nm and 865 nm may be derived. The default NASA atmospheric correction scheme subsequently is used to obtain the aerosol scattering components at shorter wavelengths. This simple method was tested under various atmospheric conditions over the Gulf of Mexico, and it proved effective in reducing the errors of both the water-leaving radiance and the chlorophyll concentration estimates. In addition, in areas where the default NASA algorithms created a mask due to atmospheric correction failure, water-leaving radiance and chlorophyll concentrations were recovered. This method, in comparison with field data and other turbid water algorithms, was tested for the Gulf of Maine and turbid, posthurricane Gulf of Mexico waters. In the Gulf of Maine it provided more accurate retrievals with fewer failures of the atmospheric correction algorithms. In the Gulf of Mexico it provided far fewer pixels with algorithms failure than the other methods, did not overestimate chlorophyll as severely, and provided fewer negative water-leaving radiance values.

A 3-D scene modeling approach for these purposes is presented in this paper. This 3-D model fulfills its goal by taking advantage of radiosity theory and computer graphics techniques. It consists of two major modules: a modified extended L-systems (MELS) method to gene-rate a 3-D realistic scene and a radiosity-graphics combined method (RGM) to calculate the radiation regime based on the 3-D structures rendered with MELS. The 3-D simulation tool is then evaluated using field measurements of both plant structure and spectra collected during the NASA Earth Observing Satellite Prototype Validation Exercise Jornada field campaign near Las Cruces, NM. The modeled scene reflectance is compared with measurements from three platforms (ground tower, and satellite) at various scales (from the size of individual shrub component to satellite pixels of kilometers). The agreement with measured reflectances is excellent at all sampling scales tested. As an example of the model\'s application, we use the model output to examine the validity of a linear mixture scheme over the Jornada semidesert scene. The result shows that the larger the sampling size (at least larger than the size of the shrub component), the better the hypothesis is satisfied because of the unique structure of the Jornada scene: dense plant clumps (shrub component) sparsely scattered on a predominantly bare soil background. A range of possible applications of this 3-D scene model is highlighted. and further work needed for 3-D modeling is also discussed.

Coincident with these changes in vegetation dominance are increases in soil erosion, stream channel cutting, and shrub coppice dune formation on sandy soil. Where marked transitions in, vegetation type from grassland to honey mesquite shrubland have occurred, the local topography has been transformed with previously flat mesa becoming rolling duneland. The size, distribution, and morphological characteristics of these dunes have an important impact on fluxes of energy and nutrients at the surface; they also render the land far less useful as grazing land for domestic livestock. These shrub coppice dunes and the mesquite shrubs that grow on them may be considered roughness elements. Quantifying their morphology is important for the calculation of aerodynamic roughness length and displacement height. This article tests the ability of active scanning laser remote sensing techniques to provide accurate estimates of the three-dimensional shapes and areal distributions of dune and interdune areas. It shows that scanning laser with a footprint diameter of 0.38 m and a sampling interval of 1.5 m to 2 m can be used to measure the morphological characteristics of shrub coppice dunes in the desert grasslands of southern New Mexico with acceptable accuracy and precision for a range of uses, including important geomorphological and hydrological applications. The use of scanning laser systems together with optical multi-spectral data is shown to be highly synergistic, providing information that is not easily obtainable via other surveying methods.

The general patterns of the surface circulation estimated by the MCC agree well with previous studies that used direct measurements, hydrographic data, and/or modeling efforts. In the shallower areas of the study region, the MCC technique is less applicable due to the predominance, in violation of the assumptions of the method, of nonadvective processes.

However, for ecological approaches to forest management to become widely accepted by forest managers, and for these tools to be widely used, methods must be developed to characterize and map or model ecosystem classes at landscape scales for large regions. In this study, the site-specific Northwestern Ontario Forest Ecosystem Classification (NWO FEC) was adapted to provide a landscape-scale (1:20 000) forest ecosystem classification for the Rinker Lake Study Area located in the boreal forest north of Thunder Bay, Ontario. High spatial resolution remote sensing data were collected using the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) and analyzed using geostatistical techniques to obtain an understanding of the nature of the spatial dependence of spectral reflectance for selected forest ecosystems at high spatial resolutions. Based on these analyses it was determined that an optimal size of support for characterizing forest ecosystems (i.e., optimal spatial resolution), as estimated by the mean ranges of a series of experimental variograms, differs based on (i) wavelength, (ii) forest ecosystem class, and (iii) mean maximum canopy diameter (MMCD). In addition, maximum semivariance as estimated from the sills of the experimental variograms increased with density of understory.

The work uses both simulate reflectance data, derived from a Monte Carlo ray-tracing model, and multiangle Advanced Solid-state Array Spectrometer (ASAS) data. Factorial analysis of variance was applied to the simulate reflectance data set in order to quantify the view angle dependence of the relative sensitivity of an index to independent variations in forest cover, crown leaf-area-index (LAI), stand structure, and background reflectance. Overall, it was found that off-nadir viewing improved the performance of the indices for discriminating cover and LAI, when compared with nadir viewing. The potential of the indices for discriminating forest cover was low either because of strong sensitivity to the other stand characteristics, or because of nonlinear relationships with cover. At low covers, GEMI performed best in the forward-scatter direction, while GEMI had poor sensitivity in the nadir case. The potential for discriminating crown LAI was good; both SAVI and GEMI were found to be sensitive to crown LAI in the backscatter direction. In the plane perpendicular to the solar principal plane, off-nadir viewing gave improved sensitivity to cover (NDVI) and to LAI (GEMI). The results indicate that Sun-sensor geometry may be exploited to improve discrimination of forest characteristics, using spectral indices, and further work is needed to test these findings with satellite data. The results are discussed in the context of off-nadir viewing sensors such as the ATSR-2.

The first is at the northern basin west of Luzon Island (16 degrees-18 degrees N, 117 degrees-119 degrees E), the second is at the center of the SCS (14 degrees-16 degrees N, 113.5 degrees-114.5 degrees E), and the third is off the central Vietnam coast (12 degrees-13 degrees N, 110 degrees-112 degrees E). Front empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, we found that the variations of these three active areas are dominated by annual cycles, but out of phase. The first two areas have the highest SSH in June and the lowest SSH in December. The third one off the Vietnam coast has the highest SSH in Ft February and the lowest SSH in August . The EOF analysis also reveals that the variation of SSH in the SCS has a response to El Nino events. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.', 'Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Oceanog, Keelung 20243, Taiwan.

In this study, landcover change is treated as a qualitative shift between landcover categories. The Change Detection Adaptive Fuzzy (CDAF) network learns fuzzy membership functions for each landcover class present at the first image date based on a sample of the image data. An image from a later date is then classified using this network to recognize change among familiar classes as well as change to unfamiliar landcover classes. The CDAF network predicts landcover change with 86% accuracy representing an improvement over both a standard multidate K-means technique which performed at 70% accuracy and a hybrid approach using a maximum likelihood classifier (MLC)/K-means which achieved 65% accuracy. In this study, we developed a hybrid classified based on conventional statistical methods (MLC/K-means classifier) for comparison purposes to help evaluate the performance of the CDAF network. The CDAF compared with existing change detection methodology has two features that lead to significant performance improvements: 1) new landcover types created by a change event automatically lead to the establishment of new landcover categories through an unsupervised learning strategy, and 2) for each pixel the distribution of fuzzy membership values across possible categories are compared to determine whether a significant change has occurred.

Because of differences in soil hydrologic characteristics, the forest is described by five ecotypes, which determine the understorey type and rile potential for pine growth. Bidirectional visible and near-infrared reflectances were analyzed from a daily NOAA-11 archive through years 1990-1994 using the bidirectional reflectance function model of Rahman. Rahman\'s model fits 72% of AVHRR visible reflectance, and 93% of AVHRR near-infrared reflectance. A typical example shows that 1) in the principal plane, he ratio of hot spot to forward scatter reflectance is 2.9 and 2.1 for visible and near-infrared, respectively, 2) bidirectional effects become negligible across the principal plane, and 3) NDVI shows a shape opposite to that of reflectances. After normalization, the seasonal dynamics of AVHRR reflectances were related to the phenological cycle of pine trees and under-storey vegetation. Visible reflectance drops earlier on coastal than on inland sites, due to an advance in the onset of pine growth. Near-infrared reflectance increases in summer for annual understory, and remains steady foe evergreen understorey. Differences in the seasonal dynamics of NDVI consequently characterize each Landes ecotype. From the modeled reflectances, we estimated the seasonal dynamics of visible and near-infrared albedo. We calculated the solar albedo by a combination of the last two. The visible albedo displays a seasonal dynamic similar ru that normalized visible reflectance. The solar albedo was found constant and around 12.7% on each eco-type In both cases, albedo strongly increases with solar zenith angle, consistent with ground measurements. These results clearly show the usefulness of coarse spatial resolution satellite data for the regional monitoring and modeling of temperate coniferous ecosystems.

Understanding how forest backscatter varies over the range of probable surface conditions is important in the selection of appropriate radar bands and incidence angles for forest sensing applications and for quantifying uncertainty of the derived forest characteristics. Using a canopy backscatter model, we examined the sensitivity of modeled C- and L-band backscatter to five surface para meters in three loblolly pine stands representing different stages of development in Duke Forest (NC). The parameters were litter depth and moisture content, soil ms height and correlation length, and soil moisture content. Of the bands considered L-HN backscatter had the highest sensitivity to the surface parameters, followed by L-VV. In the incidence angle range of 20 degrees-40 degrees, L-HH varied by 5.3-9.6 dB as the surface parameters changed over their range. whereas L-W varied by 3.7-4.5 dB. At shallower incidence angles, the sensitivities were lower but probably not negligible. C-HH and C-VV were sensitive only at steep incidence (theta(0)=20 degrees-30 degrees) for the lowest biomass stand studied. C-HH and C-VV sensitivity fell off with increasing incidence angle and stand maturity. L-HV showed slight sensitivity for the low-biomass stand and at theta(0)=20 degrees-30 degrees but was otherwise insensitive. C-HV was insensitive to the surface for all stands and angles. At L-band, the most influential of the five parameters was soil mts height, whereas, at C-band all parameters were about equal in influence. The modeled sensitivities suggested that the surface-related uncertainty in forest backscatter at L-HH and L-VV and at C-HH and C-W at steep incidence angles, may be unacceptably large for many applications.

It combines a partial atmospheric correction with a differential absorption technique. The atmospheric path radiance term is iteratively corrected during the retrieval of water vapor. This improves the results especially over low background albedos. The error of the method for various ground reflectance spectra is below 7% for most of the spectra. The channel combinations for two test cases are then defined, using a quantitative procedure, which is based on MOD-TRAN simulations and the image itself. An error analysis indicates that the influence of aerosols and channel calibration is minimal. The APDA technique is then applied to two AVIRIS images acquired in 1991 and 1995. The accuracy of the measured water vapor columns is within a range of +/-5% compared to ground truth radiosonde data.

We find that the sample temperature has the greatest influence on the applied atmospheric correction (cf.

Four scenes are evaluated at a constant incidence angle. Seven features are extracted from the SAR data,for potential use in classification using powers at different frequencies and polarizations. Given multiseason SIR-C/X-SAR imagery, there are three possible approaches in the classifier development: 1) Under the assumption that the scene does not change significantly as a function of time, develop one classification for a set of x scenes using n features, with x times the number of samples per feature; 2) ignore the multiseason availability and develop independent classifications for each scene using n features; 3) develop a true multitemporal classification where N of features equals n (number of features) times x (number of scenes). Each of these is applied using a combination knowledge-based and Bayesian classifier. Level II (roughly forest community) results show that the true multitemporal April/October classification works very well (97%), as do those for the individual scenes (>90%). A pooled classifier works poorly (April=90%, October=77%) and shows that temporal changes in phenology and moisture conditions contribute significant noise in terrain classification.

The following points are made: i) Fractional vegetation cover and LAI are not entirely independent quantities, depending on how LAI is defined. Care must be taken in using LAI and fractional vegetation cover independently in a model because the former may partially take account of the latter; ii) A scaled NDVI taken between the limits of minimum (bare soil) and maximum fractional vegetation cover is insensitive to atmospheric correction for both clear and hazy conditions, at least for viewing angles less than about 20 degrees from nadir; iii) A simple relation between scaled NDVI and fractional vegetation cover, previously described in the literature, is further confirmed by the simulations; iv) The sensitive dependence of LAI on NDVI when the former is below a value of about 2-4 may be viewed as being due to the variation in the bare soil component.

Over the Orgeval watershed (France), the ground condition stayed very wet throughout the 5-day SAR mission. The SAR imagery allows a data collection over a range of roughness conditions on bare soils. Three classes were identified: very smooth sowings with crusted top layer, cloddy surfaces, and different ploughed fields for future crops. To complement the Shuttle Radar data (three frequencies, L, C, X, incidence range from 44 degrees to 57 degrees), the helicopter-borne scatterometer ERASME (C- and X-bands, copolarized configurations) were used. Merging of the two databases was possible. As a result, incidence angles ranging from 25 degrees to 50 degrees are available in C- and X-bands for the copolarized cross sections. Then the major objective of the article is, over this available surface backscattering models to natural surfaces, the theoretical integral equation model (IEM) of Fung et al. (1992) and the empirical model of Oh et al. (1994). It shows adequacies and limits. The IEM model reproduces well radar scatter over smooth surfaces, but fails over rough surfaces, predicting a flatter response with incidence angle than the observed signals in C- and X-bands. Difference in backscatter response due to direction angles (perpendicular and parallel to the row direction) is difficult to reproduce over smooth surfaces by this model integrating anisotropic surface but may be due to the unadequacy of the surface representation. The Oh algorithm agrees well with the backscatter response over rough surfaces at medium incidence angle, but fails with a systematic underestimation over smooth conditions. As a conclusion, further developments are necessary on derivation of theoretical solutions over rough surfaces and on validation of semiempirical algorithms over data sets of various training sources (radar and natural conditions).

In this study, 5 years (1989-1993) of NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer satellite data were used to investigate the variability of the Mississippi River sediment plume and the environmental forcing factors responsible for its variability. Plume variability was determined by extracting information on plume area and plume length from 112 cloudl-free satellite images. Correlation and multiple regression techniques were used to quantify these relationships for possible predictive applications. River discharge and wind forcing were identifed as the main factors affecting plume variability. Seasonal and interannual variabilities in plume area were similar in magnitude and corresponded closely with large changes in river discharge. However, day-to-day variability in plume size and morphology was more closely associated with changes in the wind field. The plume parameters bst predicted by the multiple regression models were plume area, east and west of the delta. Predictive models were improved by separating the data into summer and winter seasons. The best predictive model for the western area was obtained during summer when 64% of plume variability was explained by river discharge, wind speed, and the east-west wind component. The best model for the eastern plume area was obtained during summer when river discharge, the north-south and east-west wind components explained 70% of plume variability. The best model for the offshore extent of the sediment plume was obtained during summer when 53% of plume variability was explained by the east-west wind component, river discharge, and wind speed. All plume measurements were maximized by eastward winds from slightly different directions. During winter, the area and length of the western plume was additionally enhanced by offshore winds associated with winter storms. Anticyclonic curvature of the plume west of the delta was observed in 42% of the satellite images. This circulation pattern was observed primarily in association with westward winds.RP Walker, ND (通讯作者)，LOUISIANA STATE UNIV, INST COASTAL STUDIES, DEPT COASTAL & OCEANOG SCI, BATON ROUGE, LA 70803 USA.RI Walker, Nan/D-8819-2013', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 34, 119, 124, 0, 22, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

A growing body of research has shown a significant radar backscatter response to biomass in a variety of forest systems. Alaskan boreal forests may be well suited to radar remote sensing. The sites selected represent black spruce (Picea mariana) and white spruce (Picea glauca) stands in a post-fire chronosequence. Black spruce biomass ranged from less than 1 kg/m(2) to 5.6 kg/m(2) and white spruce from 8.8 to 21.5 kg/m(2). Results indicate both ERS-1 and JERS-1 backscatter is responsive to biomass, density, and height, though other factors, principally surface moisture conditions, are often a stronger influence. Sensitivity to forest biomass and structure appears greatest when surface moisture conditions are minimized as a factor. Biomass correlations with the radar backscatter were strongest in the late winter Imagery when all sites had a snow cover, and late summer when the surface is most dry. ERS-1 data may be more sensitive to surface moisture conditions than the JERS-1 data due to the shorter wavelength of the C-band sensor, though this is inconclusive because of limited JERS-1 L-band data for comparison. Also, though the ERS-1 platform has proved to provide a very stable signal, results must be interpreted with caution as the dynamic range for our study sites is often less than 4 dB, and the uncertainty of the backscatter estimate is +/- 1.5 dB.', 'ENVIRONM RES INST MICHIGAN,CTR EARTH SCI,ANN ARBOR,MI 48107.RP Harrell, PA (通讯作者)，DUKE UNIV,SCH ENVIRONM,DURHAM,NC 27708, USA.RI French, Nancy/I-5975-2019', NULL, NULL, 'French, Nancy/0000-0002-2389-3003; Bourgeau-Chavez,   Laura/0000-0001-7127-279X', NULL, NULL, 51, 94, 101, 0, 6, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

The current article examines the extent to which differences in the rate of sell moisture generation, as a function of soil type or locality, can account for these results. It concludes that they cannot. This study demonstrates that the five soil types do differ significantly with respect to both the rate of soil moisture generation per unit rainfall and the ratio of NDVI to soil moisture. The most productive soils are the clay-rich vertisols; the arenosols are the feast productive, although the rate of soil moisture generation is about the same for both soil types.

Under dry soil conditions, the backscatter increased about 2-3 dB as the biomass increased from 0.05 kg/m2 to about 0.5-1.5 kg/m2, and the backscatter may be saturated near a 0.5-1.5 kg/m2 biomass level.

Passive microwave remote sensing has been proven to be an efficient method to detect SD at regional or global scales. However, numerous heterogeneous snow property parameters and forest parameters affect the microwave radiation characteristics, which is a great challenge for SD retrieval. In this study, a novel SD retrieval algorithm that comprehensively considered the multiple sensitive factors was developed at global scales by coupling the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS) model and machine learning (ML) technique. The exponential correlation length (Pec), snow density (& rho;), and forest cover fraction (fforest) are three sensitive parameters for retrieving SD from passive microwave observations based on the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (EFAST) algorithm. The key parameter Pec, which characterizes the snow microstructure information inside snowpacks, was optimized by minimizing the brightness temperature between satellite observations and microwave radiative transfer model simulations by integrating the MEMLS, forest impact, and atmospheric radiation attenuation. The random forest (RF) ML technique was used, and the optimal combination of independent variables was selected by correlation heatmap and importance ranking of variables. Six selected essential parameters, including Pec, vertical polarized brightness temperature differences between 18.7 and 36.5 GHz, & rho; from ERA5, fforest, elevation, and longitude together with target SD output were used to train the RF model. Seventy percent of the entire data at meteorological stations were randomly chosen to train the RF model, and the remaining 30% were adopted as the validation data from 2013 to 2020 to ensure the mutual independence of training data and validation data. Compared with independent in situ measurements, the overall RMSE of SD is 13.6 cm, which was noticeably lower than those of the international SD remote sensing products and reanalysis datasets, including AMSR2 (36.2 cm), GlobSnow 3.0 (25.3 cm), ERA5 (38.2 cm), and ERA5-land (29.9 cm).

In situ precipitation datasets, remote sensingbased estimations, and reanalysis products have heterogeneous uncertainty. Numerous models have been developed to merge precipitation estimations from different sources to improve the accuracy of QPE. However, many of these attempts are mainly focused on spatial or temporal correlations between various remote sensing sources and/or gauge data separately, and thus, the developed model cannot fully capture the inherent spatiotemporal dependencies that could potentially improve the precipitation estimations. In this study, we developed a general framework that can simultaneously merge and downscale multiple user-defined precipitation products by using rain gauge observations as target values. A novel deep learning-based convolutional neural network architecture, namely, the precipitation data fusion network (PDFN), that combines multiple layers of 3D-CNN and ConvLSTM was developed to fully exploit the spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation. This architecture benefits from techniques such as batch normalization, data augmentation schemes, and dropout layers to avoid overfitting and address skewed class proportions due to the highly imbalanced nature of the precipitation datasets. The results showed that the fused daily product remarkably improved the mean square error (MSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) by 35% and 16%, respectively, compared to the best-performing product.', '[Gavahi, Keyhan; Foroumandi, Ehsan; Moradkhani, Hamid] Univ Alabama, Ctr Complex Hydrosyst Res, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.', 'University of Alabama System; University of Alabama TuscaloosaRP Gavahi, K; Moradkhani, H (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Ctr Complex Hydrosyst Res, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.', 'kgavahi@crimson.ua.edu; hmoradkhani@ua.eduRI Moradkhani, Hamid/B-1571-2012; Foroumandi, Ehsan/CAH-3797-2022', 'Moradkhani, Hamid/0000-0002-2889-999X; Foroumandi,   Ehsan/0000-0001-6867-7550', 'NOAA- CIROH [NA22NWS43220003, A22-0310]; USACE-ERDC [W912HZ2220003]', 'Partial financial support for this study was provided by NOAA- CIROH   Contract #NA22NWS43220003, project #A22-0310, and USACE-ERDC contract   #W912HZ2220003.', 103, 0, 0, 25, 25, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Thus, daily NTL images are increasingly applied to monitor human dynamics and environmental events. However, data gaps caused by cloud contamination and low-quality observations inevitably impair the effectiveness of such applications. Although a temporal gap-filling method is employed in recent Black Marble NTL products to produce seamless images, the filled images are unsuitable for quantitative analysis. Therefore, we developed an effective method, named as Cloud Removing bY Synergizing spatioTemporAL information (CRYSTAL), to generate cloud-free NTL images with satisfactorily accurate pixel brightness and spatial continuity. Simulation experiments show that CRYSTAL can produce more accurate results than the temporal gap-filling method in fifteen cities worldwide, with an average RMSE reduction of 33.69%. Images generated by CRYSTAL restore temporal variances in NTL and are thus suitable for multi-temporal quantitative analysis. CRYSTAL can reconstruct daily NTL time series by filling gaps using available partially clear images. Experiments in two cities demonstrated that the reconstructed time series had 31.85% more valid values than the original time series and effectively revealed urban dynamics during the early stages of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. In summary, CRYSTAL is a novel and effective gap-filling method for the restoration of invalid NTL observations and has the potential to generate high-quality NTL data for use in future applications.', '[Tan, Xiaoyue; Zhu, Xiaolin] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

In a previous study, we improved the P-Net by combining the feature enhancement algorithm based on the convolutional block attention module and several popular data augmentation methods in the computer vision domain, the classification accuracy can be significantly increased, and the degree of model overfitting can be reduced. However, there is a clear boundary between the data augmentations and the feature enhancement algorithm, which is manifested in that data augmentations are only used to enrich the diversity of the learned samples, but cannot directly affect the construction of the objective function, thus limiting the ability of data augmentations. In fact, in the supervised contrastive learning research, data augmentation methods are often used to generate positive samples of an anchor image to construct the objective function, i.e. supervised contrastive loss. The core idea for solving such a boundary problem is to use contrastive learning to make the anchor image close to its positive samples and the negative samples away from each other. Inspired by this, we introduced supervised contrastive learning in the P-Net, i.e., SCL-P-Net, which takes the discriminative feature representations as the constraints of the prototype clustering algorithm. In SCL-P-Net, data augmentation methods can not only extend the sample distribution, but also be used to construct the supervised contrastive loss directly. The study involves four airborne hyperspectral image datasets related to tree species classification, including the GFF-A and GFF-B datasets collected from Gaofeng Forest Farm in Nanning City, Guangxi Province, South China, the Xiongan dataset from Matiwan Village in Xiongan New Area, Hebei Province, North China, and the Tea Farm dataset from Fanglu Tea Farm in Changzhou City, Jiangsu Province, East China. The highest overall accuracy (OA) for the four datasets is 99.23% for GFF-A, 98.39% for GFF-B, 99.30% for Xiongan, and 99.54% for Tea Farm. It is concluded that the proposed SCL-P-Net classification framework can achieve multiple tree species classification with high-precision. Without changing the basic classification framework of P-Net, the introduction of supervised contrastive learning makes the combination of the data augmentations and the feature enhancement algorithm and plays a positive role in improving the distinguishability between samples.', '[Chen, Long; Wu, Jing; Xie, Yifan; Zhang, Xiaoli] Beijing Forestry Univ, Forestry Coll, Beijing Key Lab Precis Forestry, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.

The highly parameterized surface energy balance models suffer from significant uncertainties. Remote sensing information of incoming and outgoing radiation fluxes are important input variables for turbulent heat flux models, though analytical solutions of surface energy budget from these variables are yet to be derived. Here, we developed a novel, purely physics-based analytical method grounded on the thermodynamic principle of maximum power. The approach derives the total turbulent heat flux only from the four inputs of incoming and outgoing longwave and shortwave radiations at the land surface, which are available from remotely sensed satellite data. The proposed approach does not use any parameteri-zation, unlike the existing surface energy balance models, and hence does not suffer from uncertainty due to the same. We validated our methodology with 102 eddy covariance observation stations around the globe with different land use land covers from FLUXNET2015 and available urban datasets. Based on monthly averages of the total turbulent flux estimates for the eddy covariance sites, we observed root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 23.2 & PLUSMN; 10.9 Wm-2, a mean bias error (MBE) of 11.9 & PLUSMN; 13.1 Wm-2 and R2 value of 0.86 & PLUSMN; 0.15. Using the satellite observations of radiation fluxes from CERES at a spatial resolution of 10, we obtained the global flux field of total turbulent flux (QJ) and land surface heat storage (& UDelta;Qs) fluxes. On validation of QJ with FLUXNET sites for six grids for different land use land cover, we found RMSE of 20.1 & PLUSMN; 7 Wm-2, MBE of 14.4 & PLUSMN; 9 Wm-2 and R2 value of 0.96 & PLUSMN; 0.02. Further, from the evaporative stress factor of GLEAM, which is based on microwave remotely sensed vegetation optical depth and root zone soil moisture, we have obtained spatially distributed global estimates of Sensible(H) and latent heat (LE). In addition, our analytical estimates address the distribution of residual energy associated with the surface energy balance closure problem driven by the land use land cover. The theoretical estimates of all surface energy balance components from remote sensing based observations will improve our understanding of surface warming for different land use land covers across the globe.', '[Gupta, Mayank] Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Urban Sci & Engn, Mumbai 400076, India.

Satellite measurements are crucial to provide continent-wide precipitation estimates, and this highlights the importance of validating the satellite estimates with measurements collected by ground-based Antarctic stations. The NASA CloudSat satellite, launched in 2006, is equipped with a 94 GHz (W-band) Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) that provides measurements of reflectivity profiles of clouds and precipitation, whereas the incoming ESA/JAXA EarthCARE mission will add Doppler capability to a 94 GHz radar. This study explores how the synergy between two instruments available at most Antarctic stations, i.e., Micro Rain Radar (24 GHz, K-band) and laser disdrometer, can be used to validate satellite-borne W-band radar measurements, including Doppler estimates. A new validation methodology (K2W) was proposed to combine these instruments for simulating the 94 GHz reflectivity and Doppler measurements from Micro Rain Radar spectra. Assessment of the proposed K2W conversion methodology showed that the CloudSat Ze profiles can be simulated by the method with 0.2 dB mean difference at the lowest satellite radar range bin when time lag within +/- 12.5 min and the distance within 25 km around the CloudSat overpass were considered. With the K2W method, the 94 GHz Doppler velocity below 1 km altitude that would be observed by EarthCARE was obtained, and the standard deviation of the simulated Doppler velocity was found to be smaller than about 0.2 m s-1. The simulated 94 GHz Doppler radar profile information, which is less affected by attenuation compared to groundbased 94 GHz radar, will significantly improve the quantification of precipitation over Antarctica. This methodology will be applied to further assess the EarthCARE CPR Doppler velocity measurement accuracy as well as the Level 2 standard products for precipitation in Antarctica and at many other ground observation sites.', '[Bracci, Alessandro; Baldini, Luca] CNR, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate ISAC, Rome, Italy.

The model adopted a fusion architecture of residual and pyramid networks to achieve robust estimation performance. The model inputs include three different data types: essential ocean color parameters, satellite-derived environmental parameters, and the slope of above-surface remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs). We compared the model performances with various input parameters to determine the most effective inputs. The results showed that R-rs in the essential ocean color parameters and sea surface temperature (SST) in the environmental parameters were the most critical input parameters. The estimation of phytoplankton pigment concentrations was validated against HPLC data using the leave-one-out crossvalidation method. Except for three pigments, 19\'-butanoyloxy-fucoxanthin, prasinoxanthin, and lutein, the estimated pigment concentrations and in-situ observations were strongly correlated for all other pigments (an average relative root-mean-square error of 0.59, R-2 >= 0.60, and regression slopes close to 1). In addition, a time series analysis was performed on the MODIS retrieved global pigment concentrations during 2003-2021 using the established DL-PPCE model to explore the relationship between the distribution of phytoplankton groups and El Nino in the western equatorial Pacific. Our findings revealed that the prokaryotes-dominated area extended eastward from180 degrees E to 150 degrees W during the 2015/2016 El Nino event. From 2003 to 2021, prokaryotic abundance was positively correlated with El Nino intensity ( R = 0.65, P << 0.01) but negatively correlated with the abundance of the entire phytoplankton community ( R = -0.53, P << 0.01). These results demonstrate that the DLPPCE model presents a novel approach for estimating the concentration of 17 pigments worldwide, and the estimated pigment concentrations are advantageous for analyzing the phytoplankton community dynamics on a large spatiotemporal scale.', '[Li, Xiaolong; Yang, Yi; Li, Xiaofeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, CAS Key Lab Ocean Circulat & Waves, Qingdao, Peoples R China.

Hyperspectral remote sensing of plant canopies offers a key tool to map multiple plant traits. However, we are still lacking generalized methods to translate hyperspectral reflectance into a suite of relevant plant traits across biomes, land cover and sensor types. The absence of globally representative data sets and the gap between the available reflectance data with corresponding in-situ measurements have hampered such approaches. In recent years, the scientific community acquired multiple data sets encompassing canopy hyperspectral reflectance and plant traits from different plant types and sensors. To combine these heterogeneous data sets, we propose three multi-trait modeling approaches based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to simultaneously infer a broad set of 20 structural and chemical traits (e.g. leaf mass per area, leaf area index, pigments, nitrogen). The performance of these multi-trait CNN models predicting these traits was compared against single-trait CNN as well as single-trait partial least squares regression (PLSR). We found that the multi-trait CNNs performances significantly increased from single-trait CNNs (nRMSE = 0.027-19.61%) and the state-of-the-art PLSR models (nRMSE = 1.94-40.07%) across a broad range of vegetation types (crops, forest, tundra, grassland, shrubland) and sensor types. Thus, providing a single model for multiple traits not only proved to be computationally more efficient, but also more accurate, since it enabled the model to incorporate traits\' co-variation. Despite the data heterogeneity of the merged data set, our models performances\' were comparable or exceeded those of previous studies. Overall, this study highlights the potential of weakly supervised approaches to overcome the scarcity of in-situ measurements and take a step forward in creating efficient predictive models of multiple biochemical and biophysical vegetation properties.', '[Cherif, Eya; Feilhauer, Hannes; Kattenborn, Teja] Univ Leipzig, Remote Sensing Ctr Earth Syst Res RSC4Earth, Talstr 35, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.

Numerous past studies have developed and intercompared different RSQ algorithms to demonstrate their feasibility, yet relatively few have focused on assessing how the RSQ algorithms are adapted to a wide range of rivers globally. As the community is now ready to expand to the global scale given advances in computing power, sensors, and the launch of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission, a much broader geographic view of RSQ ac-curacy should be prioritized toward \"better generalizability\" instead of \"higher accuracy at limited places\". To help close this gap, we extracted multi-temporal river widths from >350 K Landsat scenes at >3 K river reaches globally, and used them to estimate discharge using the Bayesian AMHG-Manning (BAM) algorithm and the geomorphologically-enhanced variant (geoBAM). We use this framework to demonstrate how to apply an \'off the shelf\'RSQ algorithm and test it globally without methodological intervention and answer: does it live up to its promise? Our daily discharge inversions (1984-2019) showed positive Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) at 27% of the gauges for BAM and 39% for geoBAM, and this percentage increased to 46-65% after feeding richer priors on flow seasonality and monthly variability, amounting to 1400-2000 successful inversions. Exploratory analyses showed that the inversion is the most sensitive to a channel geomorphological parameter b and climate aridity, where the optimal conditions are high -b, humid environments, as well as moderate width variability, leaf area index (LAI), and river width. Although specific to BAM/geoBAM, constraining the factors to their optimal ranges led to a median KGE of 0.33 for >600 gauges, which highlights the promising potential for global RSQ. We further discussed the optimal configuration of the RS/priors by analyzing results derived from different infor-mation content in priors. Overall, our critical assessment of BAM/geoBAM reveals a successful global imple-mentation of an existing algorithm that SWOT will improve. We suggest similar large-scale assessments for other RSQs be prioritized to identify the emerging challenges as we move into a new era with global river monitoring capability from space.', '[Lin, Peirong] Peking Univ, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & GIS, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.

How-ever, it\'s not clear how lake transitions occur at regional and global scales. This is due to a lack of long-term monitoring and an effective algorithm that can distinguish floating/emergent aquatic vegetation (FEAV), sub-merged aquatic vegetation (SAV) and algal bloom (AB). This paper presents a novel three-step classification algorithm based on Landsat imagery, (ie., vegetation and bloom indices (VBI) algorithm): (1) to distinguish between aquatic vegetation (AV) and non-aquatic vegetation (non-AV) extents by an aquatic vegetation index (AVI) derived from tasseled cap transformation; (2) to identify FEAV and SAV within AV extent by using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and (3) to extract AB from non-AV extent with floating algae index (FAI). The performance of the VBI algorithm was validated using 1307 field samples collected across 22 lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLY) in China, with a pooled overall accuracy of 84.49%. Finally, the VBI algorithm was applied to Landsat data from 1985 to 2021 to quantify the temporal changes of FEAV, SAV and AB in large lakes (i.e., > 50 km2) along the MLY. Within these lakes, AV showed a significant decrease over the past 37 years, mainly due to the decrease of SAV; while AB occurred with higher frequency and in more lakes. The transition from a macrophyte-dominated state to a phytoplankton-dominated aquatic systems is still ongoing in the MLY area. This study shows outstanding innovation in the construction of a new classification index (i.e., AVI), and the method of calculating the adaptive threshold, which makes VBI algorithm have great potential in mapping long-term changes and capturing transformation between lake communities on a global scale.', '[Luo, Juhua; Ni, Guigao; Zhang, Yunlin; Wang, Kang; Shen, Ming; Cao, Zhigang; Qi, Tianci; Xiao, Qitao; Qiu, Yinguo; Cai, Yongjiu; Duan, Hongtao] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.', 'Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing Institute of Geography & Limnology,   CASRP Duan, HT (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.', 'htduan@niglas.ac.cnRI Qiu, Yinguo/IZD-6490-2023; Qi, Tianci/IRZ-2645-2023; Duan,   Hongtao/B-7210-2011', 'Duan, Hongtao/0000-0002-1985-2292; Luo, Juhua/0000-0002-4615-6006', 'National Natural Science Foundation of China [42271377, U2243205,   41971314, 41971309]; Science and Technology Planning Project of NIGLAS   [NIGLAS2022GS09]; Paolo Villa (Institute for Electromagnetic Sensing of   the Environment, National Research Council)', 'This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science   Foundation of China (42271377, U2243205, 41971314, 41971309) and by   Science and Technology Planning Project of NIGLAS (NIGLAS2022GS09) .

To understand forest ecosystem dynamics and the ecological role of human and natural disturbances, researchers and managers would like to characterize spatiotemporal patterns of several types of disturbance. Recent advances include the development and testing of algorithms to automatically detect and attribute an array of disturbance types across large forest landscapes from remotely sensed imagery. We reviewed the scientific literature for automated disturbance type attribution in forest ecosystems to synthesize current knowledge and inform future work. We created metrics that characterize study contexts, methods, and outcomes to evaluate 34 studies that automated the attribution of several (two or more) forest disturbance types. Reported accuracies of similar to 80% for up to eight disturbance types at local (500 km(2)) to continental (6.5 x 106 km(2)) spatial extents reaffirm the potential for attributing forest disturbances from remote sensing data at scales relevant to ecological research and forest management. Generally, greater accuracies were reported for attributing disturbance types that affect most of a pixel and exhibit spectral signatures distinct from other disturbances or the prior (undisturbed) condition. Accuracy of attributing disturbance type tends to be notably lower for disturbances with smaller spatial extents or resulting in subtle spectral changes, such as small patches of tree mortality covering <40% of a pixel or areas of tree damage without evident mortality (e.g., defoliator outbreaks). Nearly all (33 of 34) studies used Landsat image time series to attribute disturbance types because the Landsat archive is freely accessible, spans several decades (allowing longer-term change analyses), is calibrated to facilitate change analyses, and has multiple spectral bands that aid algorithms. In our synthesis, most studies focused on specific disturbance types of interest within a particular study area, rather than a comprehensive list of types that would make the algorithm more generally applicable at broader spatial extents. We recommend several future research areas to improve the thematic resolution, accuracy, and potentially the transferability of attribution algorithms. Further development and testing of algorithms will continue to reveal the most effective approaches for attributing disturbance types that have been more difficult to detect with available spectral data to date, such as insect damage or low severity wildfire, and to evaluate model sensitivity as well as accuracy. The lessons that collectively emerge from automated forest disturbance attribution studies have the potential to guide future research and management applications.', '[Stahl, Amanda T.; Andrus, Robert; Meddens, Arjan J.

Existing merging frameworks typically use gauge-based precipitation error statistics and neglect the inter-dependence of various precipitation products. However, gauge-observation uncertainties at daily and sub-daily time scales can bias merging weights and yield sub-optimal precipitation estimates, particularly over data-sparse regions. Likewise, frameworks ignoring inter-product error cross-correlation will overfit precipitation observation noise. Here, a Statistical Uncertainty analysis-based Precipitation mERging framework (SUPER) is proposed for addressing these challenges. Specifically, a quadruple collocation analysis is employed to estimate precipitation error variances and covariances for commonly used precipitation products. These error estimates are subsequently used for merging all products via a least-squares minimization approach. In addition, false-alarm precipitation events are removed via a reference rain/no-rain time series estimated by a newly developed categorical variable merging method. As such, SUPER does not require any rain gauge observations to reduce daily random and rain/ no-rain classification errors. Additionally, by considering precipitation product inter-dependency, SUPER avoids overfitting measurement noise present in multi-source precipitation products. Results show that the overall RMSE of SUPER-based precipitation is 3.35 mm/day and the daily correlation with gauge observations is 0.71 [- ] - metrics that are generally superior to recent precipitation reanalyses and remote sensing products. In this way, we seek to propose a new framework for robustly generating global precipitation datasets that can improve land surface and hydrological modeling skill in data-sparse regions.', '[Dong, Jianzhi; Chen, Xi; Gao, Man] Tianjin Univ, Inst Surface Earth Syst Sci, Tianjin, Peoples R China.

The angular effect (AE) of remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST), one of the obstacles hindering the application of single-source energy balance models in continental and global ET estimates, is a long-standing issue that has rarely been witnessed in the last decade. In this study, we propose a general framework for correcting the angular effect that could be practically applied to reduce the uncertainties in the ET estimations with any single-source energy balance-based model, under the guidance of simulation of thermal radiation directionality through the integration of a directional module from the soil-canopy spectral radiances, photosynthesis, fluorescence, temperature, and energy balance (SCOPE) and an artificially added ET estimation module. The correction was conducted by adjusting the directional reflectance and then the reflectance-based fractional vegetation coverage to the view zenith angle of interest, together with estimating the soil and vegetation component temperatures. This framework was later tested on the widely applied surface energy balance system (SEBS) driven by the directional LST from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) collected on 94 clear-sky days between 2009 and 2010 at the Yucheng site. The simulation results indicated that (1) the AE obviously increased as the view zenith angle increased; (2) the AE was more apparent in the backward scattering direction than in the forward scattering direction; and (3) most of the AE first increased evidently and then decreased with the increase in the leaf area index. The correction results related to the SEBS-based ET estimations, compared to the in situ ET measurements, showed that the proposed framework greatly improved the estimations of ET, with the root mean square error decreasing by 27.6 W/m(2)(similar to 8%, relative to the average 339 W/m(2)) from 86.8 W/m(2) (similar to 25%) to 59.2 W/m(2) (similar to 17%) and the bias decreasing from 49.7 W/m(2) (similar to 15%) to similar to 6.5 W/m(2) (similar to 2%). In conclusion, the proposed framework efficiently corrected the angular effect of remotely sensed LST on ET estimation. We expect more attention to be paid to the angular effect and hope our work could provide insight for solving this pendent issue.', '[Jiang, Yazhen; Tang, Ronglin; Li, Zhao-Liang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

Confidence intervals for the proportion of area are typically estimated using the Wald interval, a procedure that is known to yield less than nominal coverage (i.e., undercoverage) when the proportion of area is small (i.e., comprising 10% or less of the region of interest). The practical implication of undercoverage is that confidence intervals will include the true proportion of area for a smaller percent of samples than is implied by the stated confidence level (e.g., 95%). For simple random sampling, alternate confidence interval methods such as Wilson, Agresti-Coull, and Clopper-Pearson have been developed to remedy the undercoverage of the Wald interval, but these methods are not directly applicable to stratified sampling. In this study, we evaluated the Wald interval and two alternative general confidence interval approaches for the case of two strata. One alternative approach, previously proposed in the literature, is based on estimating effective sample size (neff method), whereas the other approach is a new method based on summing stratum-specific confidence bounds (sumstrat method) computed using one of the alternate confidence interval approaches (Wilson, Agresti-Coull, and Clopper-Pearson) for each stratum. The coverage and length of confidence intervals estimated from the different methods were compared using Monte Carlo simulation applied to a set of populations representing diverse conditions of prevalence of the target class and user\'s and producer\'s accuracies of the map used to construct the strata. The commonly applied Wald interval achieved coverage well below the nominal 95% confidence for many of the populations evaluated, and the neff method improved upon this undercoverage in only a few populations. The Wilson sumstrat intervals provided the best coverage as this method achieved close to the nominal 95% coverage or greater for most populations. Length of the Wilson sumstrat intervals was comparable to length of other methods.

Our analysis reveals clear responses of the GNSS-R sigma 0 to the presence of currents. The response depends on the wind conditions and is more prominent for wind speeds below 6 m/s. A current velocity of 0.5 m/s under an opposing wind can, on average, suppress the GNSS-R sigma 0 by 0.8 decibels for low incidence angles. The interaction of the same current with a codirectional wind can enhance sigma 0 by almost the same amount. This enhancement is most visible at high incidence angles.

Airborne platforms sample SIF data at a spatial scale intermediate between in-situ and satellite, matching that of ground measurement (e.g. flux tower footprints and other field sampling), enabling us to explore causes of SIF variation and validate satellite-based SIF products. However, harmonizing SIF across sensors and platforms (correcting for systematic errors to yield a consistent, comparable SIF product) is challenging because SIF can be retrieved in different absorption windows, with different instruments and methods complicating the comparison between different observational levels (i.e., ground, airborne, satellites) and between sites equipped with different instruments with varying optical prop-erties (spectral resolution and sampling intervals, spatial resolution). Additionally, the spatial and temporal variability of atmospheric properties can influence the retrieval of the weak SIF signal. Because of these com-plications, direct comparisons of airborne and ground SIF across scales are rarely attempted. In this study, we combined airborne SIF data with simultaneous \'ground truth\' data collected by stationary and mobile platforms in a soybean field in Nebraska, USA. In this effort, we tested several SIF extraction methods, including Fraunhofer Line Discrimination (FLD), improved Fraunhofer Line Discrimination (iFLD), Spectral Fitting Method (SFM), SpecFit, and a Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD) method. The SpecFit method was sensitive to the 715-740 nm water bands and removing the water bands in the fitting process yielded better agreement between the airborne and ground SIF spectra. Accurate estimation of the ground level downwelling irradiance obtained by ground measurements over a calibration target improved agreement between airborne and ground SIF retrievals at the O2A band, and allowed us to derive a SIF dataset with improved agreement across platforms and sampling scales. This experimental approach provided a method for generating comparable SIF signals across instruments, methods and platforms, which is critical to understanding the SIF-GPP relationship at different scales and to cross-validate the diversity of platforms used for satellite products calibration and validation.', '[Wang, Ran; Gamon, John A.; Zygielbaum, Arthur I.; Suyker, Andrew] Univ Nebraska Lincoln, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.

These measurements are primary dedicated to land & ocean color applications, but actually include also reliable information for atmospheric aerosol and surface brightness characterization. In the framework of the EUMETSAT funded study to support the Copernicus Program, we describe the retrieval of aerosol and surface properties from OLCI single-viewing multi-spectral Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) radiances based on the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP) algorithm. The high potential of the OLCI/GRASP configuration stems from the attempt to retrieve both aerosol load and surface reflectance simultaneously using a globally consistent high-level approach. For example, both over land and ocean surfaces OLCI/GRASP uses 9 spectral channels (albeit with different weights), strictly the same prescribed aerosol models and globally the same a priori constraints (though with some differences for observations over land and ocean). Due to the lack of angular multi-viewing information, the directional properties of underlying surface are strongly constrained in the retrieval: over ocean the Fresnel reflection together with foam/whitecap albedo are exclusively computed using a priori wind speed; over land, the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) is slightly adjusted from a priori values of climatological Ross-Li volumetric and geometric terms. Meanwhile, the isotropic reflectance is retrieved globally under mild spectral smoothness constraints. It should be noticed that OLCI/GRASP configuration employs innovative multi-pixel concept (Dubovik et al., 2011) that enhance retrieval by simultaneously inverting large group of pixels. The concept allows for benefiting from knowledge about natural variability of the retrieved parameters. The obtained OLCI/GRASP products were validated with the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) and intercompared with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol and surface products. The overall performance is quite comparable to the community -referenced MODIS. Over ocean the OLCI/GRASP results are encouraging with 67% of the AOD (550 nm) satisfying the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) requirement using AERONET coastal sites and 74% using MAN deep ocean measurements, and an AOD (550 nm) bias 0.01 with AERONET and nearly zero bias with MAN. Over land, 48% of OLCI/GRASP AOD (550 nm) satisfy the GCOS requirement and a bias within +/- 0.01 for total and AOD < 0.2. Key challenges are identified and discussed: adequate screening of cloud contaminations, retrieval of aerosol over bright surfaces and in the regions containing complex mixtures of aerosol.', '[Chen, Cheng; Litvinov, Pavel; Fuertes, David; Lopatin, Anton; Matar, Christian; Karol, Yana] GRASP SAS, Villeneuve Dascq, France.

Laborintensive ground surveys that are usually used for terrestrial plant biodiversity assessment are difficult to conduct in the mangrove forests. Assessing plant biodiversity from space does offer a novel perspective, but existing solutions are mainly focused on estimating alpha- or beta-diversities (i.e., diversity within communities or diversity among communities) alone. This paper applied a novel holistic biodiversity approach that could partition gamma-diversity into alpha- and beta-diversities for plant diversity mapping with operational satellites (WorldView-2, Sentinel-2, and Zhuhai-1) and field plots in the Qinglangang Provincial Nature Reserve, Hainan, China. We compared the resulting outputs of the alpha-diversity from the holistic method (SD alpha) to those by the coefficient of variation (CV) and the Rao\'s Q index, and the contributions of individual spectral features to alpha- and beta-diversity were also measured. Results indicated that alpha- and beta-diversities accounted for -30% and - 70% of the total diversity in the Reserve, respectively. alpha-diversity derived from the WorldView-2 images showed statistically higher correlations with the observed Shannon\'s index (R2: 0.20-0.42) compared to that from Sentinel-2 and Zhuhai-1 (R2: 0.03-0.15). beta-diversity derived from WorldView-2 images had the highest accuracy (90.00%), followed by that from Sentinel-2 and Zhuhai-1 (83.33% and 73.33%, respectively). Red-edge and near-infrared spectral features were the most informative features for diversity mapping while shortwave infrared (SWIR) features were also valuable for beta-diversity mapping.

The growing volume of freely available data represents nowadays a challenge in terms of storage capacity and computing resources which, together with the complexity of the processing (code parameterization, combination of the image sequences, coregistration of the images) may prevent the exploitation of long time series. We propose here a new version of the Multiple-Pairwise Image Correlation toolbox for processing OPTical images (MPIC-OPT). The toolbox proposes an end-to-end solution to compute the horizontal sub-pixel ground deformation time series from large Sentinel-2 datasets. In addition to time series inversion, several corrections and filtering options are integrated to reduce the noise and improve the accuracy and precision of the measurements. In particular, an automatic jitter correction based on wavelet filtering is proposed. Moreover, the MPIC-OPT service is deployed on the Tier 1.5 HighPerformance Computing cluster (e.g. Datacentre/EOST-A2S) of the University of Strasbourg and is accessible on-line through the ESA Geohazards Exploitation Platform (GEP) and the ForM@Ter Solid Earth computing infrastructure with a user-friendly environment to query the satellite data catalogues, parameterize the processing and visualize the outputs. We test the performances of MPIC-OPT on several use cases: the measurement of the co-seismic ground deformation of the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence (USA), of the rapid motion of the Slumgullion landslide (USA) and of the glaciers of the Mont-Blanc massif (France/Italy). We show that the results of MPIC-OPT are in agreement with in-situ data. The jitter correction significantly improves the precision (RMSEjitter=0.3m vs. RMSEnojitter=0.5m) and the accuracy (RMSEjitter=0.3m vs. RMSEnojitter=1.3m) of the measurement of the co-seismic displacement of the Rigdecrest seismic deformation. We show that the precision and accuracy of the terrain deformation estimation depend mainly on the correlation threshold and the temporal matching range parameters and we quantify and discuss their impacts.

Thermal remote sensing-based methods, using coarse resolution satellites, have been successful at estimating ETa over the conterminous United States (CONUS) and other regions of the world. In this study, we present CONUS-wide ETa from Landsat thermal imagery-using the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. Over 150,000 Landsat satellite images were used to produce 10 years of annual ETa (2010-2019) at unprecedented scale. The accuracy assessment of the SSEBop results included point-based evaluation using monthly Eddy Covariance (EC) data from 25 AmeriFlux stations as well as basin-scale comparison with annual Water Balance ETa (WBET) for more than 1000 sub-basins. Evaluations using EC data showed generally mixed performance with weaker (R-2 < 0.6) correlation on sparsely vegetated surfaces such as grasslands or woody savanna and stronger correlation (R-2 > 0.7) over well-vegetated surfaces such as croplands and forests, but location-specific conditions rather than cover type were attributed to the variability in accuracy. Croplands performed best with R-2 of 0.82, root mean square error of 29 mm/month, and average bias of 12%. The WBET evaluation indicated that the SSEBop model is strong in explaining the spatial variability (up to R-2 > 0.90) of ETa across large basins, but it also identified broad hydro-climatic regions where the SSEBop ETa showed directional biases, requiring region-specific model parameter improvement and/or bias correction with an overall 7% bias nationwide. Annual ETa anomalies over the 10-year period captured widely reported drought-affected regions, for the most part, in different parts of the CONUS, indicating their potential applications for mapping regional-and field-scale drought and fire effects. Due to the coverage of the Landsat Path/Row system, the availability of cloud-free image pixels ranged from less than 12 (mountainous cloud-prone regions and U.S. Northeast) to more than 60 (U.S. Southwest) per year.

Accuracy assessment of fused images is crucial for users to select appropriate methods for real-world applications. However, commonly used assessment metrics do not comprehensively cover multiple aspects of spatiotemporal fused image quality, contain redundant information, and are not comparable across different study areas. To address these problems, this study proposed a novel framework to assess all-round performances of spatiotemporal fusion methods. Four accuracy metrics, including RMSE, AD, Edge, and local binary patterns (LBP), were selected as the optimal set of assessment metrics according to the assessment criteria. These metrics not only quantify the spectral and spatial information in the fused images but also greatly alleviate information redundancy and feature computational simplicity. Furthermore, inspired by Taylor diagrams, we designed an all-round performance assessment (APA) diagram to provide a visual tool for a comprehensive assessment of the performance of spatiotemporal fusion methods, supporting cross-comparison of different spatiotemporal fusion methods by considering the effects of input data and land surface characteristics. The case study in three typical sites demonstrated that the proposed framework can better differentiate the performances of six spatiotemporal fusion methods. This new framework can promote the cross-comparison of different spatiotemporal fusion methods and guide users to select suitable methods for real-world applications, as well as facilitate the establishment of a standard accuracy assessment procedure for spatiotemporal fusion methods.', '[Zhu, Xiaolin; Liang, Zicong; Xu, Shuai] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

This study investigated the sensitivity of surface FT changes to warming over Arctic permafrost regions by analyzing long-term changes in surface FT phenology from satellite remote sensing and meteorological variables from the climate data for the period from 1979 to 2017. Averaging over the entire Arctic permafrost regions, spring thawed date apparently advanced by -2.05 days decade-1, whereas autumn frozen date showed weak delaying trend of 0.83 days decade-1, implying the lengthening of the thawed season. Dividing the regions by permafrost types, advancing trends of thawed dates in continuous and high ice content permafrost areas (-2.57 and -2.70 days decade-1) were stronger than those over the discontinuous and low ice content permafrost areas (-1.61 and -1.73 days decade-1). The difference in changes in spring thawed dates between the regions is attributed to the difference in absolute magnitude of warming trends (e.g., 0.72 degrees C decade- 1 for continuous vs. 0.44 degrees C decade- 1 for discontinuous). However, the temperature sensitivity over discontinuous (low ice content) permafrost areas was 23% (10%) stronger than that over continuous (high ice content) permafrost areas for thawed date. In case of autumn, delaying trends of frozen dates were smaller over continuous and high ice content areas (0.69 and 0.74 days decade-1) than those over discontinuous and low ice content areas (1.01 and 0.88 days decade-1). This is mainly explained by the difference in temperature sensitivity (e.g., 1.57 days degrees C- 1 for continuous vs. 2.18 days degrees C- 1 for discontinuous) to warming between the regions rather than the difference in the absolute warming trends between the regions (e.g., 0.91 degrees C decade- 1 for continuous vs. 0.51 degrees C decade- 1 for discontinuous). The stronger temperature sensitivity of discontinuous and low ice content permafrost could be related to the lower demand of latent heat for the phase change of ground ice (or water).

Despite a well-constrained global budget, quantification of local and regional methane emissions has proven challenging. Recent advancements in airborne remote sensing instruments such as from the next-generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) provide 2-D observations of CH4 plume column enhancements at an unprecedented resolution of 1-5 m over large geographic areas. Quantifying an emission rate from observed plumes is a critical step for understanding local emission distributions and prioritizing mitigation efforts. However, there exists no method that can predict emission rates from detected plumes in real-time without ancillary data reliably. In order to predict methane point-source emissions directly from high resolution 2-D plume images without relying on other local measurements such as background wind speeds, we trained a convolutional neural network model called MethaNet. The training data was derived from large eddy simulations of methane plumes and realistic measurement noise over agricultural, desert and urban environments. Our model has a mean absolute percentage error for predicting unseen plumes under 17%, a significant improvement from previous methods that require wind information. Using MethaNet, a validation against a natural gas controlled-release experiment agrees to within the precision error estimate. Our results support the basis for the applicability of using deep learning techniques to quantify CH4 point sources in an automated manner over large geographical areas, not only for present and future airborne field campaigns but also for upcoming space-based observations in this decade.', '[Jongaramrungruang, Siraput; Frankenberg, Christian] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.

Snow depth, an important parameter of snowpack, is a necessary variable for retrieving sea ice thicknesses based on satellite altimeter data. Here, regression analysis (RA) is used to determine the best gradient ratio (GR) combination of brightness temperatures for estimating snow depths, and the RA model is proposed. Based on the RA model, one additional deep learning model is built, namely, the 5-variable long short-term memory (5VLSTM) model (or the RA-5VLSTM model). Meanwhile, an additional neural network model is built for comparisons, namely, the 5-variable genetic wavelet neural network (5VGWNN) model (or the RA-5VGWNN model). Using Operation IceBridge (OIB) and ice mass balance buoy (IMB) data, these three models, plus three existing algorithms, are compared to assess their performances in estimating snow depth. The results show that the RA-5VLSTM model performed pretty well among the six algorithms, with an RMSE of 7.16 cm. The RA5VLSTM model, a robust approach, was less influenced by the uncertainty in the input data. From January to April during 2012-2020, the average monthly snow depth in the Beaufort Sea and the Chukchi Sea mainly showed a downward trend, while an upward trend was observed in the Central Arctic in most months.

The Hutubi underground gas storage (HUGS) in Xinjiang province is the largest UGS in China, so it is of great significance to monitor its operation. At present, the researches on the HUGS mainly rely on traditional geodetic monitoring (e.g., in-situ leveling and global navigation satellite system (GNSS)), which has a short time span and low spatial resolution. The whole-domain and long-temporal sequence surface displacements induced by gas recovery (before 2013) and injection/extraction (since 09/06/2013) were seldom reported. In this study, the large-scale background deformation was firstly obtained using the ALOS PALSAR data (2006-2011), and the displacement time series of the HUGS over 2003-2020 was observed by all available Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from multiple SAR sensors (Envisat ASAR, TerraSAR/TanDEM-X, Sentinel1). The results show that this area had a long history of slow subsidence (2.2 mm/yr) before 2013. Since 06/ 2013, the surface of the HUGS showed periodic uplift and subsidence with a net uplift. The average uplift rate in the center was about 7 mm/yr during 08/2013-07/2015 and 13 mm/yr during 03/2015-05/2020. The deformation has a temporal correspondence with the gas extraction/injection process. The accuracy is assessed by the cross-validation of the results of different datasets and the GNSS measurements. The compound dislocation model (CDM) is used to model the dynamic displacements caused by gas injection/extraction in HUGS. This model can reflect the UGS volume changes and the estimated central depth (3499.7 m) and height (108.6 m) of the storage are consistent with the actual central depth (-3585 m) and height (-110 m). We also restore the dynamic change of the pore pressure and the injected gas volume during the 5-7 cycles, on the basis of the linear relations between gas injection volume, pore pressure, and CDM parameters. In 12/2017, the estimated gas inventory of the HUGS is 91.29 x 108 m3, about 4.7% smaller than the real gas inventory of 95.77 x 108 m3.

Since Solar Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) is uniquely emitted from vegetation, it can be used to evaluate how well reflectance-based vegetation indices (VIs) can separate the vegetation and soil components. Due to the residual soil background contributions, Near-infrared (NIR) reflectance of vegetation (NIRv) and Difference Vegetation index (DVI) present offsets when compared to SIF (i.e., the value of NIRv or DVI is non-zero when SIF is zero). In this study, we proposed a simple framework for estimating the true NIR reflectance of vegetation from Hyperspectral measurements (NIRvH) with minimal soil impacts. NIRvH takes advantage of the spectral shape variations in the red-edge region to minimize the soil effects. We evaluated the capability of NIRvH, NIRv and DVI in isolating the true NIR reflectance of vegetation using the data from both the model-based simulations and Hyperspectral Plant imaging spectrometer (HyPlant) measurements. Benchmarked by simultaneously measured SIF, NIRvH has the smallest offset (0-0.037), as compared to an intermediate offset of 0.047-0.062 from NIRv, and the largest offset of 0.089-0.112 from DVI. The magnitude of the offset can vary with different soil reflectance spectra across spatio-temporal scales, which may lead to bias in the downstream NIRv-based photosynthesis estimates. NIRvH and SIF measurements from the same sensor platform avoided complications due to different geometry, footprint and time of observation across sensors when studying the radiative transfer of reflected photons and SIF. In addition, NIRvH was primarily determined by canopy structure rather than chlorophyll content and soil brightness. Our work showcases that NIRvH is promising for retrieving canopy structure parameters such as leaf area index and leaf inclination angle, and for estimating fluorescence yield with current and forthcoming hyperspectral satellite measurements.', '[Zeng, Yelu; Qiu, Han; Chen, Min] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

Both interpret the measured radiance with inversion algorithms that estimate surface reflectance, emissivity, surface temperatures, and the atmospheric state. However, the two regimes have traditionally used independent inversion methods. Here we present the first simultaneous inversion of the upwelling radiance spectrum from the UV through the VSWIR and the Thermal Infrared. Maximum A Posteriori estimation determines the surface and atmosphere state that is most consistent with measured radiance across the entire range. We find that the complementary information in the two intervals improves estimates of atmospheric properties, surface emissivity, and surface temperature. Posterior uncertainty is 40% lower in surface temperature and 60% in air temperature. Spurious correlations between atmospheric and surface state are also reduced, with 90% lower correlated uncertainty between total column water vapor and both surface and air temperature. Temperature-emissivity separation also improves, with a 33% reduction in correlated posterior uncertainty between the parameters.

Hyperspectral remote sensing (RS) provides feasible solutions for obtaining crop leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) by the advantages of its repeated and high throughput observations. However, the data redundancy and the poor robustness of the inversion models are still major obstacles that prevent the widespread application of hyperspectral RS for crop LCC evaluation. For winter wheat LCC inversion from hyperspectral observations, this study described a novel hybrid method, which is based on the combination of amplitude- and shape- enhanced 2D correlation spectrum (2DCOS) and transfer learning. The innovative feature selection method, amplitude- and shape- enhanced 2DCOS, which originated from 2DCOS, additionally considered the relationships between external perturbations and hyperspectral amplitude and shape characteristics to enhance the dynamic spectrum response. To extract the representative LCC featured wavelengths, the amplitude- and shape- enhanced 2DCOS was conducted on the leaf optical PROperties SPECTra (PROSPECT) + Scattering from Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves (SAIL) (PROSAIL) simulated dataset, which covered most possible winter wheat canopy spectra. Nine wavelengths (i.e., 455, 545, 571, 615, 641, 662, 706, 728, and 756 nm) were then extracted as the sensitive wavelengths of LCC with the amplitude- and shape- enhanced 2DCOS. These wavelengths had specificity to LCC and showed good correlation with LCC from the aspect of photosynthesis mechanism, molecular structure, and optical properties. The transfer learning techniques based on the deep neural network was then introduced to transfer the knowledge learned from the PROSAIL simulated dataset to the inversion tasks of field measured LCC. Parts of the labeled samples in field observations were used to finetune the model pre-trained by the simulated dataset to improve the inversion accuracy of the winter wheat LCC in different field scenes, aiming to reduce the need for the field measured and labeled sample size. To further ascertain the universality, transferability and predictive ability of the proposed hybrid method, field samples collected from different locations at different phenological phases, including the jointing and heading stages in 2013, 2014, and 2018, were utilized as target tasks to validate the proposed hybrid method. Moreover, the LCC of winter wheat estimated with the proposed method was evaluated with the ground-based platform and the UAV-based platform to verify the model versatility for different monitoring platforms. Various validations demonstrated that the hybrid inversion method combining the amplitude- and shape- enhanced 2DCOS and the fine-tuned transfer learning model could effectively estimate winter wheat LCC with good accuracy and robustness, and can be extended to the detection and inversion of other key variables of crops.', '[Zhang, Yao; Sun, Hong; Li, Minzan] China Agr Univ, Key Lab Modern Precis Agr Syst Integrat Res, Minist Educ, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.

Both soil moisture and VOD are retrieved from satellite brightness temperature measurements assuming a zeroth order radiative transfer model, commonly known as the tau-omega model. In this model the emission of a vegetated surface is dependent on soil moisture, vegetation absorption and vegetation scattering. Vegetation scattering is normally represented by the single scattering albedo, omega, and is commonly assumed to be a time-invariant calibration parameter to achieve high accuracy in soil moisture estimation. Therefore, little is known about omega dynamics in the context of its ecological information content. Furthermore, VOD and omega are functions of more fundamental absorption and scattering coefficients kappa(a) and kappa(s). In this study, we retrieve both VOD and omega as well as kappa(a) and kappa(s) in two separate tau-omega model frameworks using known soil moisture information. Our sensitivity analysis confirms that vegetation attenuation has a strong impact on the sensitivity of the retrieval to noise. If vegetation attenuation approaches zero, omega is weakly constrained, which leads to strong w dynamics. If vegetation attenuation is very high, VOD, kappa(a) and kappa(s) are increasingly less constrained and susceptible to noise, while omega becomes quasi time-invariant. Coinciding with our sensitivity study, global retrievals from SMAP brightness temperatures exhibit large omega dynamics in drylands and deserts, decreasing rapidly with increasing vegetation cover. In drylands omega might peak during the dry season at the seasonal VOD minimum. With increasing vegetation attenuation, omega dynamics start to follow leaf phenology before they transition to a nearly time-invariant omega in forested areas. VOD, kappa(a) and kappa(s) follow the dynamics of wet biomass and peak after the maximum of leaf area index and precipitation. Our results suggest that zeroth order scattering is generally time-invariant over a majority of the global vegetated areas. In general, time dynamic omega and kappa(s) might provide additional information on the state of the vegetation canopy, which can be valuable for biosphere studies and relevant for the parameterization of vegetation scattering in soil moisture retrievals.', '[Baur, Martin J.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England.

A few change detection algorithms such as Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) have been developed to utilize all available Landsat images for change detection and characterization at local or global scales. However, the reliable, rapid, and reproducible collection of training samples have become a challenge for time series land cover classification at a large scale. To meet the challenge, we proposed an automatic phenology learning (APL) method with the assumption that the temporal profiles of samples within the same land cover type are the same or similar at a local scale to generate evenly distributed training samples automatically. We designed the method to build land cover patterns for each category based on consensus samples derived from multiple existing scientific datasets including LANDFIRE\'s (LF) Existing Vegetation Type (EVT), USGS National Land Cover Database (NLCD), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Cropland Data Layer (CDL), and National Wetlands Inventory (NWI). Then we calculated the Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (twDTW) distance between any undefined samples and land cover patterns in the same geographical region as prior knowledge. Finally, we selected the optimal land cover category for each undefined sample from the land cover products based on the designed criteria iteratively using the twDTW distance as an indicator. The method was applied in the footprint of 10 selected Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) tiles in the eastern and western conterminous United States (CONUS) to produce annual land cover maps from 1985 to 2017. The accuracy assessment and visual comparison revealed that the APL method can generate reliable training samples without any manual interpretation, producing better land cover results especially for the grass/ shrub and wetland land cover classes. Applying the APL method, the overall accuracy of the annual land cover maps was improved by 2% over the accuracy of Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP) Collection 1.0 Science Products in the research regions. Our results also indicate that the APL method provides an approach for best use of different land cover products and meets the requirement of intensive sampling for training data collection.', '[Li, Congcong; Zhou, Qiang] US Geol Survey USGS, Earth Resources Observat & Sci EROS Ctr, ASRC Fed Data Solut, Work Performed USGS Contract 140G0119C0001, Sioux Falls, SD 57198 USA.

To date, a variety of retrieval algorithms as well as surface roughness and scattering albedo have been developed. However, a comprehensive evaluation of different algorithms with the new surface parameters across diverse biomes, climates, and terrain slopes is lacking. To narrow down this knowledge gap, here we examine the performance of various existing algorithms, including V-pol Single Channel Algorithms (SCA-V), H-pol Single Channel Algorithms (SCA-H), classic DCA, extended DCA (E-DCA), regularized DCA (RDCA), land parameter retrieval model (LPRM), multi-temporal DCA (MT-DCA), constrained multi-channel algorithm (CMCA), and spatially constrained multi-channel algorithm (S-CMCA). The SM estimates are evaluated against in-situ measurements from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) while VOD estimates are compared with the two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2), tree height, and aboveground biomass. This study has led to several important findings: (1) The overall bias, root mean square error (RMSE), and unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) of SM estimates from different algorithms generally increase with vegetation density while their temporal correlations with in-situ measurements decrease as the terrain slope increases. (2) The divergence between different SM estimates is relatively larger over forested areas than non-forested areas. (3) In terms of temporal correlation with in-situ measurements, the SCA-V and RDCA outperform other algorithms over most land cover types and climates. (4) SCA-H typically underestimates SM more compared to other algorithms across sparsely vegetated areas and most climates. (5) The ubRMSE values demonstrate that all algorithms have close performance when EVI2 is less than 0.3; however, the performance of classic DCA decays notably when EVI2 exceeds 0.3. (6) VOD retrievals from RDCA exhibit improved spatial correlations with EVI2, tree height, and aboveground biomass across the globe compared to other algorithms.

The penetration of radar waves in the snowpack is a major source of uncertainty to retrieve surface elevation. To correct this effect, a better understanding of the sensitivity of the radar waveforms to snow properties is needed. Here, we present an extension of the Snow Model Radiative Transfer (SMRT) to compute radar waveforms and conduct a series of simulations on the Antarctic ice sheet. SMRT is driven by snow and surface roughness properties measured over a large latitudinal range during two field campaigns on the Antarctic Plateau. These measurements show that the snowpack is rougher, denser, less stratified, warmer, and has smaller snow grains near the coast than on the central Plateau. These simulations are compared to satellite observations in the Ka, Ku, and S bands. SMRT reproduces the observed waveforms well. For all sites and all sensors, the main contribution comes from the surface echo. The echo from snow grains (volume scattering) represents up to 40% of the amplitude of the total waveform power in the Ka band, and less at the lower frequencies. The highest amplitude is observed on the central Plateau due to the combination of higher reflection from the surface, higher scattering by snow grains in the Ka and Ku bands, and higher inter-layer reflections in the S band. In the Ka band, the wave penetrates in the snowpack less deeply on the central Plateau than near the coast because of the strong scattering caused by the larger snow grains. The opposite is observed in the S band, the wave penetrates deeper on the central Plateau because of the lower absorption due to the lower snow temperatures. The elevation bias caused by wave penetration into the snowpack show a constant bias of 10 cm for all sites in the Ka band, and a bias of 11 cm, and 21 cm in the Ku band for sites close to the coast and the central Plateau, respectively. Now that SMRT is performing waveform simulations, further work will address how the snowpack properties affect the parameters retrieved by more advanced retracking algorithms such as ICE-2 for different snow cover surfaces.', '[Larue, Fanny; Picard, Ghislain; Arnaud, Laurent; Robledano-Perez, Alvaro; Le Meur, Emmanuel; Favier, Vincent; Jourdain, Bruno; Savarino, Joel] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Inst Geosci Environm IGE, UMR 5001, F-38041 Grenoble, France.

In particular, we focus our analysis on three periods: a) the time interval following the 2014 flank eruption, b) the July-August 2019 eruption and c) the following post-eruptive phase. To do this, we take advantage from an unprecedented set of space-borne and ground-based SAR data collected from April 2015 up to November 2019 along two (one ascending and one descending) Sentinel-1 (S-1) tracks, as well as, in the same period, by two ground-based systems installed along the Sciara del Fuoco northern rim. Such data availability permitted us to first characterize the volcano long-term 3D deformation behavior of the pre-eruptive period (April 2015-June 2019), by jointly inverting the space-borne and ground-based InSAR measurements. Then, the GB-SAR measurements allowed us to investigate the sin-eruptive time span (3rd July 2019 - 30th August 2019) which revealed rapid deformation episodes (e.g. more than 30 mm/h just 2 min before the 3rd July 2019 explosion) associated with the eruptive activity, that cannot be detected with the weekly S-1 temporal sampling. Finally, the S-1 measurements permitted to better constrain the post 2019 eruption deformations (31st August 2019 - 5th November 2019), which are mainly located outside the GB-SAR sensed area. The presented results demonstrate the effectiveness of the joint exploitation of the InSAR measurements obtained through satellite and terrestrial SAR systems, highlighting their strong complementarity to map and interpret the deformation phenomena affecting volcanic areas.', '[Di Traglia, Federico; Casagli, Nicola] Univ Firenze, Dipartimento Sci Terra, Via La Pira 4, I-50121 Florence, Italy.

Among the used remote sensing modalities, LiDAR has attracted wide attention for its ability to directly provide accurate 3D information. Despite the increasing utilization of LiDAR technology in phenotyping, there is still a lack of effective quality control strategies, in particular, quality control of LiDAR data collected on a multi-temporal basis. This study proposes a targetless framework for multi-temporal LiDAR data quality control and crop characterization in mechanized agricultural fields. Features extracted from the fields ? terrain patches and row/alley locations ? are utilized for evaluating the vertical and planimetric relative accuracy of the point clouds. Row/alley locations in the field are automatically identified from the point clouds based on the assumption that higher point density and/or higher elevation correspond to plant locations. The performance of the proposed quality control strategies is evaluated using multi-temporal datasets collected in agricultural fields of different sizes, orientation, crops, and growth stages. The result shows that the net vertical and planimetric discrepancies between multi-temporal point clouds are ?3 cm and ?8 cm, respectively. While the former reflects the actual accuracy of the point clouds, the latter is a combined effect of the LiDAR point cloud accuracy, rasterization artifacts, crop type, growth pattern, and wind condition during data acquisition. In terms of row and alley detection, the result shows that the proposed strategy achieves high performance and can deal with different planting orientation, crop types, growth stages, canopy cover, and planting density. In conclusion, this study presents a quality control framework for multi-temporal LiDAR data. Moreover, the row and alley detection leads to automated extraction of plots, and hence facilitates the use of remotely sensed data for automated phenotyping.', '[Lin, Yi-Chun; Habib, Ayman] Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.', 'Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus;   Purdue UniversityRP Habib, A (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.', 'ahabib@purdue.edu', NULL, 'Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), U.S. Department of   Energy [DE-AR0000593]; Heat Tolerant Maize for Asia project - Feed the   Future Initiative of USAID', 'This work was funded in part by the Advanced Research Projects   Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), U.S. Department of Energy, under Award Number   DE-AR0000593.

Innovative acquisition modes such as drone-borne or terrestrial remote sensing open up new scales and angles of observation, which allow to analyze small-scale, vertical, or difficult-to-access outcrops. A variety of available sensors operating in different spectral ranges can provide information about the abundance and spatial location of various geologic materials. However geological outcrops are inherently uneven and spectrally heterogeneous, may be covered by dust, lichen or weathering crusts, or contain spectrally indistinct objects, which is why classifications or domain mapping approaches are often used in geoscientific and mineral exploration applications as a means to discriminate mineral associations (e.g. ore or alteration zones) based on overall variations in HS data. Feature extraction (FE) algorithms are prominently used as a preparatory step to identify the first order variations within the data and, simultaneously, reduce noise and data dimensionality. The most established FE algorithms in geosciences are, by far, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF). Major progress has been conducted in the image processing community within the last decades, yielding innovative FE methods that incorporate spatial information for smoother and more accurate classification results. In this paper, we test the applicability of conventional (PCA, MNF) and innovative FE techniques (OTVCA: Orthogonal total variation component analysis and WSRRR: Waveletbased sparse reduced-rank regression) on three case studies from geological HS mapping campaigns, including drone-borne mineral exploration, terrestrial paleoseismic outcrop scanning and thermal HS lithological mapping. This allows us to explore the performance of different FE approaches on complex geological data with sparse or partly inaccurate validation data. For all case studies, we demonstrate advantages of innovative FE algorithms in terms of classification accuracy and geological interpretability.

LST data retrieved from thermal infrared (TIR) band imagery, however, tend to have a coarser spatial resolution (e.g., 100 m for Landsat 8) than surface reflectance (SR) data collected from shortwave bands on the same instrument (e.g., 30 m for Landsat). Spatial sharpening of LST data using the higher resolution multi-band SR data provides an important path for improved agricultural monitoring at sub-field scales. A previously developed Data Mining Sharpener (DMS) approach has shown great potential in the sharpening of Landsat LST using Landsat SR data co -collected over various landscapes. This work evaluates DMS performance for sharpening ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) LST (similar to 70 m native resolution) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) LST (375 m) data using Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) SR data, providing the basis for generating 30-m LST data at a higher temporal frequency than afforded by Landsat alone. To account for the misalignment between ECOSTRESS/VIIRS and Landsat/HLS caused by errors in registration and orthorectification, we propose a modified version of the DMS approach that employs a relaxed box size for energy conservation (EC). Sharpening experiments were conducted over three study sites in California, and results were evaluated visually and quantitatively against LST data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) flights and from Landsat 8. Over the three sites, the modified DMS technique showed improved sharpening accuracy over the standard DMS for both ECOSTRESS and VIIRS, suggesting the effectiveness of relaxing EC box in relieving misalignment-induced errors. To achieve reasonable accuracy while minimizing loss of spatial detail due to the EC box size increase, an optimal EC box size of 180-270 m was identified for ECOSTRESS and about 780 m for VIIRS data based on experiments from the three sites. Results from this work will facilitate the development of a prototype system that generates high spatiotemporal resolution LST products for improved agricultural water use monitoring by synthesizing multi-source remote sensing data.', '[Xue, Jie; Anderson, Martha C.; Gao, Feng; Yang, Yun; Knipper, Kyle R.; Kustas, William P.] USDA ARS, Hydrol & Remote Sensing Lab, 10300 Baltimore Ave, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA.

In this study, the principle of ensemble learning was introduced to provide two general soil moisture retrieval frameworks accounting for these issues. Instead of trying to find an optimal global solution, multiple soil moisture retrievals (termed sub-retrievals) with moderate performance were first obtained using different channels and/or time instances randomly selected from the available data, with the retrieved ensemble of results being the final output. The ensemble retrievals, taking one existing snapshot method and two multi-temporal methods as the base retrieval algorithms, were evaluated using a synthetic data set with the effectiveness confirmed under various uncertainty sources. An evaluation using the Fifth Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment (SMAPEx-5) data set showed that the ensemble retrieval outperformed the non-ensemble retrieval in most cases, with a decrease of 0.004 to 0.014 m(3)/m(3) in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and an increase of 0.01 to 0.16 in correlation coefficient (R).

In situ radiometric and biological data were acquired from three intertidal meadows of Zostera noltei along the European Atlantic coast in the summers of 2018 and 2019. This information allowed algorithms to estimate SPC and SB from a vegetation index to be developed and assessed. Importantly, a single SPC algorithm could consistently be used to study Z. noltei-dominated meadows at several sites along the European Atlantic coast. To analyze the seagrass seasonal cycle and to select images corresponding to its maximal development, a two-year S2 dataset was acquired for a French study site in Bourgneuf Bay. The po-tential of S2 to characterize the Z. noltei seasonal cycle was demonstrated for exposed intertidal meadows. The SPC map that best represented seagrass growth annual maximum was validated using in situ measurements, resulting in a root mean square difference of 14%. The SPC and SB maps displayed a patchy distribution, influenced by emersion time, mudflat topology, and seagrass growth pattern. The ability of S2 to measure the surface area of different classes of seagrass cover was investigated, and surface metrics based on seagrass areas with SPC >= 50% and SPC >= 80% were computed to estimate the interannual variation in the areal extent of the meadow. Due to the high spatial resolution (pixel size of 10 m), frequent revisit time (<= 5 days), and long-term objective of the S2 mission, S2-derived seagrass time-series are expected to contribute to current coastal ecosystem management, such as the European Water Framework Directive, but to also guide future adaptation plans to face global change in coastal areas. Finally, recommendations for future intertidal seagrass studies are proposed.', '[Zoffoli, Maria Laura; Gernez, Pierre; Rosa, Philippe; Le Bris, Anthony; Barille, Laurent] Univ Nantes, Lab Mer Mol Sante, Fac Sci, 2 Rue Houssiniere, F-44322 Nantes, France.

However, atmospheric correction (AC) of GOCI data with high solar zenith angle ( > 70 degrees) is still a challenge for traditional algorithms. Here, we propose a novel neural network (NN) AC algorithm for GOCI data under high solar zenith angles. Unlike traditional NN AC algorithms trained by radiative transfer-simulated dataset, our new AC algorithm was trained by a large number of matchups between GOCI-observed Rayleigh-corrected radiance in the morning and evening and GOCI-retrieved high-quality noontime remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs). When validated using hourly GOCI data, the new NN AC algorithm yielded diurnally stable Rrs in open ocean waters from the morning to evening. Furthermore, when validated by in-situ data from three Aerosol Robotic Network-Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) stations (Socheongcho, Gageocho and Ieodo), the GOCI-retrieved Rrs at visible bands obtained using the new AC algorithm agreed well with the in-situ values, even under high solar zenith angles. Practical application of the new algorithm was further examined using diurnal GOCI observation data acquired in clear open ocean waters. Results showed that the new algorithm successfully retrieved Rrs for the morning and evening GOCI data. Moreover, the amount of Rrs data retrieved by the new algorithm was much higher than that retrieved by the standard AC algorithm in SeaDAS. Our proposed NN AC algorithm can not only be applied to process GOCI data acquired in the morning and evening, but also has the potential to be applied to process polar-orbiting satellite ocean color data at high-latitude ocean that also include satellite observation with high solar zenith angles.', '[Li, Hao; He, Xiangqiang; Bai, Yan; Zhu, Qiankun; Gong, Fang; Wang, Difeng; Huang, Haiqing] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Guangzho, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.

However, very few observation systems exist that are capable of providing measurements with high spatial and temporal resolution to identify hotspots for emission control purposes. Here we introduce a mountain-top remote sensing observatory, the California Laboratory for Atmospheric Remote Sensing (CLARS), for mapping the enhancement of CO column-averaged mixing ratio (XCO) over the Los Angeles (LA) megacity. Compared to conventional observation network, CLARS is unique in the following ways: (1) it mimics a geostationary satellite observatory for LA with approximately hourlyand kilometer-scale mapping capability; (2) the free tropospheric background atmosphere is simultaneously measured; and (3) the measurements are highly sensitive to anthropogenic emissions due to the long light path along the planetary boundary layer (PBL). The CO slant column density and XCO are retrieved from reflected sunlight measurements in the 2.3 mu m CO band and the 1.27 mu m oxygen (O2) band. Data filtering and corrections for aerosol scattering and geometric effects are then implemented to derive the XCO enhancement, which is the XCO excess in the PBL compared to the background value. In the LA megacity, the XCO enhancement shows a distinctive diurnal cycle primarily driven by changes in anthropogenic emissions and sea-breeze circulation. Such diurnal patterns can be reproduced by the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). The enhancement also shows a significant weekly cycle resulting from the weekly pattern in anthropogenic CO emissions. On average, the XCO enhancements on Sunday and Saturday are 16.1% and 4.4%, respectively, lower than weekday values. The weekly XCO enhancement patterns also show high correlation with traffic counts. A seasonal pattern of XCO enhancement with high (low) spatial contrast in summer (winter), resulting from changing sea-breeze circulation, can be observed. These diurnal, weekly, and seasonal patterns of XCO enhancement serve as tracers of the atmospheric pulse of the LA megacity. The CLARS observatory can serve as a testbed for future geostationary missions to track anthropogenic emissions in cities.', '[Zeng, Zhao-Cheng; Sander, Stanley P.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Joint Inst Reg Earth Syst Sci & Engn JIFRESSE, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.

However, there are no annual or multi-year epoch maps of Spartina saltmarsh in China, which hinders our understanding and management of Spartina invasion. In this study, we selected Chongming island, China, where Spartina saltmarsh had expanded rapidly since its introduction in the 1990s. We investigated phenology of Spartina, Phragmites and Scirpus saltmarshes, and the time series vegetation indices derived from Landsat images showed that Spartina saltmarsh did not green-up in April-May and stayed green in December-January, which differed from the phenology of Phragmites and Scirpus saltmarshes. We developed a pixel- and phenology-based algorithm that used time series Landsat data to identify and map Spartina saltmarsh, and we applied it to quantify the temporal dynamics (expansion and removal) of Spartina saltmarsh on Chongming island during 1995-2018. The resultant maps showed that Spartina saltmarsh area on Chongming island increased from similar to 4 ha in 1995 to similar to 2067 ha in 2012 but dropped substantially to similar to 729 ha in 2016 after a large-scale ecological engineering project (US$ 186 million) was started to remove Spartina during 2013-2016. Chongming island still had similar to 1315 ha Spartina saltmarsh in 2018, and majority of it was distributed outside the Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve, which could serve as the sources for reinvasion in the near future.

Recently, remote sensing of R-n at regional and global scales has attracted considerable attention and has achieved significant advances. However, there are many issues in estimating all-sky daily average R-n at high latitudes, such as posing greater uncertainty by surface and atmosphere satellite products at high latitudes, and unavailability of real-time and accurate cloud base height and temperature parameters. In this study, we developed the LRD (length ratio of daytime) classification model using the genetic algorithm-artificial neural network (GA-ANN) to estimate all-sky daily average R-n at high latitudes. With a very high temporal repeating frequency (similar to 6 to 20 times per day) at high latitudes, data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used to test the proposed method. R-n measurements at 82 sites and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) data of MODIS from 2000 to 2017 were matched for model training and validation. Two models for estimating daily average R-n were developed: model I based on instantaneous daytime MODIS observation and model II based on instantaneous nighttime MODIS observation. Validation results of model I showed an R-2 of 0.85, an RMSE of 23.66 W/m(2), and a bias of 0.27 W/m(2), whereas these values were 0.51, 15.04 W/m(2), and -0.08 W/m(2) for model II, respectively. Overall, the proposed machine learning algorithm with the LRD classification can accurately estimate the all-sky daily average R-n at high latitudes. Mapping of R-n over the high latitudes at 1 km spatial resolution showed a similar spatial distribution to R-n estimates from the Clouds and the Earth\'s Radiant Energy System (CERES) product. This method has the potential for operational monitoring of spatio-temporal change of R-n at high latitudes with a long-term coverage of MODIS observations.', '[Chen, Jiang; He, Tao] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Aquarius mission, with the primary objective to provide global SSS measurements from space operated from mid-2011 to mid-2015. NASA\'s Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) mission, primarily dedicated to soil moisture measurements, but also monitoring SSS, has been operating since early 2015. The primary sensors onboard these three missions are passive microwave radiometers operating at 1.4 GHz (L-band). SSS is retrieved from radiometer measurements of the sea surface brightness temperature (TB). In this paper, we first provide a historical review of SSS remote sensing with passive L-band radiometry beginning with the discussions of measurement principles, technology, sensing characteristics and complementarities of the three aforementioned missions. The assessment of satellite SSS products is then presented in terms of individual mission characteristics, common algorithms, and measurement uncertainties, including the validation versus in situ data, and, the consideration of sampling differences between satellite SSS and in situ salinity measurements. We next review the major scientific achievements of the combined first 10 years of satellite SSS data, including the insights enabled by these measurements regarding the linkages of SSS with the global water cycle, climate variability, and ocean biochemistry. We also highlight the new ability provided by satellites to monitor mesoscale and synoptic-scale SSS features and to advance our understanding of SSS\' role in air-sea interactions, constraining ocean models, and improving seasonal predictions.

The optimization of farm resources, as well as the control of soil degradation processes (e.g., soil erosion), can be realized through crop monitoring in the field, aiming to manage the local spatial variability (time and space) with a high resolution. In the case of high profitability crops, as the case of vineyards for high-quality wines, the capability to manage and follow spatial behavior of plants during the season represents an opportunity to improve farmer incomes and preserve the environmental health. However, any field monitoring represents an additional cost for the farmer, which slows down the objective of a diffuse sustainable agriculture.   Satellite multispectral images have been widely used for production management in large areas. However, their observation is limited by the pre-defined and fixed scale with relatively coarse spatial resolution, resulting in limitations in their application.   In this paper, encouraged by recent achievements in convolutional neural network (CNN), a multiscale full-connected CNN is constructed for the pan-sharpening of Sentinel-2A images by UAV images. The reconstructed data are validated by independent multispectral UAV images and in-situ spectral measurements. The reconstructed Sentinel-2A images provide a temporal evaluation of plant responses using selected vegetation indices. The proposed methodology has been tested on plant measurements taken either in-vivo and through the retrospective reconstruction of the eco-physiological vine behavior, by the evaluation of water conductivity and water use efficiency indexes from anatomical and isotopic traits recorded in vine trunk wood.   In this study, the use of such a methodology able to combine the pro and cons of space-borne and UAVs data to evaluate plant responses, with high spatial and temporal resolution, has been applied in a vineyard of southern Italy by analyzing the period from 2015 to 2018. The obtained results have shown a good correspondence between the vegetation indexes obtained from reconstructed Sentinel-2A data and plant hydraulic traits obtained from tree-ring based retrospective reconstruction of vine eco-physiological behavior.', '[Brook, A.] Univ Haifa, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Spect & Remote Sensing Lab, IL-3498838 Har Hakarmel, Israel.

As an important active remote sensing technology, synthetic aperture radar can be a valuable tool for assessing building damages in disasters, owing to its large coverage, quick response, non-contact, and independence of weather and light capabilities. Various approaches have been proposed for SAR-based building damage assessment with the development of radar technology and interpretation techniques. While providing numerous choices, these multifarious approaches also make it burdensome to ponder the applicable approach in a specific case, and to reflect on potential fields for further research. Accordingly, this paper hierarchically classified and summarized these approaches to provide a structured understanding of the research status in this field, for assisting in approach decisions and promising field considerations. First, depending on the pre-event data availability, the numerous approaches were classified into change detections employing both pre- and post-event data, and assessments applying only post-event data. Then, determined by the data resolution level and acquisition mode, the plentiful change detection approaches were further distinguished into block-unit approaches analyzing intensity, coherence, or polarimetry features, and building-unit approaches that simply generalize the block-unit approaches, or that concretely explore the detailed individual building features. The post-event data-based assessments, with relatively fewer approaches, were further introduced as methods exploring polarimetry or/and texture features. In each classification category, the principle was first introduced to explain the basic concept and essence of the approaches. An approach review was then provided by organizing relevant studies in a logical or structured way, to facilitate a clear understanding of the overall research status.

Most approaches, however, require vast amounts of high-quality reference data, limiting their applicability across space and time. We here propose the use of a generalized regression-based unmixing approach to overcome this limitation. The unmixing approach relies on temporally generalized machine learning regression models (random forest regression [RFR] and support vector regression [SVR]), which are trained on synthetically mixed data from a multi-year library of pure and hence easy to identify image spectra. We apply the model to three decades of Landsat data, mapping both overall forest cover and broadleaved/coniferous forest cover fractions across space and time. The resulting maps well represented the spatial-temporal patterns of forest (change) in our study region. The SVR model outperformed the RFR model, yielding accuracies of r(2) = 0.74/RMSE = 0.18 for the forest cover fraction maps, r(2) = 0.50/RMSE = 0.24 for the broadleaved forest cover fraction maps, and r(2) = 0.59/RMSE = 0.23 for coniferous forest cover fraction maps, respectively. Highest map errors were found in mature stands, residential areas, and recently disturbed forests. We also found some variability in forest cover fractions for stable forest pixels over time, which were explained by variation in Landsat image acquisition dates. We conclude that regression-based unmixing using synthetically mixed training data from a multi-year spectral library offers an innovative strategy for mapping forest cover fractions and forest types throughout the Landsat archive that likely can be extended to large areas.', '[Senf, Cornelius] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU Vienna, Inst Silviculture, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.

Nevertheless, retrieval of the accurate high spatial resolution soil moisture maps that are required to satisfy hydro-meteorological and agricultural applications remains a challenge. Currently, a variety of downscaling, otherwise known as disaggregation techniques have been proposed as the solution to disaggregate the coarse passive microwave soil moisture into high-to-medium resolutions. These techniques take advantage of the strengths of both the passive microwave observations of soil moisture having low spatial resolution and the spatially detailed information on land surface features that either influence or represent soil moisture variability. However, such techniques have typically been developed and tested individually under differing weather and climate conditions, meaning that there is no clear guidance on which technique performs the best. Consequently, this paper presents a quantitative assessment of the existing radar-, optical-, radiometer-, and oversampling-based downscaling techniques using a singular extensive data set collected specifically for that purpose, being the Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment (SMAPEx)-4 and -5 airborne field campaigns, and the OzNet in situ stations, to determine the relative strengths and weaknesses of their performances. The oversampling-based soil moisture product best captured the temporal and spatial variability of the reference soil moisture overall, though the radar-based products had a better temporal agreement with airborne soil moisture during the short SMAPEx-4 period. Moreover, the difference between temporal analysis of products against in situ and airborne soil moisture reference data sets pointed to the fact that relying on in situ measurements alone is not appropriate for validation of spatially enhanced soil moisture maps.', '[Sabaghy, Sabah; Walker, Jeffrey P.; Rudiger, Christoph; Wu, Xiaoling; Ye, Nan] Monash Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.

However, the meteorological stations of the TP are scarce and mostly located at the eastern and southern parts of the TP where the elevation is relatively low, which increases the uncertainty of regional and local climate studies. Recently, the remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) has been used to estimate the surface air temperature (SAT). However, the thermal infrared based LST is prone to cloud contamination, which limits the availability of the estimated SAT. This study presents a novel all sky model based on the rule-based Cubist regression to estimate all sky daily average SAT using LST, incident solar radiation (ISR), top-of-atmosphere (TOA) albedo and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). The model is trained using station data of the Chinese Meteorological Administration (CMA) and corresponding satellite products. The output is evaluated using independent station data with the bias of -0.07 degrees C and RMSE of 1.87 degrees C. Additionally, the 25-fold cross validation shows a stable model performance (RMSE: 1.6-2.8 degrees C). Moreover, the all sky Cubist model increases the availability of the estimated SAT by nearly three times. We used the all sky Cubist model to estimate the daily average SAT of the TP for 2002-2016 at 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees. We compared our all sky Cubist model estimated daily average SAT with three existing data sets (i.e., GLDAS, CLDAS, and CMFD). Our model estimation shows similar spatial and temporal dynamics with these existing data sets but outperforms them with lower bias and RMSE when benchmarked against the CMA station data. The estimated SAT data could be very useful for regional and local climate studies over the TP. Although the model is developed for the TP, the framework is generic and may be extended to other regions with proper model training using local data.', '[Rao, Yuhan; Liang, Shunlin; Wang, Dongdong; Zhou, Yuan] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

The importance of identifying such deformations is not only related to the hazard they can pose, but also to the understanding of changes that permafrost or local hydrological conditions undergo. Here, we carry out a multi-temporal InSAR analysis over a mountainous area 8000 km(2) large, straddling north-western Bhutan and southern Tibet. We propose a methodology to separate locally deforming areas from the effects of long-wavelength signals through the analysis of the spatio-temporal behaviour of 4-years long time series of surface displacements. We present the mapping of hundreds of small-scale features that appear to be actively deforming, as well as several examples of reversible deformation rarely detected at this scale in such a challenging and vast region. The analysis of the multi-annual trend of ground deformation shows a relatively small number of irreversible gravitational movements clearly related to rock slides which attests a low level of recent activity of large rock slope instabilities in the region. In the southernmost, lower elevation parts of the study area, we quantify reversible surface displacements with amplitudes ranging between 5 and 17 mm, and showing maximum displacements towards the satellite in summer months, thus compatible with hydro-mechanical effects related to groundwater table variations. In addition, the ground movement induced by the active layer\'s response to thawing and freezing over the gentler slopes and high-elevation permafrost regions of Bhutan and southern Tibet is on average around 10 mm, with maxima up to 28 mm. The localised displacements appear to be largely associated to braided stream plains, glacier outwash plains or low angle, fine sediment covered slopes.', '[Dini, Benedetta; Manconi, Andrea; Loew, Simon] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Earth Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.

In particular, airborne hyperspectral remote sensing has an advantage in precise cyanobacteria detection with high spatial and spectral resolution. Many bio-optical algorithms have been developed and utilized to estimate algal concentration. However, achieving the optimal conventional optical model accuracy is still challenging in freshwater owing to the biophysical complexity of the inland water and the seasonal reflection of site-specific optical properties. Thus, this study applied convolutional neural network (CNN) with various input windows to estimate the concentrations of phycocyanin (PC) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and generated a phytoplankton pigment map. We proposed that the Point-centered regression CNN (PRCNN) showed accurate PC and Chl-a simulations, with R-2 > 0.86 and 0.73, respectively, and root mean square errors of <10 mg.m(-3), which were smaller than the conventional optical algorithm in our study area. In addition, the generated PC and Chl-a map from PRCNN closely followed the spatial distribution of the pigment and showed reasonable concentration levels. Through testing we found that a small input size and deep spectral bands contributed to the CNN model to achieve strong capacity to reflect the dynamic spatial feature of phytoplankton pigments. Therefore, this study demonstrated that CNN regression has the potential to detect and quantify cyanobacteria with high accuracy and can be an alternative to bio-optical algorithms.', '[Pyo, JongCheol; Baek, Sangsoo; Kwon, Yong Sung; Cho, Kyung Hwa] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Urban & Environm Engn, 50 UNIST Gil, Ulsan 689798, South Korea.

Airborne imaging spectroscopy data have been used successfully to map plant species, but often only in a single season or over a limited spatial extent due to data availability. NASA\'s Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) preparatory airborne campaign flew an imaging spectrometer from 2013 to 2015. This dataset captured a severe drought and thus provided the opportunity to evaluate species discrimination over an extreme range in environmental conditions. Here we evaluate the portability of image-based training data and accuracy of species discrimination. The imagery was acquired in the spring, summer, and fall seasons of 2013-2015 with the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). Reference spectral libraries were developed with three sets of spectra: spectra from a single image date, combining spectra from multiple dates (by season, by year, and from all dates), and creating leave-one-out (LOO) libraries that pooled spectra from all dates but one. Canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) was applied to reduce data dimensionality, and classification was performed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). When only spectra from the same image date were used, plant species were classified with a mean kappa accuracy ranging between 0.80 and 0.86 for the nine dates. Seasonal and annual spectral libraries had comparable accuracies with mean kappa 0.79-0.83 and 0.78-0.83, respectively. Seasonal libraries performed slightly better than annual libraries for species because they better-incorporated changes in spectra due to phenology. Spectral libraries were not transferable across dates, with mean kappa accuracies dropping to 0.31-0.73 for LOO spectral libraries. These results emphasize that spectral libraries built from previously collected imagery may not be able to map plant species over new images accurately. Specifically, our results highlight the need to use reference spectra that adequately represent the phenological and biophysical status of the plant species within an image for accurate mapping. Our research provides relevant insight for advanced species-mapping techniques across broad spatial and temporal scales using imagery from sensors like HyspIRI.', '[Meerdink, Susan K.; Roberts, Dar A.; King, Jennifer Y.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.

The Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map (CAVM), produced in 2003, has been widely used as a base map for studies in the arctic tundra biome. However, the relatively coarse resolution and vector format of the map were not compatible with many other data sets. We present a new version of the CAVM, building on the strengths of the original map, while providing a finer spatial resolution, raster format, and improved mapping. The Raster CAVM uses the legend, extent and projection of the original CAVM. The legend has 16 vegetation types, glacier, saline water, freshwater, and non-arctic land. The Raster CAVM divides the original rock-water-vegetation complex map unit that mapped the Canadian Shield into two map units, distinguishing between areas with lichen- and shrub-dominated vegetation. In contrast to the original hand-drawn CAVM, the new map is based on unsupervised classifications of seventeen geographic/floristic sub-sections of the Arctic, using AVHRR and MODIS data (reflectance and NDVI) and elevation data. The units resulting from the classification were modeled to the CAVM types using a wide variety of ancillary data. The map was reviewed by experts familiar with their particular region, including many of the original authors of the CAVM from Canada, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway (including Svalbard), Russia, and the U.S. The analysis presented here summarizes the area, geographical distribution, elevation, summer temperatures, and NDVI of the map units. The greater spatial resolution of the Raster CAVM allowed more detailed mapping of water-bodies and mountainous areas. It portrays coastal-inland gradients, and better reflects the heterogeneity of vegetation type distribution than the original CAVM. Accuracy assessment of random 1-km pixels interpreted from 6 Landsat scenes showed an average of 70% accuracy, up from 39% for the original CAVM. The distribution of shrub-dominated types changed the most, with more prostrate shrub tundra mapped in mountainous areas, and less low shrub tundra in lowland areas. This improved mapping is important for quantifying existing and potential changes to land cover, a key environmental indicator for modeling and monitoring ecosystems.', '[Raynolds, Martha K.; Walker, Donald A.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.

Information on the distributions and abundances of tree species can help forest managers understand the spatial coverage of tree species and manage the species composition by establishing a specific strategy. For this purpose, classification of tree species was applied to airborne hyperspectral imagery, and a determination of selected forest stand characteristics (i.e., main tree species, species cover proportions, and species mixture patterns) was made.   We selected the Milicz Forest District of southwestern Poland as our study area. Sixteen airborne hyper-spectral images were acquired with the HySpex VNIR-1800 and SWIR-384 sensors on 19 August 2015. We classified four deciduous tree species (Black alder, Pedunculate oak, Silver birch, and European beech) and coniferous species using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. To properly evaluate the classification accuracy, the level of crown visibility from above was determined during ground measurements. The obtained information was used to create a reference set integrated with the Remote Sensing data.   The classification accuracy was 91%. The main tree species found in the sample plots were correctly assessed based on the coverage area for 92% of the sample plots. The species cover proportions were estimated correctly for 75-94% of the sample plots with a tolerance threshold <= 10 percentage points depending on the species considered. Similarities of the species structures shown in the sample plots between the classification map and reference field data were found by Morisita\'s index (0.92). Spatial mixture pattern detection was performed for 316 forest stands. The results of the developed method were found to agree to field data with 69% accuracy.

Our previous LST retrieval study on Qiyi Glacier of China employed a generalized single-channel algorithm and Landsat thermal infrared data, but a clear LST summertime overestimation was observed, particularly on the glacier tongue. Here we extend our previous study by calculating the thermal radiance on Qiyi Glacier that is emitted from the surrounding terrain, and incorporating this thermal radiation term into two generalized single-channel LST algorithms to analyze its influence on the errors of glacier surface temperatures retrieved from remote sensing data. In addition, we also discuss other possible causes of this overestimation in LST retrieval. The key findings of our study are as follows. (1) The surrounding terrain provides nonnegligible summertime thermal radiation to the glacier in the Landsat7 band 6 spectrum range (10.4-12.5 mu m) that is 2.6 times larger than the atmospheric down-welling thermal radiance on the glacier tongue. The retrieved LSTs yield an overestimation of up to 0.28 K when the effect of thermal radiation from the surrounding slopes is not considered. (2) The average errors due to the surrounding topographic thermal radiation and the cubic convolution resampling method (CC method) employed in the Landsat7 thermal infrared data processing are only 0.07 K and - 0.01 K, respectively. These are much smaller than the average LST errors (1.79 K), indicating that the neither the surrounding topographic thermal radiation nor the CC method are primary factors in the retrieved LST overestimation. (3) The sole dependence of the generalized single-channel algorithm on the atmospheric water vapor content may therefore be the most likely cause of this overestimation, as high-altitude regions generally possess low atmospheric water contents. Radiative transfer models (e.g., MODTRAN) may provide a solution to this problem by simulating the influence of other atmospheric constituents on LST retrieval under conditions of low water vapor, which can then indicate any additional input variables that should be incorporated into the LST algorithm.', '[Wu, Yuwei; Wang, Ninglian; Chen, Anan; Guo, Zhongming; Qie, Yufan] Northwest Univ, Coll Urban & Environm, Shaanxi Key Lab Earth Surface Syst & Environm Car, Xian 710172, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.

The widely-used Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) method is tested on a sample of around 12,600 satellite images for statistical analysis. The core of the new water classification method is the use of a water probability algorithm based on the stacking of repeat measurements, which can mitigate the effects of translational offsets of images and the classification errors caused by clouds and cloud shadows. By integrating QuickBird, WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 multispectral images, the final data product provides a 2 m resolution coastline, as well as a 2 m water probability map and a repeat-count measurement map.

This paper studies the sensitivity of several established and experimental SM retrieval products from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission to these choices at 11 reference sites, located in 7 watersheds across the United States (US). Different RTM parameter sets cause large biases between retrievals. Whereas typical RTM parameter sets are calibrated for SM retrievals, it is shown that a parameter set carefully optimized for TB forward modeling can also be used for retrieving SM. It is also shown that the inclusion of dynamic prior SM estimates in a Bayesian retrieval scheme can strongly improve SM retrievals, regardless of the choice of RTM parameters. The second part of this paper evaluates the ensemble uncertainty metrics for SM retrievals obtained by propagating a wide range of RTM parameters through the RTM, and the relationship with time series metrics obtained by comparing SM retrievals with in situ data. As expected for bounded variables, the total spread in the ensemble SM retrievals is smallest for wet and dry SM values and highest for intermediate SM values. After removal of the strong long-term SM bias associated with the RTM parameter values for individual ensemble members, the remaining anomaly ensemble SM spread shows higher values when SM deviates further from its long-term mean SM. This reveals higher-order biases (e.g. differences in variances) in the retrieval error, which should be considered when characterizing retrieval error. The time-average anomaly ensemble SM spread of 0.037 m(3)/m(3) approximates the actual time series unbiased root-mean-square-difference of 0.042 m(3)/m(3) between ensemble mean retrievals and in situ data across the reference sites.', '[Quets, Jan; De Lannoy, Gabrielle J.

This research developed a self-adjusting model (SEAM) to correct blooming effects in DMSP-OLS NTL data based on a spatial response function and without using any ancillary data. By assuming that the pixels adjacent to the background contain no lights (i.e., pseudo light pixels, PLPs), the blooming effect intensity, a parameter in the SEAM model, can be estimated by pixel-based regression using PLPs and their neighboring light sources. SEAM was applied to all of China, and its performance was assessed for twelve cities with different population sizes. The results show that SEAM can largely reduce the blooming effect in the original DMSP-OLS dataset and enhance its quality. The images after blooming effect correction have higher spatial similarity with Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) images and higher spatial variability than the original DMSP-OLS data. We also found that the average effective blooming distance is approximately 3.5 km in China, which may be amplified if the city is surrounded by water surfaces, and that the blooming effect intensity is positively correlated to atmospheric quality. The effectiveness of the proposed model will improve the capacity of DMSP-OLS images for mapping the urban extent and modeling socioeconomic parameters.', '[Cao, Xin; Hu, Yang; Chen, Jin] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

Accurate and timely information on Ulva areal coverage and biomass is of critical importance for governmental responses, decision making, and field studies. Previous studies have shown that satellite remote sensing is the most effective method for this purpose, yet Ulva areal coverage has been estimated in different ways with significantly different results. The objective of this paper is to determine the lower and upper bounds (T-0 and T-1) of algae-containing pixels in Floating Algae Index images with an objective method that accurately estimates the Ulva areal coverage in individual images, and then converts coverage to biomass using a previously established conversion equation. First, a seawater background image, FAI(sw), is constructed to determine T-0, which varies for different algae patches. Then, T-1 is determined from water tank and in situ measurements as well as radiative transfer simulations to account for different sensor configurations, solar/viewing geometry, and atmospheric conditions. Such determined T-1 for MODIS 250-m resolution data is validated using concurrent and collocated 2-m resolution WorldView-2 data. Finally, Ulva areal coverage derived from MODIS data using this method are compared with those from the high-resolution data (OLI/Landsat, WFV/GaoFen-1), with a mean relative difference of 9.6%. Furthermore, an analysis of 17 same-day MODIS/Terra and MODIS/Aqua image pairs shows that large viewing angles, atmospheric turbidity, and sunglint can lead to an underestimation of Ulva coverage of up to 45% under extreme conditions.', '[Hu, Lianbo; Zeng, Kan; He, Ming-Xia] Ocean Univ China, Ocean Remote Sensing Inst, 5 Yushan Rd, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China.

These data offer new possibilities for the mapping of global terrain and vegetation as well as monitoring of the Earth\'s carbon stocks. The Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) instrument on-board ICESat-2 will utilize photon counting technology for the altimetry observations. Photon counting technology is relatively new to the vegetation mapping community thus requires development of new algorithm approaches for terrain surface and canopy height retrievals. Photon counting systems provide range measurements for individual photons given the instrument\'s detection sensitivity. The sensitivity enables higher laser repetition rates for improved spatial coverage but is susceptible to solar background noise making the separation of signal and noise challenging and the data volume large. The algorithm developed specifically for the extraction of terrain and canopy heights from the ATLAS point clouds produces the ATL08 geophysical data product. This paper provides a detailed description of the ATL08 methodology, presents the data format, discusses many of the critical parameters likely to be of interest to future ICESat-2 data users, and describes the predicated uncertainties for terrain and canopy heights using two simulated ATLAS data sets. The first critical function in the ATL08 algorithm needs to accurately retrieve the surface is to identify the signal photons apart from the noise photons. Using a series of iterative filters, the ground and top of canopy surfaces are then identified in the signal. Next, individual photons are classified as either noise, canopy, or ground photons based on their distance above (or below) the estimated ground and top of canopy surfaces. The ATL08 algorithm has been tested on several simulated ATLAS data sets, and the results from two different ecosystems are described. The terrain extraction results saw sub-meter RMSE for the Alaska Tundra/Taiga ecotone and < 2 m RMSE in Sonoma County, California which is characterized by complex topography and dense vegetation. Although canopy heights on the ATL08 data product will underestimate the true canopy height within a segment, the ICESat-2 derived canopy height is found to be correlated with relative height metrics produced from airborne lidar (i.e. truth). For the sparse boreal forests of Alaska, the ATL08 canopy height was most correlated with the 95th percentile relative height (RH95). However, for the dense coniferous forests of Sonoma County, CA, ATL08 canopy height is correlated with 75th percentile relative height (RH75).

Consequently, the importance of clove trees as a provisioning service is increasing at the local level, particularly for smallholders cultivating clove trees as cash crops. Due to limited availability of data on local production, using remote sensing-based methods to quantify today\'s clove production is of key interest. We estimated the clove bud yield in a study site in northeastern Madagascar by detecting individual clove trees and determining relevant productio n systems, including pasture and clove, clove plantation and agroforestry systems. We implemented an individual tree detection method based on two machine learning approaches. Specifically, we proposed using a circular Hough transform (CHT) for the automated detection of individual clove trees. Subsequently, we implemented a tree species classification method using a random forests (RF) classifier based on a set of features extracted for relevant trees in the above production systems. Finally, we classified and mapped different production systems. Based on the number of detected clove trees growing in a clove production system, we estimated the production system-dependent clove bud yield. Our results show that 97.9% of all reference clove trees were detected using a CHT. Classifying clove and non-clove trees resulted in a producer accuracy of 70.7% and a user accuracy of 59.2% for clove trees. The classification of the clove production systems resulted in an overall accuracy of 77.9%. By averaging different clove tree yield estimates obtained from the literature, we estimated an average total yield of approximately 575 tons/year for our 25,600 ha study area.

Remote sensing approaches using sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) hold the potential to directly assess ecosystem photosynthesis. However, many challenges remain linked to using the SIF emission signal to estimate gross primary production (GPP). The goal of this study was to gain a better understanding of the relationships between GPP and SIF over different time scales (minutes to years) and under varying environmental conditions. Two different ecosystems were investigated, a cropland and a mixed forest, with continuous eddy covariance flux measurements. Continuous tower-based SIF retrievals were performed in 2015 and 2016 at both ecosystems.   In both ecosystems, SIF was found to be more affected by environmental conditions than GPP. Annual cycles for GPP and SIF differed at the mixed forest due in part to the influence of the different footprint size of the two independent measurements. Diurnal cycles in GPP and SIF corresponded well under unstressed conditions and followed the incoming photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). However, depressions in SIF were found at both sites either at midday or in the afternoon during the growing season. At the cropland site, reductions in SIF occurred at high PPFD (PPFD > 1470 mu mol M-2 S-1, R-2 = 0.62) and high VPD (VPD > 1590 Pa, R-2 = 0.35). Whereas at the forest site, reductions in SIF were linked to high VPD (VPD > 1250 Pa, R-2 = 0.25), but not to high PPFD (R-2 = 0.84). The depression in SIF was also associated with an increase in non-photochemical quenching, as indicated by the photochemical reflectance index (R-2 = 0.78), thus showing the complementarity between SIF and non-photochemical quenching as different energy pathways. Our results show the importance of characterizing the influence of different environmental conditions on SIF-GPP relationships for specific ecosystems to reliably estimate GPP from remote sensing measurements.', '[Paul-Limoges, Eugenie; Liebisch, Frank; Eugster, Werner; Buchmann, Nina] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Agr Sci, Univ Str 2, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.

However, because of the tradeoff between the spatial and temporal resolutions of satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) data, the climatology, variety, and taxonomy of diurnal SUHI (DSUHI) patterns remain largely unknown for numerous cities with different bioclimates. By combining daily MODIS LST data with a newly developed four -parameter diurnal temperature cycle(DTC) model, we selected 354 Chinese megacities located in different bioclimatic zones to examine the characteristics of the DSUHI descriptors and systematically investigate the prevalent DSUHI temporal patterns.   The DSUHI variations demonstrate that both the daily maximum and minimum SUHI intensity (SUHII) can occur during most periods of the day, although these intensities are more likely to occur in the early morning and noon/afternoon. Our results also reveal that both strong SUHIs (SUHII > 3 K) and surface urban cool islands (SUCIs) (SUHII < 0 K) are more prevalent than those identified directly through the four MODIS transits. According to the SUHI dynamics, five typical DSUHI temporal patterns are identified: standard-spoon, weak spoon, quasi-spoon, inverse-spoon, and straight-line patterns. A gradient was found with spoon-like patterns (DSUHI dynamics typically with a daytime valley and a roughly constant trend or a small peak at night) in North China and inverse-spoon (DSUHI dynamics with a typical daytime peak and a constant trend at night) or straight-line patterns (DSUHI dynamics virtually unchanged all day) in South China. The DSUHI shapes were found to be greatly controlled by the urban-rural contrast in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and urban geometry. Our results not only advance our understanding of the diurnal climatology of SUHIs but also provide a basis for urban surface heat mitigation by identifying the possible timing of the mitigation requirement.', '[Lai, Jiameng; Zhan, Wenfeng; Huang, Fan; Hong, Falu] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Geog Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

They are either based on visible imagery from Landsat - the Global 3-second Water Body Map (G3WBM) and the Global Surface Water Explorer (GSWE) - or on the merging of passive/active microwave and visible observations - Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellite (GIEMS-D3) - that has been downscaled from a native resolution of 25 km x 25 km to the 90 m x 90 m resolution. The objective of this paper is to perform a thorough comparison of the different water surface estimates in order to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches and propose a strategy for future developments of high-resolution surface water databases. Results show that due to their very high spatial resolution (30 m) the Landsat-based datasets are well suited to retrieve open water surfaces, even at very small size. GIEMS-D3 has a better ability to detect water under vegetation and during the cloudy season, and it shows larger seasonal dynamics. However, its current version overestimates surface water extent on water-saturated soils, and due to its low original (i.e. before downscaling) spatial resolution, it is under-performing at detecting small water bodies. The permanent waters for G3WBM, GSWE, GIEMS-D3 and GLWD represent respectively: 2.76, 2.05, 3.28, and 3.04 million km(2). The transitory waters shows larger discrepancies: 0.48, 3.72, 10.39 and 8.81 million km(2).   Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data (from ENVIronment SATellite (ENVISAT), Sentinel and soon the Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT)) would be a good complementary information because they have a high nominal spatial resolution and are less sensitive to clouds than visible measurements. However, global SAR datasets are still not available due to difficulties in developing a retrieval scheme adequate at the global scale. In order to improve our estimates of global wetland extents at high resolution and over long-term records, three interim lines of action are proposed: (1) extend the temporal record of GIEMS-D3 to exploit the full time series of microwave observations (from 1978 to present), (2) develop an approach to fuse the GSWE and GIEMS-D3 datasets leveraging the strengths of both, and (3) prepare for the release of SAR global datasets.', '[Aires, Filipe; Prigent, Catherine] Observ Paris, CNRS, UPMC, LERMA, Paris, France.

Studies so far have estimated forest biomass stocks using rough assumptions and unreliable data. High-resolution data and robust methods are required to capture the spatial variability of forest biomass with sufficient precision. Here we aim to improve on previous approaches by using radar satellite ALOS PALSAR (25-m resolution) and optical Landsat-derived tree cover (30-m resolution) observations to estimate forest biomass stocks in Madagascar, for the years 2007-2010. The radar signal and in situ biomass were highly correlated (R-2 = 0.71) and the root mean square error was 30% (for biomass ranging from 0 to 500 t/ha). Using our map at 25-m resolution for the entire island of Madagascar, we estimated the total above-ground forest carbon for the four years 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 to be 1.1173 +/- 0.0304, 1.1029 +/- 0.0303, 1.0916 +/- 0.0301 and 1.0773 +/- 0.0298 PgC, respectively. Carbon stocks were found to have decreased constantly over this period due to anthropogenic deforestation and likely also to climate change. The results are expected to serve as a more accurate benchmark for monitoring progress on REDD and to provide strong supports for current and future spaceborne missions such as ALOS-2, SAOCOM and BIOMASS.', '[Dinh Ho Tong Minh; Ndikumana, Emile; Baghdadi, Nicolas] Univ Montpellier, Inst Natl Rech Sci & Technol Environm & Agr IRSTE, TETIS, UMR, Montpellier, France.

Second, a FR fraction map for the date of prediction is predicted using a temporal-weighted fusion model. In comparison to two established spatial-temporal fusion methods of spatial-temporal super-resolution land cover mapping model and spatial-temporal image reflectance fusion model, STFMF holds the following characteristics and advantages: (1) it takes account of the mixed pixel problem in FR remotely sensed images; (2) it directly uses the fraction maps as input, which could be generated from a range of satellite images or other suitable data sources; (3) it focuses on the estimation of fraction changes happened through time and can predict the land cover change more accurately. Experiments using synthetic multi-scale fraction maps simulated from Google Earth images, as well as synthetic and real MODIS-Landsat images were undertaken to test the performance of the proposed STFMF approach against two benchmark spatial-temporal reflectance fusion methods: the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) and the Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (FSDAF) model. In both visual and quantitative evaluations, STFMF was able to generate more accurate FR fraction maps and provide more spatial detail than ESTARFM and FSDAF, particularly in areas with substantial land cover changes. STFMF has great potential to produce accurate time-series fraction maps with fine-spatial-temporal-resolution that can support studies of land cover dynamics at the sub-pixel scale.& nbsp;', '[Zhang, Yihang; Ling, Feng; Li, Xiaodong; Du, Yun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geodesy & Geophys, Key Lab Monitoring & Estimate Environm & Disaster, Wuhan 430077, Hubei, Peoples R China.

Changes in the de-epoxidation state (DEPS) of xanthophyll cycle pigments can be observed as changes in the leaf absorption of light with wavelengths between 500 to 570 nm. These spectral changes can be a good remote sensing indicator of the photosynthetic efficiency, and are traditionally quantified with a two-band physiologically based optical index, the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI). In this paper, we present an extension of the plant leaf radiative transfer model Fluspect (Fluspect-CX) that reproduces the spectral changes in a wide band of green reflectance: a radiative transfer analogy to the PRI. The idea of Fluspect-CX is to use in vivo specific absorption coefficients for two extreme states of carotenoids, representing the two extremes of the xanthophyll de-epoxidation, and to describe the intermediate states as a linear mixture of these two states. The \'photochemical reflectance parameter\' (C-x) quantifies the relative proportion of the two states. Fluspect-CX simulates leaf chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) excitation-emission matrices, as well as reflectance (R) and transmittance (7) spectra as a function of leaf structure, pigment contents and C. We describe the calibration of the model and test its performance using various experimental datasets. Furthermore, we retrieved C-x from optical measurements of various datasets. The retrieved C-x correlates well with xanthophyll DEPS (R-2 = 0.57), as well with non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of fluorescence (R-2 = 0.78). The correlation with NPQ enabled us to incorporate Fluspect-CX in the model SCOPE to scale the processes to the canopy level. Introducing the dynamic green reflectance into a radiative transfer model provides new means to study chlorophyll fluorescence and PRI dynamics on leaf and canopy scales, which is crucial for the remote sensing.', '[Vilfan, Nastassia; Van der Tol, Christiaan; Yang, Peiqi; Verhoef, Wouter] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.

In this paper we design and present a new approach to predict the monthly mean daily solar radiation (GSR) by constructing an extreme learning machine (ELM) model integrated with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based satellite and the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) Reanalysis data for solar rich cities: Brisbane and Townsville, Australia. A self-adaptive differential evolutionary ELM (i.e., SaDE-ELM) is proposed, utilizing a swarm-based ant colony optimization (ACO) feature selection to select the most important predictors for GSR, and the SaDE-ELM is then benchmarked with nine different data-driven models: a basic ELM, genetic programming (GP), online sequential ELM with fixed (OS-ELM) and varying (OSVARY-ELM) input sizes, and hybridized model including the particle swarm optimized-artificial neural network model (PSO-ANN), genetic algorithm optimized ANN (GA-ANN), PSO-support vector machine model (PSO-SVR), genetic algorithm optimized-SVR model (GA-SVR) and the SVR model optimized with grid search (GS-SVR). A comprehensive evaluation of the SaDE-ELM model is performed, considering key statistical metrics and diagnostic plots of measured and forecasted GSR. The results demonstrate excellent forecasting capability of the SaDE-ELM model in respect to the nine benchmark models. SaDE-ELM outperformed all comparative models for both tested study sites with a relative mean absolute and a root mean square error (RRMSE) of 2.6% and 2.3% (for Brisbane) and 0.8% and 0.7% (for Townsville), respectively. Majority of the forecasted errors are recorded in the lowest magnitude frequency band, to demonstrate the preciseness of the SaDE-ELM model. When tested for daily solar radiation forecasting using the ECMWF Reanalysis data for Brisbane study site, the performance resulted in an RRMSE approximate to 10.5%. Alternative models evaluated with the input data classified into El Nino, La Nifia and the positive and negative phases of the Indian Ocean Dipole moment (considering the impacts of synoptic-scale climate phenomenon), confirms the superiority of the SaDE-ELM model (with RRMSE 13%). A seasonal analysis of all developed models depicts SaDE-ELM as the preferred tool over the basic ELM and the hybridized version of ANN, SVR and GP model. In accordance with the results obtained through MODIS satellite and ECMWF Reanalysis data products, this study ascertains that the proposed SaDE-ELM model applied with ACO feature selection, integrated with satellite-derived data is adoptable as a qualified tool for monthly and daily GSR predictions and long-term solar energy feasibility study especially in data sparse and regional sites where a satellite footprint can be identified.', '[Ghimire, Sujan; Deo, Ravinesh C.; Downs, Nathan J.; Raj, Nawin] Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Agr Computat & Environm Sci, Int Ctr Appl Climate Sci, Inst Agr & Environm, Springfield, Qld 4300, Australia.', 'University of Southern QueenslandRP Ghimire, S; Deo, RC (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Agr Computat & Environm Sci, Int Ctr Appl Climate Sci, Inst Agr & Environm, Springfield, Qld 4300, Australia.', 'u1081587@umail.usq.edu.au; ravinesh.deo@usq.edu.auRI Raj, Nawin/AAY-2846-2020; Deo, Ravinesh/F-6157-2012; Ghimire,   Sujan/ABA-5597-2021', 'Deo, Ravinesh/0000-0002-2290-6749; Ghimire, Sujan/0000-0002-7266-4442', 'University of Southern Queensland Research and Training Scheme [RTS 2016   - 2022]', 'This study was supported by the University of Southern Queensland   Research and Training Scheme (RTS 2016 - 2022) funding.

Field based studies indicated a convex response of forest recovery rate to burn severity at the individual tree level, related with fire-induced tree mortality; however, these findings were constrained in spatial/temporal extents, while not detectable by traditional optical remote sensing studies, largely attributing to the contaminated effect from understory recovery. Here, we examined whether the combined use of multi-sensor remote sensing techniques (i.e., 1 m simultaneous airborne imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR and 2 m satellite multi-spectral imagery) to separate canopy recovery from understory recovery would enable to quantify post-fire forest recovery rate spanning a large gradient in burn severity over large-scales. Our study was conducted in a mixed pine-oak forest in Long Island, NY, three years after a top-killing fire. Our studies remotely detected an initial increase and then decline of forest recovery rate to burn severity across the burned area, with a maximum canopy area-based recovery rate of 10% per year at moderate forest burn severity class. More intriguingly, such remotely detected convex relationships also held at species level, with pine trees being more resilient to high burn severity and having a higher maximum recovery rate (12% per year) than oak trees (4% per year). These results are one of the first quantitative evidences showing the effects of fire adaptive strategies on post-fire forest recovery, derived from relatively large spatial-temporal scales. Our study thus provides the methodological advance to link multi sensor remote sensing techniques to monitor forest dynamics in a spatially explicit manner over large-scales, with important implications for fire-related forest management and constraining/benchmarking fire effect schemes in ecological process models.', '[Meng, Ran; Wu, Jin; Serbin, Shawn P.] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Environm & Climate Sci Dept, Upton, NY 11973 USA.

Therefore, early detection and timely management is required to alleviate ecosystem consequences of invasion. Integrating airborne hyperspectral imagery with LiDAR data can deliver spatially explicit information on invader occurrence and ecosystem transformations even at early stages of invasion. However, relevant \"model invaders\" and well-characterized ecosystems need to be identified to both increase predictive power of invasion theory and prioritize management. In addition, there is still a knowledge gap regarding sensor-based approaches that are valid in space and time to assess the impact of invasive engineers on ecosystem functioning as well as the potential to induce regime shifts. In this study, occurrence and spatio-temporal impact of the invasive N-2-fixing shrub, Acacia longifolia, was assessed in a heterogeneous, Mediterranean dune ecosystem. The invader was mapped using vegetation indices derived from airborne hyperspectral images as well as airborne LiDAR data using Random Forest classification with a Sensitivity of 0.79, a Positive Predicted Value (PPV) of 0.81, and Cohen\'s Kappa of 0.77. Invaded sites varied between early stages with low cover, where isolated patches were detected, to heavily infested A. longifolia thickets. Analysis of historical images showed that the invader could establish under the harsh conditions of open dune plains, possibly triggered by human interference. The recently developed Near-Infrared Vegetation Index (NIRv), which is related to Gross Primary Production (GPP), increased linearly and significantly with increasing invader cover. This indicated a GPP-related regime shift induced by the invader, changing ecosystem productivity representative of open shrublands to that of forests. Such a shift could even be identified at early stages of invasion. Thus, the NIRv index may provide an appropriate sensor-based \"model metric\" to assess impacts of invasive engineers. This offers the opportunity to predict and anticipate regime shifts as a basis for timely management.', '[Grosse-Stoltenberg, A.; Thiele, J.] Univ Munster, Inst Landscape Ecol, Heisenbergstr 2, D-48149 Munster, Germany.

These locations can change on a day to day basis. Soil moisture products derived from satellite-based passive microwave remote sensing are usually resampled to a fixed Earth grid that facilitates their use in applications. In many cases the grid size is finer than the actual spatial resolution of the observation, and often this difference is not well understood by the user. Here, this issue was examined for the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) enhanced version of the passive-based soil moisture product, which has a grid size of 9-km and a nominal spatial resolution of 33-km. In situ observations from core validation sites were used to compute comparison metrics. For sites that satisfied the established reliability and scaling criteria, the impact of validating the 9-km grid product with in situ data collected over a 9-km versus a 33-km domain was very small for the sites studied (0.039 m(3)/m(3) unbiased root mean square difference for the 9-km case versus 0.037 m(3)/m(3) for the 33-km case). This result does not mean that the resolution of the product is 9-km but that for the conditions studied here the soil moisture estimated from in situ observations over 9-km is a close approximation of the soil moisture estimated from in situ observations over the 33-km resolution. The implication is that using the enhanced SMAP product at its grid resolution of 9-km should not introduce large errors in most applications.', '[Colliander, A.; Chan, S. K.; Yueh, S.

Aerial photography, satellite imagery, and increasingly airborne laser scanning (ALS) data are all used as sources of auxiliary information to address this challenge.   Combining inventory ground plot and ALS data requires that the data be co-registered to a common coordinate system. When measuring plots, inventory field crews typically obtain estimates of plot coordinates using global positioning system (GPS) receivers of varying degrees of accuracy. GPS-related errors in plot coordinates contribute to a sequence of adverse effects: (i) plot data are associated with erroneous ALS metrics, (ii) statistical models fit to such data may not adequately represent the true relationship between the plot data and the ALS metrics; and (iii) bias may be induced into model-assisted statistical estimators of population parameters.   The primary objectives of the study focused on assessing the effects of GPS receiver inaccuracies on the estimated bias and precision of model-assisted estimators of mean AGB per unit area. The underlying motivation was to determine if the advantages of using ALS data as auxiliary information can be achieved apart from the substantial additional expense of purchasing GPS receivers with sub-meter accuracy. The analyses focused on comparing estimates based on three variations of plot coordinates obtained using field crew GPS receivers with maximum location errors on the order of 5-10 m to estimates based on plot coordinates obtained using survey grade GPS receivers with sub-meter accuracy. The study area was in north central Minnesota in the USA and is characterized by both upland and lowland forest areas interspersed with lakes and wetlands. The primary results were twofold. First, estimates of mean AGB per unit area based on plot coordinates obtained using the less accurate field crew GPS receivers varied little from estimates based on the much more accurate survey grade receivers. Second, standard errors were greater by as much as 20% when using field crew GPS receivers than when using survey grade GPS receivers. However, even though the ALS-assisted standard errors obtained using field crew GPS receivers were greater than when using survey grade receivers, they were still substantially smaller than satellite image-assisted standard errors. Thus, the operational conclusion is that avoiding the substantial additional cost of providing a survey grade GPS receiver for each of more than 100 field crews likely outweighs the adverse consequences of somewhat larger standard errors.', '[McRoberts, Ronald E.; Walters, Brian F.; Kaisershot, Daniel J.] US Forest Serv, Northern Res Stn, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.

Its importance in regulating air temperature and balancing surface energy is enlarged especially under cloudy-sky conditions. Unfortunately, to date, a large number of efforts have been made to derive LWDR from space under only clear-sky conditions leading to difficulty in utilizing space-based LWDR in most models due to its spatio-temporal discontinuity. Currently, only a few studies are focused on LWDR estimation under cloudy skies, while their global application is still questionable. In this paper, an alternative strategy is proposed aiming to derive high-resolution (1 km) cloudy-sky LWDR by fusing collocated satellite multi-sensor measurements. The results show that the newly developed method works well and can derive LWDR at a better accuracy with RMSE < 27 W/m(2) and bias < 10 W/m(2) even under cloudy skies and at 1 km scales. By comparing the CCCM and SSF products of CERES, MERRA, ERA-interim and NCEP-CSFR over the Tibetan Plateau region, the new approach demonstrates its superiority in terms of accuracy, temporal variation and spatial distribution patterns of LWDR. Comprehensive comparison analysis also reveals that, except for the proposed product, the other four products (CERES, MERRA, ERA-interim and NCEP-CSFR) show a big difference from each other in the LWDR spatio-temporal distribution pattern and magnitude. The difference between these products can still be up to 60 W/m(2) even at the monthly scale, implying that large uncertainties exist in current LWDR estimations.

Here, we present the first global data set of DASF/CSC and examine the potential of CSC and SIF for providing complementary information on the controversially discussed vegetation seasonality in Amazon forests. A comparison between near-infrared SIF derived from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) instrument and the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (000-2) (overpass time in the morning and noon, respectively) reveals the response of SIF to instantaneous photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Large-scale seasonal swings of GOME-2 SIF amount up to 21% (regarding the annual maximum) and peak in October and around February, while 000-2 SIF peaks in February. However, both time series agree very well if SIF is normalized by overpass time and wavelength. We further examine anistropic reflectance characteristics with the finding that the hot spot effect significantly impacts observed GOME-2 SIF values. On the contrary, our sensitivity analysis suggests that CSC is highly independent of sun-sensor geometry as well as atmospheric effects. The slight annual variability of CSC (3%) shows no clear seasonal cycle, while a relatively high spatial standard deviation points to a high degree of spatial heterogeneity in our study domain within the central Amazon Basin.', '[Koehler, Philipp; Guanter, Luis; Walther, Sophia] German Res Ctr Geosci GFZ, Remote Sensing Sect, Potsdam, Germany.

With support from the JPSS (Joint Polar Satellite System) Proving Ground and Risk Reduction (PGRR) Program, flood detection software has been developed using Suomi-NPP/VIIRS (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) imagery to automatically generate near real-time flood maps for National Weather Service (NWS) River Forecast Centers (RFC) in the USA. The software, which is called VIIRS NOAA GMU Flood Version 1.0 (hereafter referred to as VNG Flood V1.0), consists of a series of algorithms that include water detection, cloud shadow removal, terrain shadow removal, minor flood detection, water fraction retrieval, and floodwater determination. The software is designed for flood detection in any land region between 80 degrees S and 80 degrees N, and it has been running routinely with direct broadcast SNPP/VIIRS data at the Space Science and Engineering Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW/SSEC) and the Geographic Information Network of Alaska at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks (UAF/GINA) since 2014. Near real-time flood maps are distributed via the Unidata Local Data Manager (LDM), reviewed by river forecasters in AWIPS-II (the second generation of the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System) and applied in flood operations. Initial feedback from operational forecasters on the product accuracy and performance has been largely positive. The software capability has also been extended to areas outside of the USA via a case-driven mode to detect major floods all over the world. Offline evaluation efforts include the visual inspection of over 10,000 VIIRS false-color composite images, an inter-comparison with MODIS automatic flood products and a quantitative validation using Landsat imagery. The steady performance from the 3-year routine process and the promising evaluation results indicate that VNG Flood V1.0 has a high feasibility for flood detection at the product level.', '[Li, Sanmei; Sun, Donglian] George Mason Univ, Dept Geog & Geoinformat Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.

Here we use satellite derived soil moisture observations from the Climate Change Initiative of the European Space Agency to quantify the relation between soil moisture drought and temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration and vegetation during the peak of the growing season. Furthermore, we follow the temporal evolution of the buildup and recovery surrounding the drought peak. We find that in many regions longer-term precipitation deficits are the driving factors of large negative soil moisture anomalies. At the peak of the dry period large anomalies are found for precipitation, evapotranspiration, and temperature, while vegetation indices often show a delayed response. This delay is likely related to the limited information contained in the remotely sensed soil moisture signal on the deeper root zone, thus underestimating the available soil moisture for plants. Anomalies over grasslands are generally larger than over forests, likely linked to the ability of trees to better access water at deeper depths, and to save water during dry conditions. These results illustrate the relevance of remote-sensing based soil moisture as a new independent observation for studying land-vegetation-atmosphere dynamics at the global scale.

We question the often claimed high success rate of oil spill detection algorithms using single-polarization SARs because the SAR images used to train these algorithms are based usually on subjective interpretation and are not validated by on-site inspections or multi-sensor measurements carried out from oil pollution surveillance planes. Furthermore, we doubt that polarimetric parameters derived from fully-polarimetric SAR data, like entropy, anisotropy, and mean scattering angle, are beneficial for discriminating between mineral oil films and biogenic slicks. We challenge the often made claim that another scattering mechanism than Bragg scattering applies for radar backscattering from mineral oil films than from biogenic slicks. This view is supported by data acquired by the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) of NASA/JPL, which operates at L-band and has an extremely low noise floor. We suspect that opposing results obtained from previous analyses of spacebome polarimetric SAR data are caused by the high noise floors of the spacebome SARs. However, most of the analyzed spacebome polarimetric data were not acquired at L-band, but at C-and X-band. On the other hand, differences in the statistical behavior of the radar backscattering could be real due to the fact that, other than biogenic surface films, mineral oil films, can form multi-layers, whose thickness can vary within an oil patch. Radar back scattering from emulsion layers can also fluctuate due to variations of the oil/water mixture ratio. These effects could cause an increase of the standard deviation (STD) of the co-polarized phase difference (CPD) for scattering at mineral oil films and emulsions. In the special case of thick oil layers or oil/water emulsion layers, where the radar is sensitive to the dielectric constant of the oil, discrimination becomes possible due the fact that Bragg scattering depends on the dielectric constant of the scattering medium.', '[Alpers, Werner] Univ Hamburg, Inst Oceanog, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.

A total of 14,736 collocated Aqua MODIS C6 AOD at 550 nm were evaluated against AOD from six AERONET stations over IGP, measured during the satellite overpass (+/- 1 h) from 2006 to 2015. The effects of aerosol heterogeneity, in terms of both aerosol loading and the aerosol type, on the uncertainty of the satellite-borne AOD retrieval were examined. The DT algorithm at both resolutions (3 km and 10 km) overestimated the AOD by 14-25%, with only 51.37-61.29% of the retrievals falling within the expected error (EE). The DT 3 km algorithm underestimates the surface reflectance in comparison to the DT 10 km, with the latter outperforming the former both in terms of number of collocations and retrieval accuracy, especially over urban areas. The DB 10 km was able to retrieve AOD over both arid/desert regions and vegetated surfaces even under low aerosol loading conditions. Yet, its performance was still poor, with retrieval accuracy of 53.76%, low RMSE (0.214), and generally underestimated AOD across the IGP. The merged DT-DB AOD product was mostly dominated by DT retrievals (73%-100%), except over bright land surfaces and 56.03% of the merged DT-DB retrievals fell within the EE. The retrieval accuracy of MODIS C6 products was found to be strongly dependent on the estimated surface reflectance and the aerosol type. Across IGP, DB predicted the surface reflectance better while DT at both resolutions overestimated the surface reflectance at varying extent. For high aerosol loading conditions with varying aerosol size, retrieval accuracy of DT 10 km poses lower sensitivity while DT at 3 km exhibits larger uncertainty in estimating surface reflectance. In contrast, DB 10 km shows greater bias that depends on the aerosol size. For very high aerosol loading conditions, dominated by fine or mixed aerosols, all the algorithms have errors in the aerosol model. The DT 10 km, DB 10 km and the merged AOD performed almost equally within the threshold level while the DT 3 km showed the poorest performance in terms of retrieval accuracy and RMSE. We conclude that across IGP, DB 10 km AOD has the highest accuracy in retrieving fine mode aerosols while DT 10 km AOD has almost identical accuracy in retrieving varying aerosol types. For coarse dominated aerosols, when the dissimilarity between DT and DB remains highest, the merged AOD is found to have higher accuracy in retrieving AOD across IGP.', '[Mhawish, Alaa; Banerjee, Tirthankar] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.

Previously, numerous studies have only estimated and mapped impervious surface dynamics at annual or decadal time scales. It is challenging to estimate impervious surface dynamics at a finer time scale, such as on a monthly scale, while using a single source of medium spatial resolution satellite imagery. However, urban infrastructure construction could cause changes in impervious surfaces in a short period of time. This paper aimed at developing a new methodology for evaluating monthly impervious surface dynamics by fusing Landsat and MODIS time series. The Pearl River Delta in China, is located in a humid subtropical region and was selected as the study area due to its dramatic urbanization in the past three decades. Available Landsat images with cloud cover < 90%, 7-Day MODIS NDVI 250 m smooth time series, and daily MODIS LST 1000 m time series from 2000 to 2015 were downloaded. These data were used to develop temporal features of land covers (i.e., monthly Landsat NDVI and LST time series) and to monitor impervious surface dynamics using semi-supervised time series fuzzy clustering method. The results showed the effectiveness of temporal features in differentiating land covers. Additionally, the average overall classification accuracy yielded reasonable accuracies (up to 89.36%). The proposed methodology has illustrated numerous, considerable advantages over previous methods. It has offered consistent maps of impervious surfaces on a monthly time scale as well as enhanced distinguishability of land covers with similar spectral characteristics. This study can be utilized to establish relationships between urban expansion, climate change, urban environment, population, and other socio-economic variables on a monthly basis. The study is also crucial for predicting the timing, duration, and density of ecological change for increased impervious surfaces.', '[Zhang, Lei] Wuhan Univ, Sch Geodesy & Geomat, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.

However, various sources of error may make the observed subsurface remote-sensing reflectance deviate from the model, resulting in an increased retrieval error when inverting the model based on classical least-squares fitting. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic forward model of shallow water reflectance variability that describes two of the main sources of error, namely, (1) the environmental noise that includes every source of above-water variability (e.g., sensor noise and rough water surface), and (2) the potentially complex inherent spectral variability of each benthic class through their associated spectral covariance matrix. Based on this probabilistic model, we derive two inversion approaches, namely, MILE (Maximum Likelihood estimation including Environmental noise) and MILEBI (Maximum Likelihood estimation including Environmental noise and Bottom Intra-class variability) that utilize the information contained in the proposed covariance matrices to further constrain the inversion while allowing the observation to differ from the model in the less reliable wavebands. In this paper, MILE and MILEBI are compared with the widely used least-squares (LS) criterion in terms of depth, water clarity and benthic cover retrievals. For these three approaches, we also assess the influence of constraining bottom mixture coefficients to sum to one on estimation results.   The results show that the proposed probabilistic model is a valuable tool to investigate the influence of bottom intra-class variability on subsurface reflectance, e.g., as a function of optical depth or environmental noise. As expected, this influence is critical in very optically shallow waters, and decreases with increasing optical depth. The inversion results obtained from synthetic and airborne data of Quiberon Peninsula, France, show that MILE and MILEBI generally provide better performances than LS. For example, in the case of airborne data with depth ranging from 0.44 to 12.00 m, the bathymetry estimation error decreases by about 32% when using MILE and MILEBI instead of LS. Estimated maps of bottom cover are also more consistent when derived using sum-to-one constrained versions of MILE and MILEBI. MILE is shown to be a simple but powerful method to map simple benthic habitats with negligible influence of infra-class variability. Alternatively, MILEBI is to be preferred if this variability cannot be neglected, since taking bottom covariance matrices into account concurrently with mean reflectance spectra may help the bottom discrimination, e.g., in the presence of overlapping classes. This study thus shows that taking potential sources of error into account through appropriate para-meterizations of spectral covariance may be critical to improve the remote sensing of shallow waters, hence making MILE and MILEBI interesting alternatives to LS.', '[Jay, Sylvain; Guillaume, Mireille] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Inst Fresnel, Cent Marseille, F-13013 Marseille, France.

Here we use data from the laser altimeter ICESat and the radar altimeter Cryosat-2 to present a 14-year record (2003-2016) of high-resolution and spatially extensive ice thickness observations for the ECA and identify 12 sub-regions with distinct patterns. The mean sea ice growth rate within the seasonally ice-covered ECA from November to April is 23 cm mo(-1) (565 km(3) mo(-1)), with the fastest increase in thickness occurring through strong ice convergence and deformation in eastern Hudson Bay and Foxe Basin. Our results demonstrate characteristically asymmetrical distributions of sea ice thickness in both Hudson Bay and Baffin Bay, but in opposing directions. In Hudson Bay the spring ice cover is 40 cm thicker in the eastern region compared to the northwestern region, whereas in Baffin Bay the ice is 20 cm thicker in the western half of the bay compared to the eastern half. In Hudson Bay we find that years with strong and positive ice drift vorticity (i.e. cyclonic and convergent conditions) correlate with increasingly asymmetrical sea ice covers, with the level of west-east asymmetry varying from 2 to 11 cm per 100 km. However, in Baffin Bay the ice drift vorticity is typically negative (i.e. anticyclonic and divergent) with no obvious link to the asymmetry of the spring ice cover.

A better understanding of the seasonal transition of high latitude landscapes between frozen and thawed states is therefore critical for predicting carbon cycle feedbacks in a warming climate. However, observations of freeze/ thaw state are not at sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to observe fast (similar to days-weeks) transitions in highly heterogeneous regions. Here, we present new evidence that reflected Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals captured by the SMAP radar receiver have the potential to quantify changes in high-latitude soil freeze/thaw state at kilometer-scale resolution. Boreal wetland observations indicate a similar to 10 dB seasonal difference in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), in agreement with simulations from a simple reflectivity model. Our analysis indicates that ground-reflected GNSS signals as a form of L-band bistatic radar could be a robust observable to quantify soil freeze/thaw state at process-relevant scales. We describe the caveats and potential limitations of this approach, and highlight areas for continuing research.

A surface-based Ku-, X- and C-band microwave scatterometer system is used near coincident with in-situ thermophysical snow measurements. A frequency-dependent penetration depth model is utilized to simulate diverse variations in Ku-, X- and C-band penetration during fluctuating snow thermophysical and atmospheric conditions. These results helped improve the interpretation of observed changes in Ku-, X- and C-band backscatter. Overall, dielectric loss associated with presence of brine throughout the snow volume, is observed to be the governing factor affecting microwave penetration. Our results indicate significant differences in observed microwave backscatter and derived co-polarized ratio and dual-frequency ratios, for all three frequencies during the transition from cold late winter phase to warm pre-early melt onset phase. C-band demonstrates the greatest increase in backscatter and co-pol ratios, followed by X- and Ku-bands. The dual-frequency ratio combinations clearly demonstrate their ability to separate sensitivities in frequencies by characterizing changes in bacicscatter during the 7-day transition. Our results indicate strong direct influence of downwelling shortwave and longwave radiation on snow brine volume and dielectric properties, which drives changes to Ku-, X- and C-band microwave bacicscatter and its associated co-polarized ratio and dual-frequency ratios.

In this study we examine the potential of full waveform Aerial Laser Scanning (ALS) to derive accurate spatially explicit estimates of Plant Area Index (PAI).   A discrete representation of the forest canopy is introduced in the form of a 3D voxelized space. For each voxel (elementary volume, typically one cubic m) a first estimate of local transmittance of vegetation is computed as the ratio of the sum of energy exiting a voxel to the sum of energy entering the same voxel. A spatially hierarchical model is subsequently applied to refine estimates of individual voxel transmittance. Plant area density (PAD) profiles are then computed from the local transmittance values by applying Beer Lambert\'s turbid medium approximation. PAI values are obtained from vertical integration of PAD profiles. The model is shown to be robust to low sampling intensity and high occlusion rates.   We further compared simulated values of gap fraction obtained by ray tracing for 5 angular sectors with in situ LAI2200 measurements taken at 135 positions in a 05 ha forest plot located in the center of the scene. The overall patterns of simulated and measured values (average value per inclination and pattern of variation along a 70 m transect line) were highly consistent. A slight but systematic discrepancy was observed along the inclination gradient, gap fractions derived from ray tracing in the voxelized scene being slightly lower than the measured values. This difference might be the consequence of multiple reflections which have been found to bias gap fractions estimates produced by LAI2200.   PAI estimates derived from LAI2200 measurements (either simulated 6.8 or observed 5.9) are much lower than the PAI derived from vertical integration of local PAD (13.6). This large difference reflects the fact that distribution of foliage is strongly spatially structured and that this structural information is not properly accounted for in PAI estimates derived from mean gap fraction per elevation angle. After adjusting local transmittance to match mean LAI 2200 profiles the PAI at plot level was found to be 13.2 m(2).m(-2).   We conclude that Aerial Laser Scanning can produce accurate maps of Plant Area Index over large areas with unmatched efficacy, accuracy and ease. This should be of major relevance for many forest ecological studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

More emphasis has been made on area estimation and crop detection than on the temporal aspects of crop cultivation, but seasonal and temporal information such as i) crop duration, ii) date of crop establishment and iii) cropping intensity are as important as area for understanding crop production. Rice cropping systems are diverse because genetic, environmental and management factors (G x E x M combinations) influence the spatio-temporal patterns of cultivation.   We present a rule based algorithm called PhenoRice for automatic extraction of temporal information on the rice crop using moderate resolution hypertemporal optical imagery from MODIS. Performance of PhenoRice against spatially and temporally explicit reference information was tested in three diverse sites: rice-fallow (Italy), rice-other crop (India) and rice-rice (Philippines) systems.   Regional product accuracy assessments showed that PhenoRice made a conservative, spatially representative and robust detection of rice cultivation in all sites (r(2) between 0.75 and 0.92) and crop establishment dates were in close agreement with the reference data (r(2) = 0.98, Mean Error = 4.07 days, Mean Absolute Error = 9.95 days, p < 0.01). Variability in algorithm performance in different conditions in each site (irrigated vs rainfed, direct seeding vs transplanting, fragmented vs clustered rice landscapes and the impact of cloud contamination) was analysed and discussed. Analysis of the maps revealed that cropping intensity and season length per site matched well with local information on agro-practices and cultivated varieties. The results show that PhenoRice is robust for deriving essential temporal descriptions of rice systems in both temperate and tropical regions at a level of spatial and temporal detail that is suitable for regional crop monitoring on a seasonal basis.

However, the comprehensive understanding of urban environmental change in China based on multi-source remote sensing data remains inadequate because current studies have mainly focused on a single aspect of the urban environment using a specific source of remote sensing data. In this study, we developed a comprehensive evaluation index (CEI) combining the remote sensing data of the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration, land surface temperature (1ST) and vegetation cover (VC) to assess the urban environmental change in China at the national scale, among urban agglomerations and across the rapidly urbanized regions. We found a trend of environmental degradation in the urban areas of China between 2000 and 2012. Environmentally degraded and moderately degraded urban areas accounted for 48.14% of the total urban area in China. In particular, the expanded urban areas exhibited the most extensive environmental degradation, with 52.33% of the total expanded urban areas from 1992 to 2012 exhibiting environmental degradation or moderately environmental degradation. The increase in the PM2.5 concentration was one of the main manifestations of the environmental degradation in the expanded urban areas. We suggest that more attention should be paid to urban environmental issues during future urban development in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Biocontrol of the non-native tamarisk started in 2001 by introducing the tamarisk leaf beetle (Diorhabda spp.) to the riparian ecosystems. Since then, the beetles quickly established and substantial tamarisk defoliation was subsequently observed along river corridors in the western states. The ability to monitor and track the patterns of beetle-induced tamarisk defoliation across space and time is key to understand its impact on ecosystem functioning and processes. In the present study, spatiotemporal patterns of tamarisk defoliation caused by the subtropical tamarisk leaf beetle (D. sublineata) were successfully detected using a classification based method along the Lower Rio Grande in West Texas from 2009 to 2014. Our results indicated that the subtropical beetle species can sustain a dispersal rate of approximately 102 km yr(-1) during the first year after release. Tamarisk abundance was the most important factor in directing beetle dispersal. We also found that the beetles preferred to forage within dense, connected tamarisk stands along wide sections of the riparian river corridors. These new findings of our study will help inform the land managers of the possible outcomes of tamarisk biocontrol to make effective management plans. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Although habitat quality usually is understood from a multidimensional niche space approach, the availability of foraging substrates can be a suitable and more proximate index of habitat quality for species with specialized habitat requirements, like woodpeckers that feed almost exclusively on larvae of wood-boring beetles in the trunks and branches of infested trees. Recent approaches use simple mathematical algorithms on spectral bands called Vegetation Indices (VI) to identify infestations, providing a new opportunity to assess habitat quality for woodpeckers. In this paper, we tested the ability of 102 VI to estimate tree attributes explaining habitat quality for Magellanic woodpeckers for its usage as a reliable foraging habitat quality estimator. We hypothesized that space use of Magellanic woodpeckers is positively associated with the spatial distribution of decayed trees in the landscape. We developed a methodological framework based on high-resolution, multispectral imagery with three basic steps. First, we mapped individual Nothofagus trees based on estimates of species composition from a supervised classification procedure, VI estimates and image segmentation. Second, we selected the best VI predicting the tree quality for Magellanic woodpeckers. Third, we tested these habitat quality predictors, the species composition and tree age, by using two Synoptic Models of Space Use (SMSU) of Magellanic woodpeckers based on very high-frequency (VHF) radio-telemetry and global positioning system (GPS) telemetry data.   Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) showed that the VI that best predicted habitat quality at the tree-scale was the Plant Senescence Reflectance Index (PSRI, computed as [Red-Blue]/Red-edge), included in almost all the most parsimonious models. The most parsimonious SMSU included only PSRI as an independent covariate, with a strong positive relation. Although coefficient differences were found between telemetry data (VHF vs. GPS data) both showed a positive overall response. Consequently, Red-edge based PSRI can be considered a reliable estimator of tree-scale foraging habitat quality at landscape extents for future research and management activities including Magellanic woodpeckers living on heterogeneous Nothofagus forests.

More recent research demonstrates that multitemporal NTL data can serve as a reliable proxy for change over time in these variables whether they are increasing or decreasing. Time series analysis of Nn. data is especially valuable for detecting, estimating, and monitoring socioeconomic dynamics in countries and subnational regions where reliable official statistics may be lacking. Until 2012, multitemporal NTL imagery came primarily from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS), for which digital imagery is available from 1992 to 2013. In October 2011, the launch of NASA/NOAA\'s Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite, whose Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor has a Day/Night Band (DNB) specifically designed for capturing radiance from the Earth at night, marked the start of a new era in NTL data collection and applications. In light of these advances, this paper reviews progress in using multitemporal DMSP-OLS and VIIRS imagery to analyze urbanization, economic, and population dynamics across a range of geographic scales. An overview of data corrections and processing for comparison of multitemporal NTL imagery is provided, followed by a meta-analysis and integrative synthesis of these studies. Figures are included that visualize the capabilities of DMSP-OLS and VIIRS to capture socioeconomic change in the post-Soviet Russian Far East and war-torn Syria, respectively. Finally, future directions for NTL research are suggested, particularly in the areas of determining the fundamental causes of observed light and in leveraging VIIRS\' superior sensitivity and spatial and radiometric resolution.

In recent years, methods based on radiative transfer model inversion have shown promising results for extracting information about seabed type, bottom depth and water constituents from hyperspectral imagery. However, low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) due to low water-leaving radiance combined with environmental variability make it very difficult to design an optimal processing algorithm. Here, we selected a state-of-the-art, forward semi-analytical model in which we included a mixing model of four seabed albedo, namely sand, corals, algae and seagrass. The purpose of this paper was then to compare different setups of the inversion scheme, each one having its own theoretical strengths and weaknesses regarding the different confounding factors. Six inversion setups were implemented, corresponding to the combinations between (i) three cost functions: least square (LS), spectral angle mapper (SAM) and least square on spectral derivative (LSD), and (ii) two physical constraints imposed on the seabed type retrieval: abundance sum-to-one constraint (ASC) and a relaxed version (RASC). Performances of bathymetry and seabed type retrieval were evaluated on hyperspectral data acquired in a coral reef environment in Reunion Island. Our results showed that the accuracy and robustness of the bathymetric estimation were greatly influenced by the choice of the inversion setup. RASC-LSD produced the overall best performances even if SAM-based inversion setups showed particularly low error dispersion with respect to Lidar derived bathymetry. RASC-LSD also produced the most accurate results in terms of spatial coverage of benthic components on a very shallow area (inner part of a fringing reef). The results on our study areas clearly highlighted the interest of relaxing the ASC when the bottom depth is shallow. In deeper areas, ASC versions of LS- and LSD-based inversion setups produced the best seabed type mapping results. Only broad seabed types could be retrieved in areas deeper than 10 m.

Using the same extensively measured physical snow pack properties, we compared the simulated T-B at 11, 19 and 37 GHz from these four models. The analysis focuses on the impact of using different types of measured snow microstructure metrics in the simulations. In addition to density, snow microstructure is defined for each snow layer by grain optical diameter (Do) and stickiness for DMRT-ML and DMRT-QMS, mean grain geometrical maximum extent (Dmax) for HUT n-layers and the exponential correlation length for MEMLS. These metrics were derived from either in-situ measurements of snow specific surface area (SSA) or macrophotos of grain sizes (D-max), assuming non-sticky spheres for the DMRT models. Simulated T-B sensitivity analysis using the same inputs shows relatively consistent T-B behavior as a function of Do and density variations for the vertical polarization (maximum deviation of 18 K and 27 K, respectively), while some divergences appear in simulated variations for the polarization ratio (PR). Comparisons with ground based radiometric measurements show that the simulations based on snow SSA measurements have to be scaled with a model-specific factor of Do in order to minimize the root mean square error (RMSE) between measured and simulated T-B. Results using in-situ grain size measurements (SSA or D-max, depending on the model) give a mean T-B RMSE (19 and 37 GHz) of the order of 16-26 K, which is similar for all models when the snow microstructure metrics are scaled. However, the MEMLS model converges to better results when driven by the correlation length estimated from in-situ SSA measurements rather than D-max measurements. On a practical level, this paper shows that the SSA parameter, a snow property that is easy to retrieve in-situ, appears to be the most relevant parameter for characterizing snow microstructure, despite the need for a scaling factor.

As emissions from large fires increase with time, it is essential to monitor the extent and spatial distribution of such changes that can have both short term and long-term implications in terms of human health and feedback on global radiative forcing. In this paper we have used the vertical profile distributions of some of the key trace gases, from AQUA-AIRS sensor to better understand the impact of wildfires in terms of magnitude, spatial and seasonal distribution. Our study shows the impact of season on fire emission in the planetary boundary layer and the free troposphere and also highlights areas in the continental United States (CONUS) where different trace gas emissions are more preponderant. Overall it successfully demonstrates the applicability of satellite-based sensors for regular monitoring of fire related trace gas emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The database consisted of 142 trees of interest for logging in a forest under management for timber in Brazil\'s state of Acre. The trees chosen for study were selected through proportional sampling by diameter class (ranging from 45 to 165 cm DBH) in order to properly represent the dominant and co-dominant tree populations with diameters appropriate for harvest. Subsequent to LIDAR profiling of these trees, they were felled, subjected to a battery of dimensional measurements and sampled for wood-density determination. A set of models was generated, followed by model selection and identity testing in order to compare groups of basic wood density (low, medium and high). The morphometric variables of the crown had high explanatory power for bole biomass independent of whether the allometric equations included DBH. When calculating bole biomass with equations that include basic wood density, the best estimate is obtained using variables for both DBH and crown morphology. To obtain an allometric equation that encompasses species in all three classes of basic density, one should either use only independent variables representing crown dimensions or complement these with variables for basic density (BD) and total height (Ht). The study demonstrates the feasibility of using ground-based measurements to calibrate biomass models that include only LIDAR-based variables, allowing much larger areas to be surveyed with reasonable accuracy. The present study is designed to produce data needed for forest management, but the methods developed here can be adapted to studies aimed at reducing the uncertainty in biomass estimates of whole forests (not just harvestable trees) for use in quantifying carbon emissions from forest loss and degradation.

Among remote sensing technologies, Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS) is extremely useful for fuel mapping as it provides 3D information on vegetation distribution. A cost-effective methodology to obtain high-resolution fuel model maps in large forest areas from ALS data (1 pulse/m(2)) and Landsat-8 OLI images is presented. A two-phase approach was used to generate the fuel model maps: i) ad-hoc vegetation classification derived from ALS and Landsat-8 OLI, and ii) fuel model assignment based on fuel complex structure from a limited number of ALS-derived metrics: fractional canopy cover, fuel height, and canopy relief ratio. Fuel model maps for the Canary Islands (Spain) were generated for two fuel classification systems, standard Northern Forest Fire Laboratory (NFFL) and specific Canarian fuel models (CIFM), at 25 m resolution (3678 km(2)) according to decision rules based on ALS-derived metrics developed for each vegetation type. Fieldwork was used to validate the fuel model maps, obtaining an overall accuracy of 82% (kappa = 0.777) and 70% (kappa = 0.679) for the standard NFFL and CIFM fuel models respectively. Discrimination between fuel models associated to forests with and without understory was satisfactory, showing higher errors due to species composition classification rather than to ALS-derived fuel structure. Errors due to underestimation of ALS-derived fuel cover and height were more evident in mixed grassland and shrubland fuels. Results demonstrated the potential of combining imagery and ALS for fuel model mapping at a large scale from existing data sources, even with low laser pulse density and temporarily mismatched data sets. The proposed methodology may be applied for fuel mapping in other large areas provided that ALS information is available and that fuel model definition has explicit structure characteristics allowing decision rules based on ALS data. Once algorithms are defined for fuel model assignment, the low number of ALS-derived metrics and the semi-automated processing ensures that fuel model maps can be easily updated as new data sources become available providing managers with useful spatial information in large areas.

Long-term Landsat 5 TM reflectance inconsistencies may be introduced by orbit change induced\' solar zenith variations combined with surface reflectance anisotropy, commonly described by the Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). This study quantifies the local overpass time and observed solar zenith angle changes for all the Landsat 5 TM images available at two latitudinally separated locations along the same north-south Landsat path (27) in Minnesota (row 26) and Texas (row 42). Over the 27 years the Landsat 5 orbit changed by nearly 1 h and resulted in changes in the Landsat 5 observed solar zenith angle of >10 degrees. The Landsat 5 orbit was relatively stable from 1984 to 1994 and from 2007 to 2011, but changed rapidly from 1995 to 2000, and from 2003 to 2007. Rather than directly examine Landsat 5 TM reflectance time series a modelling approach was used. This was necessary because unambiguous separation of orbit change induced Landsat reflectance variations from other temporal variations is non-trivial. The impact of Landsat 5 orbit induced observed solar zenith angle variations on the red and near-infrared reflectance and derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values were modelled with respect to different Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) BRDF land cover types. Synthetic nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) for the Landsat 5 TM observed and a modelled reference year 2011 solar zenith were compared over the 27 years of acquisitions. Ordinary leastsquares linear regression fits of the NBAR difference values as a function of the acquisition date indicated an increasing trend in red and near-infrared NEAR and a decreasing trend in NDVI NBAR due to orbit changes. The trends are statistically significant but small, no more than 0.0006 NDVI/year. Comparison of certain years of Landsat 5 data may result in significant reflectance and NDVI differences due only to Landsat 5 orbit changes and cause spurious detection of \"browning\" vegetation events and underestimation of greening trends. The greatest differences will occur when 1995 Landsat 5 TM data are compared with 2007 to 2011 data; NDVI values could be up to 0.11 greater in 1995 than in 2011 for anisotropic land cover types and up to 0.05 greater for average CONUS land cover types. A smaller number of Landsat 5 TM images were also examined and provide support for the modelled based findings. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the research findings for Landsat 5 TM time series analyses. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.', '[Zhang, H. K.; Roy, D.

High quality Landsat-8 albedo retrievals can now capture the true reflective and layered character of snow cover over a full range of land surface conditions and vegetation densities. This new capability particularly improves the assessment of post-fire vegetation dynamics across low- to high-burn severity gradients in Arctic and boreal regions in the early spring, when the albedos during recovery show the greatest variation. We use 30 m resolution Landsat-8 surface reflectances with concurrent coarser resolution (500 m) MODIS high quality full inversion surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDF) products to produce higher resolution values of surface albedo. The high resolution full expression shortwave blue sky albedo product performs well with an overall RMSE of 0.0267 between tower and satellite measures under both snow-free and snow-covered conditions. While the importance of post-fire albedo recovery can be discerned from the MODIS albedo product at regional and global scales, our study addresses the particular importance of early spring post-fire albedo recovery at the landscape scale by considering the significant spatial heterogeneity of burn severity, and the impact of snow on the early spring albedo of various vegetation recovery types. We found that variations in early spring albedo within a single MODIS gridded pixel can be larger than 0.6. Since the frequency and severity of wildfires in Arctic and boreal systems is expected to increase in the coming decades, the dynamics of albedo in response to these rapid surface changes will increasingly impact the energy balance and contribute to other climate processes and physical feedback mechanisms. Surface radiation products derived from Landsat-8 data will thus play an important role in characterizing the carbon cycle and ecosystem processes of high latitude systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The performance of albedo validation depends on the quality of ground-based albedo measurements at a corresponding coarse pixel scale, which can be conceptualized as the \"truth\" value of albedo at coarse-pixel scale. In this paper, a sampling strategy based on multiple nodes using wireless sensor network (WSN) technology, WSN-based albedo observation, is proposed. The WSN nodes are distributed in an optimal layout determined by a sequential selection method based on the representativeness of each sensor. The WSN dataset in this study includes 6 nodes. A method of weighting is used to upscale WSN node albedo to a coarse-pixel scale. The weights for each node are calculated with the ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression method. Compared with the multiple scale validation strategy, the dataset of WSN albedo \"truth\" at the coarse-pixel scale reveals a good quality both in stability and continuity. Application of this strategy is exemplified by validation of the MODIS 1 km albedo product.

Although several past studies have highlighted the lack of SWTIO salinity variability, vertical stratification may be sufficient to generate a regional barrier layer, a tropical phenomenon found throughout the Indian Ocean with the ability to affect local air-sea interactions. New global, remotely sensed sea surface salinity (SSS) obtained from the ESA\'s Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and NASA\'s Aquarius satellites gives us reason to revisit the region to see if these datasets can yield new information on salinity\'s role in SWTIO variability. We use Argo floats data to calculate mixed layer depth (MLD), isothermal layer depth (ILD), and barrier layer thickness (BLT = ILD MLD). We also use a novel approach to estimate satellite-derived BLT by replacing the Argo SSS estimate with the SMOS and Aquarius \"skin\" measurement to then recalculate the MLD and thus obtain a different BLT estimate. We find that while BLT estimates from all three products are in phase with one another, Aquarius and SMOS produce BLT estimates that are greater than Argo by 10-20 m on average. An anomalous event in 2011 demonstrates how BLT interannual variability may be created by changes in near surface salinity. Our observations suggest that the event was caused by subduction of surface waters due to increased near surface salinity and an anomalous downwelling Rossby wave generated by positive Indian Ocean dipole. Both mechanisms created a thick barrier layer followed by anomalous precipitation and SSS, a series of events consistent with barrier layer theory. Our results also suggest that new SSS measurements from SMOS and Aquarius provide a different interpretation of near surface salinity stratification that needs to be further explored.

Two satellite missions were recently launched to measure land surface emissions at this frequency band (SMOS-Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity in 2009 and SMAP-Soil Moisture Active/Passive in 2015). In order to improve soil moisture retrievals from satellite data, ground-based radiometer systems operating at the same frequency were deployed over specified areas to investigate the L-band emission of various land covers under various climatological conditions. In this study, three years of L-band passive measurements from a radiometer installed on top of a steep mountain in the French Alps were analyzed and compared to L-band passive simulations. The innovative radiometer location led to large footprints due to the distance between the radiometer and the area under study. This experiment also produced microwave measurements affected by various potential difficulties typically encountered in SMOS/SMAP satellite missions: topography, heterogeneous footprints, dry/wet snow events, dew and vegetation litter. Based on in situ and modeling data, this paper investigates the potential of a radiative transfer model (L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere, L-MEB) to simulate L-band measurements and analyzes the differences with ELBARA observations. First, it was found that the topography generated a mixing of the horizontal and vertical polarizations. In addition, a large positive bias was found on ELBARA measurements (31 K and 12 K in horizontal and vertical polarizations respectively). Investigations showed that the sky reflection measured by the radiometer was partially substituted by land reflection coming from the surrounding topography. Second, the low-vegetation emission was investigated and highlighted the inability of the MODIS NDVI product to correctly represent the vegetation dynamics. Finally, dry snow conditions were found to have non-negligible impact at L-band and a particular signature was found during snow melting periods, with potential applications at the SMOS/SMAP spatial scales (similar to 40 km).

As the volcanic plume is moving rapidly, conventional satellite based photogrammetric height restitution methods do not apply as the epipolar offset due to plume motion adds up to the one generated by the stereoscopic view. This is because there are time-lags of tens of seconds between conventional satellite stereoscopic acquisitions, depending on the stereo acquisition mode. Our method is based on a single satellite pass. We exploit the short time lag and resulting baseline that exist between the multispectral (MS) and the panchromatic (PAN) bands to jointly measure the epipolar offsets and the perpendicular to the epipolar (P2E) offsets. The first are proportional to plume height plus the offsets due to plume velocity in the epipolar direction. The second, are proportional to plume velocity in the P2E direction only. The latter is used to compensate the effect of plume velocity in the stereoscopic offsets by projecting it on the epipolar direction assuming a known plume direction, thus improving the height measurement precision. We apply the method to Landsat 8 data taking into account the specificities of the focal plane modules. We focus on the Holuhraun 2014 fissure eruption (Iceland). We validate our measurements against ground based measurements. The method has potential for detailed high resolution routine measurements of volcanic plume height/velocity. The method can be applied both to other multifocal plane modules push broom sensors (such as the ESA Sentinel 2) and potentially to other push-broom systems such as the CNES SPOT family and Pleiades.

Geographically varying estimates were obtained of both the error variance and the associated length scale of the background error which were decomposed into small-scale and large-scale errors. Both components of the background error variances were found to be seasonally variable. Minimal seasonality was observed in the error correlation length scales but they were found to be anisotropic.

However, observations with large view angles pose new challenges for radiometric cross calibration with a simple image-based method when using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data as a reference. Based on radiative transfer modeling, a novel radiometric cross-calibration method has been proposed in this study to solve large view angle-associated problems. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol products were used to simulate the top of atmosphere (TOA) signal of the reference and target instruments, and the unequal bidirectional effects were corrected using MODIS bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) products. Extensive validations with both satellite data and in situ measurements revealed an uncertainty of similar to 8% for the newly produced cross-calibration coefficients when they were used to calibrate TOA reflectance for both close-nadir and off-nadir instruments. The improvements are discernable when compared with the official provided coefficients and that were derived using the image-based cross calibration method. This study demonstrated not only the usefulness of Landsat-8 OLI data in sensor radiometric calibration but also the impressive accuracy of the MODIS BRDF and aerosol products in radiative transfer simulations. The proposed method can be used in the future to monitor and correct potential radiometric degradations of the GF-1 WFV instruments, and it also can be easily extended to other similar satellite missions to conduct radiometric cross-calibrations.

An accurate estimation of the total forest carbon stock in the aboveground biomass (AGB) is therefore necessary for improving our understanding of carbon dynamics, especially against the background of global climate change. The forest area of China is among the top five globally. However, because of limitations in forest AGB mapping methods and the availability of ground inventory data, there is still a lack in the nationwide wall-to-wall forest AGB estimation map for China. In this study, we collected over 8000 ground inventory records from published literatures, and developed an AGB mapping method using a combination of these ground inventory data, Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS)/Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) data, optical imagery, climate surfaces, and topographic data. An uncertainty field model was introduced into the forest AGB mapping procedure to minimize the influence of plot location uncertainty. Our nationwide wall-to-wall forest AGB mapping results show that the forest AGB density in China is 120 Mg/ha on average, with a standard deviation of 61 Mg/ha. Evaluation with an independent ground inventory dataset showed that our proposed method can accurately map wall-to-wall forest AGB across a large landscape. The adjusted coefficient of determination (R-2) and root-mean-square error between our predicted results and the validation dataset were 0.75 and 42.39 Mg/ha, respectively. This new method and the resulting nationwide wall-to-wall forest AGB map will help to improve the accuracy of carbon dynamic predictions in China.

While most SITS-based crop type classifications were focused on NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) temporal profiles, less attention has been paid to using the complete image spectral resolution of the time series. In this work we assessed different approaches to SITS-based classification of four major fruit-tree crops in the Maipo Valley, central Chile, during the 2013-14 growing season. We compared four feature sets from a time series comprised of eight cloud-free Landsat-8 images: the full-band SITS, the NDVI and NDWI (normalized difference water index) temporal profiles, and an image stack with all the feature sets combined. State-of-the-art classifiers (linear discriminant analysis, LDA; random forest; and support vector machine) were applied on each feature set at different training sample sizes (N = 100, 200, 400, 800 and 2291 fields), and classification results were assessed by cross-validation of the misclassification error rate (MER). For all the feature sets overall results were good (MERs <= 0.21) although substantially improved classification accuracies were achieved when the full-band SITS was employed (MER 0.14-0.05). Classifications applied on the NDVI temporal profile consistently had the worst performance. For a sample size of 200 fields, LDA using the full-band SITS of image dates 1, 3, 6 and 8 produced the best tradeoff between the number of images and classification accuracy (MER = 0.06), being the green, red, blue and SWIR (short-wave infrared) bands of image date 1 (acquired at the early greenup stage) the most relevant for crop type discrimination. Our results show the importance of considering the complete image spectral resolution for SITS-based crop type classifications as the commonly used NDVI temporal profile and their red and near infrared bands were not found the most significant to discriminate the crop types of interest. Furthermore, in light of the good results obtained, the methodology used here might be transferred to similar agricultural lands cultivated with the same crop types, thus providing a reliable and relatively efficient methodology for creating and updating crop inventories.

The radiometric characteristics of Landsat sensors, however, have limited these measurements generally to only fast-flowing glaciers with high levels of surface texture and imagery with high sun angles and cloud-free conditions, preventing wide-area velocity mapping at the scale achievable with synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the newly launched Landsat 8 features substantially improves radiometric performance compared to preceding sensors: enhancing performance of automated Repeat-Image Feature Tracking (RIFT) for mapping ice flow speed. In order to assess this improvement, we conduct a comparative study of OLI and the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) performance for measuring glacier velocity in a range of surface and atmospheric conditions. To isolate the effects of radiometric quantization and noise level, we construct a model for simulating ETM+ imagery from OLI and compare RIFT results derived from each. We find that a nonlinearity in the relationship between ETM+ and OLI radiances at higher brightness levels results in a particularly large improvement in RIFT performance over the low-textured interior of the ice sheets, as well as improved performance in adverse conditions such as low sun-angles and thin clouds. Additionally, the reduced noise level in OLI imagery results in fewer spurious motion vectors and improved RIFT performance in all conditions and surfaces. We conclude that OLI imagery should enable large-area ice sheet and glacier mapping so that its coverage is comparable to SAR, with a remaining limitation being image geolocation.

Thus, a thorough understanding of the differences in the distributions of crop variables among different vertical layers and modules, as well as the effects of these layers and modules on canopy spectral characteristics and derived vegetation indices, is vital to improving the performance of crop monitoring by remote sensing. The main goal of this work was to provide insight into the above issues based on field measurements of winter wheat under different treatments during anthesis. The results demonstrated that the leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll a and b content (Chl(a+b)), nitrogen (N) content per unit leaf area (N-L), N concentration on a mass basis (N-M), dry matter accumulation (DM), N accumulation (NA), and water content (We) in leaves and stems generally exhibited great vertical differences within wheat canopies during anthesis. There were also significant differences in N-M, DM, NA, and W-c among the different plant modules (i.e., leaves, stems, and spikes) and the entire canopy. Moreover, the removal of wheat spikes and different vertical leaf layers had evident effects on the canopy spectral reflectance, and there were differences in the types and degrees of these effects at different wavelengths and treatments. In most cases, the vegetation indices decreased after removing wheat spikes and different leaf layers, although a few indices increased. There were also some vegetation indices that responded weakly to removal events. In comparison, the vegetation indices mostly showed stronger responses to the removal of the top 1st leaves than the spikes. To a certain extent, the responses to the removal of the top 2nd leaves were comparable to those of the top 1st leaves. The responses of most vegetation indices to the top 3rd leaves\' removal were less than the responses to the top 2nd leaves\' removal. In the case of the removal of the top 4th leaves and below, many of the R-V (i.e., relative variation rate) absolute values of vegetation indices were greater than those of the top 3rd leaves\' removal but smaller than or close to those of the top 2nd leaves\' removal; this may partly be because all the withered and dead leaves covering the soil surface were also removed in this case. The above findings indicated that crop features may not be well characterized when they are based solely on leaves, especially only the upper leaves, as the lower leaves, stems, and spikes also have important effects. Moreover, wheat spikes, not just leaves, and even bottom-layer leaves, could have evident effects on canopy reflectance characteristics and derived vegetation indices. More effort is needed in future research to obtain a thorough understanding of the effects of canopy heterogeneity on canopy spectral characteristics and the relationships between crop variables and spectral vegetation indices.

The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (f(APAR)) is a dominant term in this model, and it is fundamentally important for model calculations of ecosystem productivity across large areas. The LUE term is sometimes considered a constant, but may be best represented as a variable scalar under stress conditions. The main objective of this study was to better understand factors influencing f(APAR), its relationship with seasonal variation in canopy greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)), and the consequences of potential seasonal changes in the NDVI-f(APAR) relationship for LUE model calculations of ecosystem photosynthesis in a semi-arid grassland. We used two approaches to determine f(APAR), (i) direct incoming and outgoing radiation measurements above and below the canopy, and (ii) an inversion approach based on incident photosynthetically active radiation and the light response curve of net ecosystem productivity measured by eddy covariance at low light levels. The two approaches resulted in f(APAR) values that were very strongly correlated during the initial development of the canopy until peak leaf area index (LAI) was reached. During this time, a strong linear relationship also occurred between f(APAR) and NDVI calculated from spectral reflectance measurements of the grassland canopy. After peak LAI, there was hysteresis in the NDVI-f(APAR) relationship, and the two f(APAR) estimates diverged. Light-use efficiency model calculations of ecosystem photosynthesis made using f(APAR) values were strongly correlated with chamber CO2 exchange measurements during the initial development of the canopy leaf area. After peak LAI, a stress function, based on either soil moisture or vapour pressure deficit (VPD) measurements, was necessary to reduce quantum yield and model calculations of ecosystem photosynthesis during periods of relatively low soil moisture and higher VPD later in the growing season. Both stress functions were similarly effective in improving the correlation between modeled and measured ecosystem photosynthesis values, and indicated reduced LUE under late season conditions. Modulating LUE based on the Photochemical Reflectance Index or the Water Band Index (both proposed as possible indicators of LUE) was not effective to improve the correlation between modeled and measured ecosystem photosynthesis values in this ecosystem.

Dune cliffs cut into these materials represent one of the most sensitive systems to the processes of coastal change. Establishing appropriate scales for the quantification and analysis of change in coastal dune cliffs remains limited by the speed and nature of change, the intensity of environmental processes and the challenges of achieving adequate survey control. This paper presents the results from multi-scale analyses into the behaviour of dune cliffs on the northeast coast, UK, over a 118 year period. Repeat unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) survey differences have been used to identify and quantify system behaviour, set in context with historic map comparisons. At the landform scale, monthly dune cliff dynamics have been analysed over the course of a year with terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) in order to gain insights into the drivers of contemporary dune cliff behaviour. Finally, pseudo three-dimensional ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data are used to trace subsurface stratigraphy from which the potential extent of stored carbon (in excess of 100 t over 50 m of monitored dune cliff) at risk of release by coastal erosion over the next 50 years can be calculated. The consideration of multi-scale changes over time periods relevant to well-constrained sea level change has revealed a complex combination of failure mechanisms that have resulted in an acceleration in dune cliff recession (particularly over the last decade) and a form change to shallower, divergent profiles. This potential acceleration in contemporary dune cliff response holds significant implications for both coastal management and the contribution of this poorly quantified input to the coastal carbon flux.

The evaluation uses ground-based soil moisture observations of 596 sites from 28 historical and active monitoring networks worldwide. Besides providing conventional measures of agreement, we use the triple collocation technique to assess random errors in the data set. The average Spearman correlation coefficient between ECV_SM and all in-situ observations is 0.46 for the absolute values and 0.36 for the soil moisture anomalies, but differences between networks and time periods are very large. Unbiased root-mean-square differences and triple collocation errors show less variation between networks, with average values around 0.05 and 0.04 m(3) m(-3), respectively. The ECV_SM quality shows an upward trend over time, but a consistent decrease of all performance metrics is observed for the period 2007-2010. Comparing the skill of the merged product with the skill of the individual input products shows that the merged product has a similar or better performance than the individual input products, except with regard to the ASCAT product, compared to which the performance of ECV_SM is inferior. The cause of the latter is most likely a combination of the mismatch in sampling time between the satellite observations and in-situ measurements, and the resampling and scaling strategy used to integrate the ASCAT product into ECV_SM on the other. The results of this study will be used to further improve the scaling and merging algorithms for future product updates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Dorigo, W.

For many applications, it is important to model the effects of surface roughness. This study focuses on the unique PORTOS-93 measurement campaign that covered a wide range of bare soil conditions in terms of moisture, temperature and surface roughness. The PORTOS-93 campaign covers a frequency range from 1.41 to 90 GHz. In this study, based on the PORTOS-93 dataset, we compare the Wegmuller & Matzler (1999) model (referred to as WM99) with the Wang & Choudhury (1981) model (referred to as QHN) and evaluate their abilities to simulate the soil surface brightness temperature (TB). We show that improved results were obtained by tuning the parameters of the two models to the entire PORTOS-93 dataset for each frequency separately compared to the model tuned independently of frequency. In addition we found that the Mironov et al. (2009) soil permittivity model is slightly more accurate at lower frequencies (<11 GHz) for simulating soil permittivity than the Dobson et at (1985) soil permittivity model for the PORTOS-93 site. We also found that both of these permittivity models need to be tuned at higher frequencies (>20 GHz) and that using the Wang & Schmugge (1980) model tuned using parameters derived by Calvet et al. (1995a) at higher frequencies for the PORTOS-93 dataset gives best results. Using the proposed tuned reflectivity models for each frequency separately, we obtained an overall bias of -020 K and 021 K for the WM99 and QHN models respectively between the measured and modelled brightness temperatures. This corresponds to a significant improvement in comparison to the use of the tuned WM99 model independently of the frequency (bias = -38.08 K). (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, the accuracy of AVHRR-derived cloud properties cloud mask, cloud-top height, cloud phase and cloud liquid water path is assessed using three state-of-the-art retrieval schemes. In addition, the same retrieval schemes are applied to the AVHRR heritage channels of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to create AVHRR-like retrievals with higher spatial resolution and based on presumably more accurate spectral calibration. The cloud property retrievals were collocated and inter-compared with observations from CloudSat, CALIPSO and AMSR-E The resulting comparison exhibited good agreement in general. The schemes provide correct cloud detection in 82 to 90% of all cloudy cases. With correct identification of clear-sky in 61 to 85% of all clear areas, the schemes are slightly biased towards cloudy conditions. The evaluation of the cloud phase classification shows correct identification of liquid clouds in 61 to 97% and a correct identification of ice clouds in 68 to 95%, demonstrating a large variability among the schemes. Cloud-top height (CTH) retrievals were of relatively similar quality with standard deviations ranging from 2.1 km to 2.7 km. Significant negative biases in these retrievals are found in particular for cirrus clouds. The biases decrease if optical depth thresholds are applied to determine the reference CTH measure. Cloud liquid water path (LWP) is also retrieved well with relative low standard deviations (20 to 28 g/m(2)), negative bias and high correlations. Cloud ice water path (IWP) retrievals of AVHRR and MODIS exhibit a relative high uncertainty with standard deviations between 800 and 1400 g/m2, which in relative terms exceed 100% when normalized with the mean IWP. However, the global histogram distributions of IWP were similar to the reference dataset   MODIS retrievals are for most comparisons of slightly better quality than AVHRR-based retrievals. Additionally, the choice of different near-infrared channels, 3.7 mu M as opposed to 1.6 mu m, can have a significant impact on the retrieval quality, most pronounced for IWP, with better accuracy for the 1.6 mu m channel setup. This study presents a novel assessment of the quality of cloud properties derived from AVHRR channels, which quantifies the accuracy of the considered retrievals based on common approaches and validation data. Furthermore, it assesses the capabilities of AVHRR-like spectral information for retrieving cloud properties in the light of generating climate data records of cloud properties from three decades of AVHRR measurements.

Thus, accurate and timely production forecasts are critical for making informed agricultural policies and investments, as well as increasing market efficiency and stability. Becker-Reshef et al. (2010) developed an empirical generalized model for forecasting winter wheat production. Their approach combined BRDF-corrected daily surface reflectance from Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) with detailed official crop statistics and crop type masks. It is based on the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at the peak of the growing season, percent wheat within the CMG pixel (area within the CMG pixel occupied by wheat), and the final yields. This method predicts the yield approximately one month to six weeks prior to harvest. In this study, we include Growing Degree Day (GDD) information extracted from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data in order to improve the winter wheat production forecast by increasing the timeliness of the forecasts while conserving the accuracy of the original model. We apply this modified model to three major wheat-producing countries: the Unites States (US), Ukraine and China from 2001 to 2012.

The observation of the rapidly changing dynamic characteristics of algae is limited by the insufficient temporal resolution of satellite data. The Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), launched by Korea, can provide high temporal resolution satellite data to observe the hourly dynamics of algae. In this study, a simple regional NIR-red two-band empirical algorithm of Cchl-a for GOCI is proposed for Taihu Lake. Study results show that the GOCI-derived Cchl-a matches the in situ measured values well. Based on this validated algorithm of Cchl-a, we obtained the hourly maps of Cchl-a from GOCI level-1b data during the period August 6 to August 9, 2013. The spatial variation of GOCI-derived Cchl-a also matches synchronous in situ measured values well, and the temporal variation of GOCI-derived Cchl-a coincides with buoy-measured Cchl-a. The northwestern area of the lake and Meiliang Bay are worst hit by phytoplankton bloom. GOCI-derived Cchl-a revealed a clear evidence of hourly spatial and temporal variations of Cchl-a in Taihu Lake. The vertical current plays an important role in the hourly scale of spatial and temporal variations in phytoplankton. The horizontal current is important to the distribution of phytoplankton over the long term, but spatially and temporally limited in the short term. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Two remote sensing ET models based on thermal infrared (TIR), the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) and the Satellite-Based Energy Balance for Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), were tested for accuracy, and bias at fine (1 m) and moderate (30-120 m) spatial scales. Airborne and Landsat data were collected over Maricopa, Arizona in 2009 and 2011 as part of a cotton irrigation scheduling study. Based on soil moisture observations at 112 locations across 4.9 ha and image data spanning two growing seasons, TSEB and METRIC were found similarly accurate at both fine and moderate scales with average discrepancies no more than 1.9 mm/day. Tests at 1-m scales showed that TSEB and METRIC model sensitivities were seasonally correlated, with greater sensitivity modeled by METRIC in early growth and slightly greater sensitivity by TSEB at maturity. Time integration of flux estimates was done by assuming constant evaporative fraction and was also tested for 2011 data using ground-based TIR radiometers; this latter approach improved daily ET estimates by 0.8 mm/day or better in two cases. Time-series assessment of the utility of using evaporative fraction as a water-stress indicator was tested using Landsat data and both TSEB and METRIC. Two early season water depletion events were detected and none in mid-season. The impact of overpass frequency upon ET estimates was tested for the field as a whole and found that cumulative ET estimates were significantly affected, up to 200 mm out of-1000 mm consumed. Results from this study showed that for ET accuracy, TSEB and METRIC perform similarly. METRIC is preferred when model ancillary data are sparse, while TSEB is preferred when support data are plentiful. Future ET modeling should consider implementing both to take advantage of their seasonally dependent sensitivities.

Continuous satellite derived observations of anthropogenic lighting signal at night provide consistent and efficient proxy measures of demographic and socioeconomic dynamics in the urbanization process. Previous studies have demonstrated significant positive correlations between the nocturnal light brightness, mainly derived from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS), and population and economic variables. Quantitative measurements of artificial lighting emissions at night therefore can be indicative of the overall degree of socioeconomic development at regional to country levels. The spatio-temporal characteristics of anthropogenic night-time lighting, potentially connected to the dynamic patterns of spatially expanding human settlement and economic activities during the urban expansion process, however, has received less attention largely because of diversity of both socioeconomic activity and urban forms. Based upon the quadratic relationship between the pixel-level night-time light radiance and corresponding brightness gradient (i.e. the rate of maximum local change) at the local scale, we here proposed a spatially explicit approach for partitioning DMSP/OLS night-time light images into five types of night-time lighting areas for individual cities: low, medium-low, medium, medium-high and high, generally associated with urban sub-areas experienced distinctly different forms and human activity. At the country scale, our findings suggest that significant rises are commonly found in these five types of night-time lighting areas with different growth rates across 271 China\'s cities from 1992 to 2012. At the urban scale, however, five types of night-time lighting areas show various trends for individual cities in relation to the urban size and development levels. The marked increase in high night-time lighting area is highly prevalent in most of China\'s cities with rapid urbanization over the past 21 years while significantly decreased low and medium-low night-time lighting areas are most likely to occur in large and extra-large cities. Moreover, the transition between different types of night-time lighting areas could further portray the spatio-temporal characteristics of urban development. Analyzing results indicate that the spatial expansions of gradually intensified night-time light brightness correspond geographically with the rural-urban gradients following a stepwise transition of night-time light brightness during the urban expansion.

Hence, the \'reed die-back\' as it was later named, has been a phenomenon of great scientific interest and concern to conservationists worldwide and intensively studied by field ecologists. Imaging spectroscopy has frequently been employed for vegetation mapping, but this paper is the first explicit analysis of the spectral information content for reed and an assessment of the potential for detecting the areas affected by the reed die-back syndrome using hyperspectral data at the near infrared and the chlorophyll absorption spectral regions. Leaf reflectance spectra and photophysiological information were acquired using a Hand-Held ASD spectroradiometer, a portable fluorometer and a chlorophyll metre in-situ concurrently from leaf samples along a transect perpendicular to the lake shore of Central Europe\'s largest inland lake in terms of area, Lake Balaton in-Hungary. A strong correlation between narrowband spectraLindices and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters indicates the potential of hyperspectral remote sensing in assessing plant stability. Canopy hyperspectral data were collected from an airborne AISA Eagle sensor (400-1000 nm). An application of the findings from the field data analysis to airborne hyperspectral imagery reveals important information about reed condition-at the study area. Y(II) values, regarded as a proxy of photosystem activity, have been calculated from high R-2 combination of spectral ratio 612/516 representing Fs and 699/527 representing Fm\'. ETR values are estimated based on the calculated Y(II) and the spectral ratio 463/488 for Photosynthetically Active Radiation. This research underpins the development of methods for the spectral discrimination of reed patches affected by stress caused by environmental conditions, and subsequently the reed die-back syndrome. A comparison with empirical vegetation indices from the literature shows significantly higher R2 values of the proposed indices for the specific application. We recommend spectral indices at leaf level for evaluating reed ecological status based on spectroscopic data to support the identification of affected vegetation patches and present R2 maps that can aid the selection of indices tailored to specifications of remote sensors.

The use of in situ methods is impractical for monitoring lake water quality over large geographical areas, which is a fundamental requirement to understand the true role of lakes in the global carbon cycle. The coloured component of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), called CDOM, absorbs light strongly in the blue part of the visible spectrum and can be used as a proxy for mapping lake DOC with remote sensing. However, iron associated to organic matter can cause extra browning of waters. Consequently, the remote sensing signal we interpret as DOC may partially be attributed to the presence of iron associated to organic matter, potentially hampering our ability to estimate carbon concentrations.   A thorough analysis of biogeochemical parameters was carried out on Lake Malaren on August 23, 2010, and a MERIS full resolution image was acquired simultaneously. MERIS standard, Case 2 Regional, and Boreal processors were used to calculate remote sensing products, which were compared with different lake water characteristics.   The carbon to iron ratio was different from the rest of the lake in one of the basins. MERIS standard and Case 2 Regional processors were sensitive to this difference as the correlation between MERIS CDOM product and DOC was low (R-2 = 0.43) for all sampling stations and increased to 0.92 when the one basin was excluded. The Boreal Lakes processor results were less disturbed by the different carbon-iron ratios found in one basin and produced reasonably good results (R-2 = 0.65).   We found MERIS products (e.g. total absorption) that provided good correlation (R-2 = 0.80) with DOC-specific absorbance at 254 nm, called SUVA, which is a metric commonly used to assess drinking water treatability. However, none of the MERIS products were suitable for mapping the total organic carbon in Lake Malaren.MERIS total suspended matter product was a good (R-2 = 0.73) proxy for particulate iron, meaning that the particulate iron content in Malaren can be mapped from space.

In particular, the orbit error and stratified troposphere that were not well dealt with in the original StaMPS-SB method have been satisfactorily corrected by a novel phase ramp correction method. The deformation in four regions of the study area has been retrieved with a maximum of up to 70 mm/yr. In the Luojiayu-Sanyanyu valley, the slopes where the 2010 giant landslide occurred have been found to be quite unstable before the event. Deformation exceeding 30 mm/yr has been detected in the Suoertou slope, which is a well-known place for an ancient fault zone landslide. Fast movement larger than 40 mm/yr is observed in the Xieliupo slope, which poses threats of landslide dam and dammed lake to the Pal-lung River together with another slope deformation detected in the opposite slope. In the Nanshanqiaotou slope, the detected similar to 30 mm/yr deformation can be viewed as the prelude of the large landslide occurred in October 2010.

It covers about 41,000 ha of mangrove forest and is the largest single mangrove ecosystem in Peninsular Malaysia. A mosaic of L-band PALSAR fine beam dual (FBD) with 25 m pixel spacing data for the year 2010 was provided by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency\'s (JAXA) within the framework of the ALOS Kyoto and Carbon (K&C) Initiative. A total of 320 sampling plots that were collected in 2010 and 2011 were used in the study. The calculated plot-based AGB were correlated to the pixels/backscatter of PALSAR data. The best correlation function (i.e. from HV backscatter) was used to estimate and determine the aboveground biomass of the Matang Mangroves. The study found that the estimated AGE in Matang Mangroves ranged between 2.98 and 378.32 +/- 33.90 Mg ha(-1) with an average of 99.40 +/- 33.90 Mg ha(-1) and a total AGB of about 4.25 million Mg. The HV backscatter started to saturate at an AGB of 100 Mg ha(-1) and the errors associated with the estimation occurred largely when the AGB exceeded 150 Mg ha(-1). The study also found that the manipulation of polarisation was useful in discriminating succession levels of mangroves. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.', '[Hamdan, O.; Aziz, H.

Here, we used an alternative indicator, the burned fraction derived from spectral mixture analysis (SMA), to evaluate and compare the performance for assessing fire severity of broadband and narrowband imaging spectroscopy (IS) data in the visible to shortwave infrared (VSWIR, 035-2.5 mu m). We used the band specifications of the broadband Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the narrowband Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). We integrated two techniques to account for endmember variability in the unmixing process, spectral weighting and iterative unmixing, in a model referred to as weighted multiple endmember SMA (wMESMA). Based on a separability index, we evaluated the separability between the different ground components, or endmembers, that comprise post-fire environments (char, green vegetation (CV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) and substrate). We found that the near infrared region (0.7-1.3 mu m) had the highest discriminatory power, followed by the shortwave infrared 2 (SWIR2, 2-2.4 mu m), SWIR1 (1.5-1.7 mu m) and visible (0.35-0.7 mu m) regions. Individual narrowbands did not substantially outperform individual broadbands, however, the higher data dimensionality of IS resulted in significantly improved post-fire fractional cover and burned fraction estimates compared to multispectral data. Multispectral data captured a fair amount of the variability in fire severity conditions as represented by the different fractional cover estimates of the endmembers in both a multispectral narrow- and broadband scenario, however, fractional cover estimates derived from IS data using all viable bands were significantly better. This demonstrated the benefits of IS over traditional multispectral data to assess fire severity and also showed that the additional information gain was the result of higher data dimensionality and not because of certain narrowbands capturing narrow spectral features. In addition, we found that the burned fraction derived from all viable AVIRIS bands over a fire in California, USA, was highly correlated with two field measures of fire severity (Geo Composite Burn Index: R-2 = 0.86, and the percentage black trees and shrubs: R-2 = 0.65). Formal quantification of potential improvements of IS over multispectral methods is important with the advent of upcoming spaceborne IS missions (e.g. the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program and Hyperspectral Infrared Imager). Our analysis showed that IS data when combined with advanced analysis techniques significantly improved fire severity assessments. The improvements of using IS data require higher computational cost and advanced processing, thus multispectral data might still suit the needs of certain applications such as rapid fire damage assessments and global analysis of spatio-temporal fire severity patterns.

Reliable estimations of recent expansion of short-rotation plantation areas and associated land use changes are a prerequisite to assess their environmental impact on regional carbon and water cycles, and on climate. A binary classification methodology using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 16-day 250 m NDVI time series was developed and applied to classify Eucalyptus plantations across Brazil. The identification of Eucalyptus plantations specific patterns in the time series was based on the calculation of matching functions between the NDVI time series and a -2 years long reference time series. Among the seven tested matching functions, the bounding envelope was the most successful. This method was robust to residual noise on the NDVI time series, and a threshold coefficient for the binary classification was adjusted using an omission-commission criteria. With this method, it was possible to detect any presence of Eucalyptus between 2003 and 2009 at monthly time-steps, including the periods of bare soils between two rotations that are typically 6-7 years long. The dates of first afforestation, of clear-cut at the end of a rotation, and of re-planting at the beginning of a new rotation were retrieved from the NDVI time series with a precision of -66 days. The final almost continuous tri-dimensional map (space and time) was validated with three different datasets, from local to regional data. All three datasets gave similarly high global accuracy statistics, but a global underestimation of Eucalyptus areas compared to large scales census was observed. Discrepancies and way to improve the Eucalyptus area estimates were discussed in this study. The developed methodology could be applied to other short-rotation tree plantations.

The chemistry transport model captures a large fraction of the variability in NO2 columns at a synoptic timescale, although a seasonal signal in the bias between the modelled and retrieved column data remains. Using a simulation with constant emissions in time, trends were derived on the basis of the systematically changing bias between the modelled and retrieved columns. Significant negative trends of 5-6% a(-1) were found in highly industrialized areas across Western Europe. Strongest decreases in NO2 concentrations are observed over a region with many power plants in Northern Spain (10-20% a(-1)) and over the Po Valley (11% a(-1)). A source apportionment simulation was performed to evaluate the sensitivity of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) to NO emission sources across Europe, identifying the importance of changes in the energy sector in Northern Spain. A comparative study on in-situ NO2 measurements shows that annual reductions at the surface are of 2-3% a(-1). This trend increases from rural polluted sites to remote areas (-4.5% a(-1)). The observed variability with station type may be explained by the increase in primary NO2 emissions combined with the representativeness of the measurement sites. Comparing country average trends in NO2 columns with national NO emission totals shows that these are generally within a factor 2 of each other. A better agreement was found for western European countries than for eastern European countries. The method described here is a promising methodology to complement and evaluate trends in NO2 columns and indirectly emission strengths. A strong advantage is the fact that the methodology using satellite data is in principle consistent throughout the entire domain. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Curier, R.

To address this gap, we compared remote sensing methodologies using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery to extensive field measurements in a mixed northern hardwood forest. Five vegetation indices, five mathematical fits to model a continuous temporal response, and a suite of threshold estimates for \"start of spring/season\" (SOS) assessments were compared to field measurements of bud burst stage and hemispherical photo derived canopy structural metrics (transparency, leaf area index, greenness). Results indicated that a four-parameter logistic model based on at least five spring coverages of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and a SOS threshold of 0.3 was most closely related to field metrics and most accurate in predicting the date of full leaf out. Plot level SOS was predicted with a mean absolute error of 11 days for all species and elevation combinations, but improved to 9 days for hardwood dominated plots and 7 days for sugar maple dominated plots. Mean absolute error was improved to 8 days when forest type (mixed, conifer hardwood) was used to refine predictions. The consistency of prediction errors across forest types indicates that while overall accuracy across pixels may be low, inter-annual comparisons of changes in phenology on a pixel basis may provide accurate assessments of changes in phenology overtime. This was confirmed by application to seven years of independent phenology data predicted with 12 days of mean absolute error. However, image availability will be a limiting factor in areas of frequent cloud cover.

This study examined whether the phenological analysis of a range of dryland land cover classes would benefit from the availability of synthetic images at Landsat spatial resolution and MODIS time intervals. We assembled a series of 500 m MODIS and Landsat-5 TM datasets from April to November, 2005-2009, over a study site in central Arizona that encompasses diverse dryland vegetation classes along an elevation gradient of 2000 m. We applied the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) to each MODIS image to create a time series of synthetic images at 30 m resolution. We subjected a subset of the synthetic imagery to a pixel-based regression analysis with temporally coincident Landsat images to analyze the effect of the underlying vegetation class on the accuracy of the STARFM results. To evaluate the usefulness of the increased spatial resolution compared to a MODIS product, we analyzed the variability of the date of peak greenness values of all 30 m pixels within unmixed MODIS pixels. Finally, we examined differences in the temporal distributions of peak greenness extracted from both the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) synthetic imagery time series. Our results indicate that characteristics of the vegetation classes strongly influence STARFM algorithm performance, with Pearson correlation coefficient values ranging from 0.72 to 0.96 depending on the Landsat band and the land cover class. Responses in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum yielded the lowest correlations, particularly for the Ponderosa Pine class. The phenological variability exhibited by each land cover class was dependent on the precipitation patterns of each growing season, but was sufficiently high to make the application of STARFM imagery at this scale uniformly beneficial. The peak greenness dates extracted from EVI and NDVI time series were temporally synchronized for the Grassland class but diverged for the classes of mixed woody and herbaceous vegetation types.

Many classification techniques can be employed for this purpose. In order to make the best use of the large variety of statistical and machine learning classification methods, it is necessary to assess their performance differences and make recommendations for classifier selection and improvement. The objective of this paper is to compare different classification techniques for oil-spill detection in RADARSAT-1 imagery. The data of this study consists of 15 features of 192 oil spills and look-alikes identified by Canadian Ice Service between 2004 and 2008 off Canada\'s east and west coastal areas. The studied classifiers include the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), tree-based ensemble classifiers (bagging, bundling and boosting), Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and Penalized Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA). Two performance measures, the specificity at fixed sensitivity (80%) and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), were estimated using cross-validation to evaluate the performance of classifiers at a high sensitivity. Overall, the bundling technique which achieved a median specificity of 90.7%, at sensitivity of 80%, significantly outperformed the second best (i.e. bagging) by 1.5 percentage points, and the worst (i.e. ANN) by 15 percentage points. The median values of AUC measure indicated consistent results. Bundling and bagging achieved comparable median AUC values of about 92%, followed by GAM and PLDA, with ANN yielding the smallest. Most classifiers (SVM, bundling and especially PLDA and ANN) performed significantly better on datasets pre-processed by log-transformation and standardization than on the original dataset. These results demonstrate the importance and benefit of selecting the optimal classifiers for oil spill classification, and configuring the classifiers by proper feature construction techniques.

However, the scarcity of long-term field observations of vegetation in the Sahel prevents ground validation and deeper analysis of such trends. After assessing the consistency of the new GIMMS-3g NDVI product by comparison to three other AVHRR-NDVI datasets and MODIS NDVI, regional GIMMS-3g NDVI trends over 1981-2011 are analyzed. Trends are found positive and statistically significant almost everywhere in Sahel over the 1981-2011 period. Long-term field observations of the aboveground herbaceous layer mass have been collected within the Gourma region in Mali (1984-2011) and within the Fakara region in western Niger (1994-2011). These observations sample ecosystem and soil diversity, thus enabling estimation of averaged values representative of the Gourma and Fakara. NDVI measurements are found in good agreement with field observations, both over the Gourma and Fakara regions where re-greening and negative trends are observed respectively. A linear regression analysis performed between spatially averaged seasonal NDVI and a weighted average of field measurements explains 59% of the variability for the Gourma region over 1984-2011, and 38% for the Fakara region over 1994-2011. In the Gourma, which is a pastoral region, the re-greening trend is mainly observed over sandy soils, and attests for the ecosystem\'s resilience to the 1980s\' drought, able to react to the more favorable rainfall of the 1990s and 2000s. However, contrasted changes in the landscape\'s functioning have occurred locally. An increase in erosion and run-off processes in association with decreasing or stable vegetation cover was observed over shallow soils, which occupy 30% of the area. In the agro-pastoral Fakara, the decreasing trends observed both from satellite NDVI and field assessments of herbaceous mass are hardly explained by rainfall. These results give confidence in the dominant positive trends in Sahelian greenness, but indicate that degradation trends can also be observed, both in situ and from satellite time series.

Modeling this influence is complex. This is typically the case of the \"Earth-Atmosphere\" radiative coupling in the presence of Earth surfaces with spatially variable optical properties. In that case, it may be very difficult to couple Earth and cloud-free atmosphere radiative transfer models. This explains why an atmosphere module was input into the Earth radiative transfer (RT.) model DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) in order to simulate accurately satellite images of natural and urban Earth surfaces. This paper presents how DART simulates the atmosphere IT. in the short wave and thermal infrared domains. The atmosphere is divided into 3 zones: bottom atmosphere (BA), mid atmosphere (MA) and high atmosphere (HA). The 3D distribution is arbitrary in BA and horizontally constant with any vertical distribution in MA and HA. The \"Earth-Atmosphere\" R.T. is modeled in 5 stages. 1) Atmosphere R.T. (i.e., atmosphere thermal emission and/or sun radiation scattering). 2) Earth surface R.T. (i.e., Earth thermal emission and/or atmosphere and direct sun radiation scattering). 3) Atmosphere R.T. (i.e., Earth radiation scattering). 4) Earth surface RT. (i.e., scattering of downward atmosphere radiation). 5) Simulation of satellite reflectance and/or brightness temperature images. The approach takes into account the earth curvature and the atmosphere non-Beer law behavior in the presence of strongly varying spectral properties. It uses optimally located scattering points for improving atmosphere R.T. accuracy, and it reduces computer time through the use of pre-computed transfer functions that transfer radiation between the different atmosphere levels (BA, MA, HA). Moreover, it can simulate automatically an atmosphere geometry that optimizes the trade-off \"Computer time-Accuracy\" of simulations. The robustness and accuracy of the DART atmosphere modeling were successfully validated with theoretical cases and with the MODTRAN atmosphere RT. model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The WST of Urmia Lake in northwestern Iran was examined from 2007 to 2010, using MODIS land surface temperature (LST) products. Spatial and temporal (diurnal, monthly, seasonal and inter-annual) variations of Urmia Lake WST were also investigated. Results indicate that the MODIS-derived WSTs are in a good agreement with the in situ data (R-2 = 0.92 and bias = -0.27). Spatial analysis of WST revealed that there are three thermal zones along the lake: the shallow region in barriers of the causeway, islands and the shoreline; the south part; and the deep north parts. Using validated MODIS-derived WST, the annual temperature cycles of Urmia Lake were extracted and quadratic curves were fitted to empirically display the monthly lake-averaged variations of the lake WST. Then the effect of including the spatial distribution of WST on the lake evaporation was assessed. According to the results of the energy balance method, a 147 mm/year (515 million m(3)) discrepancy can be expected in the estimated evaporation rate when the spatial distribution in the lake WST is considered in the energy balance equation. Findings of this study confirm the application of MODIS LST products for surface temperature studies in a large hyper-saline lake. Moreover, use of the distributed satellite-derived WST in estimating evaporation from the lake was shown to improve the accuracy of water loss in the lake water budget calculation.

The albedo difference between snow-covered and snow-free tundra is high. Earlier studies have shown that taller and denser vegetation causes earlier snowmelt, and that shrub height and abundance, as well as the total biomass in summer reindeer pastures are lower than in winter pastures. Therefore, reindeer summer grazing could eventually delay the snowmelt and decrease the absorbed solar energy on the ground. The effect of reindeer summer grazing on the vegetation, snowmelt timing, surface albedo and ground heating is investigated in this study by comparing summer and non-summer pastures in the northern tundra areas of Fennoscandia. A comparison of vegetation types, NDVI, fractional snow cover and albedo between the Finnish year-round (including summer) pastures and the Norwegian non-summer (winter or spring/autumn) pastures is performed. Other factors influencing the snowmelt, such as surface air temperature, ground elevation and incoming solar radiation are taken into account. Information about the vegetation on the ground is based on a vegetation map compiled from Landsat TM/ETM + satellite data and ancillary map information. The NDVI, snowmelt and albedo analyses are performed using multi-temporal remote sensing data such as GlobSnow SE and MODIS based NDVI, snow and albedo products. The results here support previous studies and indicate that vegetation in the summer pastures is shorter and sparser and that snowmelt there occurs later than in the more densely vegetated, non-summer pastures. More shrubs protruding above the snowpack and earlier snowmelt on the Norwegian side lower the albedo during the snowmelt season. This causes higher solar energy absorption of up to 6 W/m(2) in the snowmelt season and contributes up to 0.5 W/m(2) to the yearly energy balance. Therefore this study suggests that summer reindeer herding can be used to delay snowmelt, increase surface albedo and to decrease the ground heating in the snowmelt season. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

However, leaf chlorophyll retrieval is complicated as canopy reflectance in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths is affected by confounding effects not only from leaf pigment concentration but also leaf area index (LAI), canopy architecture, illumination and viewing geometry and understory vegetation. Unlike empirical indices, which are often developed at leaf-level and can be species, site and time specific, a process modelling approach can account for the variation of other variables affecting canopy reflectance; therefore providing a more accurate estimate of chlorophyll content over multiple vegetation species, time-frames and across broader spatial extents. This study used a linked canopy (4-Scale) and leaf (PROSPECT) modelling approach to investigate the ability of radiative transfer models to estimate foliar chemistry for different vegetation types (broadleaf and needle leaf) from optical remote sensing data. Coniferous and deciduous sites were selected in Ontario, Canada, representing different dominant vegetation species, including black spruce (Picea mariana), sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), and a variety of canopy closures and structures. These sites were sampled over multiple time-frames to collect ground data including leaf area index, leaf reflectance spectra (400-2500 nm) and laboratory leaf chlorophyll content. Canopy reflectance data were acquired from the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI), Landsat 5 TM and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). The model results show that leaf chlorophyll content derived from satellite images demonstrates a good relationship with measured leaf chlorophyll content, with validation results of R-2 = 0.62; p<0.001 (MERIS) and R-2 = 0.65; p<0.001 (Landsat 5 TM), and a strong linearity with negligible systematic bias. CASI data gave a regression coefficient of R-2 = 0.41 (p<0.05) on a reduced dataset. This research provides theoretical and operational bases for the future retrieval of leaf chlorophyll content across different vegetation species, canopy structures and over broad spatial extents; crucial characteristics for inclusion in photosynthesis and carbon cycle models.

However, automated radiometer systems on jetties, ships of opportunity, and buoys as well as hand-held instruments are nowadays more frequently used as monitoring methods in their own right. One of the problems in interpreting the data collected during field measurements is removing sun and sky glint from the reflectance spectra. Current methods for removal of the surface effects have not been very successful. We developed a method where power functions are used to remove reflected component from measured reflectance spectra. Reflectance values in the 350-380 nm range are used to determine the slope of the power function and reflectance values in the 890-900 nm range are used to determine the absolute value of glint. We show that fitting a power function through these two spectral regions allows the removal of reflected light component from the measured reflectance spectra. Data from nearly 300 field sites in lakes and coastal waters as well as Hydrolight simulations were used to demonstrate the suitability of the method. The method performs well in optically deep and shallow waters as well as in variable illumination and wind conditions, does not require any auxiliary data besides the reflectance itself and is simple to apply even in the case of continuous data flow coming from field radiometers installed on buoys, research vessels or ships of opportunity.

In addition, techniques for estimating and compensating for misclassification and estimating uncertainty are often unfamiliar. Forest area for the state of Santa Catarina in southern Brazil was estimated from each of four satellite image-based land cover maps, and an independent estimate was obtained using observations of forest/non-forest for more than 1000 points assessed as part of the Santa Catarina Forest and Floristic Inventory. The latter data were also used as an accuracy assessment sample for evaluating the four maps. The map analyses consisted of identifying classification errors, constructing error matrices, calculating associated accuracy measures, estimating bias, and constructing 95% confidence intervals for proportion forest estimates using a model-assisted regression estimator. Overall accuracies for the maps ranged from 0.876 to 0.929. The standard errors of the estimates were all smaller than the standard error of the simple random sampling estimate by factors ranging from approximately1.23 to approximately 1.69. The model-assisted regression estimator lends itself to easy implementation for adjusting for estimated classification bias and for constructing confidence intervals.

Oil palm can also be a sustainable economic alternative if incentives for expansion outside forests are set in place. Consistent methods to monitor the time and location of oil palm expansion and the area converted from different land covers are essential for the success of such incentives. We developed methods to detect and quantify annual land cover changes associated with oil palm expansion in the Peruvian Amazon between 2001 and 2010 at two spatial scales and for two production modes. At the coarse scale, comprising the whole Peruvian Amazon, we used MODIS data to detect forest conversion to large-scale, industrial oil palm plantations based on metrics characterizing temporal changes in vegetation greenness associated with the conversion. At the fine scale, we used data from the satellite sensors Landsat TM/ETM + and ALOS-PALSAR to map and quantify the area from different land covers converted into large and small-scale oil palm plantations annually, in a focus area near the city of Pucallpa. Estimates were obtained from the elaboration and further combination of maps representing oil palm plantations by ages in 2010 and non-oil palm land covers in each year between 2001 and 2010. Validation data were obtained in the field and from geospatial information from previous studies. At the coarse scale, MODIS detected deforestation in 73% of training events larger than 50 ha. Detected events added up to 95% of the training areas. Total area converted to oil palm annually was quantified visually by using data from Landsat TM/ETM + with 96.3% accuracy. At the fine scale, the combination of data from Landsat TM/ETM + and ALOS-PALSAR identified oil palm expansion in areas larger than 5 ha with 94% accuracy and the year of expansion with an uncertainty of +/- 1.3 years. This work underscores the need for data from multiple satellite sensors for a comprehensive monitoring of oil palm expansion, considering needs for information not only on the area expanded but also the time of conversion and land cover transitions associated with large- and small-scale plantations.

The quantitative mineral maps were validated against field data, including similar to 5500 VNIR-SWIR spectra and similar to 300 portable X-ray fluorescence measurements. The error on these airborne mineral abundance estimates averages 13.4 wt.% Fe for the Fe-Ox abundance, 4.0 wt.% Al2O3 for the AlOH-clay abundance and 0.025 for the 2320D parameter used to quantify the carbonate abundance. The unmixed quantitative mineral abundance maps improve geological mapping, including characterisation and exploration for channel iron deposits (CID). In particular, some areas with out-cropping CID, which appear subeconomic from the airborne Fe-Ox abundance map without vegetation removal, show as potentially economic CID resources when the influence of vegetation cover is unmixed from the airborne hyperspectral data. These results show that seamless maps of mineral contents can be achieved using data collected from both proximal (drill core and field) and remote (airborne and satellite) hyperspectral sensing systems.

Light attenuation is traditionally quantified as the diffuse attenuation coefficient of the downwelling spectral irradiance at wavelength 490 nm (K-d490) or the photosynthetically available radiation (K-dPAR). Satellite observations provide global coverage of these parameters at high spatial and temporal resolution and several empirical and semi-analytical models are commonly used to derive K-d490 and K-dpAR maps from ocean colour satellite sensors. Most of these existing empirical or semi-analytical models have been calibrated in open ocean waters and perform well in these regions, but tend to underestimate the attenuation of light in coastal waters, where the backscattering caused by the suspended matters and the absorption by the dissolved organic matters increase light attenuation in the water column.   We investigate two relationships between K-dPAR and K-d490 for clear and turbid waters using MERIS reflectances and the spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient K-d(lambda) developed by Lee (2005). Satellite-derived fields of K-d490 and modelled K-dPAR are evaluated using coincident in-situ data collected over the world in both clear and turbid waters, and by using Ecolight simulations. Temporal means at 250 m resolution of K-dPAR and euphotic depth were computed over the period 2005-2009 for European coastal waters. These mean data were cross-tabulated with in-situ data of kelp (Laminaria hyperborea) and seagrass (Posidonia oceanica), respectively observed at locations on Atlantic and Mediterranean shores where the light is taken as the limiting factor to the depth distribution for these species. The minima observed for P. oceanica, in percent of energy, are very close to 1% of surface irradiance, the historical threshold known as euphoric depth as defined by Ryther (1956). Real estimates of the surface irradiance (Frouin, 1989) are used in conjunction with the estimated K-dPAR to calculate the residual energy at the lower limit of P. oceanica and L hyperborea in mol photons. m(-2) - day(-1) as a complement to the usual fraction of the surface energy. We show that the observed values, in terms of energy, for both species were equivalent to the values reported in the literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

NASA Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) measurements of CO2 concentrations in the mid-troposphere from 2002 to 2010 were examined in relation to precipitation and vegetation phenology across the US Great Plains. Wavelet multi-resolution analysis and the information theory metric of relative entropy were applied to assess regional relationships between mid-tropospheric CO2, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and precipitation (PPT). Results show that AIRS observations of mid-tropospheric CO2 exchange greater amounts of information with regional PPT and NDVI at seasonal, annual, and longer time scales compared to shorter time scales. PPT and NDVI contribute to mid-tropospheric CO2 at the 18-month time scale, while spatial patterns seen at this time scale for PIT and mid-tropospheric CO2 are reflective of the influence of PPT on NDVI at the annual scale. Identification of these dominant temporal scales may facilitate utilization of AIRS CO2 for monitoring regional source/sink dynamics related to climate and land-use/cover change.

Characterization of space-time variability of chlorophyll, a surrogate for plankton abundance, in the northern Bay of Bengal is an essential first step to develop any methodology for predicting cholera outbreaks in the Bengal Delta region using remote sensing. This study quantifies the space-time distribution of chlorophyll, using the data from SeaWiFS, in the Bay of Bengal region using 10 years of satellite data. Variability of chlorophyll at daily scale, irrespective of spatial averaging, resembles white noise. At a monthly scale, chlorophyll shows distinct seasonality and chlorophyll values are significantly higher close to the coast than in the offshore regions. At pixel level (9 km) on monthly scale, on the other hand, chlorophyll does not exhibit much persistence in time. With increased spatial averaging, temporal persistence of chlorophyll increases and lag 1 autocorrelation stabilizes around 0.60 for 1296 km(2) or larger areal averages. In contrast to the offshore regions, spatial analyses of chlorophyll suggest that only coastal region has a stable correlation length of 100 km. Presence (absence) of correlation length in the coastal (offshore) regions indicate that the two regions may have two separate processes controlling the production of phytoplankton. This study puts a lower limit on space-time averaging of satellite measured plankton at 1296 km(2) monthly scale to establish relationships with cholera incidence in Bengal Delta.

The recent free availability of Landsat data increases the need for robust and efficient atmospheric correction algorithms applicable to large volume Landsat data sets. This paper compares the accuracy of two Landsat atmospheric correction methods: a MODIS-based method and the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) method. Both methods are based on the 6SV radiative transfer code but have different atmospheric characterization approaches. The MODIS-based method uses the MODIS Terra derived dynamic aerosol type, aerosol optical thickness, and water vapor to atmospherically correct ETM+ acquisitions in each coincident orbit. The LEDAPS method uses aerosol characterizations derived independently from each Landsat acquisition and assumes a fixed continental aerosol type and uses ancillary water vapor. Validation results are presented comparing ETM+ atmospherically corrected data generated using these two methods with AERONET corrected ETM+ data for 95 10 km x 10 km 30 m subsets, a total of nearly 8 million 30 m pixels, located across the conterminous United States. The results indicate that the MODIS-based method has better accuracy than the LEDAPS method for the ETM+ red and longer wavelength bands. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The synoptic view provided by imaging remote sensors offers an alternative. But while many studies have developed procedures for assessing biodiversity using multi- and hyper-spectral imagery, they may only provide snapshots at particular months/seasons due to the seasonal variability of spectral characteristics induced by vegetated land surface phenologies. Thus, procedures for remotely assessing biodiversity patterns may not fully represent the biodiversity on the ground if vegetated land surface phenologies are not considered. Using Mantel tests, ordinarily least square regression models and spatial autoregressive models, we assessed the relationship between floristic diversity and vegetated land surface phenologies, as captured by time series of vegetation indices derived from data acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The relationship was calibrated with data from temperate montane forests of the Qinling Mountains region, Shaanxi Province, China. Our results show that floristically similar areas also exhibit a comparable similarity in phenological characteristics. However, phenological similarity obtained using the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI), a spectral vegetation index found to be not only sensitive to changes in chlorophyll content but also linearly related with the relative content of foliar anthocyanins, exhibited the strongest relationship with floristic similarity. Therefore, analysis of the temporal dynamics of pigments through the use of satellite-derived metrics, such as VARI, may be used for evaluating the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of species composition across broad geographic regions.

The short-scale roughness variations in the presence of mineral oils slicks are consistently extracted and compared to variations associated with the biogenic slicks. In doing so, the wind speed dependency on the roughness anomalies is also considered.

The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) is unique among such sensors in that it provides relatively high spectral (15 bands) and spatial (similar to 300 m resolution) sampling within visible and near infrared wavelengths. A recent evaluation of four operational MERIS LAI algorithms found that they did not consistently meet accuracy targets typical of operational requirements. One explanation for the mixed performance of these algorithms may be that they do not suitably exploit the enhanced spectral sampling of MERIS. We exploit this enhanced spectral sampling to estimate several (80) narrow-band vegetation indices (Vls) by interpolating MERIS surface reflectance. The interpolation accuracy was evaluated using Hyperion imagery. Regressions were then calibrated between estimated Vls and in-situ LAI over a range of land cover types. The strongest performance (root mean squared error < 0.92 and relative root mean squared error < 038) was observed for two selected Vls (the NDVI8 and the CTR) based on both training and validation data. This study demonstrates that MERIS has the information content to meet typical operational performance specifications for LAI retrieval within the 1 unit error margin for the given atmospheric, environmental, soil and plant cover conditions on the day of the overpass and using locally derived relationships. Therefore the development of robust algorithms for retrieving LAI using these Vls is recommended. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

We developed an approach to map canopy defoliation due to gypsy moth based on site differences in Landsat vegetation index values between non-defoliation and defoliation dates. Using field data from two study areas in the U.S. central Appalachians and five different years (2000, 2001, 2006, 2007, and 2008), we fit a sigmoidal model predicting defoliation as a function of the difference in the vegetation index. We found that the normalized difference infrared index (NDII, [Band 4 Band 5]/[Band 4 + Band 51) and the moisture stress index (Band 5/Band 4) worked better than visible-near infrared indices such as NDVI for mapping defoliation. We report a global 2-term fixed-effects model using all years that was at least as good as a mixed-effects model that varied the model coefficients by year. The final model was: proportion of foliage retained =1/(1 + exp(3.057 - 31.483. [NDIIbase year -NDIIdisturbance year]). Cross-validation by dropping each year of data and subsequently refitting the remaining data generated an RMS error estimate of 14.9% defoliation, a mean absolute error of 10.8% and a cross-validation R-2 of 0.805. The results show that a robust, general model of percent defoliation can be developed to make continuous rather than categorical maps of defoliation across years and study sites based on field data collected using different sampling methods.

Part of the motivation to control Tamarix is to salvage water for human use. Information is needed on the impact of beetles on Tamarix seasonal leaf production and subsequent water use over wide areas and multiple cycles of annual defoliation. Here we combine ground data with high resolution phenocam imagery and moderate resolution (Landsat) and coarser resolution (MODIS) satellite imagery to test the effects of beetles on Tamarix evapotranspiration (ET) and leaf phenology at sites on six western rivers. Satellite imagery covered the period 2000 to 2011) which encompassed years before and after beetle release at each study site. Phenocam images showed that beetles reduced green leaf cover of individual canopies by about 30% during a 6-8 week period in summer, but plants produced new leaves after beetles became dormant in August, and over three years no net reduction in peak summer leaf production was noted. ET was estimated by vegetation index methods, and both Landsat and MODIS analyses showed that beetles reduced ET markedly in the first year of defoliation, but ET recovered in subsequent years. Over all six sites, ET decreased by 14% to 15% by Landsat and MODIS estimates, respectively. However, results were variable among sites, ranging from no apparent effect on ET to substantial reduction in ET. Baseline ET rates before defoliation were low, 394 mm yr(-1) by Landsat and 314 mm yr(-1) by MODIS estimates (20-25% of potential ET), further constraining the amount of water that could be salvaged. Beetle-Tamarix interactions are in their early stage of development on this continent and it is too soon to predict the eventual extent to which Tamarix populations will be reduced. The utility of remote sensing methods for monitoring defoliation was constrained by the small area covered by each phenocam image, the low temporal resolution of Landsat, and the low spatial resolution of MODIS imagery. Even combined image sets did not adequately reveal the details of the defoliation process, and remote sensing data should be combined with ground observations to develop operational monitoring protocols.

The commonly used approaches such as persistent scatterer InSAR (PSInSAR) and small baseline subset (SBAS) algorithms need to resolve the phase ambiguities in interferogram stacks either by searching a predefined solution space or by sparse phase unwrapping methods; however the efficiency and the success of phase unwrapping cannot be guaranteed. We present here an alternative approach - temporarily coherent point (TCP) InSAR (TCPInSAR) - to estimate the long term deformation rate without the need of phase unwrapping. The proposed approach has a series of innovations including TCP identification. TCP network and TCP least squares estimator. We apply the proposed method to the Los Angeles Basin in southern California where structurally active faults are believed capable of generating damaging earthquakes. The analysis is based on 55 interferograrns from 32 ERS-1/2 images acquired during Oct. 1995 and Dec. 2000. To evaluate the performance of TCPInSAR on a small set of observations, a test with half of interferometric pairs is also performed. The retrieved TCPInSAR measurements have been validated by a comparison with GPS observations from Southern California Integrated GPS Network Our result presents a similar deformation pattern as shown in past InSAR studies but with a smaller average standard deviation (4.6 mm) compared with GPS observations, indicating that TCPInSAR is a promising alternative for efficiently mapping ground deformation even from a relatively smaller set of interferograms.

Therefore the inverse Planck equation is under-determined, with two unknowns and a single measurement. Practical inversion algorithms designed to calculate temperature and emissivity from the measurements cannot do a perfect job of separation, and recovered temperature and emissivity may co-vary. For ASTER images, validation studies of recovered temperature and emissivity, regarded individually, have shown that they are within the precision and accuracy limits predicted in designing the ASTER TES algorithm used to calculate the standard products AST05 and AST08. Nevertheless, a closer look at emissivity recovered for water targets shows that emissivity appears to vary, incorrectly, as a function of temperature. One cause of this is electronic striping; another is incomplete characterization of atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles used in compensation for atmospheric absorption and path radiance. The linkage varies from band to band, with the greatest emissivity effect of 0.0003 K(-1) for ASTER band 12 (9.1 mu m) relative to band 13 (10.6 mu m). Although this inaccuracy in emissivity is small, it can approach or exceed the inaccuracy prediction of +/- 0.015 for the standard product when the entire gamut of terrestrial water and land temperatures is examined. Therefore, spatial filtering and upgrading the atmosphere compensation algorithm to use watervapor scaling should be considered in making AST05 and AST08. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This study investigates the performance of near infrared-red models for the remote estimation of chlorophyll-a concentrations in turbid productive waters and evaluates several near infrared-red models developed within the last 34 years. Three models were calibrated for a dataset with chlorophyll-a concentrations from 0 to 100 mg m(-3) and validated for independent and statistically different datasets with chlorophyll-a concentrations from 0 to 100 mg m(-3) and 0 to 25 mg m(-3) for the spectral bands of the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS). The MERIS two-band model estimated chlorophyll-a concentrations slightly more accurately than the more complex models, with mean absolute errors of 2.3 mg m(-3) for chlorophyll-a concentrations from 0 to 100 mg m(-3) and 1.2 mg m(-3) for chlorophyll-a concentrations from 0 to 25 mg m(-3). Comparable results from several near infrared-red models with different levels of complexity, calibrated for inland and coastal waters around the world, indicate a high potential for the development of a simple universally applicable near infrared-red algorithm.

Here, we investigate potential causes of intra-annual variability by comparing EVI from mature forest with field-measured Leaf Area Index (LAI) to validate space-based observations. EVI was calculated from 19 nadir and off-nadir Hyperion images in the 2005 dry season, and inspected for consistency with MODIS observations from 2004 to 2009. The objective was to evaluate the possible influence of the view-illumination geometry and of canopy foliage and leaf flush on the EVI. Spectral mixture models were used to evaluate the relationship between EVI and the shade fraction, a measure that varies with pixel brightness. MODIS LAI values were compared with LAI estimated using hemispherical photographs taken in two field campaigns in the dry season. To keep LAI and leaf flush conditions as constant variables and vary solar illumination, we used airborne Hyperspectral Mapper (Hymap) data acquired over mature forest from another region on the same day but with two distinct solar zenith angles (SZA) (29 degrees and 53 degrees). Results showed that intra-annual variability in MODIS and nadir Hyperion EVI in the dry season of tropical forest were driven by solar illumination effects rather than changes in LAI. The reflectance of the MODIS and Hyperion blue, red and near infrared (NIR) bands was higher at the end of the dry season because of the predominance of sunlit canopy components for the sensors due to decreasing SZA from June (44 degrees) to September (26 degrees). Because EVI was highly correlated with the reflectance of the NIR band used to generate it (r of + 0.98 for MOD1S and + 0.88 for Hyperion), this vegetation index followed the general NIR pattern, increasing with smaller SZA towards the end of the dry season. Hyperion EVI was inversely correlated with the shade fraction (r = -0.93). Changes in canopy foliage detected from MODIS LAI data were not consistent with LAI estimates from hemispherical photographs. Although further research is necessary to measure the impact of leaf flush on intra-annual EVI variability in the Querencia region, analysis of Hymap data with fixed LAI and leaf flush conditions confirmed the influence of the illumination effects on the EV1.

Disturbance processes in desert spring ecosystems are likely important but have not been well studied. Documentation of historic wildfires in these often remote areas has been inconsistent and proxy records are often not available. Remote sensing methods have been used in other environments to gain information about fires that have occurred over recent decades, but these methods have not been tested in desert spring environments. The differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) is the most commonly used method for delineating fire perimeters and burn severity mosaics, although another method, differenced linear spectral unmixing (dSmA), may produce more accurate results in heterogeneous desert spring ecosystems due to its ability to detect changes at the sub-pixel scale. This study compared dNBR and dSMA using field observations of burn presence and fire severity for two recent wildfires. The dNBR method outperformed dSMA, but required some post-processing manipulation to reduce errors of commission. The dNBR classification correctly indentified burned areas with 86% accuracy (3% omission error, 19% commission error) and classified fire severity with 76% accuracy. Misclassification errors were most common in dune and mesquite bosque/meadow land cover types (mean misclassification rate = 36%). Nine of the fifteen wildfires reported to have occurred in the study site were successfully identified, with five of the unidentified fires having reported sizes of less than one hectare. Additional refinement of remote sensing methods is necessary to better distinguish small (<5 ha) burned areas from areas of change resulting from soil moisture fluctuation and other short-term shifts in background conditions.

Validation is performed separately for different conditions: clear-sky and cloudy-sky, daytime and nighttime for four seasons. Differences between the FLASHFlux CERES shortwave radiation flux and surface measurements have larger standard deviations in cloudy-sky conditions than in clear-sky conditions, indicating that cloud contamination increases uncertainty in the retrieval algorithm. Upward shortwave radiation flux (USW) is overestimated in cloudy conditions suggesting that the cloud parameters and surface scene type in the retrieval process are not optimal for northwestern China. The CERES downward longwave radiation fluxes (DLW) accurately follow the variation of surface measurements during daytime, but are slightly underestimated during nighttime due to the coarse sounding profile and undetected low clouds at nighttime. The CERES upwelling longwave radiation fluxes (ULW) are strongly underestimated during daytime but are slightly underestimated during nighttime regardless of cloud coverage. This large bias could be caused by an underestimate of surface skin temperature and/or surface emissivity, or spatial inhomogeneity around the site. Generally, except for diurnal ULW, other components of the surface radiative fluxes obtained from CERES SSF datasets are close to meeting the accuracy requirements for climate research.

The freely available Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover images, with 500 m spatial and daily temporal resolution, can provide a basis for regional snow cover mapping, monitoring and hydrological modelling. However, high cloud obscuration remains the main limitation. In this study, we propose a five successive step approach combining data from the Terra and Aqua satellites; adjacent temporal deduction; spatial filtering based on orthogonal neighbouring pixels; spatial filtering based on a zonal snowline approach; and temporal filtering based on zonal snow cycle to remove cloud obscuration from MODIS daily snow products. This study also examines the spatial and temporal variability of snow cover in the THR of Nepal in\' the last decade. Since no ground stations measuring snow data are available in the region, the performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated by comparing the original MODIS snow cover data with least cloud cover against cloud-generated MODIS snow cover data, filled by clouds of another densely cloud-covered product. The analysis indicates that the proposed five-step method is efficient in cloud reduction (with average accuracy of >91%). The results show very high interannual and intra-seasonal variability of average snow cover, maximum snow extent and snow cover duration over the last decade. The peak snow period has been delayed by about 6.7 days per year and the main agropastoral production areas of the region were found to experience a significant decline in snow cover duration during the last decade.

The SLC failure has seriously limited the scientific applications of ETM+ data. While there have been a number of methods developed to fill in the data gaps, each method has shortcomings, especially for heterogeneous landscapes. Based on the assumption that the same-class neighboring pixels around the un-scanned pixels have similar spectral characteristics, and that these neighboring and un-scanned pixels exhibit similar patterns of spectral differences between dates, we developed a simple and effective method to interpolate the values of the pixels within the gaps. We refer to this method as the Neighborhood Similar Pixel Interpolator (NSPI). Simulated and actual SIC-off ETM+ images were used to assess the performance of the NSPI. Results indicate that NSPI can restore the value of un-scanned pixels very accurately, and that it works especially well in heterogeneous regions. In addition, it can work well even if there is a relatively long time interval or significant spectral changes between the input and target image. The filled images appear reasonably spatially continuous without obvious striping patterns. Supervised classification using the maximum likelihood algorithm was done on both gap-filled simulated SIC-off data and the original \"gap free\" data set, and it was found that classification results, including accuracies, were very comparable. This indicates that gap-filled products generated by NSPI will have relevance to the user community for various land cover applications. In addition, the simple principle and high computational efficiency of NSPI will enable processing large volumes of SIC-off ETM+ data.

OPTINC was evaluated using two sites with different remote sensing data: a residential area in Denver, CO with high-spatial resolution QuickBird image and LiDAR data, and a suburban area in Monticello, UT with HyMap hyperspectral imagery. A decision tree, a multilayer feed-forward back-propagation neural network, and aiNet were also tested for comparison. Classification accuracy, local homogeneity of classified images, and model sensitivity to training sample size were examined. OPTINC outperformed the other models with higher accuracy and more spatially cohesive land cover classes with limited salt-and-pepper noise. OPTINC was relatively less sensitive to training sample size than the neural network, followed by the decision tree. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

LiDAR-derived height profiles were also generated in 1-m layers, and regressed on CBD estimates calculated for 1-m layers from field plots to predict three-dimensional canopy fuel loading. We then produced maps of canopy fuel metrics for three 9 km(2) forested areas in the Pinelands.   Correlations for standard LiDAR-derived parameters between the two LiDAR systems were all highly significant, with correlation coefficients ranging between 0.82 and 0.98. Stepwise linear regression models developed from the profiling LiDAR data predicted maximum CBD and CFW (r(2) = 0.94 and 0.92) better than those developed from the scanning LiDAR data (r(2) = 0.83 and 0.71, respectively). A single regression for the prediction of CBD at all canopy layers had r(2) values of 0.93 and 0.82 for the profiling and scanning datasets, respectively. Individual bin regressions for predicting CBD at each canopy height layer were also highly significant at most canopy heights, with r(2) values for each layer ranging between 0.36 and 0.89, and 0.44 and 0.99 for the profiling and scanning datasets, respectively. Relationships were poorest mid-canopy, where highest average values and highest variability in fuel loading occurred. Fit of data to Gaussian distributions of canopy height profiles facilitated a simpler expression of these parameters for analysis and mapping purposes, with overall r2 values of 0.86 and 0.92 for the profiling and scanning LiDAR datasets, respectively. Our research demonstrates that LiDAR data can be used to generate accurate, three-dimensional representations of canopy structure and fuel loading at high spatial resolution by linking 1-m return height profiles to biometric estimates from field plots.

Zipf\'s Law states that the exponent of the power law for rank-size distributions of cities is near -1. Verification of power law scaling for city size distributions at continental and global scales is complicated by small sample sizes, inappropriate estimation techniques, inconsistent definitions of urban extent and variations in the accuracy and spatial resolution of census administrative units. We attempt to circumvent some of these complications by using a continuous spatial proxy for anthropogenic development and treat it as a spatial complement to population distribution. We quantify the linearity and exponent of the rank-size distribution of spatially contiguous patches of stable night light over a range of brightnesses corresponding to different intensities of development. Temporally stable night lights, as measured by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Line Scanner (DMSP-OLS), provide a unique proxy for anthropogenic development. Brightness and spatial extent of emitted light are correlated to population density (Sutton et al., 2001), built area density (Elvidge et al., 2007c) and economic activity (Doll et al., 2006; Henderson et al., 2009) at global scales and within specific countries. Using a variable brightness threshold to derive spatial extent of developed land area eliminates the complication of administrative definitions of urban extent and makes it possible to test Zipf\'s Law in the spatial dimension for a wide range of anthropogenic development. Higher brightness thresholds generally correspond to more intense development while lower thresholds extend the lighted area to include smaller settlements and less intensively developed pen-urban and agricultural areas. Using both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to estimate power law linearity and exponent of the resulting rank-size distributions across a range of upper tail cutoffs, we consistently find statistically significant exponents in the range -0.95 to -1.11 with an abrupt transition to very large, extensively connected, spatial networks of development near the low light detection limit of the sensor. This range of exponents and transition are observed at both continental and global scales. The results suggest that Zipf\'s Law also holds for spatial extent of anthropogenic development across a range of intensities at both continental and global scales. The implication is that the dynamics of urban growth and development may be represented as spatial phase transitions when the spatial extent and intensity of development are treated as continuous variables rather than discrete entities.

Microwave emission models have been used to simulate brightness temperatures (Tbs) for snowpack characteristics in terrestrial environments but cannot be applied to snow on lakes because of the differing subsurface emissivities and scattering matrices present in ice. This paper examines the performance of a modified version of the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) snow emission model that incorporates microwave emission from lake ice and sub-ice water. Inputs to the HUT model include measurements collected over brackish and freshwater lakes north of Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada in April 2008, consisting of snowpack (depth, density, and snow water equivalent) and lake ice (thickness and ice type). Coincident airborne radiometer measurements at a resolution of 80 x 100 m were used as ground-truth to evaluate the simulations.   The results indicate that subsurface media are simulated best when utilizing a modeled effective grain size and a 1 mm RMS surface roughness at the ice/water interface compared to using measured grain size and a flat Fresnel reflective surface as input. Simulations at 37 GHz (vertical polarization) produce the best results compared to airborne Tbs, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 6.2 K and 7.9 K, as well as Mean Bias Errors (MBEs) of -8.4 K and -8.8 K for brackish and freshwater sites respectively. Freshwater simulations at 6.9 and 19 GHz H exhibited low RMSE (10.53 and 6.15 K respectively) and MBE (-5.37 and 8.36 K respectively) but did not accurately simulate Tb variability (R= -0.15 and 0.01 respectively). Over brackish water, 6.9 GHz simulations had poor agreement with airborne Tbs, while 19 GHz V exhibited a low RMSE (6.15 K), MBE (-4.52 K) and improved relative agreement to airborne measurements (R= 0.47). Salinity considerations reduced 6.9 GHz errors substantially, with a drop in RMSE from 51.48 K and 57.18 K for H and V polarizations respectively, to 26.2 K and 31.6 K, although Tb variability was not well simulated. With best results at 37 GHz, HUT simulations exhibit the potential to track Tb evolution, and therefore SWE through the winter season. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Data to estimate biomass were collected from 59 sites located in fire-disturbed black spruce forests in interior Alaska. PALSAR L-band data (HH and HV polarizations) collected on two dates in the summer/fall of 2007 and one date in the summer of 2009 were used. Significant linear correlations were found between the log of aboveground biomass (range of 0.02 to 22.2 t ha(-1)) and sigma degrees (L-HH) and sigma degrees (L-HV) for the data collected on each of the three dates, with the highest correlation found using the L-HV data collected when soil moisture was highest. Soil moisture, however, did change the correlations between L-band sigma degrees and aboveground biomass, and the analyses suggest that the influence of soil moisture is biomass dependent. The results indicate that to use L-band SAR data for mapping aboveground biomass and monitoring forest regrowth will require development of approaches to account for the influence that variations in soil moisture have on L-band microwave backscatter, which can be particularly strong when low levels of aboveground biomass occur.

Quantifying the relationship between satellite-derived vegetation metrics and hydrological response to precipitation (P) has the potential to facilitate prediction of HRVs for ungauged watersheds, and/or aid in the assessment of watershed similarity as an initial phase of hydrological regionalization. The utility of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data to estimate HRVs of watersheds at the regional scale (southern and central California) is tested in this study. An exhaustive statistical regression analysis was conducted to quantify the relationships between MODIS vegetation metrics and HRVs using both ordinary least squares and spatially varying parameter models. Additionally a confirmatory analysis was conducted to test the effect precipitation and potential evaporation have on the exploratory regression results. Results from both the exploratory and confirmatory analyses suggest that (1) while there are limitations in the water balance approach to estimating ET (errors associated with changes in storage and meteorological data are unknown), moderate statistical relationships exist between MODIS vegetation metrics and HRVs; (2) these relationships are heavily influenced by vegetation-precipitation relationships and general precipitation magnitudes; (3) relationships between MODIS metrics and precipitation/HRVs are strongest when drought conditions prevail; and (4) LAI has the strongest relationship with precipitation and HRVs compared to other MODIS vegetation metrics.

Coffee species (Coffee arabica, C canephora and C liberica) were introduced from Africa in the late 19th century, they survived in the wild and spontaneously cross-hybridized. Coffee species were originally planted in native forest in association with leguminous trees (mostly introduced species) to improve their growth. Thus the canopy cover over rustic shade coffee plantations is heterogeneous with a majority of large crowns, attributed to leguminous trees. The aim of this study was to identify suitable areas for coffee inter-specific hybridization in New Caledonia using field based environmental parameters and remotely sensed predictors. Due to the complex structure of tropical vegetation, remote sensing imagery needs to be spatially accurate and to have the appropriate bands for monitoring vegetation cover. Quickbird panchromatic (black and white) imagery at 0.6 to 0.7 m spatial resolutions and multispectral imagery at 2.4 m spatial resolution were pansharpened and used for this study. The two most suitable remotely sensed indicators, canopy heterogeneity and tree crown size, were acquired by the sequential use of tree crown detection (neural network), image processing (such as textural analysis) and classification. All models were supervised and trained on learning data determined by human expertise. The final model has two remotely sensed indicators and three physical parameters based on the Digital Elevation Model: elevation, slope and water flow accumulation. Using these five predictive variables as inputs, two modelling methods, a decision tree and a neural network, were implemented. The decision tree, which showed 96.9% accuracy on the test set, revealed the involvement of ecological parameters in the hybridization of Coffea species. We showed that hybrid zones could be characterized by combinations of modalities, underlining the complexity of the environment concerned. For instance, forest heterogeneity and large crown size, steep slopes (>53.5%) and elevation between 194 and 429 m asl, are favourable factors for Coffea inter-specific hybridization. The application of the neural network on the whole area gave a predictive map that distinguished the most suitable areas by means of a nonlinear continuous indicator. The map provides a confidence level for each area. The most favourable areas were geographically localized, providing a clue for the detection and conservation of favourable areas for Coffea species neo-diversity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The use of time series residual of the NDVI/precipitation linear regression to normalize the precipitation effect on vegetation productivity and identify the long term degradation was extended at the local scale. A weighted grazing pressure surface model was developed combining information from satellite images, topography, forage availability and detailed field work data on points of livestock concentration, herders\' ranking of forage quality and grazing pattern in each pasture unit. The grazing pressure of a given site was defined as the product of annual net stocking density and the inverse of the total friction of livestock movement. While annual precipitation was found as the dominant factor for the interannual vegetation variability, degradation in Upper Mustang was the result of grazing induced change and some localized natural processes.

P-J vegetation is spatially extensive, thus large-scale mortality events such as the one that has occurred over the past several years could significantly alter regional carbon (C) budgets. Our objective was to use a remote sensing technique coupled with field-based data to estimate changes in aboveground live C stocks across a 4100 km(2) region of Colorado caused by P-J tree mortality. We hypothesized that dieback would amplify the phenological dynamics of P-J vegetation, and these variations would be related to drought-induced losses of live P-J aboveground biomass (AGB) that are discernible using time-series remote sensing vegetation data. Here, we assess live P-J AGB loss using dry season fractional photosynthetic vegetation cover (PV) derived from multi-year Landsat images. Our results showed a strong linear positive relationship between the maximum decline in PV and field-measured losses of live P-J AGB during the period 2000-05 (r(2) = 0.64, p = 0.002). These results were then used to map AGB losses throughout the study region. Mean live aboveground C loss (+/- sd) was 10.0 (+/- 3.4) Mg C ha(-1). Total aboveground live P-J C loss was 4.6 Tg C. which was approximately 39 times higher than the concurrent C loss attributed to wildfire and management treatments within or near to the national forests of the study region. Our results suggest that spatially extensive mortality events such as the one observed in P-J woodlands across the western US in the past decade may significantly alter the ecosystem C balance for decades to come. Remote sensing techniques to monitor changes in aboveground C stocks, such as the one developed in our study, may support regional and global C monitoring in the future. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In recent decades its hydrodynamic characteristics have undergone important changes that have had consequences on the lake\'s primary productivity. The establishment of a long-term Ocean Color dataset for Lake Tanganyika is a fundamental tool for understanding and monitoring these changes. We developed an approach to create a regionally calibrated dataset of chlorophyll-a concentrations (CHL) and attenuation coefficients at 490 nm (K490) for the period from July 2002 to December 2006 using daily calibrated radiances retrieved from the MODIS-Aqua sensor. Standard MODIS Aqua Ocean Color products were found to not provide a suitable calibration for high altitude lakes such as the Lake Tanganyika. An optimization of the extraction process and the validation of the dataset were performed with independent sets of in situ measurements. Our results show that for the geographical, atmospheric and optical conditions of Lake Tanganyika: (i) a coastal aerosol model set with high relative humidity (90%) provides a suitable atmospheric correction; (ii) a significant correlation between in situ data and CHL estimates using the MODIS specific OC3 algorithm is possible; and (iii) K490 estimates provide a good level of significance. The resulting validated time series of bio-optical properties provides a fundamental information base for the study of phytoplankton and primary production dynamics and interannual trends. A comparison between surface chlorophyll-a concentrations estimated from field monitoring and from the MODIS based dataset shows that remote sensing allows improved detection of surface blooms in Lake Tanganyika.

This paper presents a novel approach that addresses this issue by combining time series of satellite images with information from crop growth modeling and expert knowledge. In a fuzzy framework, a decision support system that combines multi-source information was designed to automatically detect the sugarcane harvest at field scale. The formalism that we used deals with the imprecision of the data and the approximation of expert reasoning. System performances were analyzed using a time series of SPOT-5 images. Results obtained were in substantial agreement with ground truth data: overall accuracy reached 97.80% with stability values exceeding 89.21% for all decisions. The contribution of fuzzy sets to overall accuracy reached 15.08%. The approach outlined in this paper is very promising and could be very useful for other agricultural applications.

Over the past century, outbreaks of the Eastern spruce budworm have become more frequent and severe. The notion of designing a more pest resistant landscape through prescriptive management practices hinges on our ability to effectively model forest-insect dynamics at regional scales. Increasingly, more detailed pixel-wise estimates of forest biophysical parameters are needed for such endeavors. Lidar technology, although promising, is not yet viable for repeated regional accounting, necessitating the development of methods which take advantage of existing spaceborne assets. Our objective is to use one of these assets (SPOT-5) to estimate a large set of forest structural attributes at a finer spatial grain size (5 m and 10 m) over a broader area than is currently available for the purpose of supplying needed input data for disturbance simulation modeling. We employ neighborhood statistics (standard deviation, variance, sill variance, and ratios of these metrics at 5 and 10 m) calculated from SPOT-5 sensor data and derivatives to estimate and map tree canopy diameter (CDIA), bole diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height (HT), crown closure (CC), vertical length of live crown (LC), and basal area (BA). A partial least squares (PLS) regression approach was used with these local statistics and field data to produce models for pixel-wise estimation and mapping of mean values, respectively, for hardwood and coniferous forest CDIA (R-2 = 0.82 and 0.93, RMSE 0.62 and 0.47 m), DBH (R-2 = 0.82 and 0.90, RMSE 2.92 and 3.75 cm), HT (R-2 = 0.69 and 0.92, RMSE 1.27 and 1.59 m), CC (R-2 = 0.52 and 0.68, RMSE 5.49 and 6.02%), LC (R-2 = 0.58 and 0.81, RMSE 0.96 and 1.25 m), and BA (R-2 = 0.71 and 0.74, RMSE 2.47 and 4.58 m(2) ha(-1)) for a 3600 km(2) area in northeast Minnesota. This approach for quantifying forest structure is robust in the sense that a detailed forest cover type map is not required to stratify analysis at any step in the process. Hence, we show that multi-resolution SPOT-5 data are a practical alternative to lidar for regional characterization of forest biophysical parameters. However, lidar data may potentially be used to calibrate these SPOT-based structure models in the future. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The sensitivity of different radar parameters (wavelength, incidence angles, and polarization) to sugarcane growth stages was analyzed to determine the most suitable radar configuration for better characterisation of sugarcane fields and in particular the monitoring of sugarcane harvest. Correlation between backscattered signals and crop height was also carried out. Radar signal increased quickly with sugarcane height until a threshold height, which depended on radar wavelength and incidence angle. Beyond this threshold, the signal increased only slightly, remained constant, or even decreased. The threshold height is higher with longer wavelengths (L-band in comparison with C- and X-bands) and higher incidence angles (similar to 40 degrees in comparison with similar to 20 degrees).   The radar backscattering coefficients (sigma degrees) were also compared to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from SPOT-4/5 images. Results showed a high correlation between the behaviors of sigma degrees and NDVI as a function of sugarcane crop parameters. A decrease in NDVI for fully mature sugarcane fields due to drying of the sugarcane (water stress) was also observed in the radar signal. This decrease in radar signal was of the same order as the decrease in radar signal after the sugarcane harvest. In general, it is more suitable to monitor the sugarcane harvest using high incidence angles regardless of the radar wavelength. SAR data in L- and C-bands showed an ambiguity between the signals of ploughed fields and those of fields in vegetation because of the high sensitivity of the radar signal at these wavelengths to surface roughness of bare soils. Indeed, sometimes the radar signal of ploughed fields was of the same order as that of harvested or mature sugarcane fields. Results showed better discrimination between ploughed fields and sugarcane fields in vegetation (sugarcane canopy) when using TerraSAR-X data (X-band).   Concerning the influence of radar polarization, results showed that the co-polarizations channels (HH and VV) were well correlated, but had slightly less potential than cross-polarization channels (HV and VH) for the detection of the sugarcane harvest Finally, SAR data at high spatial resolution were shown to be useful and necessary for better analysis of SAR images when the fields were of small size.

Results indicated that sigma degrees from QuikSCAT can be used to detect melt onset, water clear of ice and freeze onset dates on both lakes. An ice phenology algorithm was then developed to assess the spatiotemporal variability on both lakes from QuikSCAT for the period 2000-2006. Results showed that for Great Slave Lake, the average melt onset date occurred on year day (YD) 123, the average water clear of ice date was on YD164, and the average freeze onset date was on YD330. On Great Bear Lake, the average melt onset date occurred on YD139, the average water clear of ice date was YD191, and the average freeze onset date was YD321. Ice cover remained present for at least five weeks longer on Great Bear Lake than on Great Slave Lake and most of the difference can be explained by earlier ice melt on Great Slave Lake. Spatially, on Great Bear Lake, melt onset took place first in the eastern arm, water clear of ice occurred first in southeastern and western arms, and freeze onset appeared first in the northern arm and along the shorelines. On Great Slave Lake, melt onset began first in the central basin and then progressed to the northern and eastern arms later in the season. The central basin of Great Slave Lake cleared earlier than the periphery due to the discharge from the Slave River. Freeze onset on Great Slave Lake occurred first within the east arm, closely followed by the north and west arms, and then finally in the centre of the main basin. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

This analysis suggests that an ensemble image approach, wherein a combination of a chlorophyll anomaly, spectral shape at 490 nm and a backscatter ratio product would provide an improvement in satellite detection of K. brevis blooms. For southwest Florida, the combination of these methods through an ensemble approach may lead to an increase in user accuracy by 30-50%, as a result of correctly identifying non-K. brevis features.

The model parameters have been calibrated with data acquired by tower mounted radiometer studies in Europe and the United States, with a typical footprint size of approximately 10 m. In this study. aircraft L-band data acquired during the National Airborne Field Experiment (NAFE) intensive campaign held in South-eastern Australia in 2005 are used to perform the first evaluation of the L-MEB model and its proposed parameterization when applied to coarser footprints (62.5 m), The model could be evaluated across large areas including a wide range of land surface conditions, typical of the Australian environment. Soil moisture was retrieved from the aircraft brightness temperatures using L-MEB and ground measured ancillary data (soil temperature, soil texture, vegetation water content and surface roughness) and subsequently evaluated against ground measurements of soil moisture. The retrieval accuracy when using the L-MEB \'default\' set of model parameters was found to be better than 4.0 %v/v only over grassland covered sites. Over crops the model was found to underestimate soil moisture by up to 32 %v/v. After site specific calibration of the vegetation and roughness parameters, the retrieval accuracy was found to be equal or better than 4.8 %v/v for crops and grasslands at 62.5-m resolution. it is suggested that the proposed value of roughness parameter H(R) for crops is too low, and that variability of HR With Soil moisture must be taken into consideration to obtain accurate retrievals at these scales. The analysis presented here is a crucial step towards validating the application of L-MEB for soil moisture retrieval from satellite observations in an operational context. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

To address this question we fuse continuous tree density estimates derived from hyperspatial remote sensing imagery (pixels smaller than trees) with two topographically derived environmental gradients: elevation and yearly potential relative radiation (PRR). We based our analysis on the maximum tree density found in each of over 200 environmental gradient combinations found with our area of interest, drawing from a dataset consisting of over 300,000 30 m plots and over 3 million individual trees. At a given elevation, sites in which maximum tree density increases as a function of increasing yearly PRR were considered to be temperature or energy limited. Conversely, sites in which maximum tree density decreased as a function of increasing yearly PRR were considered water limited. We found that eastern Lake Tahoe appears to be a landscape which is both water limited (at lower elevation and brighter, south-facing slopes) and temperature/energy limited (at higher elevations and darker, north-facing slopes). We discuss how fusing accurate and ecologically relevant remote sensing outputs with direct and indirect continuous microclimate surfaces can provide a powerful tool for addressing major questions of tree distributions and life history parameters.

Recent studies have pointed out some limitations of single-date comparisons between years and have emphasized the usefulness of time series. However, less effort has hitherto been dedicated to properly account for the temporal dependences typifying the successive images of a time series. An automated change detection method based on a per-object approach and on a probabilistic procedure is proposed here to better cope with this issue. This innovative procedure is applied to a tropical forest environment using high temporal resolution SPOT-VEGETATION time series from 2001 and 2004 in the Brazilian state of Rondonia. The principle of the method is to identify the objects that most deviate from an unchanged reference defined by objective rules. A probabilistic changed-unchanged threshold provides a change map where each object is associated with a likelihood of having changed. This improvement on a binary diagnostic makes the method relevant to meet the requirements of different users, ranging from a comprehensive detection of changes to a detection of the most dramatic changes. According to the threshold value, overall accuracy indices of up to 91 % were obtained, with errors involving change omissions for the most part. The isolation of changes within objects was made possible through a segmentation procedure implemented in a temporal context. In addition, the method was formulated so as to differentiate between inter- and intra-annual vegetation dynamics. These technical peculiarities will likely make this analytical framework suitable for detecting changes in environments subject to a strongly marked phenology. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Several k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm configurations were tested in two study areas in Italy belonging to Mediterranean and Alpine ecosystems. Field data were acquired by the regional forest inventory and forest management plans, and satellite images are from Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+. The paper describes the data used, the methodologies adopted and the results achieved in terms of pixel level accuracy of forest growing stock volume estimates. The results show that several factors affect estimation accuracy when using the k-NN method. For the two test areas a total of 3500 different configurations of the k-NN algorithm were systematically tested by changing the number and type of spectral and ancillary input variables, type of multidimensional distance measures, number of nearest neighbors and methods for spectral feature extraction using the leave-one-out (LOO) procedure. The best k-NN configurations were then used for pixel level estimation; the accuracy was estimated with a bootstrapping procedure; and the results were compared to estimates obtained using parametric regression methods implemented on the same data set. The best k-NN growing stock volume pixel level estimates in the Alpine area have a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) ranging between 74 and 96 m(3) ha(-1) (respectively, 22% and 28% of the mean measured value) and between 106 and 135 m(3) ha(-1) (respectively, 44% and 63% of the mean measured value) in the Mediterranean area. On the whole, the results cast a promising light on the use of non-parametric techniques for forest attribute estimation and mapping with accuracy high enough to support forest planning activities in such complex landscapes. The results of the LOO analyses also highlight the importance of a local empirical optimization phase of the k-NN procedure before defining the best algorithm configuration. In the tests performed the pixel level accuracy increased, depending on the k-NN configuration, as much as 100%. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Results show that, under clear sky conditions, the MOD10A2 has high accuracies when mapping snow (94%) and land (99%) at snow depth >= 4 cm, but a very low accuracy (<39%) for patchy snow or thin snow depth (<4 cm). Most of the patchy snow is misclassified as land. The mean accuracy of the cloud mask used in MOD10A2 for December, January and February is very low (19%). Based on the ratio of snow to land of ground observations in each month, the new snow cover time series generated in this study provides a better representation of actual snow cover for the study area. The SAE (%) time series exhibits similar patterns during six hydrologic years (2001-2006), even though the accumulation and melt periods do not exactly coincide. The variation of SAE is negatively associated with air temperature over the range of -10 degrees C to 5 degrees C. An increase in elevation generally results in longer periods of snow cover, but the influence of elevation on SAE decreases as elevation exceeds 4 km in the Ili River Watershed (IRW). The number of days with snow cover shows either a decreasing trend or no trend in the IRW and the entire study area in the study period. This result is inconsistent with a reported increasing trend based on limited in situ observations. Long-term continuance of the MODIS snow cover product is critical to resolve this dilemma because the in situ observations appear to undersample the region. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Here, through model simulations, we examine the relationship between Kd(490), and the vertical attenuation coefficient of PAR (Kd PAR), as this later coefficient determines the light available for aquatic photosynthesis. A simple semi-analytical model is used to predict Kd(490) and Kd(PAR), as a function of the concentrations of chlorophyll, colored dissolved organic material (CDOM), suspended inorganic, and suspended organic particulate material. A series of model simulations based on variations in these optically significant constituents over a range realistic for the Baltic Sea, are used to define the relationship between the two attenuation coefficients.   K-d(PAR) = 0.6677K(d)(490)(0.6763).   This relationship was verified, using data collected independently from the data set used to derive model coefficients, and appears robust when applied to the Baltic Sea. Comparison to other studies and model sensitivity analyses suggest that the relationship will be dependent on relatively large regional variations in CDOM absorption. A relationship between K-d(490) and Secchi disk depth was also developed and verified. This relationship while useful was more uncertain. The uncertainty was related to a greater influence of scattering on Secchi disk depth estimates and the corresponding parameterization of scattering in our model. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

But few areas outside Europe have alliances and associations described in detail sufficient to support remote sensing-based modeling. Northwestern Montana has one of the few completed plant association classifications in the United States compliant with the recently established National Vegetation Classification system. This project examined the feasibility of mapping forest plant associations using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus data and advanced remote sensing technology and image classification techniques.   Suitable reference data were selected from an extensive regional database of plot records. Fifteen percent of the plot samples were reserved for validation of map products, the remainder of plots designated as training data for map modeling. Key differentiae for image classification were identified from a suite of spectral and biophysical variables. Fuzzy rules were formulated for partitioning physiognomic classes in the upper levels of our image classification hierarchy. Nearest neighbor classifiers were developed for classification of lower levels (alliances and associations), where spectral and biophysical contrasts are less distinct.   Maps were produced to reflect nine forest alliances and 24 associations across the study area. Error matrices were constructed for each map based on stratified random selections of map validation samples. Accuracy for the alliance map was estimated at 60%. Association classifiers provide between 54 and 86% accuracy within their respective alliances. Alternative techniques are proposed for aggregating classes and enhancing decision tree classifiers to model alliances and associations for interior forest types.

Spectroscopic analysis using diagnostic spectral features yields the potential for automated identification and mapping of these materials. This study proposes a new approach for the determination and evaluation of such spectral features that are robust against spectral overlap between material classes and within-class variability. Analysis is based on comprehensive field and image spectral libraries of more than 21,000 spectra of surface materials widely-used in German cities. The robustness of the interactively defined spectral features is evaluated by a separability analysis. This method is performed based on confusion matrices for each material computed from classification results. For comparison this analysis is also performed for material-specific gray values of selected bands. The obtained commission and omission errors show superiority of the spectral features compared to gray values for most of the investigated materials. The results indicate that robust spectral features yield the potential for unsupervised detection of endmembers in hyperspectral image data. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Many of the recent innovations have involved remotely sensed data and related statistical estimation techniques. Current applications of remote sensing in support of national forest inventories are reviewed for three areas: (1) observation or measurement, meaning using remotely sensed data in lieu of field observations or measurements; (2) estimation, meaning calculation of traditional inventory areal estimates such as forest area or volume per unit area; and (3) mapping. Future applications focus on two areas: augmenting field measurements with remotely sensed data obtained from lidar sensors and Internet accessible map-based estimation.

To this aim an advanced DInSAR technique, referred to as DInSAR-SBAS (Small BAseline Subset), has been applied. This technique allows monitoring the temporal evolution of a deformation phenomenon, via the generation of mean deformation velocity maps and displacement time series from a data set of acquired SAR images. In particular, we have processed a set of SAR data acquired by the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS) sensors and compared the achieved results with optical levelling measurements, assumed as reference. The surface displacements detected by DInSAR SBAS from 1992 to 2000 are between 10 mm/year in the historical part of Bologna town, and up to 59 mm/year in the NE industrial and agricultural areas. Former measurements from optical levelling referred to 1897 show 2-3 mm/year vertical movements. This trend of displacement increased in the second half of the 20th century and the subsidence rate reached 60 mm/year. We compared the more recent levelling campaigns (in 1992 and late 1999) and DInSAR results from 1992 to 1999. The standard deviation of the difference between levelling data, projected onto the satellite Line Of Sight, and DInSAR results is 2 mm/year. This highlights a good agreement between the measurements provided by two different techniques. The explanation of soil movements based on interferometric results, ground data and geological observations, allowed confirming the anthropogenic cause (surface effect due to the overexploitation of the aquifers) and highlights a natural, tectonic, subsidence.

At the same time, ground measurements were taken of soil and litter moisture content, while precipitation was also permanently monitored. This experiment was done in the context of the upcoming SMOS mission in order to improve our understanding of the behaviour of the L-band signal from forested areas for different wetness conditions and viewing angles. This is especially relevant for solving the problem of heterogeneity since a large fraction of SMOS pixels (similar to 30 x 30 km 2) is partially covered by forest.   This paper describes the objectives and the overall set-up of the Bray-2004 experiment and shows some first results. The greater part of the horizontally polarized L-band signal is found to be dominated by the influence of physical temperature. Variations in soil and/or litter moisture content are visible in the angular signal and in the above-canopy microwave emission, although the dynamic range of this last effect is very small. This, together with the fact that emissivity values are very high, is possibly due to the presence of a substantial litter layer. However, decoupling of soil and litter effects is difficult because of the strong correlation found between soil and litter moisture. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

L-MEB parameters are key ancillary information for the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission (SMOS) retrieval algorithm that produces estimates of the surface soil moisture from measurements of the surface brightness temperature at L-band.   L-band data sets from three ground-based experiments over grass are analysed in this paper: BARC (orchard grass and alfalfa), ELBARA-ETH (clover grass), and SMOSREX (grass and litter from a field left fallow). Modelling of the brightness temperature using the zero-th order radiative transfer model in L-MEB indicates that the vegetation appears isotropic to microwaves propagating with horizontal polarisation, and that the single scattering albedo can be neglected. At vertical polarisation, non-zero scattering is observed for all the grass data sets. Surface soil moisture is retrieved with enough accuracy for all data sets as long as the soil and litter emission are calibrated beforehand. Then surface soil moisture and vegetation optical depth can be left as free parameters in the retrieval process. Finally, the study highlights the importance of detecting strong emission and attenuation by wet vegetation and litter due to rainfall interception in order to obtain accurate estimates of the surface soil moisture. The study illustrates how strong rainfall interception can be flagged straightforwardly using a microwave polarisation index. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The need for dynamic monitoring of the fire risk environment favors the use of fast, site-specific, empirical models for assessing local vegetation moisture status, albeit with some uncertainties. These uncertainties may affect the accuracy of decisions made by fire managers using remote sensing derived LFMC. Consequently, the analysis of these LFMC retrieval uncertainties and their impact on applications, such as fire spread prediction, is needed to ensure the informed use of remote sensing derived LFMC measurements by fire managers. The Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, one of the most fireprone regions in the southeastern United States was chosen as our study area. Our study estimates the uncertainties associated with empirical site specific retrievals using NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index; (R-0.86 - R-1.24) / (R-0.86+R-1.24)) and NDII (Normalized Difference Infrared Index; (R-0.86 - R-1.64) / (R-0.86+R-1.64)) that are simulated by coupled leaf and canopy radiative transfer models. In order to support the findings from those simulations, a second approach estimates uncertainties using actual MODIS derived indices over Georgia Forestry Commission stations that provide NFDRS model estimates of LFMC. Finally, we used the FARSITE surface fire behavior model to examine the sensitivity of fire spread rates to live fuel moisture content for the NFDRS high pocosin and southern rough fuel models found in Okefenokee. This allowed us to evaluate the effectiveness of satellite based LFMC estimations for use in fire behavior predictions. Sensitivity to LFMC (measured as percentage of moisture weight per unit dry weight of fuel) was analyzed in terms of no-wind no-slope spread rates as well as normalized spread rates. Normalized spread rates, defined as the ratio of spread rate at a particular LFMC to the spread rate at LFMC of 125 under similar conditions, were used in order to make the results adaptable to any wind-slope conditions. Our results show that NDWI has a stronger linear relationship to LFMC than NDII, and can consequently estimate LFMC with lesser uncertainty. Uncertainty analysis shows that 66% of NDWI based LFMC retrievals over non-sparsely vegetated regions are expected to have errors less than 32, while 90% of retrievals should be within an error margin of 56. In pocosin fuel models, under low LFMC conditions (< 100), retrieval errors could lead to normalized spread rate errors of 6.5 which may be equivalent to an error of 47 m/h in no-wind no-slope conditions. For southern rough fuel models, when LFMC < 175, LFMC retrieval errors could amount to normalized spread rate errors of 0.6 or an equivalent error of 9.3 m/h in no-wind no-slope conditions. These spread rate error estimates represent approximately the upper bound of errors resulting from uncertainties in empirical retrievals of LFMC over forested regions. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The regression models, developed using standwise forest inventory data and standwise averages of moderate spatial resolution ASTER data (15 in x 15 in), were utilized to estimate stand volume for coarse resolution MODIS pixels (250 in x 250 in). The MODIS datasets for three 8-day periods produced slightly different predictions, but the averaged MODIS data produced the most accurate estimates. The inaccuracy in radiometric calibration between the datasets, the effect of gridding and compositing artifacts and phenological variability are the most probable reasons for this variability. Averaging of the several MODIS datasets seems to be one possibility to reduce bias. The estimates obtained were significantly close to the district-level mean values provided by the Finnish National Forest Inventory; the relative RMSE was 9.9%. The use of finer spatial resolution data is an essential step to integrate ground measurements with coarse spatial resolution data. Furthermore, the use of standwise forest inventory data reduces co-registration errors and helps in solving the scaling problem between the datasets. The approach employed here can be used for estimating the stand volume and biomass, and as required independent verification data. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, a reflectance-based vicarious calibration approach using high-reflectance, pseudo-invariant targets in western Queensland was developed. This calibration procedure was used to test the existing calibration models for ETM+ and TM, and develop a consistent operational calibration procedure which provides calibration information for the MSS sensors. Ground based data, sensor spectral response functions and atmospheric variables were used as input to MODTRAN radiative transfer code to estimate top-of-atmosphere radiance.

Results confirm the stability and accuracy of the ETM+ calibration, and the suitability of this data as a radiometric standard for cross-calibration with TM. Vicarious data support the use of the existing TM calibration model for the red and two shortwave-infrared bands. However, alternative models for blue, green and near-infrared bands are presented. The models proposed differ most noticeably at dates prior to 1995, with differences in estimated gains of up to 9.7%, 10.8% and 6.9% for the blue, green and near-infrared bands respectively. Vicarious gains for Landsat-2 MSS and Landsat-5 MSS are presented and are compared with those applied by the on-board calibration system. Updated calibration coefficients to scale MSS data to the SLATS vicarious measurements are given. The removal of time based calibration trends in the SLATS data archive will enable the measurement of vegetation changes over the 26 year period covered by Landsat -2, -5 and -7.

The moderate resolution data need to be autonomously geo-rectified prior to being used in subsequent scientific retrievals. This is particularly critical to the unique cloud height/wind retrievals which require sub-pixel co-registration accuracies on a global basis. In order to address this problem, the MISR ground data processing system is based on a fully photograrnmetric approach and is complemented with a quality monitoring system used to verify performance globally and over desired time periods. The georectification requirements were developed from a series of data quality investigations based partially on sensitivity requirements for the cloud height/wind retrieval algorithm.

In the presented approach, the specific information content inherent to the observations of the respective sensor was not only able to complement the canopy characterization, but also helped to solve the ill-posed problem of the RTM inversion. The theoretical feasibility of the proposed earth observation concept has been tested on a synthetic data set generated by a forest growth model for a wide range of forest stands. Robust estimates on forest canopy characteristics were achieved, ranging from maximal tree height, fractional cover (fcover), Leaf Area Index (LAI) to the foliage chlorophyll and water content. The introduction of prior information on the canopy structure derived from large footprint LIDAR observations significantly improved the retrieval performance relative to estimates based solely on spectral information.

The accuracy assessment data were also used to generate a sample-based estimate of total ETc using the crop type identified by direct ground observation of each sample field. A stratified random sampling design was implemented using field size as the stratification variable. The stratified design did not markedly improve precision for the accuracy assessment objective, but it was highly effective for the objective of estimating ETc derived from the ground-ob served crop types. The sampling design and analysis methodology developed for LCRAS demonstrates the utility of a multi-purpose approach that satisfies the accuracy assessment objectives, but also allows for rigorous, sample-based estimates of other collective properties of a region (e.g., total ETc in this study).

Yet the most common mapping method of these features is based on visual, qualitative interpretation of air-photos. In this study we examine the feasibility of mapping arid alluvial surfaces by using airborne hyperspectral reflective remote sensing methodology. This technique was tested on Late Pleistocene to Holocene alluvial fan surfaces located in the hyperarid southern Arava valley, Israel. Results of spectral field measurements showed that the surface reflectance is controlled by two main surficial processes, which are used as relative age criteria: the degree of desert pavement development (gravel coverage %) controls the absorption feature depths, while the rock coating development influences significantly the overall reflectance of the surface, but its effect on the absorption feature depths is limited. We show that as the percent of the surface covered by gravels increases, the absorption feature depth of the common gravels, in this case carbonate at 2.33 mu m, increases as well; whereas the absorption features depth of the fine particle in-between the gravels, decrease (hydroxyl and ferric absorption features at 2.21 mu m, and 0.87 mu m, respectively), as the fines are removed from the surface. Using these correlations we were able to map the surface gravel coverage (%) on the entire alluvial fan, by calculating the gravel coverage (%) in each pixel of the hyperspectral image. The prediction of gravel coverage (%) is with accuracy of +/- 15% (e.g. gravel coverage of 50% can be predicted to be 35% to 65%). Using extensive accuracy assessment data, we show that the spectral based mapping maintained high accuracy degree (R-2=0.57 to 0.83). The quantitative methodology developed in this study for mapping alluvial surfaces can be adapted for other surfaces and piedmonts throughout the arid regions of the world. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

However, understory vegetation is a recognized problem that limits the accuracy of sate I lite-estimated forest LAI. A canopy reflectance model was used to investigate the impact of the understory vegetation on LAI estimated from reflectance values estimated from satellite sensor data. Reflectance spectra were produced by the model using detailed field data as input, i.e. forest LAI, tree structural parameters, and the composition, distribution and reflectance of the forest floor. Common deciduous and coniferous forest types in southern Sweden were investigated. A negative linear relationship (r(2) = 0.6) was observed between field estimated LAI and the degree of understory vegetation, and the results indicated better agreement when coniferous and deciduous stands were analysed separately. The simulated spectra verified that the impact of the understory on the reflected signal from the top of the canopy is important; the reflectance values varying by up to 18% in the red and up to 10% in the near infra-red region of the spectra due to the understory. In order to predict the variation in LAI due to the understory vegetation, model inversions were performed where the input spectra were changed between the minimum, average and maximum reflectance values obtained from the forward runs. The resulting variation in LAI was found to be 1.6 units on average. The LAI of the understory could be predicted indirectly from simple stand data on forest characteristics, i.e. from allometric estimates, as an initial step in the process of estimating LAI. It is suggested here that compensation for the effect of the understory would improve the accuracy in the estimates of canopy LAI considerably. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The LST production chain described here could be adapted for any wide field of view sensor (e.g., MODIS, VIIRS), and the LST product may be suitable for monitoring spatial and temporal temperature trends, or as input to many process models (e.g., hydrological, ecosystem).

The instrument is operated by Instituto Nacional de Tecnica Aerospacial (INTA) and it has been involved in several field campaigns since 2004. The main goal of this paper is to analyze the feasibility of retrieving land surface temperature from the 10 AHS thermal infrared bands, from 71 to 80, located in the region between 8 and 13 gin. For this purpose, three different methods have been considered: (i) the single-channel method, which uses only one thermal band; (ii) the split-window method, which uses a combination of two thermal bands; and (iii) the TES (temperature and emissivity separation) method, which needs at least four thermal bands. The calibration of the AHS thermal bands and the algorithms have been tested with in situ measurements collected in the framework ofthe SPARC (Spectra Barrax Campaign) and EAGLE (Exploitation of AnGular effects in Land surface observations from satellites) field campaigns, which took place simultaneously in the agricultural area of Barrax (Albacete, Spain), and also in the framework of the AGRISPECTRA field campaign, carried out over an olive orchard in Cordoba (Spain), in July 2004. AHS flights were conducted at two different altitudes, 975m, and 2745 m above ground level. The results show that AHS bands 71 (8.18 mu m), 72 (8.66 mu m), and 73 (9.15 mu m) were affected by a calibration problem. Taking into account that AHS bands 74 (9.60 mu m) and 80 (12.93 mu m) are located in an absorption region, bands from 75 to 79 have been finally selected for land surface temperature retrieval. The single-channel method has been applied to AHS band 75 (10.07 mu m), which shows the highest atmospheric transmissivity, whereas the split-window method has been applied to the combination between bands 75 and 79 (12.35 mu m), which provides the best results according to simulated data. All the AHS thermal bands ranging from 75 to 79 have been used in the TES method. The tests conducted on the different algorithms used in this study show that single-channel and split-window methods provided similar results, with root mean square errors (RMSE) between 1.6 and 1.9K. The TES method slightly improved the results, with a RMSE of 1.4K. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', 'Univ Valencia, Fac Phys, Global Change Unit, Dept Thermodynam, Valencia, Spain.

A simulated annealing approach minimizes the mean of shortest distances between samples. Optimization was done by prioritizing the survey to areas with high uncertainty. The methodology is tested on a site located in the Amazonian region of Peru. It resulted into an almost equilateral triangular scheme at those parts of the area where uncertainty was highest.

In this work we have applied an advanced DInSAR technique - the Coherent Pixels Technique (CPT) -, to study subsidence phenomena due to the excessive pumping of groundwater in the Vega Media of the Segura River (SE Spain) from 1993 to the present. The settlement map retrieved with DInSAR shows settlement of up to 8 cm at some points of the study area and has been compared with other data provided by ground instruments to analyse the relationship with ground deformation. A correlation has been observed between these measurements and the observations from on-site testing of piezometric groundwater fluctuations and borehole extensometric settlement. However, the distribution of damaged buildings, well points and basements does not show a clear relationship with measured subsidence values because the occurrence of damage also depends on the structural state of the buildings and the characteristics of their foundations. In addition, the distribution of pumping wells is not indicative of the distribution of the volume of water withdrawal which is the real conditioning factor of piezometric level changes. It can be concluded that the results obtained provide very useful spatial and temporal data about this phenomenon in an urban area at a low cost. The data can be used for forecasting purposes and helps to define zones with future ground settlement problems if the same conditions are repeated. This technique has also allowed the monitoring of ground subsidence in the Vega Media of Segura River for a period (1993-1995) where no instrument information was available. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

This article investigates the effects of changes in near-surface and surface moisture upon the spectral characteristics of Sphagnum moss. Laboratory-based canopy reflectance data were collected from two common species of Sphagnum subjected to drying and subsequent rewetting. Several spectral indices developed from the near infra-red (NIR) and shortwave infra-red (SWIR) liquid water absorption bands and two biophysical indices (REIP and the chlorophyll index) were correlated with measures of near-surface moisture. All spectral indices tested were significantly correlated with near-surface moisture (with r between 0.27 and 0.94). The strongest correlations were observed using indices developed from the NIR liquid water absorption features (fWBI(980) and fWBI(1200)). However, a hysteretic response was observed in both NIR indices when the canopies were re-hydrated, a finding which may have implications for the timing of remote sensing image acquisition. The Moisture Stress Index (MSI), developed from the SWIR liquid water absorption feature also showed strong correlations with near-surface wetness although the range of moisture conditions over which the index was able to detect change was highly dependent on Sphagnum species. Of the biophysical spectral indices tested (REIP and the chlorophyll index), the most significant relationships were observed between the chlorophyll index and near-surface wetness. All spectral indices tested were species specific, and this is attributed to differences in canopy morphology between Sphagnum species. The potential for developing estimations of surface and near-surface hydrological conditions across northern peatlands using remote sensing technology is discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The resulting percent hemlock basal area coverage correctly identified hemlock dominated pixels (>40% basal area) with 83% accuracy. Key wavelengths and health indices were examined to determine if a subset of wavelengths could accurately predict an 11-class decline rating system. A linear regression based on reflectance at a chlorophyll sensitive wavelength (R683 nm), coupled with a water band index (R970/R900), was able to predict decline with 85% accuracy.

Remote sensing has considerable potential to provide such maps, but classification accuracy within primary rain forests has generally been inadequate for practical applications. Here we test how accurately floristically defined forest types in lowland tropical rain forests in Peruvian Amazonia can be recognized using remote sensing data (Landsat ETM+ satellite image and STRM elevation model). Floristic data and a vegetation classification with four forest classes were available for eight line transects, each 8 km long, located in an area of ca 800 km. We compared two sampling unit sizes (line transect subunits of 200 and 500 m) and several image feature combinations to analyze their suitability for image classification. Mantel tests were used to quantify how well the patterns in elevation and in the digital numbers of the satellite image correlated with the floristic patterns observed in the field. Most Mantel correlations were positive and highly significant. Linear discriminant analysis was used first to build a function that discriminates between forest classes in the eight field-verified transects on the basis of remotely sensed data, and then to classify those parts of the line transects and the satellite image that had not been visited in the field. Classification accuracy was quantified by 8-fold crossvalidation. Two of the tierra firme (non-inundated) forest types were combined because they were too often misclassified. The remaining three forest types (inundated forest, terrace forest and Pebas formation/intermediate tierra firme forest) could be separated using the 500-m sampling units with an overall classification accuracy of 85% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.62. For the 200-m sampling units, the classification accuracy was clearly lower (71%, Kappa 0.35). The forest classification will be used as habitat data to study wildlife habitat use in the same area. Our results show that remotely sensed data and relatively simple classification methods can be used to produce reasonably accurate forest type classifications, even in structurally homogeneous primary rain forests.

Experiments were conducted to discover and evaluate potential relationships between the characteristics of African savannah fires and post-fire surface spectral reflectance in the visible to shortwave infrared spectral region. Nine instrumented experimental fires were conducted in semi-arid woodland savannah of Chobe National Park (Botswana), where fire temperature (T-max) and duration (dt) were recorded using thermocouples positioned at different heights and locations. These variables, along with measures of fireline intensity (FLI), integrated temperature with time (T-sum) and biomass (and carbon/nitrogen) volatilised were compared to post-fire surface spectral reflectance. Statistically significant relationships were observed between (i) the fireline intensity and total nitrogen volatilised (r(2) =0.54, n=36, p<0.001), (ii) integrated temperature (Tsum-mu) and total biomass combusted (r(2) = 0.72, n = 32, p < 0.001), and (iii) fire duration as measured at the top-of-grass sward thermocouple (dt(T)) and total biomass combusted (r(2) = 0.74, n = 34, p < 0.001) and total nitrogen volatilised (r(2) = 0.73, n = 34, P < 0.001). The post-fire surface spectral reflectance was found to be related to dt and T,,. via a quadratic relationship that varied with wavelength. The use of visible and shortwave infrared band ratios produced statistically significant linear relationships with fire duration as measured by the top thermocouple (dt(T)) (r(2) = 0.76, n = 34, p < 0.001) and the mean of T-sum (r(2) = 0.82, n = 34, p < 0.001). The results identify fire duration as a versatile measure that relates directly to the fire severity, and also illustrate the potential of spectrally-based fire severity measures. However, the results also point to difficulties when applying such spectrally-based techniques to Earth Observation satellite imagery, due to the small-scale variability noted on the ground. Results also indicate the potential for surface spectral reflectance to increase following higher severity fires, due to the laying down of high albedo, white mineral ash. Most current techniques for mapping burned area rely on the general assumption that surface albedo decreases following a fire, and so if the image spatial resolution was high enough such methods may fail. Determination of the effect of spatial resolution on a sensor\'s ability to detect white ash was investigated using a validated optical mixture modelling approach. The most appropriate mixing model to use (linear or non-linear) was assessed using laboratory experiments. A linear mixing model was shown most appropriate, with results suggesting that sensors having spatial resolutions significantly higher than those of Landsat ETM+ will be required if patches of white ash are to be used to provide EO-derived information on the spatial variation of fire severity.

PARAS is a simple parameterization model for taking into account the effect of within-shoot scattering on coniferous canopy reflectance. Multiple scattering at the small scale represented by a shoot is a conifer-specific characteristic which causes the spectral signature of coniferous forests to differ from that of broadleaved forests. This has for long led to problems in remote sensing of canopy structural variables in coniferous dominated regions. The PARAS model uses a relationship between photon recollision probability and leaf area index (LAI) for simulating forest reflectance. The recollision probability is a measurable, wavelength independent variable which is defined as the probability with which a photon scattered in the canopy interacts with a phytoclement again. In this study, we present application results using PARAS in Simulating reflectance of coniferous forests for approximately 800 Scots pine and Norway spruce dominated stands. The results of this Study clearly indicate that a major improvement in simulating canopy reflectance in near-infrared (NIR) is achieved by simply accounting for the within-shoot scattering. In other words, the low NIR reflectance observed in coniferous areas is mainly due to within-shoot scattering. In the red wavelength the effect of within-shoot scattering was not pronounced due to the high level of needle absorption in the red range. To conclude the paper, Further application possibilities of the presented parameterization model are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper. we present an original method to control a simple Sahelian land surface model coupled to a radiative transfer model (RTM) on the basis of ERS wind scanerometer (WSC) observations. In a first step, a sensitivity study is implemented to identify those parameters of the land surface model that can be estimated through the assimilation of WSC data. The assimilation scheme relies on evolution strategies (ES) algorithm that aims at solving the parameter evaluation problem. These algorithms are particularly well suited for complex (nonlinear) inverse problems. The assimilation scheme is applied to several study sites located in the Sahelian mesoscale site of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis Project (Gourma region, Mali). The results are compared with ground observations of herbaceous mass. After the WSC data assimilation. the simulated herbaceous mass curves compare well with observations [187 kilogram of dry matter per hectare (kg DM/ha) of average error]. The simulated water fluxes exhibit a behaviour in agreement with ground measurements performed over similar ecosystems during the Hapex Sahel experiment. The accuracy of estimated herbaceous mass and water fluxes resulting from uncertainties on climatic forcing variable is evaluated using a stochastic approach. The average error on the herbaceous mass values mainly depends on the rainfall estimate accuracy and ranges from 139 to 268 kg DM/ha that compares well with a previous study based on the sole inversion of the radiative transfer model. Finally, this study underlines the need for a multispectral assimilation approach to get a better constraint on water fluxes estimation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Here we present a canopy height quantile-based approach for quantifying above ground carbon content (AGCC) in a temperate deciduous woodland, by means of a discrete-return, small-footprint airborne LiDAR. Fieldwork was conducted in Monks Wood National Nature Reserve UK to estimate the AGCC of five stands from forest mensuration and allometric relations. In parallel, a digital canopy height model (DCHM) and a digital terrain model (DTM) were derived from elevation measurements obtained by means of an Optech Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper 1210. A quantile-based approach was adopted to select a representative statistic of height distributions per plot. A forestry yield model was selected as a basis to estimate stemwood volume per plot from these heights metrics. Agreement of r=0.74 at the plot level was achieved between ground-based AGCC estimates and those derived from the DCHM. Using a 20x20 in grids superposed to the DCHM, the AGCC was estimated at the stand level and at the woodland level. At the stand level, the agreement between the plot data upscaled in proportion to area and the LiDAR estimates was r=0.85. At the woodland level, LiDAR estimates were nearly 24% lower than those from the upscaled plot data. This suggests that field-based approaches alone may not be adequate for carbon accounting in heterogeneous forests. Conversely, the LiDAR 20x20 in grid approach has an enhanced capability of monitoring the natural variability of AGCC across the woodland. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

FMC expresses the amount of water in a leaf relative to the amount of dry matter and differs from measures of leaf water content which express the amount of water in a leaf relative to its area. FMC is related to both leaf water content and leaf dry matter content, and the relationships between FMC and remotely sensed reflectance will therefore be affected by variation in both leaf biophysical properties. This paper uses spectral reflectance data from the Leaf Optical Properties EXperiment (LOPEX) and modelled data from the Prospect leaf reflectance model to examine the relationships between FMC, leaf equivalent water thickness (EWT) and a range of spectral vegetation indices (VI) designed to estimate leaf and canopy water content. Significant correlations were found between FMC and all of the selected vegetation indices for both modelled and measured data, but statistically stronger relationships were found with leaf EWT; overall, the water index (WI) was found to be most strongly correlated with FMC. The accuracy of FMC estimation was very low when the global range of FMC was examined, but for a restricted range of 0-100%. FMC was estimated with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 15% in the model simulations and 51% with the measured data. The paper shows that the estimation of live FMC from remotely sensed vegetation indices is likely to be problematic when there is variability in both leaf water content and leaf dry matter content in the target leaves. Estimating FMC from remotely sensed data at the canopy level is likely to be farther complicated by spatial and temporal variations in leaf area index (LAI). Further research is required to assess the potential of canopy reflectance model inversion to estimate live fuel moisture content where a priori information on vegetation properties may be used to constrain the inversion process.

A new photosynthesis model has been created that combines the standard sunlit/shaded leaf separation (two-leaf) and the multiple layer approaches and uses vertical foliage profiles measured by SLICER (the Scanning Lidar Imager of Canopies by Echo Recovery). Daily gross carbon assimilation rates calculated by this model were compared with the rates calculated by two other models, the two-leaf model and the combined two-leaf multilayer model utilizing uniform foliage profiles. The comparison was made over a wide range of profiles and weather conditions for two mixed deciduous forest stands in eastern Maryland, measured by SLICER in September 1995. Incident radiation pattern, environmental parameters and total amounts of sunlit and shaded leaves were the same for all three models. The difference was in the distributions of radiation and sunlit/shaded leaves inside the canopy. For the combined models, these distributions were calculated based on the vertical foliage profiles, while for the two-leaf model, empirical equations were used to account for the average amounts of absorbed radiation. The simulations showed that: (1) the use of a uniform foliage distribution instead of the actual one results in large differences in the calculated GPP values, up to 46.4% and 50.7% for the days with partial and total cloud cover; (2) the performance of the two-leaf model is extremely sensitive to the absorbed radiation pattern, its disagreement with the proposed model becomes insignificant when the average amounts of absorbed radiation are the same; (3) days with partial cloud cover and a greater fraction of diffuse radiation are characterized by higher GPP rates. These findings highlight the importance of vertical foliage profile and separate treatments of diffuse and direct radiation for photosynthesis modeling. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Ferrousiron absorption positioned near 1.05 mum is most intense in peridotite reflectance spectra. Ferric-iron absorption is intense in most of the felsic lithologies.   HyMap data were recorded in 126 narrow hands from 0.43 to 2.5 pm along a 7-km-wide swath with approximately 6-m spatial resolution. Correction of the data to spectral reflectance was accomplished by reference to in situ measurements of an extensive, alluvial plain. Spectral classes for matched filter processing were selected by using the pixel purity index procedure and analysis of in situ and laboratory spectra. Considering the spatial distribution of the resulting 14 classes, some classes were combined, which produced eight classes characterized by Al-OH absorption features, and three Fe,Mg-OH absorption-feature classes.   Comparison of the distribution of these I I spectral classes to a generalized lithologic map of the study area shows that the spectral distinction among the eight Al-OH classes is related to variations in primary lithology, weathering products, and vegetation density. Quartzite is represented in three classes, syenite corresponds to a single scattered class, quartz-muscovite-biotite schist defines a single very coherent class, and unconsolidated sediments are portrayed in four classes. The three mafic-ultramafic classes are distinguished on the basis of generally intense Fe,Mg-OH and ferrous-iron absorption features. A single class represents the main Mordor ultramafic mass. Epidote-bearing rocks define another class, which corresponds to biotite gneiss and, in the southern part of the area, to fracture zones. The third class, which exhibits Al-OH, as well as Fe,Mg-OH features, represents hornblende gneiss and other mafic gneisses. These results indicate the importance of analyzing the VNIR and SWIR spectral shape and albedo, as well as analyzing specific spectral features, for mapping lithologic units in this weathered terrain.

Satellite imagery was used to gain knowledge on primary biomass over large time and space scales and to process environmental variables of significance to the problem of fin whale distribution.   Fin whale distribution was obtained from survey data and expressed into sightings per unit of effort. Net primary production (g C/m(2)/day), NPP, can be estimated with a model by processing remote-sensed measurements of chlorophyll concentration, provided by SeaWIFS DAAC. NPP was integrated over different temporal scales, related to primary production cycles in the area. Additional variables were derived from sea surface temperature (AVHRR/NOAA sensors).   Multiple cross-correlation coefficients were calculated between these environmental parameters and the fin whale summer distribution from 1998 to 2002. A predictive model, the potential grouping index, was developed from this statistical approach.   This study improves our understanding of the variability of fin whale distribution in summer. While food availability at a particular time and place is a function of environmental conditions in the previous months, this study provides evidence that whales adapt their movements and group size directly to food availability rather than to instantaneous environmental conditions.

Larger-scale trends, however, must be determined using satellite-based observations. Using both a radiative transfer simulation and an analysis of multitemporal Landsat TM images, the ability of satellite remote sensing to detect and monitor coral reef bleaching is examined. The radiative transfer simulation indicates that the blue and green bands of Landsat TM can detect bleaching if at least 23% of the coral surface in a pixel has been bleached, assuming a Landsat TM pixel with a resolution of 30 x 30 in on shallow (less than 3 in deep) reef flats at Ishigaki Island, Japan. Assuming an area with an initial coral coverage of 100% and in which all corals became completely bleached, the bleaching could be detected at a depth of up to 17 in. The difference in reflectance of shallow sand and corals is compared by examining multitemporal Landsat TM images at Ishigaki Island, after normalizing for variations in atmospheric conditions, incident light, water depth, and the sensor\'s reaction to the radiance received. After the normalization, a severe bleaching event when 25-55% of coral coverage was bleached was detected, but a slight bleaching event when 15% of coral coverage was bleached was not detected. The simulation and data analysis agreed well with each other, and identified reliable limits for satellite remote sensing for detecting coral reef bleaching. Sensitivity analysis on solar zenith angle, aerosol (visibility) and water quality (Ch1 a concentration) quantified the effect of these factors on bleaching detection, and thus served as general guidelines for detecting coral reef bleaching. Spatial misregistration resulted in a high degree of uncertainty in the detection of changes at the edges of coral patches mainly because of the low (similar to30 m) spatial resolution of Landsat TM, indicating that detection of coral reef bleaching by Landsat TM is limited to extremely severe cases on a large homogeneous coral patch and shallow water depths. Satellite remote sensing of coral reef bleaching should be encouraged, however, because the development and deployment of advanced satellite sensors with high spatial resolution continue to progress.

Although remote sensing techniques have proved useful for assessing the concentration of foliar biochemicals under controlled laboratory conditions, more investigation is required to assess their capabilities in the field, where inconsistent results have been obtained so far. We investigated the possibility of determining the concentration of in situ biochemicals in a savanna rangeland, using the spectral reflectance of five grass species. Canopy spectral measurements were taken in the field using a GER 3700 spectroradiometer. We tested the utility of using four variables derived from continuum-removed absorption features for predicting canopy nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium concentration: (i) continuum-removed derivative reflectance (CRDR), (ii) band depth (BD), (iii) band depth ratio (BDR) and (iv) normalised band depth index (NBDI). Stepwise linear regression was used to select wavelengths from the absorption-feature-based variables. Univariate correlation analysis was also done between the first derivative reflectance and biochemicals. Using a training data set, the variables derived from continuum-removed absorption features could predict biochemicals with R-2 values ranging from 0.43 to 0.80. Results were highest using CRDR data, which yielded R-2 values of 0.70, 0.80, 0.64, 0.50 and 0.68 with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.01, 0.004, 0.03, 0.01 and 0.004 for nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, calcium and magnesium, respectively. Predicting biochemicals on a test data set, using regression models developed from a training data set, resulted in R-2 values ranging from 0.15 to 0.70. The error of prediction (RSE) in the test data set was 0.08 (+/-10.25% of mean), 0.05 (+/-5.2% of mean), 0.02 (+/-11.11% of mean), 0.05 (+/-11.6% of mean) and 0.03 (+/-15% of mean) for nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous, calcium and magnesium, respectively, using CRDR. When data was partitioned into species groups, the R-2 increased significantly to >0.80. With high-quality radiometric and geometric calibration of hyperspectral imagery, the techniques applied in this study (i.e. continuum removal on absorption features) may also be applied on data acquired by airborne and spaceborne imaging spectrometers to predict and ultimately to map the concentration of macronutrients in tropical rangelands.

This study presents results of the combined use of a simple water balance model, a radiative transfer model and ERS scatterometer data to produce map of vegetation biomass and thus vegetation cover at a spatial resolution of 25 kin. The backscattering coefficient measured by spacebome wind scatterometers over Sahel shows a marked seasonality linked to the drastic changes of both soil and vegetation dielectric properties associated to the alternating dry and wet seasons. For lack of a direct observation, METEOSAT rainfall estimates are used to calculate temporal series of soil moisture with the help of a water balance model. This a priori information is used as input of the radiative transfer model that simulates the interaction between the radar wave and the surface components (soil and vegetation). Then, an inversion algorithm is applied to retrieve vegetation aerial mass from the ERS scatterometer data. Because of the nonlinear feature of the inverse problem to be solved, the inversion is performed using a global stochastic nonlinear inversion method. A good agreement is obtained between the inverse solutions and independent field measurements with mean and standard deviation of -54 and 130 kg of dry matter by hectare (kg DM/ha), respectively. The algorithm is then applied to a 350,000 km(2) area including the Malian Gourma and Seno region and a Sahelian part of Burkina Faso during two contrasted seasons (1999 and 2000). At the considered resolution, the obtained herbaceous mass maps show a global qualitative consistency (r(2) = 0.71) with NDVI images acquired by the VEGETATION instrument. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, the vegetation changes that accompany the development and the initial climatic state of the land parcel must be noted. Techniques are also developed for quantifying the effects of urbanization on the surface hydrology at a watershed scale. Streamflow and precipitation data are related graphically in order to determine a watershed\'s general ratio of stormwater runoff to rainfall, along with any changes in the ratio over time. Four distinct runoff responses, separated by season and antecedent moisture conditions, are distinguishable for a particular basin, with the response during the non-summer months under typical antecedent moisture conditions the most representative of and responsive to land-use patterns. This particular runoff response can be estimated from satellite-derived land cover patterns and certain physical attributes of a basin. These satellite-based microclimate and hydrologic analyses are coupled with an existing urban growth model (SLEUTH). The SLEUTH urban growth model simulates future development scenarios for a region of interest. The resulting changes in urban land use lead to the evolution of site-specific climate and hydrology based on the scheme that is presented in this paper. This study, as well as related tools and bodies of knowledge, can be used to broaden the scientific basis behind land-use management decisions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

In September 1999, three SEBASS flight lines were acquired over Virginia City and Steamboat Springs, Nevada. At-sensor data were corrected for atmospheric effects using an empirical method that derives the atmospheric characteristics from the scene itself, rather than relying on a predicted model. The apparent surface radiance data were reduced to surface emissivity using an emissivity normalization technique to remove the effects of temperature. Mineral maps were created with a pixel classification routine based on matching instrument- and laboratory-measured emissivity spectra, similar to methods used for other hyperspectral data sets (e.g. AVIRIS). Linear mixtures of library spectra match SEBASS spectra reasonably well, and silicate and sulfate minerals mapped remotely, agree with the dominant minerals identified with laboratory X-ray powder diffraction and spectroscopic analyses of field samples. Though improvements in instrument calibration, atmospheric correction, and information extraction would improve the ability to map more pixels, these hyperspectral TIR data nevertheless show significant advancement over multispectral thermal imaging by mapping surface materials and lithologic units with subtle spectral differences in mineralogy.

In this paper, we examine the patterns observed in metrics calculated for a time series of 8 years over the southwest of Western Australia-an important crop and animal production area of Australia. Four analytical approaches were used; calculation of temporal mean and standard deviation layers for selected metrics showing significant spatial variability; classification based on temporal and spatial patterns of key NDVI metrics; metrics were analyzed for eight areas typical of climatic and production systems across the agricultural zone; and relationships between total production and productivity measured by dry sheep equivalents were developed with time integrated NDVI (TINDVI). Two metrics showed clear spatial patterns; the season duration based on the smooth curve produced seven zones based on increasing length of growing season; and TINDVI provided a set of classes characterized by differences in overall magnitude of response, and differences in response in particular years. Frequency histograms of TINDVI could be grouped on the basis of a simple shape classification: tall and narrow with high, medium or low mean indicating most land is responsive agricultural cover with uniform seasonal conditions; broad and short indicating that land is of mixed cover type or seasonal conditions are not spatially uniform. TINDVI showed a relationship to agricultural productivity that is dependent on the extent to which crop or total agricultural production was directly reduced by rainfall deficiency. TINDVI proved most sensitive to crop productivity for Statistical Local Areas (SLAs) having rainfall less than 600 mm, and in years when rainfall and crop production were highly correlated. It is concluded that metrics from standardized NDVI time series could be routinely and transparently used for retrospective assessment of seasonal conditions and changes in vegetation responses and cover.

Degradation of the solar diffuser is 2.3% at 0.412 mum, known to an uncertainty of +/-0.5%. Solar diffuser degradation for wavelengths longer that 0.5 mum is indistinguishable from the uncertainty in trend determination for the first year. Mirror side degradation at 0.412 mum is 6 +/- 0.5%, with a mirror side difference of an additional 3%.

Data were acquired using a Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) and an Airborne Laser Terrain Mapping (ALTM) 1020 instrument in midsummer for study sites in the New Forest, England, along with concomitant in situ measurements of canopy properties. The stands used displayed a wide variation in the biophysical and biochemical properties of interest. When employing the imaging spectrometer data alone, there were no relationships between any spectral variables (band reflectance, band ratios, or first derivatives of reflectance) and canopy biophysical and biochemical properties when both broad-leaved and coniferous stands were analysed as a combined data set. However, for the broad-leaved stands alone, curvilinear relationships were found between the wavelength position of the red edge (ARE) and pigment concentrations per unit ground area (e.g., R-2=0.88** for chlorophyll a [Chl a]) and per unit leaf mass (e.g., R-2=0.76** for Chl a). The predictive value of these models was somewhat limited; for example, the root mean squared error (RMSE) was 300 Mg m(-2) (27% of the mean) for Chl a concentration per unit ground area and 1.17 mg g(-1) (24% of the mean) for Chl a concentration per unit leaf mass. A ratio of a near-infrared and a green band (865 nm/553 nm) was linearly related to leaf area index (LAI) of the broad-leaved stands (R-2=0.71**) and the regression model was a reasonable predictor of the LAI for the independent test sites (RMSE=0.88; 18.6% of the mean). Canopy height information derived from the ALTM data was used to mask out canopy gap areas from the CASI imagery of each stand. This process had limited impact on the relationships between spectral and canopy variables for the broad-leaved stands, and lambda(RE) remained unrelated to pigment concentrations per unit ground area for the coniferous stands. However, the masking process substantially improved the strength of the relationship between lambda(RE) and pigment concentrations per unit leaf mass for the coniferous stands (e.g., for Chl a R-2=0.85**; RMSE of prediction=0.84 mg g(-1) [22% of the mean]). Therefore, the study demonstrates that for broad-leaved stands, spectral models can be applied to imaging spectrometer data to quantify forest pigments and LAI with moderate accuracy. For coniferous stands, the use of LIDAR data to remove canopy gap areas from the CASI imagery considerably increases the accuracy of spectral predictive models for quantifying pigment concentrations per unit leaf mass.

The power spectrum exponent beta values for the Landsat TM2 (visible) and ERS-1 images over the same surface are associated to the intrinsic properties of the different sensor type and postprocessing of the data. Differences in the beta values were observed between eroded area (Blue Nile Canyon, BNC) and relatively noneroded area (plateau, PLA) for all data sets. These differences are associated to the mechanical erosion of the plateau. The remotely sensed data fields show scaling from 35 in to 15 km, with no break at 1.5 km, and are highly multifractal. Analyses of the Landsat TM bands over each area demonstrated something particular: beta values for bands in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) range differed from beta values for bands in the visible spectrum range in the plateau area by about 0,48, while in the drainage area, this difference is around 0.13. Landsat TM SWIR bands are sensitive to spectral signature of clay minerals, while data in the visible spectrum range mostly depict topography gradients. Two concurrent processes are highlighted, mechanical erosion and chemical erosion/deposition, which interact to produce the observed differences. In the drainage area, where cliffs and steep slopes are present and mechanical erosion intensively occurs, the alteration minerals are remobilized quickly, whereas in the plateau area, mechanical erosion is low, and alteration mineral deposition is less disturbed. Such new statistical highlights of topographic versus chemical surfaces will have to be taken into account in landforming models. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The model assumes certain principles of geometric models, e.g., that sensor integrates the radiance reflected from tree plants, shaded soil, and illuminated soil. However, the model attempts to compensate for errors due to multiple scattering in vegetation canopies that lead to nonlinear mixing. In contrast to geometric models, tree crowns are treated as porous (partially transmitting), geometric bodies. Reflectance of canopy and shadowed ground are nonlinear mixtures of leaves and background signatures, which are moreover influenced by parameters of canopy, such as leaf area index (LAI), coefficient of attenuation, and leaves transmittance. Optical parameters are not constant but stochastic variables are controlled by a certain texture in canopy envelopes, and roughness and relief in surface background. The model may also be run using backgrounds presenting variable topography and comprising different landscape features on imported real images. The model predicts the basic features of the Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF), i.e., bowl shape and the hotspot, but unlike common models, it is well suited to address the spectral and spatial domains. For example, the model provides a fast and efficient strategy to derive hyperspectral images at appropriate spatial resolutions (e.g., regional scale) over a wide range of ecosystems.

These spectral/biophysical relationships were compared to 1996 field data from the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in northeastern Oklahoma and showed no consistent biases, with most regression estimates falling within the respective 95% confidence intervals. Biophysical parameters were estimated for 21 \"ground pixels\" (grids) at the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in 1996, representing three grazing/burning treatments. Each grid was 30 x 30 in in size and was systematically sampled with ground radiometer readings. The radiometric measurements were then converted to biophysical parameters and spatially interpolated using geostatistical kriging. Grid-based biophysical parameters were monitored through the growing season and regressed against Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) NDVI (r(2) = .92-.94). These regression equations were used to estimate biophysical parameters for grassland TM pixels over the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in 1996. This method maintained consistent regression development and prediction scales and attempted to minimize scaling problems associated with mixed land cover pixels. A method for scaling Landsat biophysical parameters to coarser resolution satellite data sets (I km(2)) was also investigated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Such a shortcoming stems from the lack of consistent angular data sets with an adequate resolution at global scale. In this context. the POLDER instrument is particularly relevant because it acquires directional radiance signatures at a high angular resolution and thereby provides the first global BRDF product. In this paper, we investigate how to discriminate vegetation types in using only a portion of the BRIDE in particular, the two paramount directional signatures, which are the maximum (hot spot) and the minimum (dark spot) of reflectance observed in the backscattering and forward scattering regions, respectively. A directional index hot-dark spot (HDS) is formulated using these two signatures. It is defined as the normalized difference between the reflectances at the hot spot and dark spot. It is shown that the HDS can be linearly related with the foliage clumping index for three different vegetation types observed by the spaceborne POLDER sensor. The significance of the clumping index mapping for ecological studies is evaluated using the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS). Considering foliage clumping in BEPS, the estimation of daily canopy photosynthesis can differ about 20% for a black spruce site.

Empirical linear relationships, such as rho (0.469) = 0.25(rho2.1); rho (0.555) = 0.33(rho2.1); rho (0.645) = 0.5(rho2.1); and rho (0.645) = 0.66(rho1.6), were found to be statistically significant and consistent with previous findings. Based on the above relationships, a modified vegetation index (VI) is proposed and named Aerosol Free Vegetation Index (AFRI). Two versions of this VI are formulated as: AFRI(1.6) = (rho (NIR) - 0 66 rho (1.6))/(rho (NIR) + 0.66 rho (1.6)) and AFRI(2.1) = (rho (NIR) - 0.5 rho (2.1))/(rho (NIR) + 0.5 rho (2.1)). It is shown that under clear sky conditions, the AFRIs (and especially AFRI(2.1)) closely resemble the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and their values are almost identical. The advantage of the derived AFRIs, based on the ability of the SWIR bands is to penetrate the atmospheric column even when aerosols such as smoke or sulfates exist. Consequently, these indices have a major application in assessing vegetation in the presence of smoke, anthropogenic pollution, or volcanic plumes. This was demonstrated by applying the AFRI for a biomass burned forest in Brazil. Limited success of these indices is expected in case of dust due to presence of larger particles that are of similar size to the wavelength and therefore not transparent at 2.1 mum. The AFRIs can be implemented to data from any sensor that has the SWIR bands. Currently the most commonly used of such instruments are the Landsat-Thematic Mapper (TM) and Advanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection (ASTER), and Japanese Earth Resources Satellite-Optical System (JERS-OPS). Although the AFRI(2.1) was demonstrated to perform better than the AFRI(1.6), the latter still can be used for the same application in conjunction with instruments that have onboard only the 1.6-mum band, such as Systeme Probatoire d\'Observation del la Terre (SPOT4)-VEGETATION, Indian Remote Sensing (IRS-IC/D), and Resource-21.

The POLDER data used consisted of narrow-band 0.67- and 0.765-mum reflectances corrected for ozone and water vapor absorption and Rayleigh scattering effects. The AVHRR visible (0.55-0.75 mum) and near-IR (0.68-1.05 mum) data were converted to reflectances, screened for clouds, and corrected for the same atmospheric effects as the POLDER data. Neither POLDER nor AVHRR data were collected for aerosol effects. POLDER reflectances were used to derive bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) for each 6-km(2) POLDER grid box. The BRDFs were normalized to the near-nadir values at 45 degrees solar zenith angle, resulting in the anisotropic factors, which were derived for each month for each grid box. Thus, seasonal variability of local anisotropy for each POLDER, grid box in the target areas was established. The anisotropic factors were then applied to the AVHRR/GAC visible and near-IR reflectances mapped into the POLDER grid. The anisotropy-corrected AVHRR reflectances exhibit less fluctuation than the original uncorrected values, thus, facilitating the interpretation of short-term variability in surface conditions. Application of the POLDER BRDFs to AVHRR data is especially advantageous for processing AVHRR temporal composites because of the scarce angular statistics in the areas of frequent clouds, which hampers derivation of BRDFs from AVHRR data itself. Assuming that the local BRDF does not substantially vary from year to year, this approach could be extended to data from the growing seasons of other years. Ultimately, the multiyear time series could be corrected so that the variability, related to angular effects, inherent to AVHRR time series, is reduced. The current approach suggests a paradigm for a synergistic use of TERRA/EOS Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR)/MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data stream.

Three of the algorithms are based on the Temperature-Independent Spectral Indices (TISI) concept using atmospherically corrected channels 3,4, and/or 5, namely: (1) TISIBL, (2) TS-RAM, and (3) Delta day. The fourth is a simplified method based on the estimation of epsilon using atmospherically corrected data in the visible and near-infrared channels, called Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Thresholds Method (NDVITHM). This method integrates a wide spectral data set of bare soil reflectivity measurements in the 0.4-14-mum band and uses different approaches in function of the NDVI value. All methods have been applied to the Iberian Peninsula using AVHRR/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA-14) data during March 17th, 1997. In terms of emissivity, the results dhow that the difference between the NDVITHM method and the other methods is always positive, with a bias of less than 0.010 and a root mean square (rms) error of 0.012 when compared to the TS-RAM method. In terms of land surface temperature, the NDVITHM method shows a bias of less than -0.4 K when compared to Delta day, and a bias of -1.1 K and an rms error of 0.5 K when compared to TS-RAM. In conclusion, although the TISIBL is a precise method, it needs the AVHRR channel 3 for its application, which is not alway available, for example, as in the AVHRR archives provided in the frame of the Pathfinder AVHRR Land project (more than 18 years of data). In this case we have shown that he NDVITHM method shows promising results and can be applied to obtain land surface temperature and emissivity from NOAA data without losing accuracy.

Evaluation of biological and environmental factors determining variability of RUE for daily total gross photosynthesis within and among species suggests a biophysically based approach for estimating daily total grass photosynthesis using satellite and ancillary data. Calculations have been done using leaf photosynthesis and canopy characteristics derived from field measure ments for six cultivated herbaceous and 12 uncultivated (herbaceous and needle leaf and broadleaf woody) species, and mixed species stands of temperate deciduous forest and tropical moist and dry forests. These data are for 65 canopies, divided about equally between cultivated and uncultivated species, and the leaf area index varies between 0.6 and 9.5. A model for instantaneous canopy photosynthesis, considering sunlit and shaded leaves, variation of maximum rate of leaf photosynthesis within the canopy, and a solution of the radiative transfer equation for propagation of direct and diffuse PAR, is numerically integrated in space (angular variation of radiances and depth within the canopy) and time (diurnal variation) to obtain daily total gross photosynthesis and IPAR for varied incident irradiances. The results show that the maximum rate of leaf photosynthesis and magnitudes of direct and diffuse irradiance incident on the canopy are the major factors determining RUE for unstressed conditions. Also, while woody species on the average have lower RUE, they are found to utilize diffuse radiation more efficiently them cultivated species. Comparison of calculated RUE with observations for 10 cultivated species in varied environment gave differences of -23% to +11% for individual species, but aggregately they have almost equal coefficient of variation (similar to 25%) and their averages differ by -6% (underestimation), Monthly and annual gross photosynthesis determined using satellite and ancillary data are obtained for rainforest (in Brazil), boreal forest (in Canada), and cropland (in the United States). Annual photosynthesis calculated using satellite data for the three biomes differed from, that determined from field measurements by -29% to +15%, averaging to +6%. The above error estimates for RUE and photosynthesis are obtained without calibrating any model parameter.

The simulated spectral and directional reflectances showed good agreement among the four models. A 1997 airborne experiment in the United States was used to test their performance on real data. This experiment gathered a unique data set composed primarily of 200 reflectance spectra acquired over corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max) fields, and the corresponding ground truth (chlorophyll a+b content and leaf area index), Only the first three models, which ran fast enough to allow the processing of a large data set, Lc;ere actually inverted by iterative optimization techniques, Inversions were conducted in successive stages where the number of retrieved parameters was reduced.

Widespread acceptance of this product by the user communities is dependent, in part, on a comprehensive and rigorous programme of calibration and validation. Since the MODIS albedo product will be produced at a spatial resolution of 1 km, while measurements obtained from field instruments typically relate to areas of only a few tens of meters, this requires an understanding of the spatial variability of land surface albedo and a robust means of scaling zip from field to satellite measurements. In this article, we examine these issues for a semidesert environment (the PROVE\'97 field site at Jornada, New Mexico, USA). Spatial variations in field measurements of broadband albedo are related to the functional ground cover of different scene elements (live and senescent vegetation, soil and shadow) via a simple linear mixture model. Information on the fractional ground cover of the scene elements is derived from ground-based hemispherical photography. It is shown that the albedo values predicted by the mixture model are accurate to within 2% of the corresponding measured values. This approach offers considerable potential for the validation of MODIS-derived albedo values through the use of spectral mixture modelling applied to fine spatial resolution satellite sensor images.

The coupled model is validated with POLDER and AVHRR imagery collected in a semiarid: site during the Jornada PROVE\'97 campaign with good accuracy.

The reflected signal from a given GPS satellite is cross-correlated with the pseudorandom noise code uniquely identifying that satellite. The shape of this cross-correlation, ordinarily, a very sharp triangle when tracking a direct line of sight signal, becomes wider and smoother as the mean square slope of the reflecting surface increases. It is proposed that the surface wind speed can be determined by matching the recorded shape of this cross-correlation to that predicted by theoretical models as a function od wind speed and direction. The significance of these effects increases with altitude of the receiver. Experimental data have been collected using a specially modified GPS receiver on aircraft and on a balloon at altitudes of up to 25 km. these data compare favorably with predictions of analytical models and demonstrate the dependence of the waveform shape on surface wind speed and receiver altitude. The advantages that this measurement technique has over conventional scatterometers is the small size, low cost and simplicity of the receiver hardware, no requirement for a transmitter, and the ability to simultaneously collect data from usually 10 or more points (from a low earth-orbiting satellite). This number could be larger if the Russian Global Navigation Satellite System satellites are also considered as additional sources of radiation. Furthermore, the bistatic scattering geometry is complementary to the backscatter used by conventional scatterometers.

A major drawback of the polynomial regression model is that it does not capture the random characteristic of terrain elevation. In fact, the distortion of a remote sensing image is attributed to the variation of terrain elevation and orbital parameters, the variations being random in nature. A more effective approach of remote sensing image rectification is a stochastic approach that takes into account the spatial variation structure of terrain elevation. This article presents an anisotropic spatial modeling approach of image rectification using ordinary kriging estimation. By considering the residuals of polynomial trend mapping as anisotropic random fields, the proposed approach models separately the spatial variation structures of the residuals in X and Y directions, and employs the ordinary kriging method for spatial interpolation of the residual random fields. By means of a cross validation procedure, residuals of image rectification by the polynomial trend mapping, the multiquadric interpolation function, and the ordinary kriging approaches are compared. The ordinary kriging approach yields smallest variances and root-mean-squared of mapping errors. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.', 'Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.

Ground-based measurements of the directional distribution of the reflected radiation over the hemisphere (so-called BRDFs=bidirectional reflectance distribution functions) were made on the Morteratschgletscher (Switzerland) in Landsat TM bands 2 (520-600 nm) and 4 (760-900 nm). These BRDFs cover a wide range of solar zenith angles (26-75 degrees) and surface characteristics (quantified by a variation in the spectrally integrated albedo between 0.14 and 0.50). All BRDFs exhibit a similar pattern with a minimum in the nadir direction and a maximum in the forward limb, but the amount of a anisotropy increases with increasing wavelength, with increasing solar zenith angle and with decreasing albedo. The data were used to derive parametrizations rations (one for each TM band) which relate the bidirectional reflectance (the reflectance in a specific direction) to the albedo for a given solar-view geometry. Specific parametrisations (one for each TM band) for near-nadir reflection\" are also presented. All these parameterizations can be used to convert satellite-derived bidirectional reflectances into surface albedos and thus do correct for anisotropic reflectance. The residual uncertainty in the albedo due to inaccuracy of the correction is estimated to be 0.02 in both TM bands.

However, the signal from other landscape features, such as topography, vegetation, and surface roughness, may overwhelm and confound the soil moisture signal. Previous researchers tried to correct for topographic effects using incident angle (theta) as the most significant landscape variable. Those corrections were not effective because of the poor correlation between the SAR backscatter coefficient (sigma(0)) and theta. This may be attributed to surface roughness, vegetation effects, or low resolution digital elevation data. In this article, we determined the effects of vegetation, surface roughness, and topography on sigma(0). By comparing the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the SAR-based vegetation index (SBVI), it was found that the sparse vegetation cover of sagebrush in the rangeland areas of the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) does not affect L band HH polarization SAR sigma(0). Root mean square (RMS) height of surface (h), determined using L band copolarized SAR sigma(0) in an empirical algorithm (Dubois et al., 1995), helped in stratifying the study area into low and high surface roughness areas. The high surface roughness areas, determined using the algorithm, were found to match with very rocky and extremely rocky areas, classified using detailed soil type information in a Geographic Information System (GIS).

This eight-class classification, combining the two zones appeared to represent regional distribution of the major types quite well. The pasture land cover classification was evaluated for selected LGAs by using agricultural statistics and a specialist pasture survey.

The stem-map data set consists of 75 plots subsetted from a single 32 ha stem-mapped stand, with measurements of their canopy height profiles made using the SLICER (Scanning Lidar Imager of Canopies by Echo Recovery) instrument, an airborne surface lidar system. Four height indices, maximum, median, mean, and quadratic mean canopy height (QMCH) were calculated from the canopy height profiles. Regressions between the indices and stand basal area and biomass were developed using the chronosequence data set. The regression equations developed from the chronosequence data set were then applied to height indices calculated from the remotely sensed canopy height profiles from the stem map data set, and the ability of the regression equations to predict the stem map plot\'s stand structure attributes was then evaluated. The QMCH was found to explain the most variance in the chronosequence data set\'s stand structure attributes, and to most accurately predict the values of the same attributes in the stem map data set. For the chronosequence data set, the QMCH predicted 70% of variance in stand basal area, and 80% of variance in aboveground biomass, and remained nonasymptotic with basal areas up to 50 m(2) ha(-1), and aboveground biomass values up to 450 Mg ha(-1). When applies to the stem-map data set, the regression equations resulted in basal areas that were, on average, underestimated by 2.1 m(2) ha(-1), and biomass values were underestimated by 16 Mg ha(-1), and explained 37% and 33% of variance, respectively. Differences in the magnitude of the coefficients of determination were due to the wider range of stand conditions found in the chronosequence data set; the standard deviation of residual values were lower in the stem map data set than on the chronosequence data sets. Stepwise multiple regression was performed to predict the two stand structure attributes using the canopy height profile data directly as independent variables, but they did not improve the accuracy of the estimates over the height index approach.

In the midinfrared spectral region, the ground radiance is a combination, of a radiance emitted by the surface and a reflected radiance due to sun irradiation. Using combined day/night AVHRR data, the emitted part of the radiance is estimated allowing; for the determination of the reflected part. Emphasis is placed on the accuracy achievable on the measurement of the reflectivity in AVHRR Channel 3. A detailed sensitivity analysis of the method is performed, taking into account the different sources of error. The analysis is applied to series of images covering a region of Northern Africa. Atmospheric corrections are performed using the MODTRAN code with atmospheric data extracted from the AVISO (Meteo France) data base. Processing a large number of orbits gives access to a wide range of satellite view angles. Furthermore, use of morning NOAA 12 and noon NOAA 14 overpasses leads to essentially two Sun illumination directions (principal and perpendicular planes). For several selected areas, the angular reflectivity is represented along with absolute error. Reflectivity exhibits a large angular variation demonstrating a non-Lambertian behavior at the scale of the measurements. The levels of reflectivity are different from one area to another. A simple semiempirical model is used to represent the angular reflectivity. Emissivity in Channel 3, retrieved from reflectivity by means of an angular form factor, may exhibit strong variations for large angles (>18%). If angular variation of reflectivity is not taken into account, error on emissivity can be up to 15% for the areas studied in this work.

Resulting fraction images are interpreted in terms of crop vitality (level of green biomass) in relation to stress presence and compared to field knowledge.

This work shows the interest of the approach combining PCA and unmixing for stress detection and napping of agronomic variables, with a good accuracy compared to spectral ratio analysis. It provides relevant support for crop monitoring and precision agriculture, by means of numerical cartographic products obtained by hyper- (super-) spectral remote sensing. It demonstrates the need for improved methodologies derived from hyperspectral data analysis, and reveals that, through such methods, one can, however, retrieve a significant amount of information with limited number of spectral channels (10-20), highlighting the potential of superspectral observations.

The data collected during this campaign allows Its to test the model predictions under different soil surface and canopy conditions and for different radar configurations. In general, both models are capable of mimicking the change in backscattering due to changes in radar configuration nod surface-vegetation characteristics. Next, both models are subjected to a sensitivity analysis with respect to different surface and canopy parameters. Based on this.sensitivity analysis, it is concluded that estimates of surface soil moisture content under a medium sugar beet cover (15 cm high crop) from L-band radar observations are only possible within 10% accuracy. For a fully developed sugar beet field (50 nn high crop), soil moisture retrieval is not possible.

Stage 1 models use measurements of landscape spatial properties to estimate the slopes nad intercepts of proportion transition relationships between fine- and coarse-resolution classes within randomly located pixel blocks. Following this step, a Stage II model uses a linear estimator to predict true class proportions based on measured coarse-scale proportions and the slope and intercept estimates from the Stage I models. Model development and testing on a training site is followed by testing and inversion for a validation site. Model inversion involves using spatial variables measured only at the coarse resolution as input to the Stage I models.

We investigated this phenomenon by measuring emission spectra of both undisturbed (in situ) and disturbed soils (prepared as if for transport to the laboratory). The disturbed soils had much less spectral contrast than the undisturbed soils in the resistrahlen region near 9 mu m. While the increased porosity of a disturbed soil can decrease spectral contrast due to multiple scattering, we hypothesize that the effect is dominantly the result of a difference in grain-site distribution of the optically active layer (i.e., fine particle coatings). This concept was proposed by Salisbury et al. (1994) to explain their observations that soils washed free of small particles adhering to larger grains exhibited greater spectral contrast than unwashed soils. Our laboratory reflectance spectra of wet- and dry-sieved soils returned from field sites also show greater spectral contrast for wet-sieved (washed) soils. We therefore propose that undisturbed soils in the field can be characterized as \"clean\" soils (washed free of fine particles at the surface due to rain and wind action) and that disturbed soils represent \"dirty\" soils (contaminated with fine particle coatings). The effect of packing soils in the field and laboratory also increases spectral contrast but not to the magnitude of that observed for undisturbed and wet-sieved soils. Since it is a common practice to use laboratory spectra of field samples to interpret spectra obtained remotely, we suggest that the influence of fine particle coatings on disturbed soils, if unrecognized, could influence interpretations of remote sensing data.

Assessment of reclamation in the Western Desert and coastal areas over six time periods indicates continued high rates of reclamation. Between 1986 and 1993, the amount of cultivated land in these regions increased by 43.3%.

The data consist of cloud free AVHRR images over the ocean west of Tasmania and simultaneous sun photometer measurements of aerosol optical depth at Cape Grim, some 50 km from the ocean target. Ancilliary surface meteorological data are also employed.

However, differences among results from the various methods suggests that ultimate accuracy in the determination of sensor gain is limited to similar to +/- 5%. Spurious results are obtained when the aerosol depth measured at Cape Grim does not characterize the airmass over the ocean target. This situation can arise when winds are light and variable in direction during the observing period. Under these circumstances it is not valid to use the sun photometer aerosol optical depths to model the upwelling radiance over the ocean.

The effects of these factors are theoretically and practically analyzed on two SPOT-HRV and Landsat-TM images acquired the same day over the same area in southeast France. Some simplified correction methods are proposed. The results show that: i) The conversion of digital counts into apparent reflectance is the most important step for NDVI correction. Without this correction, a relatively constant error affects NDVI depending on the sensor considered (- 0.18 for SPOT-HRV and - 0.10 for Landsat TM). ii) The MTF correction does not affect the average NDVI value; its interest is to restore the radiometric level of individual pixels that have a large contrast with their surroundings. iii) The atmospheric effects are similar in the homologous spectral bands of SPOT-HRV and Landsat TM. Their correction increases the dynamic range of NDVI variation (around 24% in the example presented) and consequently the contrast between different targets. The effect of the noncoincidence of SPOT-HRV and Landsat-TM spectral bands is also studied. This effect can be considered either as a source of error or as a supplementary source of information.

The first EOF-amplitude pair also describes the seasonal cycle in SST. Both results are consistent with long-term, large-scale, mean ship-board data for the region. The second EOF-amplitude pair defines two distinct regions paralleling the coast. The inshore region coincides with the coastal zone of Lynn and Simpson (1987), and the adjacent region farther offshore is identical to their transition zone.  The third through fifth EOF-amplitude pairs primarily represent meandering of the California Current and anticyclonic mesoscale eddy occurrences in the region; these results also are consonant with a large number of shipboard observations. The EOF results provide independent satellite-derived evidence for the existence of a transition zone off Baja California which is similar to that found off central and southern California.

Simulated pixels were parameterized with tree density and height for each tree (> 3 cm dbh) covering a 200 m x 150 m area from an immature, conifer-dominated stand in the Northern Experimental Forest located near Howland, Maine. Airborne synthetic aperture radar (AIRSAR) imagery from the stand was used to evaluate the ability of the model to predict single pixel and textural patterns at 12.1 m resolution. Although the model was unable to accurately predict pixel-by-pixel responses, probably due to registration error, textural patterns from the HH polarized image were correlated to the simulated patterns. The model\'s assumption Of randomly distributed sterns within each pixel was another probable source of error as trees in this stand were aggregated at scales from 1 m to 50 m. Despite model inadequacies, significant pattern was found at all simulated backscatter resolutions for all polarizations for most quadrat sizes (< 10,000 m2), but only for smaller quadrat sizes (< 6,000 m2) for within-pixel structural properties (i.e., stem, branch, and leaf biomasses, stem density, and average height).

The remote sensing of blue and red fluorescence signatures appears to be a suitable future tool to determine the state of health of plants. In this contribution we report about major factors which determine the intensities of the UV-laser (337 nm) excited blue fluorescence near 450 nm and the red chlorophyll fluorescence between 650 nm and 800 nm as well as the ratio of the blue to the red fluorescence F450/F690. In contrast to green plants grown in a phytochamber or at low light intensities, plants grown in the field at a high photon flux density (PFD) showed high values for the ratio of the blue to the red fluorescence F450/F690, which was due to a relatively low intensity of the red chlorophyll fluorescence. The strongly increased ratio F450/F690 was primarily caused by a much reduced penetration depth of the exciting UV light into the leaf which seemed to be due to substances absorbing in the epidermal layers. Etiolated wheat leaves exhibited a stronger blue fluorescence intensity than green leaves and showed also a small maximum around 530 nm (green fluorescence). White leaves of wheat treated with the bleaching herbicide norfluorazone (10(-4) M) and leaves from which the photosynthetic pigments had been extracted by acetone showed a fourfold and tenfold increase of the blue fluorescence, respectively. Isolated chloroplasts and thylakoids did not exhibit a blue-green fluorescence. It is concluded that the blue fluorescence is mainly caused by phenolic plant substances located in the cell wall and/or vacuoles of leaves.

The ecological impacts of the natural global cycles of gases and particulates in the earth\'s atmosphere are highly influenced by the extent of \'\'changes\'\' to vegative canopy characteristics which dictates the need for a capability to detect and assess the magnitude of such changes. The primary emphasis of this paper is on the determination of the size and configuration of the sampling unit that maximizes the probability of its intersection with a \'\'change\'\' area. Assessment of the significance of the \'\'change\'\' in a given locality is also addressed and relies on a statistical approach that compares the number of elemental units (e.g., pixels) exceeding a reflectance threshold when compared to a previous point in time. Consideration is also given to a technical framework that supports quantifying the magnitude of the \'\'change\'\' over large areas (i.e., at regional, continental, and global levels-e.g., the estimated area changing from forest to agricultural land-use).

The computer generation uses a modified Lindenmayer system (L-system) approach. With this approach, one can, in a simple way, generate objects of arbitrary shapes (such as plants and trees and their canopies, houses of various shapes, and mountains) as well as simulation of their growth, dynamics, and movement. In rendering an object on a computer screen, the object is divided into facets (triangles and quadrilaterals), and some existing and some new computer graphics techniques are used to display the object, with shading and shadowing appropriately taken into account. These rendering techniques are also used, in an innovative way, to calculate the scattering and reflectance from the object. The use of the technique is illustrated with scattering from canopies of simulated corn plants. The scattering is quantified using traditional measures like bidirectional reflectance factor and albedo as well as rendering of the canopies with brightness of a facet proportional to the amount of light scattered from the object in the viewer\'s direction.RP GOEL, NS (通讯作者)，SUNY BINGHAMPTON, DEPT SYST SCI, POB 6000, BINGHAMTON, NY 13902 USA.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 37, 87, 106, 1, 14, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

We first limit the start and end dates according to the sea ice concentration (SIC). Then, we exclude false freezing signals by identifying high variability in SIC; finally, we consider changes in the distribution of sea ice types (first-year ice and multiyear ice) over time to obtain an improved algorithm. The early freeze onset (EFO) and FO derived from the AMSR data are then compared with results derived from the surface air tem-perature and sea skin temperature (SAT & SKT) and SSM/I products. The spatial distribution of the new EFO results shows greater consistency with SAT & SKT than with the results of SSM/I, with a mean error, absolute error, and root mean square error for the SAT & SKT comparison of 3.7 days, 10.4 days, and 16.0 days, respectively, for the AMSR2 period. The improved FO and EFO correct the small values caused by misidentified summer melt signals and the large values caused by sea ice dynamic processes after the melt season. There is a constant change in ice type over 20%-30% of the ice cover, and the improved FO and EFO correct for anomalies due to misidentified ice types. The improved results correlate better with the interannual variability in EFO derived from SAT & SKT in subregions, especially in ice marginal regions. The Arctic sea ice EFO north of 70 degrees N was delayed at a rate of 6.4 day/dec from 2003 to 2021, with remarkable trends found in the Laptev (14.6 day/ dec) and Kara (14.1 day/dec) Seas.', '[Qu, Zhifeng; Su, Jie] Ocean Univ China, Frontier Sci Ctr Deep Ocean Multispheres & Earth S, Qingdao, Peoples R China.

In this work, we applied the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC)-based vicarious calibration technique over Libya-4 desert site to perform calibration analysis of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on Suomi National Polarorbiting Partnership (SNPP) and NOAA-20 satellites. For both VIIRS sensors we characterized residual linear calibration trends and cross-calibrated both sensors to MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua regarded as a calibration standard. The relative spectral response (RSR) differences were accounted for using the German Aerospace Center (DLR) Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) hyperspectral surface reflectance data. Our results agree with independent vicarious calibration results of both the MODIS/VIIRS Characterization Support Team as well as the CERES Imager and Geostationary Calibration Group within estimated uncertainty of 1-2%. Analysis of MAIAC geophysical products with the new calibration shows a high level of agreement of MAIAC aerosol, surface reflectance and NDVI records between MODIS and VIIRS. Excluding high aerosol optical depth (AOD), all three sensors agree in AOD with mean difference (MD) less than 0.01 and residual mean squared difference rmsd - 0.04. Spectral geometrically normalized surface reflectance agrees within rmsd of 0.003-0.005 in the visible and 0.01-0.012 at longer wavelengths. The residual surface reflectance differences are fully explained by differences in spectral filter functions. Finally, difference in NDVI is characterized by rmsd 0.02 and MD less than 0.003 for NDVI based on VIIRS imagery bands I1/I2 and less than 0.01 for NDVI based on VIIRS radiometric bands M5/M7.

However, there is an urgent need to enhance such monitoring methods with automated direct driver attributions to detected disturbances. This would provide important additional information to make forest disturbance alerts more actionable and useful for uptake by different stakeholders. In this study, we demonstrate spatially explicit and near real-time methods to monitor direct drivers of small-scale tropical forest disturbance across a range of tropical forest conditions in Suriname, the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We trained a convolutional neural network with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to continuously classify newly detected RAdar for Detecting Deforestation (RADD) alerts as smallholder agriculture, road development, selective logging, mining or other. Different monitoring scenarios were evaluated based on varying sensor combinations, post-disturbance time periods and confidence levels. In general, the use of Sentinel-2 data was found to be most accurate for driver classifications, especially with data composited over a period of 4 to 6 months after the disturbance detection. Sentinel-1 data showed to be valuable for more rapid classifications of specific drivers, especially in areas with persistent cloud cover. Throughout all monitoring scenarios, smallholder agriculture was classified most accurately, while road development, selective logging and mining were more challenging to distinguish. An accuracy assessment throughout the full extent of our study regions revealed a Macro-F1 score of 0.861 and an Overall Accuracy of 0.897 for the best performing model, based on the use of 6-month post-disturbance Sentinel-2 composites. Finally, we addressed three specific monitoring use cases that relate to rapid law enforcement against illegal activities, ecological impact assessments and timely carbon emission reporting, by optimizing the trade-off in classification timeliness and confidence to reach required accuracies.

However, detailed knowledge about changes in carbon stocks remain uncertain as only few studies have used remotely sensed vegetation products for moni-toring spatial and temporal changes of aboveground live biomass carbon (AGC) in that region. This study aims at evaluating optical-and microwave-based vegetation proxies (i.e., LAI, percent tree cover (PTC), L-/X-/C-band vegetation optical depths (VOD)) for understanding the spatio-temporal variations of tropical Asian AGC be-tween 2013 and 2019.Our results indicated that the spatial distributions of L-VOD and PTC were highly spatially correlated with four benchmark AGC maps used for comparison (R > 0.79 and R > 0.75, respectively). By employing L-VOD as the reference data in assessing AGC dynamics, the X-/C-VOD showed advantages in capturing AGC changes for low-medium (20-40 Mg C/ha) carbon density vegetation, respectively, while other vegetation proxies showed limited capabilities. All proxies presented limitations in tracking AGC dynamics at high AGC density (> 60 Mg C/ ha). Tropical Asian AGC stocks estimated using the L-VOD product indicated that tropical Asia accumulated carbon in biomass at a rate of +44+39+53 Tg C/yr between 2013 and 2019. This small sink is dominated by non-forest biomes (65.9%). The non-forest regions in southern India, southwest China, and southern Vietnam and southwest China showed a continuous AGC increase while forests in northern Laos, Malaysia, and central Indonesia experienced continuous decreases between 2013 and 2019 caused by deforestation.', '[Cui, Tianxiang] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Nanjing 210042, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

Most existing studies either required auxiliary terrain data, e.g., Digital Terrain Model (DTM) provided by lidar data, or focused on flat terrains. It is still a great challenge to extract tree heights in mountainous forests only using UAV leaf-on stereoscopic imagery. An al-gorithm referred to as AGAR (i.e., Approximation of Ground using Allometric Relationship) is proposed in this study to estimate individual heights of visible trees on UAV stereoscopic imagery in mountainous natural forests. The central idea of the AGAR algorithm is firstly to approximate the understory terrain elevations (i.e., DTM) based on attributes of tree crowns (e.g., crown area) and the iterative adjustment of allometric equation co-efficients. Then individual tree heights are determined by differencing the elevation of crown tops with that of the approximated ground surface. The proposed algorithm was demonstrated at five sites with different terrain conditions by taking field measurements and ICESat-2 data as references, respectively. Results showed that the AGAR algorithm worked well on the estimation of tree heights at all sites. In contrast, the classical progressive triangulation filter (PTF) algorithm was susceptible to terrains and forest structures. The root mean square error (RMSE) and relative RMSE (rRMSE) of tree heights estimated by the PTF algorithm were 4.4 m -6.3 m and 32.6% -37.6%, respectively. They were decreased by the AGAR algorithm to 1.7 m -2.5 m and 12.6% -15.2%, respectively. The AGAR algorithm will substantially advance the application of UAV stereoscopic im-agery on the extraction of tree heights in the absence of other available terrain data, and will also open new horizons for application of decimeter or even centimeter spaceborne stereoscopic imagery on forest vertical structures in the future.', '[Yu, Tianyu; Ni, Wenjian; Zhao, Ruiqi; Zhang, Zhiyu] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

The goal of the OC-XGBRT AC algorithm is to improve the quality of ocean color satellite products over inland and coastal waters with AA and heavy aerosol loadings. The images acquired by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua satellite (MODIS-Aqua) over six regions with the cases of AA were utilized to assess the performance of OC-XGBRT. The Rrs(& lambda;) retrieved by OC-XGBRT were validated with in situ measurements from the Aerosol Robotic Network-Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) and the SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage (SeaBASS). The results showed that OC-XGBRT provided more accurate Rrs(412 nm) and Rrs(443 nm) products than the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) v7.5 standard near-infrared (NIR) AC algorithms, the POLYnomial-based approach established for the atmospheric correction of MERIS data (PLOYMER), and the Ocean Color-Simultaneous Marine and Aerosol Retrieval Tool (OC-SMART) over coastal and inland waters, with mean absolute percentage deviation (APD) and root mean square error (RMSE) values less than -36.9% and - 5.5 x 10-4 sr-1, respectively. Application results of OC-XGBRT in six typical regions further demonstrated that the quality of retrieved Rrs(412 nm) and Rrs(443 nm) had substantially improved compared with the original satellite products under the condition of AA.

This paper presents new approaches to utilization of reflectance for sea surface temperature (SST) remote sensing for the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR). SLSTR is an along-track scanning sensor with a complex instrumental viewing geometry, and no co-registration of the fields-of-view of reflectance and thermal pixels. Reflectance channels have twice the spatial resolution of thermal channels, and observations are placed on compatible \"image grids\" for the convenience of users of Level-1 data. We highlight limitations of simple methods, based on these image grids, of using reflectance imagery to inform cloud detection at the thermal resolution. We present improvements from averaging the N-nearest reflectance observations directly to the infrared instrument geometry, where N = 10 is chosen in this study when using the A and B stripes together. We show that the standard deviation of the N-nearest reflectance observations is another calculable quantity of use to improve the discrimination of clouds in the infrared image, beneficially reducing the weight placed on coarser-scale thermal spatial variability. The developments are illustrated by case studies in coastal zones over optically bright waters and around strong ocean fronts, and the benefit for SST products is quantified by the impacts on coverage and validation statistics. In a case study over optically bright waters, the clear-sky fraction increases from 46.2% to 93.1%. Coastal zone validation shows a 23.8-31.6% reduction in the false alarm rate and a corresponding 27.133.3% increase in the cloud detection true skill score. Globally the robust standard deviation for clear-sky matches between SLSTR-A and drifting buoys reduces from 0.3 to 0.29 with a 6% reduction in data due to improved screening of scattered cloud.', '[Bulgin, Claire E.; Faulkner, Agnieszka; Merchant, Christopher J.; McCarroll, Niall; Embury, Owen] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6AL, England.

This study introduces and tests a novel approach that integrates a spatial perspective into the dense Landsat time series analysis, called \"Object-Based COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance\" (OB-COLD). The new algorithm is based on the recognition that the pixels under effects of the same disturbance event often present similar spectral change concurrently in a short time; such pixels experiencing concurrent change could be grouped as an analytic spatial unit, namely \"change object\". OB-COLD first generates a change-magnitude snapshot every 60 days by applying per-pixel time series analysis to measure spectral change history. Then, an object-based change analysis is applied for each time-stamped snapshot: two levels of change objects are generated through over-segmentation and region merging; the changing area is determined by examining three object-level properties derived at different scales: the average change magnitude, the pre-change cover type, and the object size. Lastly, OB-COLD reconstructs model coefficients for each temporal segment based on the temporal breaks indicated by new snapshot-based change maps. We tested the new algorithm using 3000 randomly selected reference sample plots and eight Landsat ARD tiles across the continental United States. The accuracy assessment suggests that OB-COLD achieved 76.9% producer\'s accuracy, which is significantly higher than the per-pixel time series algorithm (i.e., COLD) (16.3 percentage increase) while keeping a comparable user\'s accuracies (58.7% vs. 57.8%). The quantitative and qualitative evaluations both suggest that OB-COLD could significantly reduce omission errors, particularly for stress disturbances. Most commission errors (73%) are attributed to agricultural practices and climate variability. The proposed algorithm is computationally scalable to large-scale spatiotemporal datasets with advanced cyberinfrastructure resources, holding great potential as the base detection algorithm for the next generation of land disturbance products.', '[Ye, Su; Zhu, Zhe] Univ Connecticut, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.

Unfortunately, the scarcity and unreliable performance of mainstream precipitation products in desert regions has prevented further research on the responses of desert ecosystems to climate change scenarios. By taking advantage of the spectral sensitivity of biocrusts to hydration, this study aims to examine the potential to monitor rainfall events using the spectral response of biocrusts. First, BRDF harmonization enhanced the rainfall-induced spectral response. Then, a detectability analysis was per-formed to clarify how influential factors affect the spectral response. Finally, a random forest (RF) model was developed to derive the temporal dynamic and spatial pattern of detectable rainfall events. The results show that rainfall events induce significant changes in biocrust spectra, especially within some spectral bands (i.e., SWIR, Red, and Blue) and indices (i.e., BSCI and NDVI). A rainfall event is detectable if the precipitation amount is >6 mm and recorded by satellites within 24 h. The RF model performs better (F1 score symbolscript 0.78) than the mainstream precipitation products (F1 score between 0.19 and 0.52) in temporal monitoring. Additionally, the model can delineate the spatial pattern of rainfall events well. These findings imply that this phenomenon has great po-tential for application in rainfall monitoring in desert areas, which could greatly contribute to understanding the mechanisms of desert ecological processes on a large scale.', '[Chen, Ruilin; Chen, Hui; Chen, Jin] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

Such estimates can be made by combining remote sensing derived land surface parameters with climate reanalysis data. We analysed to what degree generic (plant functional type (PFT)-independent) satellite-derived vegetation properties and climate reanalysis data can explain land surface fluxes and to what extent the PFT-specific information extends the flux simulations. For this purpose, we used the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model, which combines radiative transfer in plant leaves and vegetation canopies with photosynthesis and energy balance in a single model representation of the vegetation. We evaluated the performance of SCOPE in simulating fluxes by comparison to 63 eddy covariance sites representing 10 PFTs. We varied the sources of maximum carboxylation capacity (V-cmax25) and BallBerrySlope values (default vs literature), the seasonality of V-cmax25 and the meteorological forcing (locally measured and climate reanalysis). The average performance of daily flux in terms of root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 2.3 +/- 0.8 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) (R-2 = 0.74 +/- 0.12) for gross primary productivity (GPP), 24 +/- 8 W m(-2) (R-2 = 0.68 +/- 0.16) for latent heat flux (lambda E) and 50 +/- 15 W m(-2) (R(2)0.47 +/- 0.17) for sensible heat flux (H). The inter-site variability of the annual accumulated GPP flux was captured well with seasonally varying PFT-specific V-cmax25 (R-2 = 0.74, RMSE = 308 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and bias = -68 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The annual accumulated evapotranspiration (ET) was overestimated (R-2 = 0.31, RMSE = 101 mm yr(-1) and bias = 37 mm yr(-1)), mainly in the ecosystems with subtropical Mediterranean climate, for which the soil resistance to evaporation from porous space (r(ss)) had to be constrained from soil moisture content (SMC) or land surface temperature (LST).

In this study, a global seamless (without missing values) and high-resolution (30 arcsecond spatial res-olution) temperature (for both Ts and Ta) dataset (GSHTD) from 2001 to 2020 was developed. First, a method called the estimation of the temperature difference (ETD) was proposed to reconstruct both clear-and cloudy-sky Ts. A global seamless 8-day and monthly average all-and clear-sky Ts data were then created using the MODIS Ts data and the ETD method. The seamless monthly average of the mean, maximum and minimum Ta data were further developed using the seamless Ts data, in situ Ta data and Cubist machine learning algorithm. GSHTD has four main advantages. First, GSHTD includes seven types of temperature data: clear-sky daytime and nighttime Ts, all-sky daytime and nighttime Ts, and mean, maximum and minimum Ta. Second, it has global coverage and high spatial resolution. Third, using the ETD method proposed in this study, GSHTD has no missing values. Fourth, the accuracy of GSHTD is high; the average mean absolute errors (MAEs) of ETD in reconstructing the 25 x 25 and 150 x 150 pixel clear-sky daytime (nighttime) Ts data were 0.724 (0.552) and 1.024 (0.895) degrees C, respectively.

Large deformation rates of polar glaciers can cause a deformation gradient which exceeds the theoretical limi-tation of phase unwrapping. There is acceptable coherence for Sentinel-1 interferograms with very short tem-poral baselines, however, traditional D-InSAR still fails at the phase unwrapping step. Here, we propose a method to reduce the phase gradient of the D-InSAR interferogram via subtracting the estimated deformation phase to obtain a residual phase. Such rough deformation can be acquired by performing offset-tracking to the current pair of SAR images or can be calculated by any other glacier velocity products, which are usually obtained by the offset-tracking technique. Phase unwrapping is then performed on the residual phase and then the rough deformation phase is added to yield the final deformation fields. Four study sites located in northern Greenland are selected to test our proposed method, which improved the mean coherence of the residual phase by 0.037, 0.032, 0.037, and 0.039 in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, as compared to traditional D-InSAR interfer-ometry. The modulus of the phase gradient is also reduced, by 0.054, 0.044, 0.056, and 0.064 rad in each season. The coherence improvement is more sensitive to the temporal baseline in summer than other seasons, and our method is less effective. Seven unwrapped phase profiles of the glaciers find that our method performs better in spatial and temporal phase continuity than traditional D-InSAR.

Sentinel-1 (A/B) satellite provides high-resolution (similar to 10 m) synthetic aperture radar data, and its high revisit capability (6 days at the equator) with multi-track data provides great potential for global soil moisture monitoring. In this study, an algorithm was proposed for soil moisture retrieval using the Multi-Temporal Dual-Channel (MTDC) Sentinel-1 data. The MTDC algorithm first conducted an incidence angle normalization method based on time series data to normalize backscattering coefficients from multiple tracks. Subsequently, using the vegetation water content obtained through a vegetation index climatology, soil roughness and soil unfrozen water content could be estimated for the freezing period (unfrozen water content in the soil is assumed to be stable for January and December). The changes in total backscatter between successive observations were expressed as a function of the two-way vegetation transmissivity multiplied by the difference between soil backscatter, which was directly related to the changes in soil moisture. Considering the retrieved soil roughness as a constant for the entire year, and the average unfrozen water content as the initial soil moisture, the changes in and absolute values of soil moisture for each observation can be estimated by minimizing a cost function between the modeled and observed changes in total backscatter. Retrieval results were validated against the soil moisture network in a semi-arid watershed of Shandian River with an unbiased Root Mean Square Error (ubRMSE) of 0.06 cm(3).cm(-3), and a bias of-0.04 cm(3).cm(-3). With the initial soil moisture from in-situ measurements, a higher accuracy was achieved for the MTDC algorithm (ubRMSE = 0.06 cm(3).cm(-3); bias =-0.01 cm(3).cm(-3)). Further, comparisons with Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) enhanced products further verified the efficacy of the proposed algorithm (ubRMSE = 0.03 cm(3).cm(-3); bias =-0.004 cm(3).cm(-3)), and demonstrated the feasibility of operational soil moisture products using the Sentinel-1 radar dataset.', '[Wang, Zhen; Zhao, Tianjie; Ji, Dabin; Yao, Panpan] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.

Compared to physical models, the generality of empirical models based on vegetation indices is often questioned when they are used to estimate LCC due to the influence from canopy structure, such as leaf area index (LAI). A recent study developed the LAI-insensitive chlorophyll index (LICI) and established a semi-empirical LICI-based LCC quantification model, which inherits both the robustness of physical models and the simplicity of empirical models. However, it is unclear whether such a simple model is as accurate and generic as physical models. Here, we adopted an innovative approach to disentangle the confounding effects of LAI and LCC on LICI and found that LICI was strongly correlated to LCC but only marginally sensitive to LAI. Moreover, we also found that LICI was sensitive to the soil background and thus proposed a spectral separation of soil and vegetation (3SV) algorithm, which is automatic and does not require prior information of soil background. After implementing the 3SV al-gorithm to remove the contributed reflectance of soil, we then obtained the contributed reflectance of vegetation (CRv). Model simulations showed that the soil background effect on the CRv-derived LICI was largely eliminated and hence this index was viewed to be soil-removed. As a result, the accuracy and generality of the soil-removed LICI-based model for LCC estimation was evaluated using comprehensive datasets from multiple vegetation types, years, sites, and observation platforms and compared to that of a MatrixVI-based physical model and a MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI)-based semi-empirical model. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) for LCC estimated by the soil-removed LICI-based model was 6.22-6.87 mu g/cm2 for the crop datasets and 10.68 mu g/ cm2 for the multi-ecosystem dataset when the equivalent wet soil fraction was <0.7. Although further efforts are required to mitigate the effects of soil on the LICI-based model over sparse vegetation, this research is highly beneficial for extending its potential applications to the globe and advancing the development of an operational LCC monitoring system in the emerging satellite hyperspectral era.', '[Li, Dong; Yu, Weiguo; Zheng, Hengbiao; Yao, Xia; Cao, Weixing; Zhu, Yan; Cheng, Tao] Nanjing Agr Univ One Weigang, Inst Smart Agr, Natl Engn & Technol Ctr Informat Agr NETCIA, MOE Engn Res Ctr Smart Agr,MARA Key Lab Crop Syst, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

Currently, global coverage SM is routinely produced from spaceborne measurements using all three frequency bands, but despite continued validation efforts of the products, the relative characteristics and performance of these observations have not been fully established. Therefore, this study focused on the parametrization of SM retrieval algorithms at L-, C- and X-bands using TB observations from the L-band radiometer on NASA\'s SM Active Passive (SMAP) mission and the C- and X-band channels of JAXA\'s Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) onboard the GCOM-W satellite. These can be applied in global SM retrieval algorithms using either one of the frequencies or a combination of them. The reference in situ SM data was obtained from 12 core validation sites across various land cover types around the world. The investigation highlighted the known challenges of retrieving SM from C- and X-band data compared to the higher sensitivity of the L-band data. Even with a sitespecific retrieval algorithm parameterization, the mean correlation of the C- and X-band retrievals for the core validation site SM measurement were much lower than that for L-band, being 0.52 (0.54) and 0.45 (0.47) for vertical (horizontal) polarization, respectively, while for the L-band retrieval the corresponding values were 0.81 (0.77). The parameterization exercise showed that matching the C- and X-band TB measurements with an emission model was not difficult; the problem was relating the observations to SM under the influence of large roughness and vegetation effects. As a result, parameter optimization produced values for some sites that were not realistic or did not allow any practical sensitivity to SM at C- and X-band. Considering the L-band observations, the parameter optimization resulted in superior bias performance as compared to the operational SMAP', '[Gao, Y.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Joint Inst Reg Earth Syst Sci & Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.

The estimation of forest variables, in particular above-ground biomass (AGB), from scatterometer data instead was seldom explored. Given the availability of multi-decadal sets of scatterometer observations from space, it is of interest to address the contribution of C-band scatterometer data to the quantification of carbon stocks stored in forests even if the spatial resolution of spaceborne scatterometers is very coarse. In this paper, we investigated the prospects of AGB estimation using backscatter observations by the MetOp Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) with a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees. For this study, ASCAT observations acquired in 2010 were used to be contemporary with AGB datasets selected to benchmark the performance of the estimation. A Water Cloud Model that integrates two allometric equations derived from spaceborne LiDAR data reproduced the relationship between observations of radar backscatter as a function of AGB. Estimates of AGB from individual observations were then combined with a weighted average to reduce uncertainties. Finally, a correction was introduced to compensate for the offset introduced by sloped terrain and surfaces not covered by woody vegetation on the AGB estimate of a pixel. Uncertainties associated with the scatterometer observations, and the modelling framework were propagated to obtain per-pixel values of the standard deviation of an AGB estimate. The proposed method explains much of the variance in AGB estimates when compared to measurements from inventory data (R-2 = 0.72) and generated unbiased estimates globally (bias: -3.3 Mg.ha(-1)). Nonetheless, the discrepancy between estimated and plot-based AGB values tended to increase for decreasing biomass level from 20% to 60% of the reference AGB level. A further assessment related to global stocks indicated that the value estimated from the scatterometer dataset (596 Pg, 95% of which 563 Pg stored in forest land) was in line with two published estimates based on forest inventory data only (571 Pg and 600 Pg, respectively). Despite the coarse spatial resolution, our results indicate that C-band scatterometer observations from space can contribute to the characterization of terrestrial biomass pools. The record of observations starting in the early 1990s may provide an unprecedented way to look at long-term forest dynamics as well as to constrain the strength of carbon-climate cycle feedback simulated by Earth System models.', '[Santoro, Maurizio; Cartus, Oliver; Wegmueller, Urs] Gamma Remote Sensing, CH-3073 Gumlingen, Switzerland.

The impact that rapid deglaciation has had on the slope stability of valley walls and on the sedimentation of fans and deltas adjacent to fjords and inlets is an ongoing research topic. Using 3-year (2018-2020) Sentinel-1 datasets, and an automated time-series persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PSInSAR) processing method, we detected landslides or delta subsidence at 27 sites within a vast 180 x 180 km remote region encompassing Glacier Bay proper. Most of the sites that we identified had not been previously identified. We categorized the hazard source areas that we identified into three general types:1) slow-moving landslides on steep rocky slopes not near (> 2 km away from) present-day glacier termini (e.g., Tidal Inlet landslide), 2) slow -moving landslides directly adjacent to (< 2 km away from), and associated with glacier thinning and retreat, and 3) subsidence of glacial outwash fan deltas. In categories 1 and 2, we observed 22 landslides moving at velocities ranging from 0.5 to 4 cm/yr. In category 3, we detected five fan deltas subsiding at velocities ranging from 0.5 to 6 cm/yr. Within our measurement error, these velocities were consistent during the monitoring period. Because acceleration was not observed, the issuance of warnings of imminent rapid failure is not warranted, however, continued remote monitoring is warranted. Our interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) results could be combined with other data sets including field observations, subaerial and submarine landslide inventories, bedrock fabric mapping from newly available light detection and ranging (lidar) data, and geologic maps to produce an inherent susceptibility map for landslides in bedrock and fan deltas. This map could be used to forecast susceptibility for both earthquake and climatically induced landslides.', '[Kim, Jinwoo; Lu, Zhong] Southern Methodist Univ, Roy M Huffington Dept Earth Sci, Dallas, TX 75275 USA.

Ongoing developments in optical remote sensing technologies have provided tools to increase our un-derstanding of stress-related physiological processes. Therefore, this study aimed to provide an overview of the main spectral technologies and retrieval approaches for detecting crop stress in agriculture. Firstly, we present integrated views on: i) biotic and abiotic stress factors, the phases of stress, and respective plant responses, and ii) the affected traits, appropriate spectral domains and corresponding methods for measuring traits remotely. Secondly, representative results of a systematic literature analysis are highlighted, identifying the current status and possible future trends in stress detection and monitoring. Distinct plant responses occurring under short-term, medium-term or severe chronic stress exposure can be captured with remote sensing due to specific light interaction processes, such as absorption and scattering manifested in the reflected radiance, i.e. visible (VIS), near infrared (NIR), shortwave infrared, and emitted radiance, i.e. solar-induced fluorescence and thermal infrared (TIR). From the analysis of 96 research papers, the following trends can be observed: increasing usage of satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle data in parallel with a shift in methods from simpler parametric ap-proaches towards more advanced physically-based and hybrid models. Most study designs were largely driven by sensor availability and practical economic reasons, leading to the common usage of VIS-NIR-TIR sensor com-binations. The majority of reviewed studies compared stress proxies calculated from single-source sensor do-mains rather than using data in a synergistic way. We identified new ways forward as guidance for improved synergistic usage of spectral domains for stress detection: (1) combined acquisition of data from multiple sensors for analysing multiple stress responses simultaneously (holistic view); (2) simultaneous retrieval of plant traits combining multi-domain radiative transfer models and machine learning methods; (3) assimilation of estimated plant traits from distinct spectral domains into integrated crop growth models. As a future outlook, we recom-mend combining multiple remote sensing data streams into crop model assimilation schemes to build up Digital Twins of agroecosystems, which may provide the most efficient way to detect the diversity of environmental and biotic stresses and thus enable respective management decisions.', '[Berger, Katja; Van Wittenberghe, Shari; Verrelst, Jochem] Univ Valencia, Image Proc Lab IPL, C Catedrat Jose Beltran 2, Valencia 46980, Spain.

Novel Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) schemes and model parameterizations are proposed to achieve this goal. In this work, we attempt to characterize errors and uncertainties that prop-agate from RTMs and their parameters while retrieving SM and VOD from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data. Three RTMs are considered, including a zeroth order model (Tau-omega model) and two first order models (First order RTM and 2-Stream Emission model (2S-EM)). Surface roughness (h; characterizes undulations on soil surface) and single scattering albedo (omega; accounts for the scattering of emissions due to vegetation structure) are the two parameters (of RTMs) considered. SM and VOD are retrieved concurrently using a multi-temporal RTM inversion scheme. Errors and uncertainty contributions are determined using the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) approach. To assess the role of land cover conditions on error and uncertainties in retrievals, ten reference sites are chosen to represent various biomes. Initially, brightness temperatures are simulated by varying RTMs and their parameters to determine their sensitivity. The SM and VOD retrievals are compared with reference datasets, and the performance is found to be acceptable. Error decomposition analysis indicates RTMs and their parameters (h and omega) induce noticeable and significant error in SM and VOD retrievals. Errors contributions due to the above factors are more prominent in VOD retrievals compared to SM. However, the uncertainty contributions indicate minimal influence of RTMs and their parameters on SM retrievals. The omega parameter followed by the choice of RTM have significant contributions to the uncertainty in the VOD retrievals. The h parameter resulted in significant uncertainties in VOD retrievals under sparsely vegetated regions. The results are used to comment on the suitability of each of the three RTMs and the model parameterization design that could alleviate the issue of errors and uncertainties in concurrent retrievals of SM and VOD.

Through their Instrument Incubator Program (IIP), an uncooled multispectral thermal instrument was fabricated and flight-tested to demonstrate its potential utility to support future spaceborne missions. While uncooled systems offer the attractive advantage of elimi-nating the need for large and expensive cryocoolers, they naturally introduce challenges that must be overcome to achieve the fidelity observed in image data acquired by existing cooled spaceborne instruments. In this work, the Multi-band Uncooled Radiometer Instrument (MURI) system, designed and built by Leonardo DRS, is fabricated using custom microbolometer detector arrays also developed by Leonardo DRS. Potential is-sues associated with thermal imaging using microbolometers from a spaceborne platform are discussed and innovative engineering solutions to overcome these issues are highlighted. Details of three airborne campaigns designed to assess the fidelity of MURI image data, using Landsat 8\'s Thermal Infrared Sensor\'s (TIRS) radio-metric & geometric requirements as a baseline, are presented. Results of these campaigns show that the as-built MURI system significantly outperforms these requirements, as compared to ground-based reference measure-ments. Sustainable Land Imaging (SLI) requirements indicate that a five-band instrument is desirable to improve future Landsat science while maintaining continuity with previous thermal instruments. Considering its multi-band design, temperature/emissivity separation (TES) is applied to MURI flight data and compared to ground-based spectrometer measurements for several materials. Results of this study indicate that MURI\'s TES perfor-mance is in-line with existing spaceborne systems.

Recent research shows that the land surface reflection in the forward direction of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals at L-band can convey high-resolution land surface information, including surface soil moisture. However, these signals are often affected by complex land surface characteristics and the bistatic nature of the GNSS-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) technique, resulting in a nonlinear relationship between the signals and surface soil moisture. In this work, a machine learning (ML) approach is used to map quasi-global soil moisture using bistatic reflectance observations acquired from the recently launched Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) mission. Specifically, several land surface parameters are obtained from remote sensing products and integrated with Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) enhanced soil moisture retrievals to facilitate daily quasi-global CYGNSS soil moisture mapping at 9 km. Based on cross-validation against SMAP data, the ML algorithm is shown to be suitable for retrieving soil moisture from CYGNSS. Median values of unbiased root-mean-square-difference for the quasi-global coverage or regions with vegetation water content less than 5 kg/m(2) are 0.0395 cm3/cm(3 )and 0.0320 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. Likewise, via independent evaluation against more than 100 in-situ sites, the algorithm is shown to have an unbiased root-mean-square-error of 0.0543 cm(3)/cm(3). CYGNSS-based retrievals contain similar spatial variability as SMAP across different seasons. Moreover, through a robust triple collocation technique, the accuracy of CYGNSS soil moisture is relatively high over moderately vegetated regions with correlations ranging from 0.4 to 0.8. Based on these validation results, we argue that derived CYGNSS soil moisture estimates can supplement current global soil moisture databases and provide more frequent retrievals at 9 km.', '[Lei, Fangni; Senyurek, Volkan; Moorhead, Robert] Mississippi State Univ, Geosyst Res Inst, Starkville, MS USA.

Most of the existing spatio-temporal fusion models lacked the fusion of ET because they ignored the physiological characteristics of the vegetation moisture condition. Therefore, we propose a classification-based spatiotemporal adaptive fusion model (CSAFM) for the evaluation of remotely sensed ET in an irrigated agricultural area with a complex planting structure. This model combines the unmixing-based and weight-based fusion approaches to produce ET maps with high spatiotemporal resolution. It uses the mainstream weight based fusion algorism-the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM)-in the fusion step. However, in contrast to the existing reflectance-based fusion algorithms, the CSAFM considers the effects of soil moisture and crop category on evapotranspiration rates. It replaces the unmixing window with an irregular hydrological response unit (HRU) containing homogeneous meteorological and irrigation conditions, and then unmixing the mixed pixels using a planting structure map. Moreover, an ET correction method was proposed in CSAFM to restore the spatial heterogeneity. The performance of CSAFM was compared to that of two mainstream fusion models using Landsat-ET and MODIS-ET based on the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL): the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) and the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion method (FSDAF). The models were validated with ground-based ET monitored by eddy covariance observed ET and Landsat inverted ET. It was found that the CSAFM model (mean MAE: 0.40 mm/day) beat the ESTARFM model (mean MAE: 0.49 mm/day) and the FSDAF (mean MAE: 0.53 mm/day) in accurately fusion ET and reproduce the details of complex surface landscapes. Additionally, CSAFM (RMSE: 0.66-1.10 mm/day) is less sensitive to the update frequency of input data in the crop growing season than ESTARFM (RMSE: 0.79-1.36 mm/day) and FSDAF (RMSE: 0.79-1.17 mm/day), indicating its suitability in areas with limited input dataset. Overall, the proposed CSAFM model can greatly improve the ET fusion accuracy in irrigated agricultural areas.', '[Wang, Shuai; Wang, Chaozi; Zhang, Chenglong; Xue, Jingyuan; Wang, Pu; Wang, Xingwang; Wang, Weishu; Zhang, Xin; Huang, Guanhua; Huo, Zailin] China Agr Univ, Ctr Agr Water Res China, Tsinghuadong St 17, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.

Currently, only two space-borne L-band radiometer missions are operating: the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions in orbit since 2009 and 2015, respectively. This study presents a new mono-angle retrieval algorithm (called SMAP-INRAE-BORDEAUX, hereafter SMAP-IB) of SM and L-band VOD (L-VOD) from the dual-channel SMAP radiometric observations. The retrievals are based on the L-MEB (L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere) model which is the forward model of SMOS-IC and of the official SMOS retrieval algorithms. The SMAP-IB product aims at providing good performances for both SM and L-VOD while remaining independent of auxiliary data: neither modelled SM data nor optical vegetation indices are used as input in the algorithm. Intercomparison with other SM and L-VOD products (i.e., MT-DCA, SMOS-IC, and the new versions of DCA and SCA-V extracted from SMAP passive Level 3 product) suggested that SMAP-IB performed well for both SM and L-VOD. In particular, SMAP-IB SM retrievals presented the higher scores (R = 0.74) in capturing the temporal trends of in-situ observations from ISMN (International Soil Moisture Network) during April 2015-March 2019, followed by MT-DCA (R = 0.71). While the lowest ubRMSD value was obtained by the new version of SMAP DCA (0.056 m3/m3), SMAP-IB SM retrievals presented best scores for R, ubRMSD (- 0.058 m3/m3) and bias (0.002 m3/m3) when considering only products independent of optical vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI). L-VOD retrievals from SMAP-IB, MT-DCA, and SMOS-IC were well correlated (spatially) with aboveground biomass and tree height, with spatial R values of -0.88 and - 0.90, respectively. All three L-VOD products exhibited a smooth non-linear density distribution with biomass and a good linear relationship with tree height, especially at high biomass levels, while the L-VOD datasets incorporating optical information in the algorithms (i.e., SCA-V and DCA) showed obvious saturation effects. It is expected that this new algorithm can facilitate the fusion of both SM and L-VOD retrievals from SMOS and SMAP to obtain long-term and continuous L-band earth observation products.', '[Li, Xiaojun; Wigneron, Jean-Pierre; Frappart, Frederic; Liu, Xiangzhuo; Wang, Mengjia; Ma, Hongliang; Moisy, Christophe] Univ Bordeaux, INRAE, UMR1391 ISPA, F-33140 Villenave Dornon, France.

High-resolution, national-scale maps of agricultural land are needed to develop strategies for future sustainable agriculture. However, the characterization of agricultural land cover over large areas and for multiple years remains challenging due to the locally diverse and temporally variable characteristics of cultivated land. We here propose a workflow for generating national agricultural land cover maps on a yearly basis that accounts for varying environmental conditions. We tested the approach by mapping 24 agricultural land cover classes in Germany for the three years 2017, 2018, and 2019, in which the meteorological conditions strongly differed. We used a random forest classifier and dense time series data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 in combination with monthly Sentinel-1 composites and environmental data and evaluated the relative importance of optical, radar, and environmental data. Our results show high overall accuracy and plausible class accuracies for the most dominant crop types across different years despite the strong inter-annual meteorological variability and the presence of drought and nondrought years. The maps show high spatial consistency and good delineation of field parcels. Combining optical, SAR, and environmental data increased overall accuracies by 6% to 10% compared to single sensor approaches, in which optical data outperformed SAR. Overall accuracy ranged between 78% and 80%, and the mapped areas aligned well with agricultural statistics at the regional and national level. Based on the multi-year dataset we mapped major crop sequences of cereals and leaf crops. Most crop sequences were dominated by winter cereals followed by summer cereals. Monocultures of summer cereals were mainly revealed in the Northwest of Germany. We showcased that high spatial and thematic detail in combination with annual mapping will stimulate research on crop cycles and studies to assess the impact of environmental policies on management decisions. Our results demonstrate the capabilities of integrated optical time series and SAR data in combination with variables describing local and seasonal environmental conditions for annual large-area crop type mapping.', '[Blickensdoerfer, Lukas] Thunen Inst Forest Ecosyst, Alfred Moeller Str 1, D-16225 Eberswalde, Germany.

We mapped mowing events for the years from 2017 to 2020 for permanent grassland areas in Germany. The results were validated on a pixel level in four of the main natural regions in Germany based on reported mowing events for a total of 92 (2018) and 78 (2019) grassland parcels. Results for 2020 were evaluated with combined time series of Landsat, Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope data. The mean absolute percentage error between detected and reported mowing events was on average 40% (2018), 36% (2019) and 35% (2020). Mowing events were on average detected 11 days (2018), 7 days (2019) and 6 days (2020) after the reported mowing. Performance measures varied between the different regions of Germany, and lower accuracies were found in areas that are revisited less frequently by Sentinel-2. Thus, we assessed the influence of data availability and found that the detection of mowing events was less influenced by data availability when at least 16 cloud-free observations were available in the grassland season. Still, the distribution of available observations throughout the season appeared to be critical. On a national scale our results revealed overall higher shares of less intensively mown grasslands and smaller shares of highly intensively managed grasslands. Hotspots of the latter were identified in the alpine foreland in Southern Germany as well as in the lowlands in the Northwest of Germany. While these patterns were stable throughout the years, the results revealed a tendency to lower management intensity in the extremely dry year 2018. Our results emphasize the ability of the approach to map the intensity of grassland management throughout large areas despite variations in data availability and environmental conditions.', '[Schwieder, Marcel; Wesemeyer, Maximilian; Frantz, David; Pfoch, Kira; Hostert, Patrick] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.

This paper aims to examine and compare the performance in LCC monitoring using three satellite sensors: PROBA-V, Landsat 8 OLI, and Sentinel-2 MSI. We utilized a unique set of global reference data containing four years of records (2015-2018) at 29,263 land cover change/no-change 100 x 100-m sites. The LCC monitoring was conducted using the BFAST(s)-Random Forest (BRF) change detection framework involving 15 global timeseries vegetation indices and three BFAST models. Due to the different spectral characteristics and data availability of the sensors, we designed 30 comparison scenarios to extensively evaluate their performance. The overall results were: 1) for global general LCC monitoring, Landsat 8 OLI slightly outperformed Sentinel-2, and PROBA-V performed the worst. The performance among the three sensors differed consistently despite different data availability and spectral observation regions. Sentinel-2 was more competitive with Landsat 8 when the red-edge 1 band was included; 2) Landsat 8 was more accurate in forest, herbaceous vegetation, and water monitoring. Sentinel-2 performed particularly well in wetland monitoring. In addition, we further observed: 3) missing data in time series decreased the accuracy in all sensors, but had little influence on the relative performance across sensors; 4) combining sensors would not necessarily improve the accuracy because the complementary effects enhanced the accuracy only when there was a large amount of data missing for all sensors; 5) the BRF framework maintained the performance gap among sensors, but obtained a higher and more balanced accuracy overall when compared with using BFAST methods alone, by involving ensemble learning with an embedded sample-balancing strategy; 6) among the random forest variables, the \'magnitude\' proved to be the most important contributor, and the NDVI had the most consistently good performance across sensors when compared against other vegetation indices. All sensors using BRF still had some errors in change detection, with a tendency to underestimate the global LCC. A potential reason for this is the complexity of the diverse change/no-change characteristics at the global extent and the fact that smaller, more subtle LCCs might not be well detected. These limitations could be addressed by taking advantage of ensemble learning approaches with a combination of multiple independent region/thematic-adapted LCC monitoring models and using the original Sentinel-2 (10 m) and Landsat 8 (30 m) in the future.', '[Xu, Lili] Cent China Normal Univ, Key Lab Geog Proc Anal & Simulat Hubei Prov, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

It is of great interest and potential to use SIF to detect forest stresses, but the approach requires accurate modeling of the SIF emission within stressed forests. However, the existing radiative transfer approaches of SIF generally ignore the within crown heterogeneity caused by pests. To account for within-canopy scattering with both high accuracy and efficiency, FluorESRT was proposed as a new model for simulating the SIF of forests with heterogeneous distribution of damaged foliage, which was the synergy of the SIF radiative transfer and the Stochastic Radiative Transfer (SRT) model for forest with vertical distribution of damage. The performance of FluorESRT for both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases were well validated not only by the one-dimensional (1D) model SCOPE but also by the three-dimensional (3D) model DART. As an analytically simple approach, FluorESRT can evaluate the sensitivity of canopy SIF and apparent reflectance to the level of pest damage. The impact of structural properties of damaged foliage on canopy fluorescence, as well as the response of hyperspectral signals on the pest damage was analyzed. According to our study, hyperspectral vegetation indices with the consideration of SIF showed higher sensitivity to pest damage in the early stage when the response of broad band vegetation indices was hardly detectable. The results indicated that the potential of FluorESRT to simulate SIF and hyperspectral apparent reflectance should play a critical role in early monitoring of pest damage.', '[Li, Xiaoyao; Chen, Ling; Huang, Huaguo] Beijing Forestry Univ, Res Ctr Forest Management Engn, State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Beijing, Peoples R China.

Despite inherent differences in sensors\' spectral capability, spatial sampling, and radiometric performance, research efforts focused on formulating, implementing, and validating universal WQ algorithms continue to evolve. This research extends a recently developed machine-learning (ML) model, i.e., Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) (Pahlevan et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2021), to the inverse problem of simultaneously retrieving WQ indicators, including chlorophyll-a (Chla), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and the absorption by Colored Dissolved Organic Matter at 440 nm (acdom(440)), across a wide array of aquatic ecosystems. We use a database of in situ measurements to train and optimize MDN models developed for the relevant spectral measurements (400-800 nm) of the Operational Land Imager (OLI), MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), and Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) aboard the Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-3 missions, respectively. Our two performance assessment approaches, namely hold-out and leaveone-out, suggest significant, albeit varying degrees of improvements with respect to second-best algorithms, depending on the sensor and WQ indicator (e.g., 68%, 75%, 117% improvements based on the hold-out method for Chla, TSS, and acdom(440), respectively from MSI-like spectra). Using these two assessment methods, we provide theoretical upper and lower bounds on model performance when evaluating similar and/or out-ofsample datasets. To evaluate multi-mission product consistency across broad spatial scales, map products are demonstrated for three near-concurrent OLI, MSI, and OLCI acquisitions. Overall, estimated TSS and acdom(440) from these three missions are consistent within the uncertainty of the model, but Chla maps from MSI and OLCI achieve greater accuracy than those from OLI. By applying two different atmospheric correction processors to OLI and MSI images, we also conduct matchup analyses to quantify the sensitivity of the MDN model and best -practice algorithms to uncertainties in reflectance products. Our model is less or equally sensitive to these un-certainties compared to other algorithms. Recognizing their uncertainties, MDN models can be applied as a global algorithm to enable harmonized retrievals of Chla, TSS, and acdom(440) in various aquatic ecosystems from multi-source satellite imagery. Local and/or regional ML models tuned with an apt data distribution (e.g., a subset of our dataset) should nevertheless be expected to outperform our global model.', '[Pahlevan, Nima; Smith, Brandon] NASA Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.

However, two key challenges related to fusion accuracy remain: a) reducing the uncertainty of image fusion caused by sensor differences and b) addressing strong temporal changes. To solve the above two issues, this paper presents the newly proposed Reliable and Adaptive Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (RASDF) method. In RASDF, the effects of four kinds of sensor differences on fusion are analyzed systematically. A reliability index is therefore proposed to describe the spatial distribution of the reliability in input data for image fusion. An optimization strategy based on the spatial distribution of the reliability quantified by the index is developed to improve the robustness of the fusion. In addition, an adaptive global unmixing model and an adaptive local unmixing model are constructed and utilized collaboratively to enhance the ability to retrieve strong temporal changes. The performance and robustness of RASDF were compared with six representative fusion methods for both real and simulated datasets covering both homogeneous and heterogeneous sites. Experimental results indicated that RASDF achieves a better performance and provides a more reliable image fusion solution in terms of reducing the impact of sensor differences on image fusion and retrieving strong temporal changes.', '[Guo, Dizhou; Zhang, Hua] China Univ Min & Technol, Jiangsu Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Eng, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

It also allows a better understanding of global climate regulation as a potential carbon sink or source. Large area assessments usually require data from spaceborne remote sensors, but most of them cannot measure the vertical variability of vegetation structure, which is required for accurately measuring fuel loads and defining management interventions. The recently launched NASA\'s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) full-waveform lidar sensor holds potential to meet this demand. However, its capability for estimating fuel load has yet not been evaluated. In this study, we developed a novel framework and tested machine learning models for predicting multi-layer fuel load in the Brazilian tropical savanna (i.e., Cerrado biome) using GEDI data. First, lidar data were collected using an unnamed aerial vehicle (UAV). The flights were conducted over selected sample plots in distinct Cerrado vegetation formations (i.e., grassland, savanna, forest) where field measurements were conducted to determine the load of surface, herbaceous, shrubs and small trees, woody fuels and the total fuel load. Subsequently, GEDI-like full-waveforms were simulated from the high-density UAV-lidar 3-D point clouds from which vegetation structure metrics were calculated and correlated to field-derived fuel load components using Random Forest models. From these models, we generate fuel load maps for the entire Cerrado using all on-orbit available GEDI data. Overall, the models had better performance for woody fuels and total fuel loads (R-2 = 0.88 and 0.71, respectively). For components at the lower stratum, models had moderate to low performance (R-2 between 0.15 and 0.46) but still showed reliable results. The presented framework can be extended to other fire-prone regions where accurate measurements of fuel components are needed. We hope this study will contribute to the expansion of spaceborne lidar applications for integrated fire management activities and supporting carbon monitoring initiatives in tropical savannas worldwide.', '[Leite, Rodrigo Vieira; do Amaral, Cibele Hummel] Fed Univ Vicosa UFV, Dept Forest Engn, Av Peter Henry Rolfs, BR-36570900 Vicosa, MG, Brazil.

It ingests remote-sensing reflectance at only three bands, centred on red, green and blue wavelengths.

Measurements of radial stem growth are mainly performed at the individual tree scale and can be used to infer ecosystem net primary productivity (NPP). However, these measurements are spatially limited, and remote sensing provides a promising tool to track vegetation function and productivity across spatial scales, making it a viable technique for assessing variation in interannual tree growth and carbon storage. In this study we examined the correspondence between in-situ annual tree-ring width across four dominant evergreen species in the Sierra Nevada and a wide range of remotely sensed products linked to carbon uptake including NPP, gross primary productivity (GPP), net photosynthesis (PSN), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), near infrared reflectance of vegetation index (NIRV), and chlorophyll/carotenoid index (CCI) from MODIS (Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) as well as downscaled solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) products, using a 14 year dataset (2000-2014) across 62 forest sites. We show that variation of annual tree-ring width was best captured by the annual sum of MODIS GPP, with a legacy effect (5-month backwards shift). Across all forest sites, MODIS GPP with a 5-month legacy effect showed moderate correspondence with tree-ring width (r = 0.60). Within each individual site, however, the interannual correspondence between MODIS GPP with a legacy effect and tree growth was stronger (median r = 0.70 vs 0.14 without a legacy effect). The importance of legacy effects in explaining tree growth variation within sites indicates that tree growth each year is influenced by carbon uptake during the latter part of the previous growing season. Additional local environmental factors also explained annual variation in tree-ring width, including (in descending order of importance) local tree density, latitude, slope, DBH, elevation and aspect.', '[Wong, Christopher Y.

Because snow cover is highly spatially and temporally variable, mapping its extent using currently available satellite data remains a challenge. At present, there are no sensors acquiring daily data of Earth\'s entire surface at fine spatial resolutions (< 30 m) in wavelengths required for snow cover retrieval, namely: visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared. Fine scale observations at 30 m from Landsat are available at 16-day intervals since 1982 and at 8-day intervals since 1999. However, over this duration, snow can accumulate, ablate, or both, making the Landsat data ineffective for many applications. Conversely, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) atmospherically corrected daily reflectance data, have a coarse spatial resolution of 463 m and thus, are not ideal for snow cover mapping either. This spatial and temporal resolution tradeoff limits the use of these data for a wide range of snow cover applications and indicates a pressing need for data fusion. To address this need, we use a physically-based, spectralmixture-analysis approach for mapping fractional snow cover (fSCA) and a two-stage random forest algorithm to produce daily 30 m fSCA. We test our algorithm in the US Sierra Nevada and find MODIS fSCA is the most important predictor. We cross validate using 170 Landsat scenes and while snow cover varies immensely in time we find little variation in errors between seasons, a small bias of 0.01, and an overall accuracy of 0.97 with slightly higher precision than recall. This technique for accurate, daily, high-resolution snow cover retrievals could be applied more broadly for analyses of regional energy budget, validating snow cover in global and regional models, and for quantifying changes in the availability of biotic resources in ecosystems.', '[Rittger, Karl] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, 4001 Discovery Dr, Boulder, CO 80303 USA.

Here, the vertical distribution of aerosols and how it has changed from 2006 to 2017 is studied using time series data from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument on board the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite. Aerosol centroid altitude, a variable representing the aerosol vertical extent, is estimated using the aerosol flags of the Vertical Feature Mask (VFM) product of CALIOP. The case study includes four overpasses, with various aerosol types and densities, covering the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and India regions characterized by frequent dust storms and smoke emissions, respectively, and Europe, a pioneer in establishing air quality policies. The values of aerosol centroid altitude are examined to determine the effects of climate (space) and season (time) on aerosol vertical distribution. For this purpose, 10-year mean values of aerosol centroid altitude were calculated over climate regions extracted from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) climate map as well as over each season, and the resultant values were then statistically analyzed. The results indicate that environmental heat, steam from climate or season, leads to aerosols increasing in altitude. The time series was imported in a version of the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) algorithm, so-called BFAST01, allowing the magnitude of gradual changes along with the time and type of the major abrupt change to be determined. The strongest positive trends in aerosol centroid altitude were recorded in the desert regions. Positive trends were also observed in the midlatitudes steppes and the North Sea. India was another region with a relatively positive trend which could be mainly caused by the increasing anthropogenic activities and smoke emission. The strongest negative trend detected in Europe is a result of strict environmental regulation policies and efforts for air quality improvement. The results show that a small fraction of granules (12 out of 4036) mainly in the northern part of overpass A, over Europe, the mid part of overpasses B and C, over the Middle East, and southern part of overpass D, over India, experienced structural changes. The reversal changes type 8 (50% of the abrupt changes) and interruption type 6 (33%) are the dominant types, mostly occurred around 2014 and 2012, respectively. Changing environmental factors such as temperature, wind speed, and anthropogenic activities are the main drivers of these changes. The study demonstrates the applicability of BFAST01 and the usability of CALIOP VFM time series data to monitor the vertical structure of the atmosphere.', '[Brakhasi, Foad] Monash Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Clayton Campus, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.

Consequently, SIF measurements from GeoCarb can be performed much more flexibly compared to polar-orbiting platforms. With its scan mirror assembly, the instrument can point to any location on the Earth disc. This will allow measurements to be collected at various times of day, and measurement locations can be revisited several times within a day. In expectation of the launch, we conduct an extensive, SIF-focused simulation study and explore the capability and limitations of the instrument and its particular sampling approach. Using cloud information from real measurements, as well as other observation- and model-based data, we produce over four million atmospheric simulations of GeoCarb measurements that the instrument would see throughout a full day. We then apply dedicated SIF retrieval algorithms on the simulated spectra and investigate the results along with cloud-screening performance and emergent retrieval biases and subsequent bias correction.

While the availability of N to deciduous tundra plants in part relies on their internal reallocation of N from leaves to stems and roots during autumn senescence, the species-specific importance of reallocation timing and its community-wide implications on landscape- and regional-scales remains not well known. Here, we quantified leaf N contents and C:N ratios of four widespread shrub species in West Greenland from June through October and compared plot observations to landscape scale based on a new Sentinel-2-derived index. Our Sentinel-2 index captures overall N reallocation trends well across time and space at the plot level (R-2 = 0.81, p < 0.001). Using this novel approach is therefore relevant for upscaling of current and future changes in plant C:N dynamics. Using satellite data, we estimate the leaf N mass reallocated during senescence equaled about 0.8 g N m(-2) from leaves to stems and roots. We conclude that (1) in-situ data from the entire growing season is critical to quantify timing and contrasting strategies of N allocation at species level, (2) key species such as Salix glauca are capable of halving their leaf N content during senescence, (3) Sentinel-2 (S-2) satellite data is a strong candidate for quantifying these plant functional dynamics in space and time. Our study has implications for research on competition among Arctic plants, litter decomposition and consequently carbon accumulation in tundra soils from a climate change perspective. Further, it captures plant functional dynamics during critical parts of the growing season, including autumn senescence which is generally more complex than capturing spring greenup. Lastly, our new index has important implications for remotely mapping temporal and spatial variation in substrate quality for both wild and domesticated herbivores, as it is a first step towards a tool to assess the tundra vegetation and fodder quality for cold region animal husbandry.', '[Westergaard-Nielsen, A.; Christiansen, C.

In particular, global ocean acidification is having a profound effect on the coastal waters of the EBUS, affecting the entire trophic chain, net primary production (NPP) and related economic activities such as fisheries. Another predicted change related to human activity is that of upwelling dynamics with expected long-term changes in upwelling winds as proposed by Bakun (1990), Bakun et al. (2015) and Rykaczewski et al. (2015). Although these predicted long-term changes may emerge only later in the 21st century, this has fueled many studies using historical data. Long-term increase in upwelling winds has thus been a much debated topic, showing that there is considerable uncertainty depending on the EBUS considered, the effect of natural climate fluctuations, the choice of wind dataset, the time period considered, and the methodologies and significance tests applied. Therefore, there is an immediate interest in being able to monitor upwelling using verified and self-consistent wind data sets. This work focused on a sensitivity study of the estimated trends in upwelling winds in the California Current Upwelling System (CCUS), for the most recent period 1996-2018, using the two state-of-the-art satellite wind analyses and two atmospheric model re-analyses. Embedded into the strong modulation by natural climate fluctuations on interannual and decadal time scales, we do see an increase in upwelling-favorable winds in the core of the CCUS, with a local increase of more than 25% in seasonal upwelling transport for the period considered. In this central upwelling zone, a good agreement on stronger equatorward winds for the winter and spring seasons is found between the different datasets, although with different significance levels. Conversely, conflicting results are found in the southernmost part of the CCUS between the satellite analyses and the model reanalyses. Systematic, time-dependent differences are found between the wind products, highlighting the need to further investigate the poorly documented temporal stability of these widely used wind long-term climatology products. The observed spatial structuring of the estimated wind trends is consistent with the trend analysis of water chlorophyll-a, partial pressure of CO2, and basity (pH) analysis products. This result is consistent with changes being important for modulating the carbonate system within the CCUS.', '[Quilfen, Y.; Piolle, J-F; Autret, E.] Univ Brest, Lab Oceanog Phys & Spatiale LOPS, IUEM, CNRS,IRD,IFREMER, Brest, France.

SIF-based primary productivity metrics have demonstrated higher fidelity to largescale patterns of crop productivity than reflectance-based vegetation indices when averaged across the growing season. In-season crop yield forecasting typically relies upon reflectance-based vegetation indices, raising the question of whether in-season monitoring could be improved by utilizing SIF. Here, we analyze patterns of US agricultural productivity from USDA surveys and their in-season relationships with coarse-resolution GOME-2 SIF, high-resolution downscaled SIF, SIF-based primary productivity metrics, MODIS NDVI, and MODIS GPP. We find that coarse-resolution SIF-based metrics and NDVI exhibit similar out-of-sample in-season (April-July and April-August) predictive ability, even when spatially filtering higher-resolution NDVI data to cropland areas. The downscaled SIF product performed more poorly than the coarse-resolution SIF, and MODIS GPP performed more poorly than MODIS NDVI. All forecasts are improved by incorporating county fixed effects to control for crosssectional differences between counties. NDVI-based metrics allow for significantly better yield predictions during drought conditions than SIF-based metrics, suggesting limited added value of SIF for early warning of drought impacts.

It is based on Shannon\'s entropy index, which was originally designed to describe evenness in abundances among qualitative typologies, and thus the calculation of FHD involves subjective layering steps which are essentially unnatural to describe a continuous variable (X) such as height. In this contribution we aim to provide a mathematical framework for determining maximum entropy in 3D remote sensing datasets based on the Gini Coefficient of theoretical continuous distributions, intended to replace FHD as entropy measure in vertical profiles of LiDAR heights (1D, X), with extensions to variables expressing dimensions of higher order (2D or 3D, Z proportional to X2 or X3). Then we apply this framework to Boreal forests in Finland to describe landscape heterogeneity with the intention to improve the modelling of forest aboveground biomass (AGB), hypothesizing that LiDAR models of AGB should essentially be different in areas of differing structural characteristics. We carried out a pre-stratification of LiDAR data collected in 2012 using simple rules applied to the L-skewness (Lskew) and L-coefficient of variation of LiDAR echo heights (Lcv; equivalent to the Gini coefficient, GCH), determining a new threshold at GCH = 0.33 as a consequence of the newly developed mathematical proofs. We observed only moderate improvements in terms of model accuracies: RMSDs reduced from 41.7% to 38.9 or 37.0%. More remarkably, we identified critical differences in the metrics selected at each stratum, which is useful to understand what predictor variables are more important for estimating AGB at each area of a forest. We observed that higher LiDAR height percentiles are more relevant at open canopies and heterogeneous forests, whereas closed canopies in homogeneous forests obtain most accurate predictions from a combination of cover metrics and percentiles around the median. Without stratification, the overall model would neglect explained variability in the structural types of lower occurrence, and predictions from a model influenced by structural types of higher occurrence would be biased at those areas. These results are thus useful in terms of improving our understanding on the relationships underlying LiDAR-AGB models.', '[Adnan, Syed; Maltamo, Matti; Packalen, Petteri] Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Forest Sci, POB 111, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland.

These ALS data were compared to in situ field measurements to develop ALS-based predictive models of these attributes. The correlation between field- and ALS-modeled HTLC data was strong, with an R-2 of 0.79 (p < 0.001). We assessed the ability of eight lidar light penetration indices to estimate effective leaf area index (eLAI) in the field. The best predictor of total (sum of understory and overstory) eLAI produced an R-2 of 0.88 (p < 0.001). The independent contributions of overstory and understory components could also be accurately predicted by ALS-derived canopy-only eLAI metrics (R-2 = 0.71; p < 0.001) and understory-only metrics (R-2 = 0.49; p < 0.001). Two new indices, calculated as the sum of return intensity for each foliar layer and correcting for transmission losses, were developed specifically for the vertical strata related to the understory (BLunder) or overstory (BLover). The estimates from BLover were equivalent to the best-performing indices for predicting canopy-only eLAI and the corresponding BLunder was superior to other indices for understory eLAI. The broad spatial and temporal extents of the data, as well as the inclusion of pine plantations with differing stand ages, planting densities, understory control, and thinning treatments, suggest the relationships generated from these methods are robust to site and seasonal variability. The results produced from the analysis of multiple acquisitions implies that the methods presented here are transferable across location, time and sensor design, without implementation-specific calibration, at least for structurally similar loblolly pine plantations.', '[Sumnall, Matthew J.; Carter, David R.; Wynne, Randolph H.; Thomas, Valerie A.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Forest Resources & Environm Conservat, 228 Cheatham Hall Mail Code 0324, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.

The calving fronts of many Greenland glaciers have been undergoing substantial variations, and a comprehensive front dataset is necessary for better understanding such frontal dynamics. Therefore, there is a need for an automated approach to identifying glaciological features such as calving fronts. In 2019, three deep-learning-based methods were applied to calving front delineation, but were restricted to a specific area or dataset. Here, we develop a more generalized method that can be applied to a major outlet glacier or remote sensing datasets that are not included in the training. We integrate seven remote sensing datasets into a single deep learning network. The core datasets include optical (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) and synthetic aperture radar images (Envisat, ALOS-1 TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1, and ALOS-2) taken over Jakobshavn Isbme, Kangerlussuaq, and Helheim, spanning from 2002 to 2019. We evaluate four neural network architectures (e.g., U-Net, DeepLabv3+ with ResNet, DRN, and MobileNet as the backbones) and three histogram modification strategies (e.g., histogram normalization, linear stretching, and no histogram modification). We find that the combination of histogram normalization and DRN-DeepLabv3+ has the lowest test error, at 86 m.

Evapotranspiration (ET), which consists of crop water use through transpiration and water loss through direct soil evaporation, is a good indicator of soil moisture availability and vegetation health. ET therefore has been an integral part of many yield estimation efforts. The Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) is an ET-based crop stress indicator that describes temporal anomalies in a normalized evapotranspiration metric as derived from satellite remote sensing. ESI has demonstrated the capacity to explain regional yield variability in water-limited regions. However, its performance in some regions where the vegetation cycle is intensively managed appears to be degraded due to interannual phenological variability. This investigation selected three study sites across the U.S. Corn Belt - Mead, NE, Ames, IA and Champaign, IL - to investigate the potential operational value of 30-m resolution, phenologically corrected ESI datasets for yield prediction. The analysis was conducted over an 8-year period from 2010 to 2017, which included both drought and pluvial conditions as well as a broad range in yield values. Detrended yield anomalies for corn and soybean were correlated with ESI computed using annual ET curves temporally aligned based on (1) calendar date, (2) crop emergence date, and (3) a growing degree day (GDD) scaled time axis. Results showed that ESI has good correlations with yield anomalies at the county scale and that phenological corrections to the annual temporal alignment of the ET timeseries improve the correlation, especially when the time axis is defined by GDD rather than the calendar date. Peak correlations occur in the silking stage for corn and the reproductive stage for soybean ? phases when these crops are particularly sensitive to soil moisture deficiencies. Regression equations derived at the time of peak correlation were used to estimate yields at county scale using a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. The ESI-based yield estimates agree well with the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) county-level crop yield data, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.79 to 0.93 and percent root-mean-square errors of 5-8%. These results demonstrate that remotely sensed ET at high spatiotemporal resolution can convey valuable water stress information for forecasting crop yields across the Corn Belt if interannual phenological variability is considered.', '[Yang, Yang; Anderson, Martha C.; Gao, Feng; Yang, Yun; Dulaney, Wayne] USDA ARS, Hydrol & Remote Sensing Lab, Beltsville, MD USA.

This index is only marginally impacted by effects from atmosphere, clouds and sun illumination, and thus increasingly used for ecological applications at large scales. Newly released VOD products show different abilities in monitoring vegetation features, depending on the algorithm used and the satellite frequency. VOD is increasingly sensitive to the upper vegetation layer as the frequency increases (from L-, C- to X-band), offering different capacities to monitor seasonal changes of the leafy and/or woody vegetation components, vegetation water status and aboveground biomass. This study evaluated nine recently developed/reprocessed VOD products from the AMSR2, SMOS and SMAP space-borne instruments for monitoring structural vegetation features related to phenology, height and aboveground biomass.   For monitoring the seasonality of green vegetation (herbaceous and woody foliage), we found that X-VOD products, particularly from the LPDR-retrieval algorithm, outperformed the other VOD products in regions that are not densely vegetated, where they showed higher temporal correlation values with optical vegetation indices (VIs). However, LPDR X-VOD time series failed to detect changes in VOD after rainfall events whereas most other VOD products could do so, and overall daily variations are less pronounced in LPDR X-VOD. Results show that the reprocessed VODCA C- and X-VOD have almost comparable performance and VODCA C-VOD correlates better with VIs than other C-VOD products. Low frequency L-VOD, particularly the new version (V2) of SMOS-IC, show a higher temporal correlation with VIs, similar to C-VOD, in medium-densely vegetated biomes such as savannas (R similar to 0.70) than for other short vegetation types. Because the L-VOD indices are more sensitive to the non-green vegetation components (trunks and branches) than higher frequency products, they are well-correlated with aboveground biomass: (R similar to 0.91) across space between predicted and observed values for both SMOS-IC V2 and SMAP MT-DCA. However, when compared with forest canopy height, results at L-band are not systematically better than C- and X-VOD products. This revealed specific VOD retrieval issues for some ecosystems, e.g., boreal regions. It is expected that these findings can contribute to algorithm refinements, product enhancements and further developing the use of VOD for monitoring above-ground vegetation biomass, vegetation dynamics and phenology.', '[Li, Xiaojun; Wigneron, Jean-Pierre; Frappart, Frederic; Liu, Xiangzhuo; Wang, Mengjia; Moisy, Christophe] Univ Bordeaux, INRAE, UMR1391 ISPA, F-33140 Villenave Dornon, France.

However, the retrieval of H remains challenging, especially for passive instruments. In this work, we derive a semi-analytical algorithm for retrieving H of single-layer liquid cloud based on oxygen A-band hyperspectral measurements from NASA\'s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2). In this algorithm, a high-order correction is introduced to the approximation formula to accurately calculate oxygen A-band hyperspectral cloud reflectance. The algorithm can retrieve H in real time as it does not require the use of the time-consuming radiative transfer model for radiation calculation during each retrieval. In addition, the algorithm currently requires cloud optical depth, cloud top height, and aerosol properties measured by other instruments as input. In idealized simulations using ten thousand A-band spectra spanning a range of cloud cases, the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the retrieval is approximately 2.0 hPa (for low clouds, 1 hPa is about 10 m). We also retrieve H based on millions of real OCO-2 observations and compare the retrieval results with the cloud product from CloudSat/CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations). After abnormal samples are removed, the correlation coefficient is 0.716, the average bias is -15.6 hPa, and the RMSE is 27.4 hPa. The statistical results show that the absolute bias increases systematically with the reference cloud geometrical thickness, which may be caused by the unrealistic vertical homogeneous cloud assumption. The similar phenomenon was also found in comparison with OCO2CLD-LIDAR-AUX, a joint retrieval product based on OCO-2, CALIPSO, and accurate radiative transfer model. The fast algorithm shows a similar distribution of retrieved cloud bottom pressure and a smaller bias on cloud geometrical thickness retrieval compared to the OCO2CLD-LIDAR-AUX products.', '[Yang, Jie; Li, Siwei; Mao, Feiyue] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

Compiling accurate and spatially comprehensive fuel information is necessary to inform various aspects of land management in forested environments. Remote sensing may offer distinct advantages for this in comparison to traditional site-based approaches. We conducted a literature review of the past 10 years of research in the remote sensing of fire fuel in forested environments, with a focus on emerging methods of fuel estimation, and the fuel attributes estimated. We position our review of remote sensing research in relation to the fuel attributes that influence fire behaviour, as suggested by contemporary physics-based fire behaviour knowledge, and a summary of fuel inputs to widely applied forest fire behaviour models. We find a disconnect between recent remote sensing research and fuel characterisations relevant to contemporary fire behaviour knowledge. Specifically, we find a tendency in remote sensing research towards estimation of forest overstorey fuel attributes, and a relative lack of research that estimates more obscured, though highly relevant, fuel components such as understorey, surface, and bark fuel. We also find a tendency for recent remote sensing research to conceptualise fire fuel by existing fire behaviour models, with particular emphasis on matching pre-existing fuel model classifications. A case is made for remotely sensed forest fuel estimation grounded in current knowledge of fire behaviour processes and the fuel attributes known to influence these processes. Shortcomings in remote sensing of key forest fuel attributes are partly due to inherent limitations of current technologies, and we discuss recent and expected advancements in remote sensing research and technology that may drive significant future advancement in forest fuel estimation. Further, we suggest that recognition of interactions between fuel attributes and measurable biophysical forest properties can assist in addressing present limitations in remote sensing of key forest fuel attributes. Such process-based methods would be more spatially and temporally applicable, encourage new techniques for estimating fuel attributes using remote sensing data, and may encourage the development of fire behaviour and risk prediction systems that are more suited to remote sensing.', '[Gale, Matthew G.; Cary, Geoffrey J.; Van Dijk, Albert I.

Large mast seeding events (known as \"mast years\") can be a visually stunning and ecologically important phenomenon, supporting trophic interactions and survival of seed predators as well as forest regeneration. Documenting patterns in mast seeding is generally labor-intensive, requiring repeated visual cone counts at consistent and widespread locations over long periods to quantify the spatiotemporal variability of cone production. Our goal in this work was to evaluate the correspondence of multispectral vegetation indexes (VIs) from Landsat with ground-based observations of mast seeding in white spruce (Picea glauca) forests of the Kluane region, Yukon, Canada. Given the visual characteristics of mast seeding in white spruce, we tested: 1) whether photosynthesis- and color-oriented VIs can identify senescence of spruce cones in late summer and autumn during mast years, and 2) if moisture-oriented VIs can distinguish the significant drying of seed cones from the surrounding spruce canopy vegetation during that senescence and after seeds are released. We hypothesized that the slope of late season decline in VIs in spruce forests would be related to masting (Le., greater decline in VI during mast years). Using generalized linear mixed-effects modeling (GLMM), we compared more than 100 site-year combinations of mast/non-mast observations to develop VI-based regressions. We found some success identifying mast years with moisture-oriented VIs, while models using the photosynthesis- and color-oriented VIs were not supported, given the data. However, we found that models containing multiple VIs from both categories were more successful than any single-VI model, accurately predicting four of sixteen mast events in site observations. We provide compelling evidence that mast-seeding patterns may be detectable using moisture-oriented Landsat observations over large coniferous forest areas. Additional work is warranted to distinguish the signal for mast events from confounding disturbance-related effects and to differentiate variation in VI signals attributable to masting productivity in contrast to effects of climatological variability on reflectance.', '[Garcia, Matthew; Zuckerberg, Benjamin; Townsend, Philip A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

The new version of baseline brightness temperature (Tb) downscaling algorithm for SMAP is tested using L-band airborne data to evaluate the cap-abilities of the C-band Sentinel-1A SAR relative to L-band radar data in downscaling the SMAP Tb for achieving high resolution brightness temperature. In this study, the downscaling algorithm used L-band airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter (sigma) collected from the fifth Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment (SMAPEx5) in south-eastern Australia to downscale 36 km L-band SMAP radiometer Tb pixels to 3 km and 9 km. The downscaling results were then compared with the published results using Sentinel-1A C-band backscatter, and evaluated against airborne 1 km resolution L-band passive microwave brightness temperature collected from SMAPEx-5. The results show that for vertical polarization the average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of downscaled Tb when compared with reference airborne Tb across 4 days at 9 km resolution were 4.9 K for L band and 6.0 K for C-band, and increased to 9.3 K for L-band and 9.6 K for C-band at 3 km spatial resolution.

Accordingly, the RMSE increased and the correlation coefficient decreased when using C-band radar data in place of that at L-band.

We attained overall classification accuracies of 92% (Latvia) and 93% (Russia) for the forest/non-forest change maps of 1967-1989, and 91% (Latvia) and 93% (Russia) for 1989-2015, and our results were robust in regards to the segmentation scale parameter. Sample-based forest cover gain from 1967 to 1989 differed notably between the two countries (18.5% in Latvia and 23.6% in Russia), but was generally much higher prior to 1989 than from 1989 to 2015 (8.7% in Latvia and 9.7% in Russia). Furthermore, we found rapid de-fragmentation of forest cover, where forest core area increased, and proportions of isolated patches and forest corridors decreased, and this was particularly pronounced in Russia. Our findings highlight the need to study Soviet-time land cover and land use change, because rural population declines and major policy decisions such as the collectivization of agricultural production, merging of farmlands and agricultural mechanization led already during Soviet rule to widespread abandonment and afforestation of remote farmlands. After 1991, government subsidies for farming declined rapidly in both countries, but in Latvia, new financial aid from the EU became available after 2001. In contrast, remoteness, lower population density, and less of a legacy of intensive cultivation resulted in higher rates of forest gain in Russia. Including Corona imagery in our object-based image analysis workflow allowed us to examine half a century of forest cover changes, and that resulted in surprising findings, most notably that forest area gains on abandoned farm fields were already widespread during the Soviet era and not just a post-socialist land use change trend as had been previously reported.', '[Rendenieks, Zigmars; Nita, Mihai D.; Radeloff, Volker C.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, SILVIS Lab, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

Generally, the principle of existing spatio-temporal fusion methods can be characterized by a unified framework of prediction based on two parts: (i) the known fine spatial resolution images (e.g., Landsat images), and (ii) the fine spatial resolution increment predicted from the available coarse spatial resolution increment (i.e., a downscaling process), that is, the difference between the coarse spatial resolution images (e.g., MODIS images) acquired at the known and prediction times. Owing to seasonal changes and land cover changes, there always exist large differences between images acquired at different times, resulting in a large increment and, further, great uncertainty in downscaling. In this paper, a virtual image pair-based spatio-temporal fusion (VIPSTF) approach was proposed to deal with this problem. VIPSTF is based on the concept of a virtual image pair (VIP), which is produced based on the available, known MODIS-Landsat image pairs. We demonstrate theoretically that compared to the known image pairs, the VIP is closer to the data at the prediction time. The VIP can capture more fine spatial resolution information directly from known images and reduce the challenge in downscaling. VIPSTF is a flexible framework suitable for existing spatial weighting- and spatial unmixing-based methods, and two versions VIPSTF-SW and VIPSTF-SU are, thus, developed. Experimental results on a heterogeneous site and a site experiencing land cover type changes show that both spatial weighting- and spatial unmixing-based methods can be enhanced by VIPSTF, and the advantage is particularly noticeable when the observed image pairs are temporally far from the prediction time. Moreover, VIPSTF is free of the need for image pair selection and robust to the use of multiple image pairs. VIPSTF is also computationally faster than the original methods when using multiple image pairs. The concept of VIP provides a new insight to enhance spatio-temporal fusion by making fuller use of the observed image pairs and reducing the uncertainty of estimating the fine spatial resolution increment.', '[Wang, Qunming; Tang, Yijie; Tong, Xiaohua] Tongji Univ, Coll Surveying & Geoinformat, 1239 Siping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.

Given the importance of mountainous regions for ecosystem services and endemic biodiversity, monitoring these changes is essential. Satellite data provide a great resource to map land-cover change in mountainous regions, however mapping is especially challenging there because topographic complexity affects reflectance. The socalled \'topographic effect\' has been successfully corrected for in case studies of small areas, but a comparison of large-area classifications and land-cover change analyses with and without topographic correction is missing. Here, we performed a long-term land-cover change assessment for a large mountainous region, i.e., the Caucasus Mountains with topographic correction. Our two goals were 1) to examine the effect of topographic correction on land-cover classification for a large mountainous region, and 2) to assess land-cover changes since 1987 across the Caucasus based on the full Landsat archive. Both the complex topography and the history of land-use changes, especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, make the Caucasus Mountains an ideal study area to understand topographic effects on large-area land-cover mapping for the last three decades. First, we compared a non-topographically-corrected Landsat classification for 2015 with a classification that was topographically-corrected with an enhanced C-correction for the same year and assessed the accuracy of both. Second, we derived topographically-corrected Landsat classifications for six dates to assess changes in cropland and forest from 1987 to 2015, based on class probabilities and post-classification comparisons. In regard to our first goal, topographic correction improved the overall accuracy of the classification only by 2% (from 79 to 81%), but disagreement rates were as high as 100% in mountainous regions, especially among forest types. In regard to our second goal, we found that cropland loss was the most prevalent change process since 1987. Cropland loss was particularly widespread in Georgia and Armenia until 2000, and in Azerbaijan until 2005. The North Caucasus (the Russian Federation) had more stable cropland over time, most likely due to different land reforms after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the prevalence of flat landscapes and very fertile soils, which make cultivation easier than in the South Caucasus. Rates of forest change throughout the Caucasus Mountains were surprisingly low, with forest loss and forest gain being roughly equal. Forest loss was most likely related to both illegal logging and natural disturbance, whereas forest gain was most likely due to cropland abandonment and less grazing pressure. Our results highlight both the importance and the feasibility of topographic correction for accurate large-area land-cover classifications in steep terrain.', '[Buchner, Johanna; Yin, He; Lewinska, Katarzyna E.; Rizayeva, Afag; Radeloff, Volker C.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, SILVIS Lab, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

SBAS defines a network of interferograms that is limited by temporal and spatial baseline thresholds that are often applied arbitrarily, or in apparently subjective ways in the literature. We use simulated SAR data to assess (1) the influence of residual noise and SBAS network configuration on InSAR-derived deformation rates, and (2) how the number of interferograms and data gaps in the time series may further impact the estimated rates. This leads us to an approach for defining a SBAS network based on geodetic reliability theory represented by the redundancy number (r-number). Simulated InSAR datasets are generated with three subsidence signals of linear rates plus sinusoidal annual amplitudes of -2 mm/yr plus 2 mm, -20 mm/yr plus 5 mm and -100 mm/yr plus 10 mm, contaminated by Gaussian residual noise bounded within [-2; +2] mm, [-5; +5] mm and [-10; +10] mm, corresponding to standard deviations of approximately 0.5 mm, 1.5 mm and 3.0 mm, respectively. The influence of data gaps is investigated through simulations with percentages of missing data ranging from 5% to 50% that are selected (1) randomly across the 4-year time series, and (2) for three-month windows to represent the northern winter season where snow cover may cause decorrelation. These simulations show that small deformation rates are most adversely affected by residual noise. In some extreme cases, the recovered trends can be contrary to the signal (i.e., indicating uplift when there is simulated subsidence). We demonstrate through simulations that the r-number can be used to pre-determine the reliability of SBAS network design, indicating the r-values between similar to 0.8 and similar to 0.9 are optimal. r-numbers less than similar to 0.3 can deliver erroneous rates in the presence of noise commensurate with the magnitude of deformation. Finally, the influence of data gaps is not as significant compared to other factors such as a change in the number of interferograms used, although the blocks of \"winter\" gaps in the SBAS network show a larger effect on the rates than gaps at random intervals across the simulated time series.', '[Bui, Luyen K.; Featherstone, W.

Previous studies mainly focused on modeling key phenological transition dates (e.g. discrete timing of spring bud-break and fall senescence) based on aggregated climate variables (e.g. mean temperature, growing-degree days). We developed and evaluated a Bayesian Hierarchical Space-Time model for Land Surface Phenology (BHST-LSP) to synthesize remotely sensed vegetation greenness with climate covariates at a daily temporal scale from 1981 to 2014 across the entire conterminous United States. The BHST-LSP model incorporated both temporal and spatial information and exhibited high predictive power in simulating daily phenological development with an overall out-of-sample R-2 of 0.80 +/- 0.17 and 0.72 +/- 0.20 for spring and fall phenology, respectively. The overall out-of-sample normalized root mean square errors were 9.3% +/- 6.1% and 9.9% +/- 5.2% between the observed and predicted vegetation greenness for spring and fall phenology, respectively. We found that a fast increase of temperature can accelerate the speed of spring green-up while a slow decrease of temperature can lead to a decelerated fall brown-down. Increasing accumulated precipitation can benefit daily phenological development over an entire growing season, while extreme rainfall events can have the opposite effects. More frequent frost events could slow spring leaf expansion and accelerate fall leaf senescence. Impacts of extreme heat events were complex and depended on water availability. Cropland in the Midwest as well as evergreen needleleaf forest along the coastal regions showed relatively strong resistance to drought events compared to other land cover types. The BHST-LSP model can be used to forecast vegetation phenology given future climate projection, thus providing valuable information for adopting climate change adaptation and mitigation measures.', '[Qiu, Tong; Song, Conghe] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.

Updated and accurate sugarcane maps are critical for monitoring sugarcane area and production and assessing its impacts on the society, economy and the environment. To date, no sugarcane mapping tools are available to generate annual maps of sugarcane at the field scale over large regions. In this study, we developed a pixel- and phenology-based mapping tool to produce an annual map of sugarcane at 10-m spatial resolution by analyzing time-series Landsat-7/8, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 images (LC/ S2/S1) during August 31, 2017 - July 1, 2019 in Guangxi province, China, which accounts for 65% of sugarcane production of China. First, we generated annual maps of croplands and other land cover types in 2018. Second, we delineated the cropping intensity (single, double and triple cropping in a year) for all cropland pixels in 2018. Third, we identified sugarcane fields in 2018 based on its phenological characteristics. The resultant 2018 sugarcane map has producer, user and overall accuracies of 88%, 96% and 96%, respectively. According to the annual sugarcane map in 2018, there was a total of 8940 km(2) sugarcane in Guangxi, which was similar to 1% higher than the estimate from the Guangxi Agricultural Statistics Report. Finally, we identified green-up dates of those sugarcane fields in 2019, which could be used to support the sugarcane planting and management activities. Our study demonstrates the potential of the pixel- and phenology-based sugarcane mapping tool (both the algorithms and the LC/S2/S1 time series images) in identifying croplands, cropping intensity and sugarcane fields in the complex landscapes with diverse crop types, fragmented crop fields and frequent cloudy weather. The resultant annual maps from this study could be used to assist farms and sugarcane mills for sustainable sugarcane production and environment.', '[Wang, Jie; Xiao, Xiangming; Wu, Xiaocui; Qin, Yuanwei] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Microbiol & Plant Biol, 101 David L Boren Blvd, Norman, OK 73019 USA.

This study outlines data quality control criteria for obtaining the stable synchronous data needed for developing and evaluating a cross-calibration algorithm. With image data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS) and Medium Resolution Spectral Imager II (MERSI II), we developed a cross-calibration algorithm using 35 image pairs of four ocean gyres, and we evaluated the data using 11 image pairs of the global ocean. We found that our new algorithm provided well-calibrated MERSI II reflectance at the top-of-atmosphere. The coefficients of determination (R-2) were greater than 0.89, and the mean absolute percent difference (MAPD) varied from 1.13% to 8.37% in the visible bands, which was significantly superior to an algorithm developed from a data set constrained by existing data quality controls. When the satellite data were preprocessed with the new cross-calibration algorithm, the MERSI II instrument provided inter-mission remote sensing reflectance for the North Pacific Gyre that was consistent with the VIIRS instrument. Furthermore, we derived consistent estimates of remote sensing reflectance and backscattering coefficients (b(b)) from VIIRS and the cross-calibrated MERSI II reflectance data for four typically turbid coastal waters. The VIIRS bb coastal images had special distribution patterns, such as tongue-shaped plumes and mesoscale eddies, which accurately reappeared in the MERSI II images. The inter-mission MAPD values varied from 16%-24% for the coastal waters. This uncertainty level was much lower than the bb data quantified from the original MERSI II data with no cross-calibration. Our results suggest that our data quality control criteria provide good quality synchronous data for cross-calibration analysis. MERSI II could provide good ocean color products for oceanic communications after cross-calibration, even though the radiance calibration for the original MERSI II reflectance data are imperfect.', '[Chen, Jun; Liu, Zhongli] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Human Settlements & Civil Engn, Xian 710049, Peoples R China.

This narrow focus is at least partially due to a lack of data on the vertical dimension of urban land. The potential of Earth observation data to fill this gap has already been shown, but this has not yet been applied at large spatial scales. This study aims to map urban 3D building structure, i.e. building footprint, height, and volume, for Europe, the US, and China using random forest models. Our models perform well, as indicated by R-2 values of 0.90 for building footprint, 0.81 for building height, and 0.88 for building volume, for all three case regions combined. In our multidimensional input variables, we find that built-up density derived from the Global Urban Footprint (GUF) is the most important variable for estimating building footprint, while backscatter intensity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is the most important variable for estimating building height. A combination of the two is essential to estimate building volume. Our analysis further highlights the heterogeneity of 3D building structure across space. Specifically, buildings in China tend to be taller on average (10.35 m) compared to Europe (7.37 m) and the US (6.69 m). At the same time, the building volume per capita in China is lowest, with 302.3 m(3) per capita, while Europe and the US show estimates of 404.6 m(3) and 565.4 m(3), respectively.

Automatic extraction of field boundaries from satellite imagery would reduce the reliance on manual input of these records, which is time consuming, and would underpin the provision of remote products and services. The lack of current field boundary data sets seems to indicate low uptake of existing methods, presumably because of expensive image preprocessing requirements and local, often arbitrary, tuning. In this paper, we propose a data-driven, robust and general method to facilitate field boundary extraction from satellite images. We formulated this task as a multi-task semantic segmentation problem. We used ResUNet-a, a deep convolutional neural network with a fully connected UNet backbone that features dilated convolutions and conditioned inference to identify: 1) the extent of fields; 2) the field boundaries; and 3) the distance to the closest boundary. By asking the algorithm to reconstruct three correlated outputs, the model\'s performance and its ability to generalise greatly improve. Segmentation of individual fields was then achieved by post-processing the three model outputs, e.g., via thresholding or watershed segmentation. Using a single monthly composite image from Sentinel-2 as input, our model was highly accurate in mapping field extent, field boundaries and, consequently, individual fields. Replacing the monthly composite with a single-date image close to the compositing period marginally decreased accuracy. We then showed in a series of experiments that, without recalibration, the same model generalised well across resolutions (10 m to 30 m), sensors (Sentinel-2 to Landsat-8), space and time. Building consensus by averaging model predictions from at least four images acquired across the season is paramount to reducing the temporal variations of accuracy. Our convolutional neural network is capable of learning complex hierarchical contextual features from the image to accurately detect field boundaries and discard irrelevant boundaries, thereby outperforming conventional edge filters. By minimising over-fitting and image preprocessing requirements, and by replacing local arbitrary decisions by data-driven ones, our approach is expected to facilitate the extraction of individual crop fields at scale.', '[Waldner, Francois] CSIRO, Agr & Food, 306 Carmody Rd, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.

The most recent addition to the family of global DEMs is the TanDEM-X DEM with resolution of 0.4?arc sec. DEMs are essential for a wide range of environmental applications, many of which are related to mountains including studies on natural hazards, forestry or glacier mass changes. However, synthetic aperture radar interferometry used for acquisition of TanDEM-X DEM is especially challenging over steep and irregular mountain surfaces due to shadowing and foreshortening effects. In this study, we assessed the absolute vertical accuracy of TanDEM-X DEM in European mountains. We compared it with both a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and a Digital Surface Model (DSM) derived from airborne laser scanning data. Our results indicate that the height error of TanDEM-X DEM expressed as absolute deviation at the 90% quantile is consistent with the 10?m mission specification benchmark. We further concentrated on the absolute height error with respect to environmental characteristics (i.e. forested and non-forested areas, slope, and aspect). The comparison of TanDEM-X DEM with a reference DTM showed a positive vertical offset; however, the mean error differed greatly between forested and non-forested areas. When compared to reference DSM, our results showed a slight underestimation. We observed the highest underestimation in deciduous forests, followed by coniferous forests and non-forested areas. A significant decrease in accuracy was observed with increasing slope, especially for slopes above 10 degrees. In mountains where the imagery was acquired only in one orbit direction (i.e. ascending for Northern hemisphere), the largest TanDEM-X DEM error when compared to DSM was recorded for the west-facing slopes (i.e. slopes facing the sensor); however, the association with terrain orientation diminished in mountains, the imagery of which was acquired from both the ascending and descending orbit. Finally, we evaluated the effect of data acquisition characteristics provided with TanDEM-X DEM as auxiliary data. Our results show that two coverages might not be sufficient in mountain environment. Additional acquisitions, especially those with different acquisition geometry, improved the absolute vertical accuracy of TanDEM-X DEM and eliminated areas of inconsistency. We discourage from using the Height Error Map (HEM) to estimate the error magnitude.

Due to the impracticality of maintaining ground instrumentation over wide geographic areas, remote sensing and numerical model-based fine-scale mapping of soil water conditions have been applied for water resource applications at a range of spatial scales. Here, we present a prototype framework for integrating high-resolution thermal infrared (TIR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing data into a soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer (SVAT) model with the aim of providing improved estimates of surface- and root-zone soil moisture that can support optimized irrigation management strategies. Specifically, remotely-sensed estimates of water stress (from TIR) and surface soil moisture retrievals (from SAR) are assimilated into a 30-m resolution SVAT model over a vineyard site in the Central Valley of California, U.S. The efficacy of our data assimilation algorithm is investigated via both the synthetic and real data experiments. Results demonstrate that a particle filtering approach is superior to an ensemble Kalman filter for handling the nonlinear relationship between model states and observations. In addition, biophysical conditions such as leaf area index are shown to impact the relationship between observations and states and must therefore be represented accurately in the assimilation model. Overall, both surface and root-zone soil moisture predicted via the SVAT model are enhanced through the assimilation of thermal and radar-based retrievals, suggesting the potential for improving irrigation management at the agricultural sub-field-scale using a data assimilation strategy.', '[Lei, Fangni; Crow, Wade T.; Kustas, William P.; Dong, Jianzhi; Yang, Yun; Knipper, Kyle R.; Anderson, Martha C.; Gao, Feng; McKee, Lynn M.; Alfieri, Joseph G.] ARS, Hydrol & Remote Sensing Lab, USDA, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA.

The Himawari-8/Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) satellite measurements receive high spatial, temporal and spectral signals, which provides an opportunity to estimate cloud, aerosol and SSR accurately.   In this study, we developed the AHI official cloud property product (version 1.0) for JAXA P-Tree system. A look-up table (LUT) method was used to calculate high-temporal (10 min) and high-spatial (5 km) SSR from AHI cloud properties. First, the LUT of the SSR estimation was optimized through a radiative transfer model to account for solar zenith angle, cloud optical thickness (COT), effective particle radius (CER), aerosol optical thickness and surface albedo. Following this, COT and CER were retrieved from the AHI data, with ice cloud parameters being retrieved from an extended Voronoi ice crystal scattering database and water cloud parameters being retrieved from the MieLorenz scattering model. The retrieved COT and CER for water clouds were compared well with MODIS collection 6 cloud property products, with correlation coefficients of 0.77 and 0.82, respectively. The COT of ice cloud also shows good consistency, with a correlation coefficient of 0.85. Finally, the SSR was calculated based on the SSR LUT and the retrieved cloud optical parameters. The estimated SSR was validated at 122 radiation stations from several observing networks covering the disk region of Himawari-8. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) at CMA (China Meteorological Administration) stations was 101.86 Wm(-2) for hourly SSR and 31.42 Wm(-2) for daily SSR; RMSE at non-CMA stations was 119.07 Wm(-2) for instantaneous SSR, 81.10 Wm(-2) for hourly SSR and 26.58 Wm(-2) for daily SSR. Compared with the SSR estimated from conventional geostationary satellites, the accuracy of the SSR obtained in this study was significantly improved.', '[Letu, Husi; Wang, Tianxing; Shang, Huazhe; Chen, Liangfu; Shi, Jiancheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Datun Rd 20 North, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

Harmonic time series models, i.e., superimposed sequences of sines and cosines, have an established provenance for fitting satellite vegetation index time series to coarse resolution satellite data, but their application to medium resolution Landsat data for crop monitoring has been limited. Non-linear harmonic models have been shown to perform well over agricultural sites using single-year Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series, but have not been explored with Landsat data. The 2017 availability of Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) over the United States provides the opportunity to investigate the utility of temporally rich Landsat data for 30m pixel-level crop monitoring. In this paper, the capability of 5- and 7-parameter linear harmonic models and a 5-parameter non-linear harmonic model applied to a year of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) ARD is investigated. The analysis is undertaken over six sites, each defined by a 5000x5000 30m pixel ARD tile, that together include the major conterminous United States (CONUS) crops identified by inspection of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Cropland Data Layer (CDL). The model fits are evaluated as the root mean square difference (RMSD) between the fitted and the observed Landsat data. Considering locations with at least 21 annual Landsat observations, the 7-parameter linear harmonic model (tile mean crop NDVI RMSD values ranging from 0.052 to 0.072) and the 5-parameter non-linear harmonic model (tile mean crop NDVI RMSD values ranging from 0.054 to 0.074) are shown to be able to fit annual Landsat NDVI time series for most CONUS crops, whereas the 5-parameter linear harmonic model cannot (tile mean crop NDVI RMSD values ranging from 0.072 to 0.099). If there are between 15 and 20 annual Landsat observations, the 5-parameter non-linear harmonic model is recommended for fitting annual NDVI crop time series, and if there are >= 21 observations, then either the 5-parameter non-linear or the 7-parameter linear model can be used. The 7-parameter model had marginally smaller mean NDVI RMSD values but larger standard deviations than the 5-parameter non-linear model, likely due to the relative robustness of the non-linear model to over-fitting and oscillations. None of the models could reliably fit crops with multiple stages, such as alfalfa, that are insufficiently sampled using combined Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ time series. Given the utility of the growing season peak NDVI for crop yield applications, the date and magnitude of the model fitted peak NDVI are compared to quantify model reporting differences. The differences between the 7-parameter linear and the 5-parameter non-linear harmonic models are not large. For each ARD tile, the mean absolute differences in the estimated peak NDVI days varied from < 2 days in the northern ARD tiles, which had short growing seasons and similar crops, to less than a week for the other tiles except for nearly 10 days for the California tile that had longer growing seasons and more diverse crops including crops with multiple stages.

Their elevation values were compared against values measured with a dual-frequency Trimble 5800 Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receiver with two antennas in static relative positioning. A total of 139 ground control points (GCPs) with elevations of up to 4334 m above sea level (asl). were obtained from four topographically contrasting regions along the flat, arid coast, the semi-dry Andes and the Amazon rainforest. The combined results of the four areas showed that the residuals of ASTER GDEM2 had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.907 m, SRTM3 5.113 m and AW3D30 6.246 m. For the two areas where TanDEM-X was investigated, a RMSE of 1.666 m was obtained. When considering each area individually, of the three 30-m DEMs, SRTM3 performed best in all areas, while ASTER GDEM2 was always performing worst. The standard deviation (SD) of the residuals of ASTER GDEM2 and AW3D30 varied much more between the four study areas than the SD of SRTM3 and TanDEM-X. It was possible to establish linear correlations with R-2 > 0.95 between the GNSS-measured and DEM-derived elevation values for all areas and all DEMs, which can be used to correct ASTER GDEM2 and AW3D30 for Peru. No relationship was found between absolute elevation and residuals. Slope angle of > 15 degrees, however, correlated to much higher residuals for SRTM3 and AW3D30, whereas a constant increase in residual correlated to a constant increase in slope angle for TanDEM-X. In general, the highest residuals corresponded to the highest slope classes. A comparison of absolute elevation values and slope angles of selected areas between ASTER GDEM2 and SRTM3, as well as between AW3D30 and SRTM3, showed in all cases more deviation from true values in areas with steeper slopes. This effect seems independent of vegetation. The presence of buildings however, severely affected performance of ASTER GDEM2. For some areas, AW3D30 suffered from mismatch between adjacent scenes and horizontal and oblique stripping. An analysis of drainage networks showed that all three 30-m DEMs were capable of producing a similar number of Strahler orders, total number of channels, minimum and maximum channel length and accumulative channel length. All DEMs produced accurate networks in the upper reaches of the catchments, but suffered in flat areas such as wide fluvial valleys and sink-filled areas. ASTER GDEM2 in particular produced parallel river channels and unnatural short cuts. Our results agreed well with those of other studies elsewhere around the world and showed that i) the vertical error is much less than those officially reported for all DEMs; ii) slope is the most determinant factor in DEM accuracy. We conclude that SRTM3 delivers the most stable performance in almost all tests and is therefore the DEM of choice for landscape analysis in Peru. TanDEM-X 12 m performed very well in our elevation accuracy test and could become a worthy successor to SRTM3.', '[del Rosario Gonzalez-Moradas, Maria] Univ Oviedo, Dept Explotac & Prospect Minas, Area Ingn Cartog Geodesia & Fotogrametria, Oviedo, Spain.

Crop water productivity (CWP) is a performance indicator to monitor and evaluate water use efficiency in agriculture. Often in remote sensing datasets of CWP and its components, i.e. crop yield or above ground biomass production (AGBP) and evapotranspiration (ETa), the end-users and developers are different actors. The accuracy of the datasets should therefore be clear to both users and developers. We assess the accuracy of remotely sensed CWP against the accuracy of estimated in-situ CWP. First, the accuracy of CWP based on in-situ methods, which are assumed to be the user\'s benchmark for CWP accuracy, is reviewed. Then, the accuracy of current remote sensing products is described to determine if the accuracy benchmark, as set by in-situ methods, can be met with current algorithms. The percentage error of CWP from in-situ methods ranges from 7% to 67%, depending on method and scale. The error of CWP from remote sensing ranges from 7% to 22%, based on the highest reported performing remote sensing products. However, when considering the entire breadth of reported crop yield and ETa, accuracy, the achievable errors propagate to CWP ranges of 74% to 108%. Although the remote sensing CWP appears comparable to the accuracy of in-situ methods in many cases, users should determine whether it is suitable for their specific application of CWP.', '[Blatchford, Megan L.; Mannaerts, Chris M.; Zeng, Yijian] ITC UTWENTE, Hengelostr 99, NL-7514 AE Enschede, Netherlands.

We considered two spatial scales to capture the spatially heterogeneous nature of the effects of hurricanes. A first more fine-grained one where we considered 120 km radius disks centered at every consecutive hurricane position within the EEZ (scale 1) and a second more coarse grained one enclosing the entire EEZ (scale 2). We conclude that the hurricanes induced a weak cooling since 75 and 85% of the SST anomalies at scale 1 and 2, respectively, were smaller than -1 degrees C. The sea surface cooling was mainly caused by wind-driven processes. The maximum chl-a responses were recorded in the first and second post-storm weeks, with 60% ranging between -0.01 and 0.04 mg m(-3) at scale 1, and between -0.07 and 0.02 mg m(-3) at scale 2. During those post-storm weeks SST and chl-a anomalies were 18 and 44% higher at scale 1 than at scale 2, respectively. We argue that the transport of chl-a from the deep chlorophyll maximum and/or the rich coastal waters are the dominant mechanisms determining the post-storm chl-a response in the EEZ. We also found that the magnitude of the Island Mass Effect (i.e., increase of chl-a concentration in waters surrounding islands) after the passage of the hurricanes was 89% higher in the EEZ than before its passage.', '[Avila-Alonso, Daile; Cardenas, Rolando] Univ Cent Marta Abreu Villas, Dept Phys, Lab Planetary Sci, Santa Clara 54830, Cuba.

Knowing the sources, patterns and driving factors of model uncertainty aids the development of more accurate flood predictions. This study investigates the consistency of two global flood inundation products, i.e., the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite based fractional water (Fw) cover and the Global Flood Monitoring System (GFMS) modeled flood inundation. Using Pearson\'s correlation coefficient (r) as the indicator of the SMAP-GFMS model consistency, this research documents the spatial and temporal patterns of the correlations between the two flood products, and investigates factors affecting these relationships, including climate, land cover, hydrology and terrain distributions. Results reveal that globally, 64% locations have moderate to strong SMAP-GFMS correlation (r >= 0.4). Locations that are dry and have low biomass and high seasonal flood variability tend to have high correlation; for example, 47% locations with r >= 0.4 occur in tropical and arid climate zones, and 43% locations with r >= 0.4 are observed in Barren, Evergreen Broadleaf Forest, Grasslands, Open Shrubland and Savannahs. Also, larger rivers have higher correlation, and in each Strahler stream order there are 60% to 65% locations having r >= 0.4. Larger watersheds show higher SMAP-GFMS consistency in particular watersheds between 1000 and 40,000 km(2). Regions with greater urban infrastructure tend to have lower correlation, while locations with lower elevations and relatively flat topography have higher SMAP-GFMS consistency. This study indicates that GFMS and SMAP provide complementary information on surface water storage variations influencing precipitation driven runoff and flooding, which may enable enhanced global flood predictions.', '[Wu, Huan; Huang, Zhijun] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Climate Change & Nat Disas, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.

Remote sensing has played a vital role in this endeavor during the last five decades by quantifying carbon fluxes and stocks. The availability of satellite observations of the land surface since the 1970s, particularly the early 1980s, has made it feasible to quantify ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks at regional to global scales. Here we provide a review of the advances in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle from the early 1970s to present. First, we present an overview of the terrestrial carbon cycle and remote sensing of carbon fluxes and stocks. Remote sensing data acquired in a broad wavelength range (visible, infrared, and microwave) of the electromagnetic spectrum have been used to estimate carbon fluxes and/or stocks. Second, we provide a historical overview of the key milestones in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Third, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in remote sensing of carbon fluxes. The remote sensing data and techniques used to quantify carbon fluxes include vegetation indices, light use efficiency models, terrestrial biosphere models, data-driven (or machine learning) approaches, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), land surface temperature, and atmospheric inversions. Fourth, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in passive optical, microwave, and lidar remote sensing of biomass carbon stocks as well as remote sensing of soil organic carbon. Fifth, we review the progresses in remote sensing of disturbance impacts on the carbon cycle. Sixth, we also discuss the uncertainty and validation of the resulting carbon flux and stock estimates. Finally, we offer a forward-looking perspective and insights for future research and directions in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Remote sensing is anticipated to play an increasingly important role in carbon cycling studies in the future. This comprehensive and insightful review on 50?years of remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle is timely and valuable and can benefit scientists in various research communities (e.g., carbon cycle, remote sensing, climate change, ecology) and inform ecosystem and carbon management, carbon-climate projections, and climate policymaking.', '[Xiao, Jingfeng] Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Earth Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA.

The different sources (e.g., radar, optical and LiDAR sensors) and analysis approaches (e.g., differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar, DInSAR; multiple-aperture InSAR; pixel offset tracking; and iterative closest point, ICP) in imaging geodesy used to derive displacement estimates have unique benefits and drawbacks. However, the inherent differences among these data sources and methods in the construction of three-dimensional (3D) deformation maps, particularly in the near field, remain poorly understood and require further discussion. In this study, we acquired three pairs of ALOS-2 stripmap mode images, two pairs of Sentinel-1 TOPS mode images and pre- and post-event LiDAR data for the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake to explore the 3D near-field displacements using various imaging geodesy techniques with different types of image information, i.e., SAR phase data, SAR amplitude data and LiDAR point cloud data. Our results show that each image type is independently capable of producing a high-quality 3D deformation map for the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake with an on-fault accuracy of <43 cm determined from field work measurement, and an off-fault accuracy of <14 cm determined from GNSS observations. The major contributors to the uncertainty in the 3D deformation estimates from the SAR phase, SAR amplitude, and LiDAR data methods are the effective Doppler bandwidth, pixel resolution and topographic roughness, respectively. In the near-field deformation region, more secondary fault ruptures were revealed by SAR amplitude and LiDAR information than by the SAR phase information, thereby overcoming the sensitivity of the SAR phase signal to incoherence. Finally, an integrated complete 3D map was generated to constrain the coseismic rupture behavior of the Kumamoto earthquake sequence associated with the Futagawa and Hinagu faults. Our slip model suggests the main slip rupture a length of 32 km and terminated near the rim of the Aso caldera; additionally, the slip pattern delineated by three asperities that was dominated by right-lateral strike-slip with a minor normal slip component at a depth of 7 km. Furthermore, the main rupture triggered two secondary faults with right-lateral strike-slip and normal slip.

Variants of the Fraunhofer Line Depth/Discriminator (FLD) method are used as the basis of retrieval algorithms for estimating SIF from space. Although typically unobserved directly, recent advances in FLD-based algorithms now facilitate the prediction (by model inversion) of the canopy emitted fluorescence spectrum from the discrete-feature FLD retrievals.   Here we present first canopy scale measurements of chlorophyll a fluorescence spectra emitted from Scots pine at two times of year, and also from a lingonberry dominated understory. We used a high power mul-tispectral Light Emitting Diode (LED) array to illuminate the respective canopies at night and measured under standardised conditions using a field spectrometer mounted in the nadir position above the canopy. We refer to the technique, which facilitates the in situ upscaling of a commonly measured leaf scale quantity to the canopy, as nocturnal LED-Induced chlorophyll a Fluorescence (LEDIF).   The shape of the LEDIF spectra was dependant on the colour of the excitation light and also on the dominant species. Because we measured pine at two different times of year we were also able to show an increase in the canopy scale apparent quantum yield of fluorescence which was consistent with leaf-level increase in fluorescence yield recorded with a monitoring PAM fluorometer.   The automation of the LEDIF technique could be used to estimate seasonal changes in canopy fluorescence spectra and yield from fixed or mobile platforms and provide a window into functional traits across species and architectures. LEDIF could also be used to evaluate FLD and inversion-based retrievals of canopy spectra, as well as different irradiance normalisation schemes typically applied to SIF data to account for the dependence of SIF on ambient light conditions.', '[Atherton, Jon; Porcar-Castell, Albert] Univ Helsinki, Opt Photosynth Lab, Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res Forest Sci, Helsinki, Finland.

However, global NDVI products are usually provided with relatively coarse spatial resolutions that lack important spatial details. Producing NDVI time-series data with high spatiotemporal resolution is indispensable for monitoring land surfaces and ecosystem changes, especially in spatiotemporally heterogeneous areas. The Improved Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (IFSDAF) method was developed in this study to fill this need. In accord with the distinctive characteristics of NDVIs with large data variance and high spatial autocorrelation compared with raw reflectance bands, the IFSDAF method first produces a time-dependent increment with linear unmixing and a space-dependent increment via thin plate spline interpolation. It then makes a final prediction by optimal integration of these two increments with the constrained least squares method. Moreover, the IFSDAF was developed with the capacity to use all available finer-scaled images, including those partly contaminated by clouds. NDVI images with coarse spatial resolution (MODIS) and fine spatial resolution (Landsat and Sentinel) in areas with great spatial heterogeneity and significant land cover changes were used to test the performance of the IFSDAF method. The root mean square error and relative root mean square error of predicted relative to observed results were 0.0884 and 22.12%, respectively, in heterogeneous areas, and 0.0546 and 25.77%, respectively, in areas of land-cover change. These promising results demonstrated the strength and robustness of the IFSDAF method in providing reliable NDVI datasets with high spatial and temporal resolution to support research on land surface processes. The efficiency of the proposed IFSDAF method can be greatly improved by using only the space-dependent increment. This simplification will make IFSDAF a feasible method for monitoring global vegetation.', '[Liu, Meng; Chen, Jin; Chen, Xuehong] Beijing Normal Univ, Inst Remote Sensing Sci & Engn, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

The commonly applied area-based approach (ABA) allows the derivation of wall-to-wall geospatial coverages representing each of the modeled attributes at a grid-cell level, with spatial resolutions typically between 20 and 30 m. The ABA predictive models are developed using stratified inventory data from field plots, the requirement for which can increase the overall cost of the ALS-based inventory. Parsimonious use of ground plots is a key means to control variable costs in the operational implementation of the ABA. In this paper, we demonstrate how the prediction accuracy of Lorey\'s height (HL, m), quadratic mean diameter (QMD, cm), and gross volume (V, m(3)) vary when existing ABA models are transferred to different areas or are applied to point cloud data with different characteristics than those on which the original model was developed. Specifically, we consider three scenarios of model transferability: (i) same point cloud characteristics, different areas; (ii) different point cloud characteristics, same areas; and (iii) different point cloud characteristics, different areas. We generated area-based models using three modeling approaches: linear regression (OLS), random forests (RF), and k-nearest neighbour (kNN) imputation. Results indicated that the prediction accuracy of area-based models varied by attribute and by modeling approach. We found that when the models were transferred their prediction accuracy decreased, with an average increase in relative bias up to 22.04%, and increase in relative RMSE up to 29.31%. Prediction accuracies for HL were higher than those of QMD or V when models were transferred, and had the lowest average increase in relative bias and relative RMSE of < 5% in the majority of cases. Likewise OLS models for HL had greater prediction accuracies when models were transferred compared to RF and kNN models, especially when the point cloud characteristics were similar. Conversely, we found that for QMD and V, RF models were found to be the most transferable in cases when models were applied to different areas with similar and different point cloud characteristics. While there is potential for cost savings by transferring models and reducing data acquisition costs, our results show the degree of transferability depends more on the attribute being modelled or the modeling approach applied, and less on the characteristics of the point cloud data.', '[Tompalski, Piotr; Coops, Nicholas C.] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.

The improved performance of this approach was based on the specification of local POC absorption characteristics based on dominant POC sources; phytoplankton or detritus based. This specification was made using a new POC-Index (PI), developed and tested across a range of POC (300-10,000 mg/m(3)) conditions in temporally and spatially heterogeneous inland and coastal waterbodies. The POC model was based on remote sensing reflectance (R-rs, sr(-1)) in four wavebands: R-rs(751), R-rs(488) and R-rs(R/G), where R is the red band [R-rs(672)] for detritus dominated waters and G is the green band [R-rs(555)] in the phytoplankton dominated waters. The model provided a high R-2 (0.74) and relatively low r(RMSE) (42.0%, N = 136, p < 0.01). Validation with independent datasets from Chaohu Lake and the Yangtze River Estuary produced a larger positive bias (R-2 = 0.59, r(RMSE) = 83%, delta = 634 mg/m(3), S = 0.63, I = 1439 mg/m(3)); nevertheless, the bias was reduced when tuned with local data (R-2 = 0.80, r(RMSE) = 45%, delta = 72 mg/m(3), S = 0.81, I = 327 mg/m(3)). Additionally, HydroLight simulations presented an independent correlation between PI and CDOM conditions and reasonable POC estimates from the new approach developed in this study. The approach was tested using data from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) in a range of optically complex conditions to quantify carbon dynamics. We indicate the advantages and challenges of using this approach in ecosystems where multiple organic carbon sources are present.', '[Jiang, Guangjia; Ma, Ronghua; Duan, Hongtao] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

Since the spectral signals of chlorophyll content and leaf area are highly coupled, it is required to remove the effect of the LAI on the retrieval of Chl(Leaf) from satellite data. In this paper, an approach for the retrieval of Chl(Leaf) was proposed. A 2-dimensional matrix-based relationship between Chl(Leaf) and two VIs was established using simulated datasets from the PROSAIL model. The matrix was formed by dividing the two-VI space into m x n cells and assigning the Chl(Leaf) value to each cell. Based on the matrix, the Chl(Leaf) can be retrieved using the two VIs from observations. Three matrices of different VI pairs for retrieving Chl(Leaf) were tested using the PROSAIL simulated data. The results show that the matrix formed with two new VIs, RERI[705] and RERI[783], works best. The results from the matrices of two VIs are better than those from individual VIs as well as from VI ratios. The matrices were successfully used to retrieve the Chl(Leaf) of winter wheat from Sentinel-2 images. The Chl(Leaf) estimations using the RERI[705]-RERI[783] matrix achieves an accuracy of R-2 = 0.70, RMSE = 10.4 mu g/cm(2), and NRMSE = 11.9%. The estimations using the TCARI-OSAVI and the R-740/R-705-R-865/R-665 matrices are also in good agreement with the measured Chl(Leaf) (R-2 > 0.48, RMSE < 13.1 mu g/cm(2), and NRMSE < 15.1%).

The reference data consisted of 739 circular field plots that had been collected by the Finnish Forest Centre concurrently with the Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 acquisitions. The input data were divided into training, validation and test sets of equal sizes for 100 iterations in each modelling setup. The predicted forest variables were stem volume (V), stem diameter (D), tree height (H) and basal area (G), and their species-wise components for pine (Pine), spruce (Spr) and broadleaved (BL) trees. We recorded the performance figures and the best predictive image bands for each modelling setup.   The best average performance over the 100 modelling iterations was obtained using all Sentinel-2 bands. The plot-level relative root mean square errors (RMSE%) of the field observed mean were 38.4% for average stem diameter, 42.5% for stem basal area/ha, 30.4% for average tree height, and 59.3% for growing stock volume/ha with variables including all tree species.

The Sentinel-2 outperformed Landsat 8 also when using near-equivalent image bands and Sentinel-2 data down-sampled to 30 m pixel resolution. The relative systematic error (bias%) did not show any significant differences between Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data: the average of the absolute value of bias% was 0.8% for Sentinel-2 and 1.2% for Landsat 8.

The question is how to summarize remotely sensed data so that they are most relevant for biodiversity analyses, and the Dynamic Habitat Indices are three metrics designed for this. Our goals here were to a) derive, for the first time, the Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs) globally, and b) use these to evaluate three hypotheses (available energy, environmental stress, and environmental stability) that attempt to explain global variation in species richness of amphibians, birds, and mammals. The three DHIs summarize three key measures of vegetative productivity: a) annual cumulative productivity, which we used to evaluate the available energy hypothesis that more energy is associate with higher species richness; b) minimum productivity throughout the year, which we used to evaluate the environmental stress hypothesis that higher minima cause higher species richness, and c) seasonality, expressed as the annual coefficient of variation in productivity, which we used to evaluate the environmental stability hypothesis that less intra-annual variability causes higher species richness. We calculated the DHIs globally at 1-km resolution from MODIS vegetation products (NDVI, EVI, LAI, fPAR, and GPP), based on the median of the good observations of all years from the entire MODIS record for each of the 23 or 46 possible dates (8- vs. 16-day composites) during the year, and calculated species richness for three taxa (amphibians, birds, and mammals) at 110-km resolution from species range maps from the IUCN Red List. We found marked global patterns of the DHIs, and strong support for all three hypotheses. The three DHIs for a given vegetation product were well correlated (Spearman rank correlations ranging from -0.6 (cumulative vs. variation DHIs) to -0.93 (variation vs. minimum DHI)). Similarly, DHI components derived from different MODIS vegetation products were well correlated (0.8-0.9), and correlations of the DHIs with temperature and precipitation were moderate and strong respectively. All three DHIs were well correlated with species richness, showing in ranked order positive correlations for cumulative DHI based on GPP (Spearman rank correlations of 0.75, 0.63, and 0.67 for amphibians, resident birds, and mammals respectively) and minimum DHI (0.73, 0.83, and 0.62), and negative for variation DHI (-0.69, -0.83, and -0.59). Multiple linear models of all three DHIs explained 67%, 65%, and 61% of the variability in species richness of amphibians, resident birds, and mammals, respectively. The DHIs, which are closely related to well-established ecological hypotheses of biodiversity, can predict species richness well, and are promising for application in biodiversity science and conservation.', '[Radeloff, V.

This research introduces Multiple Optimal Depth Predictors Analysis (MODPA), which combines previously developed depth predictors along with additional predictors derived from the intensity component of the HSI color space transformation. MODPA empirically selects a set of optimal predictors among all candidates utilizing partial least squares (PIS), stepwise, or principal component (PC) regression models. The primary focus of this study was on shallow (< 1 m deep) and clearly flowing streams where substrate variability could have a pronounced effect on depth retrieval. Spectroscopic experiments were performed under controlled conditions in a hydraulic laboratory to examine the robustness of bathymetry models with respect to changes in bottom type. Further, simulations from radiative transfer modeling were used to extend the analysis by isolating the effect of inherent optical properties (IOPs) and by investigating the performance of bathymetry models in optically complex and deeper streams. The bathymetry of the Sarca River, a shallow river in the Italian Alps, was mapped using a WorldView-2 (WV-2) image, for which we evaluated the atmospheric compensation (AComp) product. Results indicated the greater robustness of multiple-predictor models particularly MODPA rather than single-predictor models, such as Optimal Band Ratio Analysis (OBRA), with respect to heterogeneity of bottom types, IOPs, and atmospheric effects. The HSI intensity component enhanced the accuracy of depth retrieval, particularly in optically-complex waters and also for low spectral resolution imagery (e.g., GeoEye).

The detailed description of the airborne image processing method is given. As demonstrated, retrieved spectra agree well with nearby NDBC buoy data, both for spectrum shape, level and energy angular distribution. The 180-degree wave direction ambiguity, inherent to image-derived spectra, is eliminated by using cross-correlation analysis between two consecutive images.

In this article, a novel framework that utilizes a UAV-based hyperspectral image is proposed to identify the degree of damage caused by Dendrolirnus tabulaeformis Tsai et Liu (D.tabulaeformis) in Jianping county of Liaoning province, China. First, data reduction of the hyperspectral image is achieved by comparing three waveband selection algorithms: principal components analysis (PCA), the successive projection algorithm (SPA), and the instability index between classes (ISIC). On this basis, a joint algorithm, ISIC-SPA, which demonstrates the best waveband selection efficiency and good cross-validation accuracy, is proposed. ISIC-SPA is used to select only three sensitive wavebands from 125 original wavebands with a root mean square error of 0.1535. Then, according to analysis of the three sensitive wavebands\' reflectance and the corresponding defoliation rate, the piecewise index (PI, B(710 + 738 - 522)) was constructed and the threshold of PI was found to divide the defoliation level. Finally, a piecewise partial least squares regression model was established to quantitatively estimate the defoliation using the optimal wavebands to identify and demarcate the damage level to individual trees. The assessment accuracy of damage caused by D.tabulaeformis at the tree level reached 95.23% using the ISIC-SPA-P-PLSR framework.', '[Zhang, Ning; Zhang, Xiaoli; Zhu, Chenghao; Huo, Langning] Beijing Forestry Univ, Forestry Coll, Beijing Key Lab Precis Forestry, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.

Coral reefs represent a unique challenge for remote sensing, being highly heterogeneous at metre scales and occurring at variable depths and water clarity regimes. However, conservation initiatives, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, add urgency to the need for the large scale environmental monitoring information that remote sensing can provide. In the quest to meet this challenge a range of satellite instruments have been leveraged, from Landsat to high spatial resolution sensors such as WorldView-2, toward objectives such as: mapping of bottom types, bathymetry, change detection, and detection of coral bleaching events. Sentinel-2A and 2B offer a new paradigm of available instruments, with a 5-day revisit, 10m multispectral spatial resolution and freely available data. Pre-launch simulation analyses by several of the authors suggested Sentinel-2 would have good performance for reef applications, in this paper we follow up on this study by reviewing the potential based on the substantial archive of actual data now available.   First we determine to what extent the World\'s reefs are covered by Sentinel-2, since the mission requirements do not by default include all reefs. Secondly we review how a 5-day revisit translates to a usable acquisition rate of clear images, given that cloud and surface glint are common confounding factors. The usable acquisition rate is the real determinant of the objectives to which the data can be applied. Finally we apply current processing algorithms to Sentinel-2 data of several sites over the Great Barrier Reef, including physics-based bathymetry inversion and object-orientated benthic mapping. Landsat 8 OLI is most comparable current sensor to Sentinel-2 MSI, so direct comparisons and the possibilities for data synthesis are explored.   Our findings confirm that Sentinel-2 has excellent performance for meeting several essential coral reef scientific and monitoring objectives. Taking into account cloud and sun glint, the usable acquisition rate for a large proportion of reefs is likely to be around 20 clear images a year on average, giving a new potential for evaluation of short time-scale disturbances and impacts. The spatial resolution of 10 m is a key threshold for delineating benthic features of interest such as coral structures, and there is evidence from image and field data that bleaching is detectable. Radiometrically Sentinel-2 data can support good results in physics-based methods, such as bathymetric mapping, comparable to Landsat 8 and WorldView-2. In addition the large scale acquisition area, provided by the 290 km wide swath, offers advantages over high spatial resolution imagery for mapping at multi-reef scales.   Sentinel-2 data can be immediately leveraged with existing methods, to provide a new level of reef monitoring information compared to that previously available by remote sensing. Combined with Landsat 8 and the historical Landsat archive, the data collected today will be invaluable for decades or even centuries to come. In this context, the main downside of the Sentinel-2 mission is that approximately 12% of the World\'s reefs currently lie outside the acquisition plan and are not imaged. Surprisingly, for a European initiative, coral reefs in European governed territories are among the worst served globally. These omissions, approximately only 1/200th of the currently imaged area, limit the global scope which otherwise would be one of Sentinel-2s greatest strengths.', '[Hedley, John D.] Numer Opt Ltd, Tiverton, England.

However, the adverse effects of ALAN on human health and ecosystems have not been well understood. Because of a lack of high resolution data, studies of ALAN in China have been confined to coarse resolution, and fine-scale details are missing. The fine details of ALAN are pertinent, because the highly dense population in Chinese cities has created a distinctive urban lighting pattern. In this paper, we introduced a new generation of high spatial resolution and multi-spectral night-time light imagery from the satellite JL1-3B. We examined its effectiveness for monitoring the spatial pattern and discriminating the types of artificial light based on a case study of Hangzhou, China. Specifically, local Moran\'s I analysis was applied to identify artificial light hotspots. Then, we analyzed the relationship between artificial light brightness and land uses at the parcel-level, which were generated from GF-2 imagery and open social datasets. Third, a machine learning based method was proposed to discriminate the type of lighting sources - between high pressure sodium lamps (HPS) and light-emitting diode lamps (LED) - by incorporating their spectral information and morphology feature. The result shows a complicated heterogeneity of illumination characteristics across different land uses, where main roads, commercial and institutional areas were brightly lit while residential area, industrial area and agricultural land were dark at night. It further shows that the proposed method was effective at separating light emitted by HPS and LED, with an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 83.86% and 0.67, respectively. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of JL1-3B and its superiority over previous night-time light data in detecting details of lighting objects and the nightscape pattern, and suggests that JL1-3B and alike could open up new opportunities for the advancement of night-time remote sensing.', '[Zheng, Qiming; Huang, Lingyan; Wang, Ke; Deng, Jinsong; Jiang, Ruowei; Ye, Ziran; Gan, Muye] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Inst Appl Remote Sensing & Informat Technol, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

Footprint-scale assessments of these products are generally restricted to limited number of densely-instrumented validation sites. However, by taking active and passive soil moisture products together with a third independent soil moisture estimates via land surface modeling, triple collocation (TC) can be applied to estimate the correlation metric of satellite soil moisture products (versus an unknown ground truth) over a quasi-global domain. Here, an assessment of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) surface soil moisture retrievals via TC is presented. Considering the potential violation of TC error assumptions, the impact of active-passive and satellite-model error cross correlations on the TC-derived inter-comparison results is examined at in situ sites using quadruple collocation analysis. In addition, confidence intervals for the TC-estimated correlation metric are constructed from moving-block bootstrap sampling designed to preserve the temporal persistence of the original (unevenly-sampled) soil moisture time series. This study is the first to apply TC to obtain a robust global-scale cross-assessment of SMAP, SMOS and ASCAT soil moisture retrieval accuracy in terms of anomaly temporal correlation. Our results confirm the overall advantage of SMAP (with a global average anomaly correlation of 0.76) over SMOS (0.66) and ASCAT (0.63) that has been established in several recent regional, ground-based studies.

Substantial land cover/use change in the last few decades, driven by a combination of post-liberalization socioeconomic changes and extreme climatic events, has degraded these water-limited grassland\'s structure and function. Hence, a precise estimation of canopy cover (CC, %) and aboveground biomass (AGB, g m(-2)) is needed. In this study, we analyzed > 1000 field observations with sampling during June, July and August (JJA) in 2006, 2007, 2010 and 2016 in IM and 2010-2012 and 2014-2016 in MG. The field sampling was stratified by the dominant vegetation types on the plateau, including the meadow steppe, the typical steppe, and the desert steppe. Here we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived surface reflectance and vegetation indices optimized for low cover conditions to develop and test predictive models of CC and AGB using observed samples as training and validation data through rule-based regression tree models. We then used the predictive models to estimate spatially-explicit CC and AGB for the plateau over the last decade (2000-2016). Our study demonstrated the effectiveness of our predictive models in up-scaling ground observations to the regional scale across steppe types. Our results showed that model R-2 and RMSE for CC and AGB were 0.74 (13.1%) and 0.62 (85.9 gm(-2)), respectively.

We also found that our scaled up estimates were significantly related to inter-annual climatic variability and anthropogenic drivers especially distance to urban/built-up areas and livestock density.

The accuracy of theta estimates, however, is affected by surface soil porosity (n). We hypothesize that n can be derived using a simple linear n-P relationship of a dry surface soil layer, and that accounting for n improves the accuracy of theta estimation using a P(theta) model. The P of a surface layer was measured by using the heat pulse method during a drying period, and the feasibility of estimating theta with a P(theta) model that included n was explored. The approach was also tested with published P values derived from meteorological data and MODIS data against in situ theta measurements at two field sites in Arizona, USA. The results on a partially vegetated shrubland indicated that by using the P-derived n, the P(theta) model provided more accurate theta estimates than by using the literature n values. Discrepancies between modeled theta and in situ theta measurements were observed at small theta values, which were caused in part by the fact that the modeled theta represented soil layers a few millimeters thick, while the in situ measurements represented theta at the 5 cm depth. The new n-P function has potential for estimating surface theta accurately using multi-scale P data on bare soils or on sparsely vegetated lands.', '[Lu, Yili; Ren, Tusheng] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.

Knowledge about the distribution of these fields is critical in food security programs. We developed a semi-automated image segmentation approach using wall-to-wall sub-meter imagery with high-performance computing to map crop area (CA) throughout Tigray, Ethiopia that encompasses over 41,000 km(2). Multiple processing streams were tested to minimize mapping error while applying five unique smoothing kernels to capture differences in land surface texture associated to CA. Typically, very-small fields (mean < 2 ha) have a smooth image roughness compared to natural scrub/shrub woody vegetation at the similar to 1 m scale and these features can be segmented in panchromatic imagery with multi-level histogram thresholding. Multi-temporal very-high resolution (VHR) panchromatic imagery with multi-spectral VHR are sufficient in extracting critical CA information needed in food security programs. A 2011 to 2015 CA map was produced, using over 3000 WorldView-1 panchromatic images wall-to-wall in 1/2 degrees mosaics for Tigray, Ethiopia. CA was evaluated with nearly 3000 WorldView-2 2 m multispectral 250 x 250 m image subsets by seven expert interpretations, and with in-situ global positioning system photography.

However, a limitation of conventional single-sensor satellite missions is their limited capacity to observe land surface dynamics at the very high spatial and temporal resolutions demanded by a wide range of applications. One solution to this spatio-temporal divide is an observation strategy based on the CubeSat standard, which facilitates constellations of small, inexpensive satellites. Repeatable near-daily image capture in RGB and near-infrared (NIR) bands at 3-4 m resolution has recently become available via a constellation of > 130 CubeSats operated commercially by Planet. While the observing capacity afforded by this system is unprecedented, the relatively low radiometric quality and cross-sensor inconsistencies represent key challenges in the realization of their full potential as a game changer in Earth observation. To address this issue, we developed a Cubesat Enabled Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Method (CESTEM) that uses a multi-scale machine-learning technique to correct for radiometric inconsistencies between CubeSat acquisitions. The CESTEM produces Landsat 8 consistent atmospherically corrected surface reflectances in blue, green, red, and NIR bands, but at the spatial scale and temporal frequency of the CubeSat observations. An application of CESTEM over an agricultural dryland system in Saudi Arabia demonstrated CubeSat-based reproduction of Landsat 8 consistent VNIR data with an overall relative mean absolute deviation of 1.6% or better, even when the Landsat 8 and CubeSat acquisitions were temporally displaced by > 32 days. The consistently high retrieval accuracies were achieved using a multi-scale target sampling scheme that draws Landsat 8 reference data from a series of scenes by using MODIS-consistent surface reflectance time series to quantify relative changes in Landsat-scale reflectances over given Landsat-CubeSat acquisition timespans. With the observing potential of Planet\'s CubeSats approaching daily nadir-pointing land surface imaging of the entire Earth, CESTEM offers the capacity to produce daily Landsat 8 consistent VNIR imagery with a factor of 10 increase in spatial resolution and with the radiometric quality of actual Landsat 8 observations. Realization of this unprecedented Earth observing capacity has far reaching implications for the monitoring and characterization of terrestrial systems at the precision scale.', '[Houborg, Rasmus] South Dakota State Univ, Geospatial Sci Ctr Excellence, 1021 Medary Ave,Wecota Hall 506B, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.

They can help to quantify wood volume and biomass, to estimate leaf area distributions on a detailed scale, and can be exploited for physically based modelling approaches. If architectural tree models can be derived for multiple acquisition dates, they permit the detailed investigation of phenological effects. Although promising approaches for the generation of architectural tree/forest models from terrestrial LiDAR data are available, they are often non-trivial and their application to forest plots is often difficult. This is restricting the flexibility of these reconstruction approaches especially for multi-temporal analyses. In this paper, forest models of two Larix decidua forest plots are reconstructed by making use of terrestrial LiDAR data and digital hemispherical photographs (DHP). Recent modelling strategies are enhanced and developed further in order to improve the robustness and usability of the architectural tree model reconstruction process.   Raw point cloud data are directly used as input to solve both tree delineation and tree reconstruction in a single processing pipeline. This includes terrain filtering, intensity filtering, and trunk extraction. These steps are followed by a hierarchical and iterative multi-tree branch and twig reconstruction. Based on multi-temporal DHPs, various foliage states are documented. These DHPs and the reconstructed branching architectures are used to flexibly generate and update multi-temporal 3D models of foliage. In order to quantify the modelling performance with respect to various forest characteristics, a test setup based on simulated forest and acquisition geometries is build up. It can be shown, that typical sources of error in the tree reconstruction process are minimized by the proposed approach. It is possible to estimate wood volume distributions, trunk tapering and leaf area distributions with an error of only 10-14%. Except for strongly overlapping tree crowns, the overall accuracy of the single tree delineation in interlinked tree crowns is higher than 80%. Considering these error margins, we apply the modelling strategy to two forest plots and derive architectural models for three dates during the growing season. Using DHPs as reference data, it can be shown, that the estimated gap fraction values derived from the generated models show an error of only 10-15%.', '[Bremer, M.; Rutzinger, M.] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Geog, Innrain 52, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.

Objects are typically constructed by partitioning imagery into spatially contiguous groups of pixels through image segmentation and used as the basic spatial unit of analysis. As it is typically desirable to know the accuracy with which the objects have been delimited prior to undertaking the classification, numerous methods have been used for accuracy assessment. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of image segmentation accuracy assessment in land cover mapping applications. First the literature published in three major remote sensing journals during 2014-2015 is reviewed to provide an overview of the field. This revealed that qualitative assessment based on visual interpretation was a widely-used method, but a range of quantitative approaches is available. In particular, the empirical discrepancy or supervised methods that use reference data for assessment are thoroughly reviewed as they were the most frequently used approach in the literature surveyed. Supervised methods are grouped into two main categories, geometric and non-geometric, and are translated here to a common notation which enables them to be coherently and unambiguously described.

Here, optical properties of dry and wet marine-harvested plastic debris were quantified to explore the feasibility of plastic debris optical remote sensing in the natural environment. We measured the spectral reflectance of microplastics (< 5 mm) from the North Atlantic Ocean, macroplastics (> 5 mm) washed ashore along the USA west coast and virgin plastic pellets over a wavelength range from 350 to 2500 nm. Compared to the spectral variability of multi-colored dry macroplastics, the measured dry marine-harvested microplastic reflectance spectra could be represented as a single bulk average spectrum with notable absorption features at similar to 931, 1215, 1417 and 1732 nm. The wet marine-harvested microplastics had similar spectral features to the dry microplastics but the magnitude was lower over the measured spectrum. When spectrally matched to the reference library of typical dry virgin pellets, the mean dry marine-harvested microplastics reflectance had moderate similarities to low-density polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene and polymethyl methacrylate. This composition was consistent with the subset sampled with the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and what has been reported globally. The absorption features at 1215 and 1732 nm were observable through an intervening atmosphere and used to map the distributions of synthetic hydrocarbons at a landfill and on man-made structures from airborne visible-infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery, indicating the potential to remotely sense dry washed ashore and land-origin plastics. These same absorption features were identifiable on wet marine-harvested microplastics, but the ability to conduct remote sensing of microplastics at the ocean surface layer will require more detailed radiative transfer analysis and development of high signal-to-noise sensors.

The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission provides hemispheric estimates of landscape FT state at a spatial resolution of approximately 362 km(2). Previous validation studies of SMAP and other satellite FT products have compared satellite retrievals with point estimates obtained from in situ measurements of air and/or soil temperature. Differences between the two are attributed to errors in the satellite retrieval. However, significant differences can occur between satellite and in-situ estimates solely due to differences in scale between the measurements; these differences can be viewed as \'representativeness errors\' in the in-situ product, caused by using a point estimate to represent a large-scale spatial average. Most previous validation studies of landscape FT state have neglected representativeness errors entirely, resulting in conservative estimates of satellite retrieval skill. In this study, we use a variant of triple collocation called \'categorical triple collocation\' - a technique that uses model, satellite and in-situ estimates to obtain relative performance rankings of all three products, without neglecting representativeness errors - to validate the SMAP landscape FT product. Performance rankings are obtained for nine sites at northern latitudes. We also investigate differences between using air or soil temperatures to estimate FT state, and between using morning (6 AM) or evening (6 PM) estimates. Overall, at most sites, the SMAP product or in-situ FT measurement is ranked first, and the model FT product is ranked last (although rankings vary across sites). These results suggest SMAP is adding value to model simulations, providing higher-accuracy estimates of landscape FT states compared to models and, in some cases, even in-situ estimates, when representativeness errors are properly accounted for in the validation analysis.', '[Lyu, Haobo; Li, Xinlu; Lu, Hui] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.

Despite a hardware mishap that rendered the radar inoperable shortly after launch, the radiometer continues to operate nominally, returning more than two years of science data that have helped to improve existing hydrological applications and foster new ones.   Beginning in late 2016 the SMAP project launched a suite of new data products with the objective of recovering some high-resolution observation capability loss resulting from the radar malfunction. Among these new data products are the SMAP Enhanced Passive Soil Moisture Product that was released in December 2016, followed by the SMAP/Sentinel-1 Active-Passive Soil Moisture Product in April 2017.   This article covers the development and assessment of the SMAP Level 2 Enhanced Passive Soil Moisture Product (L2_SM_P_E). The product distinguishes itself from the current SMAP Level 2 Passive Soil Moisture Product (L2_SM_P) in that the soil moisture retrieval is posted on a 9 km grid instead of a 36 km grid. This is made possible by first applying the Backus-Gilbert optimal interpolation technique to the antenna temperature (T-A) data in the original SMAP Level 1B Brightness Temperature Product to take advantage of the overlapped radiometer footprints on orbit. The resulting interpolated TA data then go through various correction/calibration procedures to become the SMAP Level 1C Enhanced Brightness Temperature Product (L1C_TB_E). The L1C_TB_E product, posted on a 9 km grid, is then used as the primary input to the current operational SMAP baseline soil moisture retrieval algorithm to produce L2_SM_P_E as the final output. Images of the new product reveal enhanced visual features that are not apparent in the standard product. Based on in situ data from core validation sites and sparse networks representing different seasons and biomes all over the world, comparisons between L2_SM_P_E and in situ data were performed for the duration of April 1, 2015-October 30, 2016. It was found that the performance of the enhanced 9 km L2_SM_P_E is equivalent to that of the standard 36 km L2_SM_P, attaining a retrieval uncertainty below 0.040 m(3)/m(3) unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) and a correlation coefficient above 0.800. This assessment also affirmed that the Single Channel Algorithm using the V-polarized T-B channel (SCA-V) delivered the best retrieval performance among the various algorithms implemented for L2_SM_P_E, a result similar to a previous assessment for L2_SM_P.', '[Chan, S.

Visible, near-infrared and short wave infrared (VNIR/ SWIR, 400-2500 nm) hyperspectral imaging is one of the most promising tools for topsoil property mapping. The aim of this study was to test the sensitivity of soil property prediction results to coarsening image spectral resolution. This may offer an analysis of the potential of forthcoming hyperspectral satellite sensors, e.g., HYPerspectral X IMagery (HYPXIM) or Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP), and existing multispectral sensors, e.g., SENTINEL-2 Multispectral Sensor Instrument (MSI) or LANDSAT-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), for soil properties mapping. This study used VNIR/SWIR hyperspectral airborne data acquired by the AISA-DUAL sensor (initial spectral and spatial resolutions of approximately 5 nm and 5 m, respectively) over a 300 km(2) Mediterranean rural region. Ten spectral configurations were built and divided in the following two groups: i) six spectral configurations corresponding to simulated sensors with regular spectral resolution from 5 nm to 200 nm (i.e., the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) remains constant throughout the considered spectral domain; this includes the simulation of the forthcoming HYPXIM and EnMAP hyperspectral satellites) and ii) four spectral configurations corresponding to existing multispectral sensors with irregular spectral resolution (i.e., the FWHM differs from spectral sampling interval; Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), SENTINEL-2 MSI, LANDSAT-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM +) and LANDSAT-8 OLI). The soil property studied in this paper is the clay content, defined as the percentage of granulometric fraction finer than 2 mu m by weight of the soil, which will be estimated using the partial least squares regression method. Our results showed that i) spectral configurations with regular spectral resolutions from 5 to 100 nm provided similar and good clay content prediction performances (R-val(2) > 0.7 and RPIQ > 3) and allowed clay mapping with correct short-scale variations, ii) the spectral configuration with a regular spectral resolution of 200 nm provided unsatisfactory clay content prediction performance (R-val(2) similar or equal to 0.01 and RPIQ similar or equal to 1.65) and iii) the ASTER sensor was the only existing multispectral sensor that provided both correct performance of clay content estimation (R-val(2) similar or equal to 0.8 and RPIQ similar or equal to 3.72) and correct clay mapping. Therefore, clay mapping by the ASTER multispectral data should be pursued while awaiting the launch of forthcoming hyperspectral satellite sensors (e.g., HYPXIM and EnMAP), which will be good candidates for future large clay mapping campaigns over bare soils.', '[Gomez, C.; Adeline, K.; Driessen, B.] INRA IRD SupAgro, UMR LISAH, IRD, F-34060 Montpellier, France.

In the present study, we first inter-compared global-scale error patterns and combined the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) SSM products using a triple collocation (TC) analysis and the maximized Pearson correlation coefficient (R) method from April 2015 to December 2016. The Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) and global in situ observations were utilized to investigate and to compare the quality of satellite-based SSM products.   The average R-values of SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2 were 0.74, 0.64, and 0.65 when they compared with in situ networks, respectively. The ubRMSD values were (0.0411, 0.0625, and 0.0708) m(3) m(-3); and the bias values were (-0.0460, 0.0010, and 0.0418) m(3) m(-3) for SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2, respectively. The highest average R-values from SMAP against the in situ results are very encouraging; only SMAP showed higher R-values than GLDAS in several in situ networks with low ubRMSD (0.0438 m(3) m(-3)). Overall, SMAP showed a dry bias (-0.0460 m(3) m(-3)) and AMSR2 had a wet bias (0.0418 m(3) m(-3)); while ASCAT showed the least bias (0.0010 m(3) m(-3)) among all the products.   Each product was evaluated using TC metrics with respect to the different ranges of vegetation optical depth (VOD). Under vegetation scarce conditions (VOD < 0.10), such as desert and semi-desert regions, all products have difficulty obtaining SSM information. In regions with moderately vegetated areas (0.10 < VOD < 0.40), SMAP showed the highest Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Over highly vegetated regions (VOD > 0.40) ASCAT showed comparatively better performance than did the other products.   Using the maximized R method, SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2 products were combined one by one using the GLDAS dataset for reference SSM values. When the satellite products were combined, R-values of the combined products were improved or degraded depending on the VOD ranges produced, when compared with the results from the original products alone.   The results of this study provide an overview of SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2 reliability and the performance of their combined products on a global scale.

The NN was trained on GEOS-5 soil moisture target data, making the NN estimates consistent with the GEOS-5 climatology, such that they may ultimately be assimilated into this model without further bias correction. Evaluated against in situ soil moisture measurements, the average unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE), correlation and anomaly correlation of the NN retrievals were 0.037 m(3)m(-3), 0.70 and 0.66, respectively, against SMAP core validation site measurements and 0.026 m(3)m(-3), 0.58 and 0.48, respectively, against International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) measurements. At the core validation sites, the NN retrievals have a significantly higher skill than the GEOS-5 model estimates and a slightly lower correlation skill than the SMAP Level-2 Passive (L2P) product. The feasibility of the NN method was reflected by a lower ubRMSE compared to the L2P retrievals as well as a higher skill when ancillary parameters in physically-based retrievals were uncertain. Against ISMN measurements, the skill of the two retrieval products was more comparable. A triple collocation analysis against Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) soil moisture retrievals showed that the NN and L2P retrieval errors have a similar spatial distribution, but the NN retrieval errors are generally lower in densely vegetated regions and transition zones.', '[Kolassa, J.] Univ Space Res Assoc, NPP, Columbia, MD 21046 USA.

Patches are the basic management and planning units in urban landscapes, and urban designers and planners and natural resource managers frequently seek tools to understand changes at the patch level. High spatial resolution imagery has been increasingly used to measure fine-scale changes of percent cover of urban greenspace. However, few studies have investigated the dynamics of urban greenspace at the patch level, to quantify the process of growth, shrinking, or disappearance of patches. Here, we developed a new approach to quantify and characterize urban greenspace change at the patch level, by implementing object-based image analysis. We used2.5 m resolution ALOS and SPOT image data captured in 2005 and 2009, and tested the new approach in Beijing, China. With this approach, we identify different types of change in patches of urban greenspace, such as expansion and shrinking, newly created, and totally lost, in addition to gain and loss information. The results show: 1) 9.25% of the total area (6179 ha) was generated from expansion of extant patches, while 5.36% (3582 ha) was lost due to shrinking of patches; 2) 0.91% (607 ha) of urban greenspace was totally removed, and 1.23% (821 ha) was newly created; and 3) Urban greenspace with different ranges of patch size, from 0.01 to 1000 ha, all experienced large changes, with a tendency for small-sized patches (< 1 ha) to be totally removed. This new approach provides an effective tool for better understanding changes of urban greenspace, and results from this study provide important insights for planners and managers to devise target-specific measures and plans to more effectively protect urban green space.', '[Wang, Jing; Zhou, Weiqi; Qian, Yuguo; Li, Weifeng; Han, Lijian] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.

Despite its requirement for thermodynamic sea ice modeling, measurement of melt pond areal coverage using satellite remote sensing has proven difficult due to significant spatiotemporal variability in the timing and evolution of melt ponds. Less than optimal results from prior studies employing a spectral mixture analysis (SMA) towards the determination of melt pond areal coverage from satellite remote sensing data provided the incentive for a multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) approach. The MESMA was performed on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery using endmember spectra obtained from atmospherically corrected coincident high resolution imagery, surface observations and modeling. Results were validated against a high resolution Quickbird image acquired coincident to the MODIS image. The validation indicates that the best MESMA results provide consistent estimates of melt pond coverage for regions with high pond coverage (within 5% melt pond coverage) but overestimate pond fraction for regions with low pond coverage (by 10% or more). This may be due to deficiencies in the representation of sea ice surfaces within the endmember library used, oversimplified modeling of the ice surface and shortcomings in the validation process. However, it is assumed that with further refinement, the MESMA technique could allow for reliable estimates of the areal coverage of sea ice melt ponds using low resolution (large spatial coverage) optical satellite imagery under a wide variety of spatiotemporal pond evolution and fraction conditions.', '[Yackel, John J.; Nandan, Vishnu; Mahmud, Mallik; Kang, Jason W.; Geldsetzer, Torsten] Univ Calgary, Dept Geog, Cryosphere Climate Res Grp, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.

Subsequently, the applications of these products are limited in cases requiring higher temporal frequency. With the increasing number of freely available moderate resolution remote sensing datasets, multi-sensor synergy to increase temporal sampling is warranted. However, radiometric consistency of multi-sensor data is not as good as expected; therefore, first the constituency should be evaluated. A new cross-calibration approach of reflective bands for moderate resolution remotely sensed data is proposed in this paper. The new approach uses a time series of MODIS data from both Terra and Aqua to retrieve both the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) simultaneously over an invariant desert target. The MODIS retrieved BRDF and AOD are then used to cross calibrate the medium resolution spectral imager (MERSI) and visible and infra-red radiometer (VIRR) onboard FengYun3-A and B satellites (FY3A/B) and advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) onboard NOAA-16, 17, and 18. The cross-calibration method is validated in two ways: 1) by comparing with the vicarious calibration; and 2) the top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance before and after calibration, which show that the calibration error of this new approach is consistent within 5%. Compared with most cross -calibration methods, our new method is generic and better consider on BRDF models; furthermore, the well-built BRDF of the calibration site and simultaneously retrieved AOD make the method fully automatic and cost effective for the calibration of most moderate resolution remote sensors, especially Chinese sensors.', '[Zhong, B.; Yang, A.; Wu, S.; Li, J.; Liu, Q.] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

These data records were processed from a stratospheric aerosol dataset derived from the GOMOS experiment, using an inversion algorithm optimized for aerosol retrieval, called AerGOM. They provide a suite of aerosol parameters, such as the aerosol extinction coefficient at different wavelengths in the UV-visible range.The extinction record includes the total extinction as well as separate fields for liquid sulfate aerosols and polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs). Several additional fields (PSC flag, etc.) are also provided. The resulting stratospheric aerosol dataset, which spans the whole duration of the GOMOS mission (2002-2012), was validated using different reference datasets (lidar and balloon profiles). In the present paper, the emphasis is put on the extinction records. After a thorough analysis of the original AerGOM dataset, we describe the methodology used to construct the gridded CCI-GOMOS dataset and the resulting improvements on both the AerGOM algorithm and the binning procedure, in terms of spatio-temporal resolution, coverage and data quality.   The extinction datasets were validated using lidar profiles from three ground-based stations (Mauna Loa, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Dumont d\'Urville). The median difference of the CCI-GOMOS (Level 3) extinction and ground-based lidar profiles is between similar to 15% and similar to 45% in the 16-21 km altitude range, depending on the considered site and aerosol type.   The CCI-GOMOS dataset was subsequently used, together with a MIPAS SO2 time series, to update a volcanic eruption inventory published previously, thus providing a more comprehensive list of eruptions for the ENVISAT period (2002-2012). The number of quantified eruptions increases from 102 to 230 in the updated inventory. This new inventory was used to simulate the evolution of the global radiative forcing by application of the EMAC chemistry-climate model. Results of this simulation improve the agreement between modelled global radiative forcing of stratospheric aerosols at about 100 hPa compared to values estimated from observations. Medium eruptions like the ones of Soufriere Hills/Rabaul (2006), Sarychev (2009) and Nabro (2011) cause a forcing change from about -0.1 W/m(2) to -0.2 W/m(2). (C) 2017 The Authors.

However, due to the sheer volume of remotely sensed data and the lack of effective data analytics tools, most data remain in the dark, with little to no quality assurance and limited access to high-level analytical tools. Anomaly detection, which aims to find scenarios that differ from the norm, is of particular importance when analyzing remotely sensed data. However, most previous work has focused on identifying individual anomalies, and required prior knowledge of the ground truth for supervised learning. In this work, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection framework that requires no prior knowledge and is capable of detecting anomalous events, which we define as groups of outlier objects differing contextually from their spatial and temporal neighbors. Such contextual anomalies can be useful in discovering both hidden quality issues in the data and real natural events of significance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework via Web-based tools developed for visualizing and analyzing such contextual anomalies, using two types of data. The techniques and tools developed in this project are generally usable for a diverse set of satellite products and will be made publicly available with the support of the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).

However, periodic tidal flooding reduces spectral reflectance, especially in the near and short-wave infrared wavelengths. Consequently, marsh vegetation time-series products that lack tidal filtering, such as those provided by MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), may not reflect true vegetation trends. We created a new Tidal Marsh Inundation Index (TMII) for processing daily 500-m MODIS surface reflectance data and calibrated it with a Spartina alterniflora salt marsh pixel on Sapelo Island, GA. Ground-truth data for TMII was extracted from a PhenoCam, which collected high frequency digital photography of the TMII calibration pixel. To identify the best wavelengths to include in the TMII, we compared goodness of fit metrics from generalized linear models (GLMs). Predictors for these GLMs included suites of normalized difference indices from the literature as well as other band combinations. We also explored including a phonology parameter that could scale TMII relative to vegetation development. Ultimately, TMII was based on the normalized difference of green and shortwave infrared reflectance in combination with a phenology parameter composed of the moving average of the normalized difference of near infrared and shortwave infrared reflectance. This final index allowed a single optimized decision boundary to identify flooding across the annual growth cycle. When compared to ground-truth data from the PhenoCam, the TMII classified flooded conditions with 67-82% and dry conditions with 75-81% accuracy, respectively, across training, testing and validation datasets. We applied TMII to new S. alterniflora marsh MODIS pixels on Sapelo Island, GA as well as on Plum Island, MA. For these new pixels, TMII classified marsh flooding with 77-80% overall accuracy. We also demonstrated how users can apply TMII filtering in a MODIS workflow to create vegetation time-series composites within S. alterniflora, Spardrza patens and Juncus roemerianus marshes. We showed how a new user can validate and optimize TMII in their application, either by comparing it to inundation data or by validating the filtered vegetation time series against field data. We also compared TMII-filtered composites to the existing MODIS MOD13 16-d Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) product. TMII-filtered composites generated less noisy time -series that fit field data better than MOD13. TMII filtering was most important on Sapelo Island, where the tide range was high and vegetation was sparse. Results were less dramatic when TMII was applied to different marsh species within the Gulf Coast sites with lower tidal ranges, but TMII-filtering still improved vegetation time series. Thus, preprocessing MODIS imagery with the TMII effectively identified most inundated pixels. The TMII represents a step forward for wetland remote sensing that will be useful for improved estimation of phonology, biomass and carbon storage in coastal marshes.', '[O\'Connell, Jessica L.; Alber, Merryl] Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA.

It is challenging to map tropical forests and their spatio-temporal changes because forests are facing fragmentation from human activities (e.g., logging, deforestation), drought, and fire, as well as persistent clouds. Here we present a robust approach to map forests in South America during 2007-2010 and analyze the consistency and uncertainty among eight major forest maps in South America. Greenness-relevant MOD13Q1 NDVI and structure/biomassrelevant ALOS PALSAR time series data recorded 2007 through 2010 were coupled to identify and map forests at 50-m spatial resolution. Both area and spatial comparison were conducted to analyze the consistency and uncertainty of these eight forest maps. Annual 50-m PALSAR/MODIS forest maps were generated during 2007-2010 and the total forest area in South America was about 8.63 x 10(6) km(2) in 2010. Large differences in total forest area (8.2 x 10(6) km(2)-12.7 x 10(6) km(2)) existed among these forest products, especially in the forest edges, semi-humid tropical, and subtropical regions. Forest products generated under a similar forest definition had similar or even larger variation than those generated with contrasting forest definitions. We also find out that one needs to consider leaf area index as an adjusting factor and use much higher threshold values in the Vegetation Continuous Field (VCF) datasets to estimate forest cover areas. Analyses of PALSAR/MODIS forest maps in 2008/2009 showed a relatively small rate of loss (3.2 x 10(4) km(2) year(-1)) in net forest cover, similar to that of FAO FRA (3.3 x 10(4) km(2) year(-1)), but much higher annual rates of forest loss and gain. The rate of forest loss (0.195 x 10(6) km(2) year(-1)) was higher than that of Global Forest Watch (0.081 x 10(6) km(2) year(-1)). PALSAR/MODIS forest maps showed that more deforestation occurred in the unfragmented forest areas. Caution should be used when using the different forest maps to analyze forest loss and make policies regarding forest ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. The integration of PALSAR and MODIS images during 2007-2010 provides annual maps of forests in South America with improved accuracy and reduced uncertainty.', '[Qin, Yuanwei; Xiao, Xiangming; Dong, Jinwei; Zhou, Yuting; Wang, Jie; Doughty, Russell B.; Zou, Zhenhua] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Microbiol & Plant Biol, Ctr Spatial Anal, Norman, OK 73019 USA.

While some of the drivers of these changes are well known (high rates of relative sea level rise, reduced sediment inputs, canal dredging), debate exists about other drivers. One area that has received substantial attention is the role of, \"river diversions,\" areas where sediments and water are diverted from the Mississippi River into degrading wetlands with the hope of reinitiating deltaic land building processes. Some authors have argued that diversions lead to reduced shear strengths of wetland soils that make them more vulnerable to storm driven erosion, while other authors have argued that sediments from river diversions will develop stable land. This study examined this controversy in the Cubits Gap Subdelta, an analogue for a large (>1420 m(3) s(-1)) river diversion by testing the hypothesis that areas of land gain, and/or resilience to erosion occurred in areas that actively received river sediments and as a result had mineral rich soils with high shear strength. To accomplish this, a Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was developed for Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. The NDWI was calculated from (Blue - SWIR) / (Blue + SWIR), where SWIR is the shorter wavelength, and yielded land/water boundary maps with 30 m resolution. Results indicate that land gain occurred predominantly in the riverside section of this subdelta where sediments were imported from Mississippi River crevasses and/or dredging. Land loss typically occurred in the distal regions of the subdelta, which had lower levels of sediment supply and greater wave exposure. Sediment geotechnical analyses revealed land loss pixels generally correlated sediments with to high organic contents (9.0 +/- 1.9%), water contents (54.8 +/- 3.7%) and salinity (6.5 +/- 2.0 PSU), with low shear strengths (5.7 +/- 0.8 kN m(-2)) and low bulk density (0.6 +/- 0.8 g cm(-3)), whereas land gain pixels generally correlate with low organic content (3.9 +/- 0.6%), water content (38.1 +/- 4.2%) high shear strength (10.9 +/- 4.1 kN m(-2)) and bulk density (1.00 +/- 0.1 g cm(-3)). This study suggests plans to restore the region by partially diverting the flow of the Mississippi River will be most successful if they carry high loads of sediment, and that concerns about the integrity of fresh marsh may be unwarranted if those marshes are sediment rich.

The emerging high-resolution satellite aerosol product, Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC), provides a valuable opportunity to characterize local-scale PM2.5 at 1-km resolution. However, non-random missing AOD due to cloud/snow cover or high surface reflectance makes this task challenging. Previous studies filled the data gap by spatially interpolating neighboring PM2.5 measurements or predictions. This strategy ignored the effect of cloud cover on aerosol loadings and has been shown to exhibit poor performance when monitoring stations are sparse or when there is seasonal large-scale missingness. Using the Yangtze River Delta of China as an example, we present a Multiple Imputation (MI) method that combines the MAIAC high-resolution satellite retrievals with chemical transport model (CTM) simulations to fill missing AOD. A two-stage statistical model driven by gap-filled AOD, meteorology and land use information was then fitted to estimate daily ground PM2.5 concentrations in 2013 and 2014 at 1 km resolution with complete coverage in space and time. The daily MI models have an average R-2 of 0.77, with an inter-quartile range of 0.71 to 0.82 across days. The overall model 10-fold cross-validation R-2 (root mean square error) were 0.81 (25 mu g/m(3)) and 0.73 (18 mu g/m(3)) for year 2013 and 2014, respectively. Predictions with only observational AOD or only imputed AOD showed similar accuracy. Comparing with previous gap-filling methods, our MI method presented in this study performed better with higher coverage, higher accuracy, and the ability to fill missing PM2 (5) predictions without ground PM2.5 measurements. This method can provide reliable PM2 (5) predictions with complete coverage that can reduce bias in exposure assessment in air pollution and health studies.', '[Xiao, Qingyang; Meng, Xia; Geng, Guannan; Liu, Yang] Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.

This includes for the first-time joint exploitation of both 375 m I-Band and 750 m M-Band data to provide both AF detections and FRP (fire radiative power) retrievals over the full range of fire and FRP magnitudes. We demonstrate the value of our VIIRS-IM \'synergy\' product in an area of eastern China dominated by numerous small agricultural residue burns, which contribute significantly to regional air quality problems but which are often difficult to identify via standard (e.g. MODIS 500 m resolution) burned area mapping. We show that the highly \'fire sensitive\' VIIRS I-Band data enables detection of the \'small\' active fires (FRP <= 1 MW), but this sensitivity can lead to false alarms, often associated with manmade structures. We help avoid these via use of 30 m resolution global land cover data and an OpenStreetMap mask. Comparisons to near-simultaneous Aqua-MODIS AF detections, and the existing VIIRS I-Band AF global product, highlight our VIIRS algorithm\'s ability to more reliably detect the lowest FRP pixels, associated with the type of agricultural burning dominating eastern China. Our algorithm delivers typically 5 to 10x more AF pixels than does simultaneous-collected MODIS AF data (notwithstanding differences in spatial resolution), and importantly with a AF detection sensitivity that remains much more constant across the swath due to VIIRS\' unique pixel aggregation scheme. The VIIRS I4-Band saturates over higher FRP fires, but by combining use of 1- and M-Band data our algorithm generates reliable FRP records for all fires regardless of FRP magnitude. Using the VIIRS-IM methodology we find regionally summed FRP\'s up to 4x higher than are recorded by MODIS over the same fire season, highlighting the significance of the formally undetected low FRP active fires and indicating that current MODIS FRP-based emissions inventories for areas dominated by agricultural burning may be underestimating in a similar way to burned-area based approaches. FRP generation from VIIRS that takes into account both low- and high-FRP fires via use of both the I- and M-Band data should therefore enable significant improvements in global fire emissions estimation, particularly for regions where smaller types of fire are especially dominant.

Although MERIS was limited in spectral coverage, accurate Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) from MERIS data are retrieved by using appropriate additional information. We introduce a new AOT retrieval algorithm for MERIS over land surfaces, referred to as eXtensible Bremen AErosol Retrieval (XBAER). XBAER is similar to the \"dark-target\" (DT) retrieval algorithm used for Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in that it uses a lookup table (LUT) to match to satellite-observed reflectance and derive the AOT. Instead of a global parameterization of surface spectral reflectance, XBAER uses a set of spectral coefficients to prescribe surface properties. In this manner, XBAER is not limited to dark surfaces (vegetation) and retrieves AOT over bright surface (desert, semiarid, and urban areas). Preliminary validation of the MERIS-derived AOT and the ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements yield good agreement, the resulting regression equation is y = (0.92x +/- 0.07) + (0.05 +/- 0.01) and Pearson correlation coefficient of R = 0.78. Global monthly means of AOT have been compared from XBAER, MODIS and other satellite derived datasets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Some methods to estimate phytoplankton carbon at large scales from ocean colour data rely on the parameterisation of carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio, which is known to depend on factors such as the phytoplankton community structure, whereas other methods are based on the estimation of total particulate organic carbon (POC), and rely on the assumption that a known fraction of POC is made up of phytoplankton carbon. The carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio is also used in marine ecosystem models to convert between carbon and chlorophyll, a common requirement. In this paper we present a novel bio-optical algorithm to estimate the carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio, and the standing stocks of phytoplankton carbon partitioned into various size classes, from ocean colour. The approach combines empirical allometric relationships of phytoplankton size structure with an absorption-based algorithm for estimating phytoplankton size spectra developed earlier. Applying the new algorithm to satellite ocean colour data from September 1997 to December 2013, the spatio-temporal variations of carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio and phytoplankton carbon across various size classes are computed on a global scale. The average annual stock of phytoplankton carbon, integrated over the oceanic mixed-layer depth, is estimated to be similar to 0.26 gigatonnes, with the size-partitioned stocks of 0.14 gigatonnes for picoplankton, 0.08 gigatonnes for nanoplankton and 0.04 gigatonnes for microplankton. The root-mean-square error and the bias in the satellite-derived estimates of picoplankton carbon, when compared with corresponding in situ data, are found to be 36.23 mgC m(-3) and 13.53 mgC m(-3), respectively, on individual pixels. The regional uncertainties in the estimates of phytoplankton carbon are calculated to be less than the relative uncertainties in other satellite derived products, for most parts of the global ocean, and can amplify only for certain oceanographic regions. Although the new estimates of phytoplankton are of the same order of magnitude as those based on existing models, our study suggests that a consensus is yet to be built on the accurate sizes of the phytoplankton carbon pools; improved satellite chlorophyll products, and better estimates of inherent optical properties would be essential pre-requisites to minimising the uncertainties.

Particular emphasis is put on an extensive comparison of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) USCs as potential indicators of the surface urban heat island (UHI) effect and as potential predictors for thermal sharpening applications. Both widely-used as well as more recently proposed metrics of the urban remote sensing literature are investigated within a single experiment. While some of these USCs have already been used earlier, others have never been analyzed before in the context of urban temperature studies. In addition to the comparison of 2D and 3D USC5, the spatio-temporal dependencies of their relation to LST are examined. To this end, the experimental setup of this work includes two study areas, 26 USC5, and 16 LST scenes covering four seasons. Use is made of a comprehensive database compiled for the cities of Berlin and Cologne, Germany. After data preparation, very high resolution (VHR) multi-spectral and height data are employed to map fine-scale urban land cover (LC). The resulting LC maps are then used in conjunction with the height information to compute 2D and 3D USCs. Subsequently, multi-temporal LST images are retrieved from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) scenes. The spatio-temporal investigation of the USC-LST connection constitutes the final stage of the workflow and is achieved in the framework of a dedicated correlation analysis. The results of this study highlight that the linkage between USCs and LST sensed at small scan angles is not stronger when 3D parameters are considered. Even though they may offer more holistic representations of the urban landscape, 3D USCs are consistently outperformed by some of the most widely-used 2D metrics. The analysis of spatial dependencies reveals that the USC-LST interplay does not only differ between, but also within the two test sites. This is due to their distinct geographies, with urban form and compactness, green spaces and street trees, and the structural composition of LC elements being some of the determining factors. The examination of temporal dependencies yielded that the association between USCs and LST is fairly stable over time but can be subject to larger inter- and intra-season variations for different reasons, including the season of acquisition, vegetation phonology, and meteorological conditions. Since previous research was based on the analysis of a single study area, a limited number of (mainly 2D) USCs, and/or only a few LST scenes acquired in specific seasons, it is concluded that the findings of this study provide researchers and practitioners with a more complete picture of the USC-LST relationship.

Recent and on-going L-Band (approximate to 1.4 GHz) spaceborne missions have the potential to provide enhanced information on F/T state over large geographic regions with rapid revisit time. However, the low spatial resolution of these spaceborne observations (approximate to 145 km) makes it difficult to isolate the primary contributions to the Fir signal, including the soil, snow, and vegetation states. A ground-based L-Band radiometer measurement campaign was conducted in Saskatchewan, Canada during the winter of 2014-2015 to evaluate brightness temperature sensitivity to F/T processes, snow, liquid water in snow and assess theoretical retrievals of soil permittivity (epsilon(G)), and snow density from experimental data. The ground-based radiometer was run in multiple configurations. First, temporally continuous measurements were conducted through the winter over an agricultural field, with a comprehensive network of reference snow and soil observations characterizing the F/T state of the soils within or adjacent to the radiometer footprint. Secondly, weekly multi-angular L-Band measurements were made at an undisturbed site of naturally accumulating snow cover, over a site that was kept snow free, and a site with artificially compacted snow. Results from the assessment of the land surface F/T retrieval algorithm showed that L-Band measurements are sensitive to the near surface F/T state of the soil, with the highest level of agreement found between the near surface (2.5 cm) F/T reference measurements of soil temperature and epsilon(G) (accuracies of 91.1% and 92.9%, respectively). Several mid-winter melt events with air temperatures (T-air) above 0 degrees, and soil temperatures below 0 degrees C, illustrated that liquid water within the snow dramatically increase the T-B,T- resulting in false retrievals of soil thaw events using existing L-Band F/T retrieval algorithms. However, Tair was also shown to have a high commission errors compared to radiometer observations in detecting snow melt, because of the delay between T-air > 0 degrees C and the onset of melt resulting in a measurable wet snow signal at L-Band. The retrieval of snow density (rho(s)), of the bottom 10 cm of the snowpack tended to underestimate high rho(s) (>400 kg m(-3)), and agreed well for lower rho(s) (<400 kg m(-3)). The paper gives important information on different contributions to the L-Band F/T signal in a prairie environment, which will help improving satellite-based F/T retrieval algorithms.

Their area-wide mapping and monitoring in mountainous terrain, however, is still challenging. The growing archives of optical remote sensing images offer great potential for the operational detection and monitoring of surface motion in such areas. This study proposes a multiple pairwise image correlation (MPIC) technique to obtain a series of redundant horizontal displacement fields, and different multi-temporal indicators for a more accurate detection and quantification of surface displacement. The technique is developed and tested on a series of monoscopic and stereoscopic Pleiades satellite images at a test site in the South French Alps. Empirical tests confirm that MPIC significantly increased detection accuracy (F- measure = 0.85) and that the measurement error can be reduced by averaging velocities from all pair combinations covering a given time-step (i.e. when stereo-pairs are available for at least one date). The derived inventory and displacement fields of 169 slow-moving landslides show a positive relationship between the landslide size and velocities, as well as a seasonal acceleration of the largest landslides in response to an increase in effective precipitation. The processing technique can be adapted to better exploit increasingly available time-series from a variety of optical satellites for the detection and monitoring of landslide displacement.

The inclusion of fluorescence excitation was implemented with the \'weight reduction\' and \'photon spread\' concepts based on Monte Carlo ray-tracing technique. The radiative transfer of SIF in a 3-D canopy was simulated in a physically-based and rigorous way so that various contributions from the radiative process can be accurately quantified. The physical mechanism behind the spectral and angular distributions of canopy SIF was analyzed based on FluorWPS. SIF anisotropy is an intrinsic property of the vegetative surface and it can be significantly influenced by the canopy structure. The performance of the model was evaluated with field measurements and systematically compared with an established RT model of canopy SIF. Especially the detailed comparison with the RT model for four canopy scenes demonstrates that FluorWPS is capable of faithfully reproducing the spectral and angular distributions of SIF, with the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) being higher than 0.92 and lower than 0.066 W . m(-2). sr(-1) . mu m(-1), respectively, for the red peak, and higher than 0.92 and lower than 0.16 W . m(-2). sr(-1) . mu m(-1) for the far-red peak.

Experts predicted that the potential risk and instability of the landslide might remain for many decades, or even longer. Monitoring the activity of such a large landslide is hence critical. Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) mode from the Sentinel-1 satellite provides us with up-to-date high-quality Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images over a wide ground coverage (250 x 250 km), enabling full exploitation of various InSAR applications. However, the TOPS mode introduces azimuth -dependent Doppler variations to radar signals, which requires an additional processing step especially for SAR interferometry. Sentinel-1 TOPS data have been widely applied to earthquakes, but the performance of TOPS data-based time series analysis requires further exploitation. In this study, Sentinel-1 TOPS data were employed to investigate landslide post-seismic activities for the first time. To deal with the azimuth-dependent Doppler variations, a processing chain of TOPS time series interferometry approach was developed. Since the Daguangbao landslide is as a result of the collapse of a whole mountain caused by the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake, the existing Digital Elevation Models (DEMs, e.g. SRTM and ASTER) exhibit height differences of up to approximately 500 m. Tandem-X images acquired after the earthquake were used to generate a high resolution post-seismic DEM. The high gradient topographic errors of the SRTM DEM (i.e. the differences between the pre-seismic SRTM and the actual post-seismic elevation), together with low coherence in mountainous areas make it difficult to derive a precise DEM using the traditional InSAR processing procedure. A re-flattening iterative method was hence developed to generate a precise TanDEM-X DEM in this study. The volume of the coseismic Daguangbao landslide was estimated to be of 1.189 +/- 0.110 x 109 m(3) by comparing the postseismic Tandem-X DEM with the preseismic SRTM DEM, which is consistent with the engineering geological survey result. The time-series results from Sentinel-1 show that some sectors of the Daguangbao landslide are still active (and displaying four sliding zones) and exhibiting a maximum displacement rate of 8 cm/year, even eight years after the Wenchuan earthquake. The good performance of TOPS in this time series analysis indicates that up-to-date high-quality TOPS data with spatiotemporal baselines offer significant potential in terms of future InSAR applications.

To improve the robustness of the retrieved properties, REGFLEC was modified to 1) correct for aerosol and adjacency effects, 2) consider foliar dust effects on modeled canopy reflectances, 3) include spectral information in the red-edge wavelength region, and 4) exploit empirical LAI estimates in the model inversion. Using multi-spectral RapidEye imagery allowed Chl(1) to be retrieved with a Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of 7.9 mu g cm(-2) (16%), based upon in situ measurements conducted in fields of alfalfa, Rhodes grass and maize over the course of a growing season. LAI and Chl1 compensation effects on canopy reflectance were largely avoided by informing the inversion process with ancillary LAI inputs established empirically on the basis of a statistical machine learning technique. As a result, LAI was reproduced with good accuracy, with an overall MAD of 0.42 m(2) ITI-2 (12.5%). Results highlighted the considerable challenges associated with the translation of at-sensor radiance observations to surface bidirectional reflectances in dryland environments, where issues such as high aerosol loadings and large spatial gradients in surface reflectance from bright desert soils to dark vegetated fields are often present. Indeed, surface reflectances in the visible bands were reduced by up to 60% after correction for such adjacency effects. In addition, dust deposition on leaves required explicit modification of the reflectance sub-model to account for its influence. By implementing these model refinements, REGFLEC demonstrated its utility for within-field characterization of vegetation conditions over the challenging landscapes typical of dryland agricultural regions, offering a means through which improvements can be made in the management of these globally important systems.

Second, the relationships between coarsened 8 km MODIS and AVHRR Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were modeled pixel by pixel using spatial autocorrelation. Then the NDVI was back-predicted to 1982 from historical AVHRR observations and snow data. The back-predicted NDVI was validated against those data held-out from MODIS in 2001 and 2002 from four distinct biogeographic state regions (California, Kansas, Minnesota and Mississippi) in the continental United States. The results show consistency of the derived NDVI from two sensors, with a Root Mean Square Error within 0.05 over most land cover classes. This validation results suggest potential application of this approach for generating consistent long term multi-sensor NDVI data records for ecology and global climate change studies.

Due to climatic warming and increasing food demand, paddy rice has been expanding rapidly in high latitude areas in the last decade, particularly in northeastern (NE) Asia. Current knowledge about paddy rice fields in these cold regions is limited. The phenology- and pixel-based paddy rice mapping (PPPM) algorithm, which identifies the flooding signals in the rice transplanting phase, has been effectively applied in tropical areas, but has not been tested at large scale of cold regions yet. Despite the effects from more snow/ice, paddy rice mapping in high latitude areas is assumed to be more encouraging due to less clouds, lower cropping intensity, and more observations from Landsat sidelaps. Moreover, the enhanced temporal and geographic coverage from Landsat 8 provides an opportunity to acquire phenology information and map paddy rice. This study evaluated the potential of Landsat 8 images on annual paddy rice mapping in NE Asia which was dominated by single cropping system, including Japan, North Korea, South Korea, and NE China. The cloud computing approach was used to process all the available Landsat 8 imagery in 2014 (143 path/rows, similar to 3290 scenes) with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The results indicated that the Landsat 8, GEE, and improved PPPM algorithm can effectively support the yearly mapping of paddy rice in NE Asia. The resultant paddy rice map has a high accuracy with the producer (user) accuracy of 73% (92%), based on the validation using very high resolution images and intensive field photos. Geographic characteristics of paddy rice distribution were analyzed from aspects of country, elevation, latitude, and climate. The resultant 30-m paddy rice map is expected to provide unprecedented details about the area, spatial distribution, and landscape pattern of paddy rice fields in NE Asia, which will contribute to food security assessment, water resource management, estimation of greenhouse gas emissions, and disease control.

The first method employs a precomputed Look-Up-Table (LUT) generated from radiative transfer simulations. The LUT associates spectral irradiance reaching the surface to a given set of input parameters, namely solar zenith angle, cloud optical thickness, cloud fraction, ozone concentration, and surface albedo. The second method, as implemented by NASA\'s Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) in the standard Ocean Color data processing chain, expresses the energy budget of the atmosphere-surface-ocean system via a simple radiative transfer model. The performance of these methods is evaluated using an extensive in situ PAR dataset collected in the Arctic Ocean between 1998 and 2014, with daily values ranging from 0.08 to 61.07 Em(-2) d(-1). A methodology is developed to compare in situ measurements and satellite products of different spatial and temporal resolution. Agreement is generally good between satellite-derived estimates and ship-based data and between methods. Specifically, both methods yield a small positive bias of 6% and 2% and a relative uncertainty larger than that observed at low latitude, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 33% and 20% for the LUT and OPBG methods, respectively. This is attributed to the peculiar environmental conditions encountered in the Arctic, namely low solar elevation, changing surface albedo due to sea ice, and persistent cloudiness. The RMSE difference among methods is due to the high temporal resolution (3 h) of the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) LUT input not fully compensating for its low spatial resolution (280 km grid cells). The LUT method has the major advantage of providing PAR estimates in all conditions, including ice-covered regions, while the OBPG method is currently limited to open waters and a solar zenith angle lower than 83 degrees. Consequently, the OBPG method may not account for as much as 38% of PAR reaching the Arctic ocean surface annually. Both methods have the potential to provide useful PAR estimates just below the ice, by including information about ice transmittance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Snowmelt timing and magnitude in mountains are controlled predominantly by absorption of solar radiation and the distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE), and yet both of these are very poorly known even in the best-instrumented mountain regions of the globe. Here we describe and present results from the Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO), a coupled imaging spectrometer and scanning lidar, combined with distributed snow modeling, developed for the measurement of snow spectral albedo/broadband albedo and snow depth/SWE. Snow density is simulated over the domain to convert snow depth to SWE. The result presented in this paper is the first operational application of remotely sensed snow albedo and depth/SWE to quantify the volume of water stored in the seasonal snow cover. The weekly values of SWE volume provided by the ASO program represent a critical increase in the information available to hydrologic scientists and resource managers in mountain regions.

Here, we introduce a methodology to decompose lidar point cloud data into 3D clusters corresponding to individual tree crowns (ITC) that enables the estimation of many biophysical variables of tropical forests such as tree height, crown area, crown volume, and tree number density. The ITC-based approach was tested using airborne high-resolution lidar data collected over the 50-ha Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS) plot in the Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The lack of tree height and crown size measurements in the field prohibits the direct validation of the ITC metrics. We assess the reliability of our method by comparing the aboveground biomass (AGB) estimated using ground and lidar individual tree measurements at multiple spatial scales, namely 1 ha, 2.25 ha, 4 ha, and 6.25 ha. We examined four different lidar-derived AGB models, with three based on individual tree height, crown volume, and crown area, and one with mean top canopy height (TCH) calculated at the plot level using the lidar canopy height model. Results show that the predictive power of all models based on ITC size and TCH increases with decreasing spatial resolution from 16.9% at 1 ha for the worst model to 5.0% at 6.25 ha for the best model. The TCH-based model performed slightly better than ITC-based models except at higher spatial scales (similar to 4 ha) and when errors due to edge effects associated with tree crowns were reduced. Unlike the TCH models that change regionally depending on forest type and structure allometry, the ITC-based models are derived as a function of individual tree allometry and can be extended globally to all tropical forests. The method for lidar detection of individual crown size overcome some limitations of ground-based inventories such as 1) it is able to access crowns of large trees and 2) it enables the assessment of directional changes in tree density, canopy architecture and forest dynamics over large and inaccessible areas to support robust tropical ecological studies.

Land elevation below mean sea level and continuous subsidence over the past century has made this island a high priority area for investigations of subsidence and restoration in the Delta. This study reports the results of successful application of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data and technique to measure subsidence in the Delta, which is a coherence-challenged non-urban area. We carried out a time series interferometric analysis of Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) L-band (23.8 cm) data, collected from July 2009-August 2014, to assess both the spatial and temporal variation of subsidence on Sherman Island. We report both large-scale (island-wide) subsidence trends and small-scale (levee/ farm scale) subsidence features in Sherman Island. Assuming the subsidence is linear during the five years of UAVSAR data acquisition, subsidence rates across the island range from 0-5 cm/yr, with an average of 1.3 +/- 0.2 cm/yr. We estimate our systematic uncertainty to be 03 cm/yr. Overall, the central region in the island has subsided at a faster rate than the rest of the island. We find our results to be consistent with previous measurements of subsidence rates at electric transmission line towers scattered throughout the island. The results of this study provide insights into several factors influencing subsidence, including soil type, water table depth, land use, land elevation and the location and time of levee repairs. Subsidence monitoring on Sherman Island is essential for maintaining a reliable water supply for the state of California and for protecting the Delta ecosystem. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Because of the much greater penetration depth, modeling the microwave ice sheet emission requires taldng into account not only snow conditions on the surface, but should also include glaciological information. Even if the penetration depth of the L-band is not well known due to the uncertainty on the imaginary part of the ice permittivity, it is likely to be of the order of several hundreds of meters, which means that the temperature of the ice over a depth of nearly 1000 m influences the emission. Over such a depth, the temperature is related to both the surface conditions and to the ice sheet thickness, which in turn depends on the bedrock topography and on other glaciological variables. The present paper aims to provide a thorough theoretical explanation of the observed T-B spatial variation close to the Brewster angle at vertical polarization, in order to limit the effect of surface and vertical density variability in the firn. In order to provide reliable inputs to the microwave emission models used for simulating T-B data, an in-depth analysis of the temperature profiles was performed by means of glaciological models. The comparison between simulated and observed data over three transects totalling 2000 km in East Antarctica pointed out that, whereas the emission models are capable of explaining the T-B spatial variations of several kelvins (0.7 and 2.9 K), they are unable to predict its absolute value correctly. This study also shows that the main limiting factor in simulating low-frequency microwave data is the uncertainty in the currently available imaginary part of the ice permittivity.

The scientific objectives of the SMOS mission directly respond to the need for global observations of soil moisture and ocean salinity, two key variables used in predictive hydrological, oceanographic and atmospheric models. SMOS observations also provide information on vegetation, in particular plant available water and water content in a canopy, drought index and flood risks, surface ocean winds in storms, freeze/thaw state and sea ice and its effect on ocean-atmosphere heat fluxes and dynamics affecting large-scale processes of the Earth\'s climate system.   Significant progress has been made over the course of the now 6-year life time of the SMOS mission in improving the ESA provided level 1 brightness temperature and level 2 soil moisture and sea surface salinity data products. The main emphasis of this paper is to review the status of the mission and provide an overview and performance assessment of SMOS data products, in particular with a view towards operational applications, and using SMOS products in data assimilation.   SMOS is in excellent technical condition with no limiting factors for operations beyond 2017. The instrument performance fulfils the requirements. The radio-frequency interference (RFI) contamination originates from man-made emitters on ground, operating in the protected L-band and adding signal to the natural radiation emitted by the Earth. RFI has been detected worldwide and has been significantly reduced in Europe and the Americas but remains a constraint in Asia and the Middle East. The mission\'s scientific objectives have been reached over land and are approaching the mission objectives over ocean.   This review paper aims to provide an introduction and synthesis to the papers published in this RSE special issue on SMOS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

With the recently developed Global Urban Footprint (based on radar data from TanDEM-X) and the Global Human Settlement Layer (based on optical data), two new initiatives that promise to map complex settlement patterns at global scales and unprecedented spatial resolutions are about to enter the scientific and map user community. However, comparative studies on these layers\' strengths and weaknesses, especially in terms of their potential added value with regard to existing lower resolution maps, as well as their assessed accuracy are still absent. In this regard, we introduce a multi scale cross-comparison framework that uses the best existing urban maps as a benchmark. To paint a complete picture, we simultaneously address several components of map accuracy including relative inter-map agreement, absolute accuracies and pattern-based classification differences. This framework is applied to present regionally representative results from two Central European test sites. In this, we find that the new base maps bring decisive advancements in preserving the small-scale complexity of global human settlement patterns beyond urban core areas. Relative inter-map comparison exposes low density settlement regions traditionally under-represented by lower resolution maps that are now recognized. Absolute metrics such as the Kappa coefficient of agreement (K) show that accuracies of the new high resolution layers ((K) over bar = 0.56-0.58) nearly double those of existing products. Beyond, they feature substantial consistency between urban ((K) over bar = 0.46-0.50) and rural landscapes ((K) over bar = 0.41-0.45). Results from pattern-based exploration further reveal significant correlation of accuracies with physical pattern variations such as settlement density and mark a clear shift of accuracies from large to medium and small patch sizes. This differentiated view on classification accuracies shows that the new generation of urban maps constitutes a significantly enhanced spatial representation of large-scale settlement patterns.

However, the effects of urbanization on vegetation phenology are poorly understood in urban environments. Using MODIS data between 2007 and 2013, we investigated the trends of the phenological metrics (i.e., start, end, and length of growing season: SOS, EOS and GSL) of individual cities and across cities relative to rural areas for China\'s 32 major cities. We found that the effects of urbanization on phenology decayed exponentially toward rural areas, and were closely related to the land surface temperature (LST) for more than half of the cities. The phenological sensitivity to temperature were 9-11 days SOS advance and 6-10 days EOS delay per 1 degrees C increase of LST. On average across all cities, the growing season started 11.9 days earlier and ended 5.4 days later in urban zones compared to rural counterparts. The urbanization effects increased with increasing latitudes, following the pattern of urban heat island effects in general. Our study suggests the value of urban environments in studying the phenological responses to future global change. However, the urbanization impacts are complex and need more direct observations, experimental manipulations, and cross boundary inter-comparison studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The FT observations define near-surface thermal status used to determine permafrost extent and stability over a 30-year (1980-2009) satellite record. The PE results showed similar performance against independent inventory and process model (CHANGE) estimates, but with larger differences over heterogeneous permafrost subzones. A consistent decline in the ensemble mean of permafrost areas (-0.33 million km(2) decade(-1); p < 0.05) coincides with regional warming (0.4 degrees C decade(-1); p < 0.01), while more than 40% (9.6 million km(2)) of permafrost areas are vulnerable to degradation based on the 30-year PE record. ALT estimates determined from satellite (MODIS) and ERA-Interim temperatures, and CHANGE simulations, compared favorably with independent field observations and indicate deepening ALT trends consistent with widespread permafrost degradation under recent climate change.

Monitoring surface albedo is a key application of remote sensing and achieving consistency between instruments is crucial to accurate assessment of changing albedo. Here we take advantage of a high resolution (5 m) airborne multispectral dataset that was collected over Langjokull, Iceland in 2007, and compare it with near contemporaneous ETM+ and MODIS imagery. All three radiance datasets are converted to reflectance by applying commonly used atmospheric correction schemes: 6S and FLAASH. These are used to derive broadband albedos. We first assess the similarity of albedo values produced by different atmospheric correction schemes for the same instrument, then contrast results from different instruments. In this way we are able to evaluate the consistency of the available atmospheric correction algorithms and to consider the impacts of different spatial resolutions. We observe that FLAASH leads to the derivation of surface albedos greater than when 6S is used. Albedo is shown to be highly variable at small spatial scales. This leads to consistent differences associated with specific facies types between different resolution instruments, in part attributable to different surface bi-directional reflectance distribution functions. Uncertainties, however, still exist in this analysis as no correction for variable bi-directional reflectance distribution functions could be implemented for the ETM+ and airborne datasets.

Specific changes observed were those associated with agricultural intensification and fires. The study concluded that prior knowledge (spectral class signatures, awareness of local agricultural practices and pressures) was needed for the selection of the most appropriate image (in terms of seasonality) to be acquired at T-2.

Knowledge of the desert biomass distribution and its dynamic related to the climate controls are vital for the development of adaptation strategies to meet the challenge of climate changes in the 21st century. However, due to the lack of field observations and the difficulties in retrieving vegetation fractional coverage (VFC) of sparsely vegetated lands across large areas from satellite imagery, the amount of desert biomass and its spatiotemporal patterns in Central Asia are still unclear. Based on 168 field observations and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, we developed the VFC and biomass maps of the temperate deserts in Central Asia for the early 2000s (2000-2004) and early 2010s (2010-2014) and investigated the relationship between climate drivers and biomass distribution in the first decade of the 21st century. Our results showed the mean VFC (+/- SE) and biomass density (+/- SE) of the temperate desert, which covers an area of 3.6 x 10(6) km(2) in Central Asia, were 19 +/- 14% and 280 +/- 190 g m(-2) respectively. The total desert biomass amounted to 1.00 Gt, about 36% of which was contributed by the temperate semi-shrub and dwarf semi-shrub. Precipitation, aridity, and growing season temperature were the major control factors on the biomass. Following the precipitation gradient, the western Central Asia had higher biomass density than the east, and relatively high biomass density was found on the windward slopes of the mountains. Large areas in the western Central Asia desert lost biomass due to the prolonged drought since the late 1990s. The differences in climate sensitivities among that desert vegetation types were noteworthy, indicating the future climate change may trigger vegetation succession. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, the availability of long-term lake freeze-thaw-cycles, required to understand this proxy for climate variability and change, is scarce for European lakes. Long time series from space observations are limited to few satellite sensors. Data of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) are used in account of their unique potential as they offer each day global coverage from the early 1980s expectedly until 2022. An automatic two-step extraction was developed, which makes use of near-infrared reflectance values and thermal infrared derived lake surface water temperatures to extract lake ice phenology dates. In contrast to other studies utilizing thermal infrared, the thresholds are derived from the data itself, making it unnecessary to define arbitrary or lake specific thresholds. Two lakes in the Baltic region and a steppe lake on the Austrian-Hungarian border were selected. The later one was used to test the applicability of the approach to another climatic region for the time period 1990 to 2012. A comparison of the extracted event dates with in situ data provided good agreements of about 10 d mean absolute error. The two-step extraction was found to be applicable for European lakes in different climate regions and could fill existing data gaps in future applications. The extension of the time series to the full AVHRR record length (early 1980 until today) with adequate length for trend estimations would be of interest to assess climate variability and change. Furthermore, the two-step extraction itself is not sensor-specific and could be applied to other sensors with equivalent near-and thermal infrared spectral bands. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We conducted experimental research using four LiDAR datasets and individual Scots pine, Norway spruce, and silver/downy birch trees. The classification performance and the importance of features were evaluated for dominant/co-dominant trees (N = 9930), and compared to a subset of trees (N = 3630) that had well separable crowns. We used data obtained from two discrete-return (DR) Leica ALS60 sensors, in which the first echo triggers the recording of a WF sequence. Using experience with simulated WF data, we defined a set of informative and technically simple WF features. Quadratic discriminant analysis was applied to classify tree species and also to discover the most important WF features. The WF features outperformed the DR intensity data (0.57-0.75 vs. 0.74-0.86 in Cohen\'s kappa). The total backscattered energy (E) of single returning WF sequences was the most important feature. Early summer data outperformed late summer data, and we observed differences in the noise characteristics of individual sensors. We performed analyses of the best-performing mean WF features, using linear mixed-effects modeling. The non-quantified variation in tree structure explained 13-65% of within-species feature variance, while dataset-species interaction (i.e. the dependence of species effect on LiDAR dataset), tree height, age, site type, and scan zenith angle accounted for only 2-25%. The residual variance of each feature was 13-84% and depended on the number of pulses. This dependence was weakest for E, implying good performance at low pulse densities. Further analysis showed how intra-species variations in crown and branch morphology and vigor were logically linked with WF features. We conclude that improvements in species classification may be obtained by a stratification according to tree height and by acquiring data during early summer. The inherent between-tree and within-species variation in geometric-optical properties sets an upper limit for classification performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Multiple regression models using the integral of FAPAR from the onset of the dry season to the onset of the rainy season, the start date of the growing season and the rate of decrease of the FAPAR curve achieve a cross validated r(2)/RMSE (in % woody cover) of 0.73/3.0 (MODIS) and 0.70/32 (VGT). The extrapolation to Sahel scale shows agreement between VGT and MODIS at an almost nine times higher woody cover than in the global tree cover product MOD44B which only captures trees of a certain minimum size. The derived woody cover map of the Sahel is made publicly available and represents an improvement of existing products and a contribution for future studies of diylands quantifying carbon stocks, climate change assessment, as well as parametrization of vegetation dynamic models.

However, no single sensor meets this requirement. This study presents a new spatiotemporal data fusion method, the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) method, to generate synthesized frequent high spatial resolution images through blending two types of data, i.e., frequent coarse spatial resolution data, such as that from MODIS, and less frequent high spatial resolution data such as that from Landsat. The proposed method is based on spectral unmixing analysis and a thin plate spline interpolator. Compared with existing spatiotemporal data fusion methods, it has the following strengths: (1) it needs minimum input data; (2) it is suitable for heteregeneous landscapes; and (3) it can predict both gradual change and land cover type change. Simulated data and real satellite images were used to test the performance of the proposed method. Its performance was compared with two very popular methods, the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) and an unmixing-based data fusion (UBDF) method. Results show that the new method creates more accurate fused images and keeps more spatial detail than STARFM and UBDF. More importantly, it closely captures reflectance changes caused by land cover conversions, which is a big issue with current spatiotemporal data fusion methods. Because the proposed method uses simple principles and needs only one fine-resolution image as input, it has the potential to increase the availability of high-resolution time-series data that can support studies of rapid land surface dynamics.

However, many elements contribute to the uncertainty of such estimate. In this study, the uncertainties of eight days gross primary production (GPP) predicted by Random Forest (RF) machine learning models were analysed at the site, ecosystem and European spatial scales. At the site level, the uncertainties caused by the missing of key drivers were evaluated. The most accurate predictions of eight days GPP were obtained when all available drivers were used (Pearson\'s correlation coefficient, rho similar to 0.84; Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) similar to 1.8 g C m(-2) d(-1)). However, when predictions were based on only remotely sensed data the accuracy was close to the optimum (rho similar to 0.8; RMSE similar to 1.9 g C m(-2) d(-1)) and to a commonly used light use efficiency model (MOD17) with parameters optimised for the applied study sites (the MOD17 +, rho similar to 0.79; RMSE similar to 2.04 g C m(-2) d(-1)). Remotely sensed data were key drivers for the accurate prediction of GPP in ecosystems with high variability of green biomass over the phenological cycle (e.g., deciduous broad-leaved forests) or highly affected by the human management (e.g. croplands). In contrast, in the ecosystems with low variability of greenness (e.g., evergreen broad-leaved forests), the predictions were poor when meteorological information were not used. At a European spatial scale, when modelled grids of meteorological, land cover and fPAR data were used as inputs, the propagation of their uncertainty, not accounted in the models training, had significant effects on the uncertainty of the mean annual GPP. At this scale, the effects of meteorological uncertainty were higher than the misclassification error. These findings suggested that a strategy based on satellite-measured data could be a favourable improvement for the spatial upscaling of GPP, because avoiding the propagation of the uncertainties of the modelled grids.

These variables are necessary for understanding and predicting ocean productivity, carbon fluxes, underwater light propagation, water quality, and for assessing marine photochemical processes. The Cariaco Basin, located on the continental shelf of Venezuela in the southeastern Caribbean Sea, is the site of the CARIACO Ocean Time-Series project. Since 1995, CARIACO has collected bio-optical (hyperspectral inherent and apparent optical properties IOPs and AOPs, respectively), biogeochemical and ecological observations to characterize local ecosystem variations in response to regional and global changes in climate. We examine phytoplankton taxonomic and pigment time series data collected by this program between 2006 and 2012 to understand how seasonal changes in these parameters relate to biooptical data (i.e., absorption spectra). TChla and accessory pigments varied seasonally in response to changes in the phytoplankton community composition, with higher concentrations of microphytoplankton (>20 mu m; 45%) during upwelling (December-April) than during the rainy season (16%; May/June-October/November). Picophytoplankton (<2 mu m) dominated during the rainy season (66%). The absorption properties also exhibited seasonal variations. Diagnostic pigments could not be identified in a quantitative way using derivative analysis of phytoplankton absorption, likely because of overlapping of absorption spectra among the pigments present. The POC:TChla ratio at CARIACO was variable and dependent on bulk carbon (not necessarily related to phytoplankton) and the functional groups present at any given time, underscoring the fact that using a fixed ratio of POC:Chla in biogeochemical models can lead to large uncertainties in carbon budgets from coastal zones. Low POC:TChla was associated with microphytoplanIcton size class (diatoms), while picophytoplankton (cyanobacteria) exhibited higher ratios. These results contribute to furthering our understanding of coastal phytoplankton dynamics and how they relate to optical signatures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

As such, there is a need to derive land surface phenological descriptors that are free of the influence of snow-cover. The presence of on-ground snow-cover influences the phenological descriptors produced using some remotely sensed vegetation indices. This study proposes a method that uses both the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) to obtain dates for the start and end of the growing season. The method operates in the phase-spaces (sometimes referred to as feature- or band-spaces) created by the intersection of the NDVI-NDII data-space of individual pixels and can be used to derive descriptors for the start and end of the growing period as well as period corresponding with the end of green-up. This paper describes the origins and rationale for the method, which was applied to a MODIS image time-series of Australia\'s alpine bioregion for 2000-mid-2001. The results were validated against descriptors derived using the method of Delbart et al. (2005). For the start of the growing period, the validation indicated there was moderate correlation (r = 0.51, p <= 0.001) between the descriptors. Noise in the NDII time-series used resulted in little, or no, correlation for the end of the growing period (r = -0.13, p <= 0.001), and the correlation for the end of the green-up period was somewhat limited (r = 0.24, p <= 0.001). In contrast to traditional NDVI threshold methods, the phase-space algorithm proposed here provided for a clear set of definitions that correspond with biophysical phenomena of the land surface, such as the offset and on-set of seasonal snow-cover.

Optical and radar remote sensors are increasingly used as an alternative method for rapid delineation and classification of surface sediments. However, each sensor provides different levels of information and accuracy. In this research work, six datasets (ALOS/AVNIR-2, ASTER, AVNIR-2/PALSAR, ASTER/PALSAR, quad polarized ALOS/PALSAR and quad polarized Radarsat-2) were prepared to run unsupervised and supervised classifications to compare their accuracy for mapping surface sediment in the non-vegetated El-Gallaba Plain of the Western Desert of Egypt, particularly in terms of grain size and surface roughness. The accuracy level of all classification outputs, as well as the official geologic map, in comparison with the reference field information is empirically evaluated using the standard accuracy assessment method (confusion matrices). The best overall accuracy and dataset is the supervised classification using the complex coherence matrix [T-3] of the full polarimetric Radarsat-2 which is 96.43% with Kappa coefficient of 0.929. Therefore, the zonal statistics method is applied between the final supervised classification map with its five classes and the generated Entropy (H), Alpha (alpha degrees), Anisotropy (A) and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) to extract information regarding the polarimetric response as well as the elevation of each sediment class. In addition, the polarization signatures of these five classes are extracted in order to examine their scattering mechanism and to distinguish the differences between them in terms of differences in their surface roughness and grain sizes. In addition, the low frequency ALOS/PALSAR data reveal a set of linear features that are hidden under windblown sand and are not visible in the field or in other datasets. These hidden lineament features were confirmed in the field by a ground penetrating radar survey using 100 MHz shielded GSSI antenna. The GPR profiles show very clear discontinuities in the subsurface layers, which are covered by a thin sand sheet Furthermore, the complicated depositional history of these surface sediments is proposed based on field work and remote sensing analyses. Consequently, the results show that El-Gallaba Plain has high potential for agricultural production using its groundwater resources. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, AMSR-E USDA RZSM data show best agreements with in-situ data at 20 cm, among the four depths (10, 20, 30, and 50 cm). In this study, the ASCAT SSM and SWI were rescaled based on the porosity and the effective saturation according to soil texture. Renormalized soil moisture products using three renormalization methods: the linear regression correction (REG), average-standard deviation (mu - sigma), and cumulative distribution function (CDF) provided an improvement in biases and RMSEs, with SSM (SWI) RMSEs of 0.04 (0.02), 0.05 (0.03), and 0.05 (0.03) m(3)/m(3) for REG mu - sigma, and CDF matching, respectively. A Taylor diagram was used to assess the accuracy of four satellite soil moisture products with in situ data on a plot. Based on these results, ASCAT soil moisture products were potentially proven to be more appropriate than AMSR-E products in northeast Asia. Remotely sensed soil moisture datasets from passive (AMSR-E) and active (ASCAT) sensors are beneficial to operational hydrological investigations and water management activities.

Land subsidence in the basin resulting from mining activities has already been known over the past few decades. There has been ongoing concern that irrigation and off-shore oil and natural gas extraction has significantly lowered groundwater levels on-shore, and that this may lead to further subsidence. Therefore it is important to map the land surface change in the basin in order to understand the actual impact of these activities. The total area of Gippsland Basin is approximately 46,000 km(2), where approximately one-third of the basin is located onshore. Because of the large area of the basin, ALOS PALSAR data from 4 different paths were used to map the land displacement over the basin. The InSAR result suggests that the land displacement at 98% of the measurement points in the basin was between -10 mm/year and 10 mm/year. The InSAR result has been compared to the ground survey data in several areas, collected with GPS and total station surveys. The comparison of results suggested that the InSAR measurement and the ground survey measurement agree with each other in general. The standard deviation of difference between the InSAR results and the ground survey data is approximately 4 mm/year near the coastal area and 15 mm/year near the mining sites. Several rapidly deforming areas have been identified at the mining sites and the surrounding areas. Deformation rate at up to -82.9 mm/year is observed in these areas. The deformation at the mining sites and the surrounding areas are expected to be resulted from mining activities and associated mine dewatering. Moreover, several minor displacement zones have been observed and investigated in the area between the Loy Yang Mines and the Gippsland coast as well as the area between Yanakie and Wilsons Promontory.

Between 31 degrees N and 40 degrees N, the spring bloom onset is mainly associated with a cessation of mixed layer deepening. In much of the area north of 40 degrees N, including the Oyashio area, the onset of the spring bloom is consistent with Sverdrup\'s critical depth hypothesis. The spatial extents of the light- and nutrient-limited areas and the areas associated with a single bloom onset mechanism are by no means constant.

Nonlinear DR algorithms, also referred to as manifold learning algorithms, have been successfully applied to hyperspectral data and provide improved performance compared with linear DR algorithms. However, DR algorithms cannot handle missing data that are common in multi-temporal imagery. In this paper, the Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) nonlinear DR algorithm was refined for application to multi-temporal satellite data with large proportions of missing data. Refined LE algorithms were applied to 52-week Landsat time series for three study areas in Texas, Kansas and South Dakota that have different amounts of missing data and land cover complexity. A series of random forest classifications were conducted on the refined LE DR bands using varying proportions of training data provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Cropland Data Layer (CDL); these classification results were compared with conventional metrics-based random forest classifications. Experimental results show that compared with the metrics approach, higher per-class and overall classification accuracies were obtained using the refined LE DR bands of multispectral reflectance time series, and the number of training samples required to achieve a given degree of classification accuracy was also reduced. The approach of applying the refined LE to multispectral reflectance time series is promising in that it is automated and provides dimensionality-reduced data with desirable classification properties. The implications of this research and possibilities for future algorithm development and application are discussed. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.', '[Yan, L.; Roy, D.

Spectral measurements of the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) at ground level provide us a method to capture the directional characteristics of the observed surface. Various spectroradiometers with different field of views (FOVs) were used under different mounting conditions to measure crop reflectance. The impact and uncertainty of sensor FOV and distance from the target have rarely been considered. The issue can be compounded with the characteristic reflectance of heterogeneous row crops. Because of the difficulty of accurately obtaining field measurements of crop reflectance under natural environments, a method of computer simulation was proposed to study the impact of sensor FOV and distance on field measured BRFs. A Monte Carlo model was built to combine the photon spread method and the weight reduction concept to develop the weighted photon spread (WPS) model to simulate radiation transfer in architecturally realistic canopies. Comparisons of the Monte Carlo model with both field BRF measurements and the RAMI Online Model Checker (ROMC) showed good agreement. BRFs were then simulated for a range of sensor FOV and distance combinations and compared with the reference values (distance at infinity) for two typical row canopy scenes. Sensors with a finite FOV and distance from the target approximate the reflectance anisotropy and yield average values over FOV. Moreover, the perspective projection of the sensor causes a proportional distortion in the sensor FOV from the ideal directional observations. Though such factors inducing the measurement error exist, it was found that the BRF can be obtained with a tolerable bias on ground level with a proper combination of sensor FOV and distance, except for the hotspot direction and the directions around it Recommendations for the choice of sensor FOV and distance are also made to reduce the bias from the real angular signatures in field BRF measurement for row crops.

While most previous studies on this topic relied on modeling results or precipitation-based surface moisture information (particularly the standardized precipitation index, SPI), we use here a new merged remote sensing soil moisture product that combines active and passive microwave sensors to investigate the relation between the number of hot days (NHD) and preceding soil moisture deficits. Along with analyses of temporal variabilities of surface vs. root-zone soil moisture, this sheds light on the role of different soil depths for soil moisture-temperature coupling. The global patterns of soil moisture-NHD correlations from remote sensing data and from SPI as used in previous studies are comparable. Nonetheless, the strength of the relationship appears underestimated with remote sensing-based soil moisture compared to SPI-based estimates, particularly in regions of strong soil moisture-temperature coupling. This is mainly due to the fact that the temporal hydrological variability is less pronounced in the remote sensing data than in the SPI estimates in these regions, and large dry/wet anomalies appear underestimated. Comparing temporal variabilities of surface and root-zone soil moisture in in-situ observations reveals a drop of surface-layer variability below that of root-zone when dry conditions are considered. This feature is a plausible explanation for the observed weaker relationship of remote sensing-based soil moisture (representing the surface layer) with NHD as it leads to a gradual decoupling of the surface layer from temperature under dry conditions, while root-zone soil moisture sustains more of its temporal variability.

In 1996, nutrient load reductions were placed into North Carolina (NC) law to reduce the extent and duration of algal blooms in the Neuse and Tar River estuaries (Session Law 1995, Section 572). The chlorophyll a criterion was used as the endpoint to manage total nitrogen concentrations, and compliance would be achieved if chl a exceedances occurred in fewer than 10% of the samples collected in a specified area and time (known as the 10/40 criterion).   In 2009, discussions were held between the North Carolina Department of Environmental and Natural Resources (NCDENR) and US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concerning the practicality of using satellite-derived chl a concentrations to monitor water quality, enforce water quality-related environmental regulations, and understand the environmental impacts of the watershed land-use practices on coastal waters.   In this study, the MERIS chlorophyll a data product was used to conduct a retrospective analysis of the NC standard for water quality and Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for total nitrogen in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River estuaries from 2006 to 2009.

In this study, a Landsat-based sub-pixel fractional snow covered area retrieval model based on spectral unmixing is applied and validated over a southern Andes study region. An application analyzing minimum annual snow/ice covered areas is presented as an example of the utility of the existence of such a model and the Landsat database. The model was validated using high-resolution imagery aggregated to the nominal Landsat resolution, showing good correlation for both fresh snow and ice/old snow presence. Using annual minimum snow/ice retrievals from Landsat 5 and 7, the presence of trends in each snow/ice-covered pixel area was assessed for the 1986-2013 historical period, and three metrics were examined: pixels with significant negative trends, total area loss, and areas with any absolute negative change. Significant negative (area reduction) trends in most of the glacier fronts were found, with a loss of approximately 15% of the original 241 km(2) glacierized/snow area between 1986 and 2011. Trends in fractional values were compared with those derived from traditional binary classification of snow and significant discrepancies were observed. Even though the binary classification identified a greater total areal loss (33 vs. 23 km(2)) when comparing scenes from the beginning and the end of the study period, the fractional algorithm identified a larger number of pixels with significant negative trends between 1986 and 2013 (42.3 vs. 10.5 km(2)). The binary algorithm resulted in consistent overestimations of ice and snow area and does not offer the ability for identifying subpixel changes. The method could enable future monitoring of Andean and other glaciers and snow cover at a sub-pixel scale over large scales, and with Landsat 8 in orbit a continuous stream of more than 30 years of data is already available.

Here we demonstrate a new method that physically integrates the radiometric surface temperature (T-S) into the PM equation for estimating the terrestrial surface energy balance fluxes (sensible heat, H and latent heat, lambda E). The method combines satellite T-S data with standard energy balance closure models in order to derive a hybrid closure that does not require the specification of surface to atmosphere conductance terms. We call this the Surface Temperature Initiated Closure (STIC), which is formed by the simultaneous solution of four state equations. Taking advantage of the psychrometric relationship between temperature and vapor pressure, the present method also estimates the near surface moisture availability (M) from T-S, air temperature (T-A) and relative humidity (R-H), thereby being capable of decomposing lambda E into evaporation (lambda E-E) and transpiration (lambda E-T). STIC is driven with T-S, T-A, R-H, net radiation (R-N), and ground heat flux (G). T-S measurements from both MODIS Terra (MOD11A2) and Aqua (MYD11A2) were used in conjunction with FLUXNET R-N, G, T-A, R-H, lambda E and H measurements corresponding to the MODIS equatorial crossing time. The performance of STIC has been evaluated in comparison to the eddy covariance measurements of lambda E and H at 30 sites that cover a broad range of biomes and climates. We found a RMSE of 37.79 (11%) (with MODIS Terra T-S) and 44.27 W m(-2) (15%) (with MODIS Aqua T-S) in lambda E estimates, while the RMSE was 37.74(9%) (with Terra) and 44.72 W m(-2) (8%) (with Aqua) in H. STIC could efficiently capture the lambda E dynamics during the dry down period in the semi-arid landscapes where lambda E is strongly governed by the subsurface soil moisture and where the majority of other lambda E models generally show poor results. Sensitivity analysis revealed a high sensitivity of both the fluxes to the uncertainties in T-S. A realistic response and modest relationship was also found when partitioned lambda E components (lambda E-E and lambda E-T) were compared to the observed soil moisture and rainfall. This is the first study to report the physical integration of T-S into the PM equation and finding analytical solution of the physical (g(B)) and physiological conductances (g(S)). The performance of STIC over diverse biomes and climates points to its potential to benefit future NASA and NOAA missions having thermal sensors, such as HyspIRI, GeoSTAR and GOES-R for mapping multi-scale lambda E and drought.

This study presents an effort to synergistically combine optical and SAR data to improve the mapping of impervious surfaces. Three pairs of optical and SAR images, Landsat ETM + and ENVISAT ASAR, SPOT-5 and ENVISAR ASAR, and SPOT-5 and TerraSAR-X, were selected in three study areas to validate the effectiveness of the methods in this study. The potential of Random Forest (RF) was evaluated with parameter optimization for combining the optical and SAR images. Experiment results demonstrate some interesting findings. Firstly, the built-in out-of-bag (OOB) error is insufficient for accuracy assessment, and an assessment with additional reference data is required for combining optical and SAR images using RF. Secondly, the optimal number of variables (m) for splitting the decision tree nodes in RF should be some different from the principles reported previously, and an empirical relationship was given for determining the parameter m. Thirdly, the optimal number of decision trees (T) in RF is not sensitive to the resolutions and sensor types of optical and SAR images, and the optimal T in this study is 20. Fourthly, the combined use of optical and SAR images by using RF is effective to improve the land cover classification and impervious surface estimation, by reducing the confusions between bright impervious surface and bare soil and dark impervious surface and bare soil, as well as shaded area and water surface. Even though the easily-confused land classes tend to be different in different resolutions of images, the effectiveness of combining optical and SAR images is consistent. This improvement is more significant when combing lower resolution optical and SAR images. The conclusions of this study could serve as an important reference for further applications of optical and SAR images, and as a potential reference for the applications of RF to the fusion of other multi-source remote sensing data.

Detailed Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) data of vertical current velocity component, echo intensity, modulation of SSC and related oceanographic and meteorological observations in a tidal inlet of the North Sea have been analyzed. To understand the associated hydrodynamics of the optical imaging mechanism theoretical considerations based on the Navier Stokes and sediment continuity equations have been carried out. As a first approximation these theoretical results explain signatures of enhanced SSC of in situ measurements and analyzed space-borne images. Strong currents flowing over steep bottom topography are able to stir up the sediments to form both a general continuum of SSC and localized pulses of higher SSC in the vicinity of the causative bed feature itself. The \"strain rate\" equivalent to the current gradient is an important parameter describing near water surface oceanographic and meteorological phenomena in the visible and microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum observed by shore- and ship-based as well as air- and space-borne remote sensing systems. Significant disagreements between theoretical results of the \"strain rate\" generated by the surface current and in situ observations at the crests of submerged ridges and sand waves were identified. Possible explanations could be: first, the current velocity may not be barotropic near the crests of such bed forms and second, mass conservation may not only be maintained through an acceleration or deceleration of the flow. This implies that active up- and downwelling effects of the three-dimensional current field can also play a significant role for hydrodynamic interaction between current and underwater bed forms.

Simulations were also performed for atmospheric profiles that were created from the measured profiles by \'drying\' layers at various altitudes. It was found that the retrieval errors 1) depend on the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, 2) change in a systematic way dependent on the presence and characteristics of a dry layer, 3) dry layers in the lower troposphere make the SST retrieval errors more positive, and dry layers in the upper troposphere tend to introduce SST retrieval errors that are more negative.

ERA-Land results from Land Surface Model simulations forced by high quality atmospheric forcing data. It was shown to adequately capture the temporal dynamic of soil moisture. ERA-land\'s large scale nature, frozen configuration, global availability and ability to accurately represent soil moisture variability make it suitable to complement typical validation approaches of soil moisture from remote sensing based on ground measurements. Considering locations that have significant correlations for each 3-year sub periods within 1980-2010, averaged soil moisture correlations of SM-MW with ERA-Land (at 95% Confidence Interval) are increasing steadily from 1986 to 2010 (from 0.52 +/- 0.10, to 0.66 +/- 0.04). The lower correlations mirror the periods where only passive microwave from the Special Sensor Microwave/Image (SSM/I Ku band at 19.3 GHz) sensor was used, highlighting the importance of multi-sensor capabilities. Overall SM-MW is relatively stable over time with respect to ERA-Land.

Hyperspectral data were collected from a helicopter coincident with accurately located sites where detailed ground sampling was undertaken based on adaptation of standard methods such as the GeoCBI. Ground sampling revealed the importance of models that characterise both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic vegetation including scorched foliage. The proportion of charred material was not significantly correlated with fire severity categories. Models were assessed particularly in relation to spectral bands of the MODIS sensor given its high observation frequency and global application in fire detection and mapping studies. Significant and inverse fire severity relationships were observed with the near infrared and two short wave infrared bands, demonstrating support for a model like the widely used differenced normalised burn ratio (Delta NBR). However, model assessment using Akaike\'s Information Criteria suggests the most parsimonious model is the pre- and post-fire difference in MODIS channel 6 (1628-1652 nm).

The weights reduce the effects of background variation while emphasizing the variation caused by disturbance. The weighted DI was applied to the severe insect defoliation of 2006 in the Apostle Island National Lakeshore with promising results. A supervised maximum likelihood thematic map based on the unweighted DI was 59% accurate and one based on the weighted DI was 62%. A classification with only two classes, defoliated and not defoliated, was also more accurate when based upon the weighted DI (77% verses 69%). In nearly all instances, the user\'s and producer\'s accuracies were significantly higher for the weighted DI image, suggesting that weighting the DI to fit local conditions is a superior approach, at least for small-area studies.

Both vegetation and physical snowpack variables including snowpack grain size, snow depth, and stratigraphy influence the observed brightness temperature. The natural heterogeneity of snowpack and vegetation states within the microwave footprint occurs at spatial scales shorter than PM observation scales. In this study, we analyze the relationship between PM brightness temperature measurements and the heterogeneity of snowpack and vegetation. Specifically, we explore the question of whether PM observations are sensitive to changes in snow depth even given sub-pixel variability in snow and vegetation. To examine this question, densely sampled, spatially distributed in situ snow properties from multiple study areas made during the NASA Cold Land Processes Experiment (CLPX) are employed in a forward modeling scheme to study the effect of highly variable snow and vegetation properties on the observed PM measurement.   In all test cases, this study finds that there exists sensitivity of microwave brightness temperature (T-b) to total snow depth contained within the measurement footprint, regardless of the heterogeneous nature of snow pack properties. Across three study areas, T-b decreases by 23-35 K as depth increased up to the signal saturation depth, which ranged from 70 to 120 cm. With regard to vegetation sensitivity, forest fractions (F) as little as 0.2 can modify the PM measurement by up to 10 K, and F greater than 0.6 mask virtually all of the microwave signal attributable to snow. Finally, with respect to the measurement scale, our results indicate that the scale at which the PM measurement is made does not affect the sensitivity of the T-b to mean snow depth, to the scale (1 km) examined herein.

Because acquisition of \"wall-to-wall\" ALS data over large areas is not economically feasible, a systematic sampling approach using ALS as a strip sampling tool was used to supplement a conventional field-based inventory in a large-scale biomass survey in Hedmark County (HC), Norway. However, the complexities of these surveys render prohibitive the analytical determination of the properties of the resulting estimators and of the estimators of their sampling variances. To overcome the problem, the statistical properties of the estimators were empirically investigated in this paper using simulated sampling from an artificial population. Through this approach, estimators with desirable properties can be identified and used for inference in real applications. By combining biomass estimates from Norwegian National Forest Inventory plots in HC ALS measurements and Landsat 5 TM imagery, an artificial population at the scale of HC was created. Using this artificial population as \"ground-truth\", we demonstrate how simulated sampling can be used for assessing the statistical properties of regression estimators and of their variance estimators under two-phase post-stratified systematic sampling (SYS) and simple random sampling without replacement (SRSwoR) designs, considering design- and model-dependent inferential frameworks. The results were assessed using a purely ground-based systematic design with a Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimator as benchmark. The real overall precision of the ALS-aided systematic survey was nearly five times overestimated when using the design-based variance estimators developed for SRSwoR, while under model-dependent inference the overestimation of the real standard errors was around 40%. Compared to ground-based inventory, the estimated standard errors of the systematic ALS survey doubled while in reality the standard errors were 55% lower. Using successive differences variance estimators greatly improved the precision of the systematic ALS-aided survey and produced valid 95% confidence intervals under the design-based inference. The most satisfactory results for the ALS-aided survey in terms of analytical variances occurred under design-based inference with successive difference variance estimator, closely followed by the model-dependent estimators. Using simulations, the cost efficiency of the ground based and ALS-aided surveys was assessed by evaluating accuracy against inventory cost for various sampling intensities. The results indicated that the ALS-aided surveys can be a cost-efficient alternative to traditional field inventories. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

It is quite difficult to obtain an immediate assessment of large-scale natural disasters by ground survey. Microwave remote sensing by airborne or spaceborne sensors is a suitable tool for monitoring near-real-time damage over large areas. However, it is not always possible to acquire datasets with sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions for the precise detection of large areas of damage; therefore, this study focuses on the application of fully polarimetric scattering observations for deduction of information about damaged areas. Earthquake-induced changes in the radar backscattering mechanism are investigated by polarimetric scattering mechanism indicators. In addition, a change detection technique using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) based thresholding approach is applied to various polarimetric features. Furthermore, a new polarimetric information fusion method based on the contextual Markov Random Field (MRF) is proposed. The mapping accuracy for tsunami-swept urban areas can be improved by about 50% with significant reduction of false- and missed-alarm rates compared with the single-polarization SAR approach.

This study assesses an lambda E model (PT-JPL model) based on downscaling potential evapotranspiration according to multiple stresses at daily time-scale in two of these regions using MSG-SEVIRI (surface temperature and albedo) and MODIS products (NDVI, LAI and f(PAR)). An open woody savanna in the Sahel (Mali) and a Mediterranean grassland (Spain) were selected as test sites with Eddy Covariance data used for evaluation. The PT-JPL model was modified to run at a daily time step and the outputs from eight algorithms differing in the input variables and also in the formulation of the biophysical constraints (stresses) were compared with the lambda E from the Eddy Covariance. Model outputs were also compared with other modeling studies at similar global chyland ecosystems.   The novelty of this paper is the computation of a key model parameter, the soil moisture constraint, relying on the concept of apparent thermal inertia (f(SM-ATI)) computed with surface temperature and albedo observations. Our results showed that f(SM-ATI) from both in-situ and satellite data produced satisfactory results for lambda E at the Sahelian savanna, comparable to parameterizations using field-measured Soil Water Content (SWC) with r(2) greater than 0.80. In the Mediterranean grasslands however, with much lower daily lambda E values, model results were not as good as in the Sahel (r(2)= 0.57-0.31) but still better than reported values from more complex models applied at the site such as the Two Source Model (TSM) or the Penman-Monteith Leuning model (PML).   PT-JPL-daily model with a soil moisture constraint based on apparent thermal inertia, f(SM-ATI) offers great potential for regionalization as no field-calibrations are required and water vapor deficit estimates, required in the original version, are not necessary, being air temperature and the available energy (Rn-G) the only input variables required, apart from routinely available satellite products.

Prior to the advent of satellites, it was difficult to obtain LSTs over extensive areas. Even today, as a result of the resolution tradeoffs involved in using satellite data, it is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to acquire satellite LSTs with high spatial and temporal resolutions. This low resolution results in a thermal mixture effect, where the resolution cells are larger than the thermal elements. The disaggregation of remotely sensed land surface temperature (DLST), a research field that focuses on decomposing pixel-based temperatures, has been critical in related fields such as the surface flux downscaling, forest fire detection, and urban heat island monitoring and it is now growing rapidly as one of the thriving subbranches of thermal remote sensing. Various methods have been independently proposed for DLST in recent decades. However, this field is suffering a disorderly development. We thus critically investigate the interdisciplinary literature on DIST and identify the terms used to denote DLST in different disciplines. Two subtopics of DIST, thermal sharpening (TSP) and temperature unmixing (TUM), are identified as a dual pair of DLST because of their parallel areas of interest. Previous studieS are classified into different categories in chronological and taxonomic order. We formulate definitions of TSP, TUM, and DLST, and we then examine how TSP and TUM are connected to related fields in remote sensing. Based on the literature, we present the key issues related to DLST, the recommended DLST methods in different applications, and the caveats that must be considered in future work, including (1) four predetermined assumptions (i.e., additivity, separability, connectivity, and convertibility), (2) the utilization of diurnal thermal observations, and (3) the complication of aggregation. This overview will provide a generalization of TSP and TUM, promote the understanding of DLST, and guide future research. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

A data fusion approach also provides a means to extend 3D information from discrete spaceborne LiDAR measurements of forest structure across scales much larger than that of the LiDAR footprint. For estimating biomass, these measurements mix a number of errors including those associated with LiDAR footprint sampling over regional-global extents. A general framework for mapping above ground live forest biomass density (AGB) with a data fusion approach is presented and verified using data from NASA field campaigns near Howland, ME, USA, to assess AGB and LiDAR sampling errors across a regionally representative landscape. We combined SAR and Landsat-derived optical (passive optical) image data to identify contiguous areas (>0.5 ha) that are relatively homogenous in remote sensing metrics (forest patches). We used this image-derived data with simulated spaceborne LiDAR derived from orbit and cloud cover simulations and airborne data from NASA\'s Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) to compute AGB and estimate LiDAR sampling error for forest patches and 100 m, 250 m, 500 m, and 1 km grid cells. At both the patch and grid scales, we evaluated differences in AGB estimation and sampling error from the combined use of LiDAR with both SAR and passive optical and with either SAR or passive optical alone. First, this data fusion approach demonstrates that incorporating forest patches into the AGB mapping framework can provide sub-grid forest information for coarser grid-level AGB reporting. Second, a data fusion approach for estimating AGB using simulated spaceborne LiDAR with SAR and passive optical image combinations reduced forest AGB sampling errors 12%-38% from those where LiDAR is used with SAR or passive optical alone. In absolute terms, sampling errors were reduced from 14-40 Mg ha(-1) to 11-28 Mg ha(-1) across all grid scales and prediction methods, where minimum sampling errors were 11, 15, 18, and 22 Mg ha(-1) for 1 km, 500 m, 250 m, and 100 m grid scales, respectively. Third, spaceborne global scale accuracy requirements were achieved whereby at least 80% of the grid cells at 100 m, 250 m, 500 m, and 1 km grid levels met AGB accuracy requirements using a combination of passive optical and SAR along with machine learning methods to predict vegetation structure metrics for forested areas without LiDAR samples. Finally, using either passive optical or SAR, accuracy requirements were met at the 500 m and 250 m grid level, respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Montesano, P.

The accuracy of biomass estimates, and rate of biomass change, is not only important in the context of carbon markets emerging under REDD, but also for characterizing uncertainty in estimates of carbon cycling and the global carbon budget. There is particular interest in mapping biomass so that carbon stocks and stock changes can be monitored consistently across a range of scales - from relatively small projects (tens of hectares) to national or continental scales - but also so that other benefits of forest conservation can be factored into decision making (e.g. biodiversity and habitat corridors). We conducted an analysis of reported biomass accuracy estimates from more than 70 refereed articles using different remote sensing platforms (airborne and spaceborne) and sensor types (optical, radar, and lidar), with a particular focus on lidar since those papers reported the lowest errors when used in a synergistic manner with other coincident multi-sensor measurements. We show systematic differences in accuracy between different types of Iidar systems flown on different platforms but, perhaps more importantly, differences between forest types (biomes) and plot sizes used for field calibration and assessment. We discuss these findings in relation to monitoring, reporting and verification under REDD, and also in the context of more systematic assessment of factors that influence accuracy and error estimation.

The Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory Coastal Ocean Modelling System (POLCOMS) was used to predict the location of this front, and data from the MODIS Aqua sensor was used to derive a five-year time series of red-waveband remote sensing reflectance (R(rs)667) and sea surface temperature (SST) for two representative areas on either side of the frontal region. Pronounced annual cycles in R(rs)667 and SST were observed at both locations, with summer minima in R(rs)667 being roughly coincident with SST maxima. Previous studies have shown that R(rs)667 in the Irish Sea is mainly determined by near-surface concentrations of suspended mineral particles. The annual cycles in reflectance therefore indicate that vertical mixing of the water column in winter supplies fine particles to the surface layer which settle out in calmer summer conditions. While the temporal resolution achievable by remote sensing in a single year was limited by the high incidence of cloud cover, monthly averaged data for the whole five-year period revealed differences of the order of one month in the timing of the reflectance cycle on the mixed and stratified sides of the front. This difference produced transient patterns of reflectance in early summer (and occasionally in autumn) in which sharp contrasts coincided with the location of the tidal front predicted by the POLCOMS model. We conclude that optical remote sensing in shelf seas can provide information not only on changing concentrations of optically significant materials, but also on the location and timing of dynamical processes such as seasonal front formation, and note that such information is of potential value for tuning and validating numerical models of shelf sea ecosystems.

The air temperatures measured by ground-based weather stations were properly matched with brightness temperatures observed by the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board of both Terra and Aqua satellites. In total, 931 daytime and nighttime scenes taken between 2007 and 2010 were processed. Analysis of the canopy layer heat island (CLHI) maps during summer months reveals an average heat island effect of 3-4 K during nighttime (with some peaks around 5 K) and a weak CLHI intensity during daytime. In addition, the satellite maps reveal a well defined island shape across the city center from June to September confirming that, in Milan, urban heating is not an occasional phenomenon. Furthermore, this study shows the utility of space missions to monitor the metropolis heat islands if they are able to provide nighttime observations when CLHI peaks are generally significant.

A major contributor to this noise is the directional effect as the target reflectance varies with the observation geometry. The operational MODIS processing inverts the parameters of a BRDF model which are provided in the so-called MCD43C2 product with a frequency of (8 days)(-1). Recently, Vermote et al. (2009) suggested an alternative BRDF inversion method. A major assumption is that the BRDF model shape (i.e. the BRDF normalized by its overall amplitude) varies little throughout the year so that the two model parameters are linear functions of the NDVI. Consequently, a given target BRDF shape is described by four parameters (slope and intercept for the two NDVI-dependent parameters) rather than 2 parameters that change for each 8 days period. This method imposes additional constrain for the surface BRDF inversion.   In this paper, we evaluate the performance of these two approaches for the correction of surface reflectance time series. We work at the 0.05 degrees (approximate to 5 km) resolution of the CMG grid and analyze a representative set of + 100 targets selected on the basis of the location of AERONET sites. The performance is quantified by the high-frequency noise in the corrected time series. We demonstrate that the performances of the two approaches are very similar. This result demonstrates that a simple four-parameter NDVI-scaled model performs as well as a more complex model with many more degrees of freedom. Besides, the four-parameter model, which is inverted on a given year, can be applied to the measurements of other years with a similar level of performance. Finally, a single \"averaged\" model can be applied to any target with a performance that is only slightly reduced compared to what is achieved with a model derived through a full inversion of the multi-temporal data.   The proposed four-parameter BRDF model permits the reduction of noise in the reflectance time series by a factor of the order of three in the red and four in the near infrared. After correction, the reflectance time series are very clean, with an apparent noise that is approximate to 0.005 in the red band and 0.01 in the near infrared. The quality of the BRDF correction makes it possible to use the individual reflectance time-series at high temporal resolution, rather than indices based on their ratio, and thus retain more information about the vegetation dynamics.

The scope of these methods ranges from simple regression between LiDAR-derived height metrics and biomass to methods including automated tree crown delineation, stochastic simulation, and machine learning approaches. This study compared the effectiveness of four modeling techniques-linear mixed-effects (LME) regression, random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR). and Cubist-for estimating biomass in moderately dense forest (40-60% canopy closure) at both tree and plot levels. Tree crowns were delineated to provide model estimates of individual tree biomass.and investigate the effects of delineation accuracy on biomass modeling. We used our previously developed method (COTH) to delineate tree crowns. Results indicate that biomass estimation accuracy improves when modeled at the plot level and that SVR produced the most accurate biomass model (671 kg RMSE per 380 m(2) plot when forest plots were modeled as a collection of trees). All models provided similar results when estimating biomass at the individual tree level (505, 506, 457, and 502 kg RMSE per tree). We assessed the effect of crown delineation accuracy on biomass estimation by repeating the modeling procedures with manually delineated crowns as inputs. Results indicated that manually delineated crowns did not always produce superior biomass models and that the relationship between crown delineation accuracy and biomass estimation accuracy is complex and needs to be further investigated.

The intensity, rate and timing of reductions in seasonally-summed NDVI are systematically varied on sample data to simulate land degradation, after which the trend analysis was applied and its sensitivity evaluated. The study was based on a widely-used, 1 km(2) AVHRR data set for a test area in southern Africa. The trends were the most negative and significant when the degradation was introduced rapidly (over a period of 2-5 years) and in the middle of a 16-year time series. The seasonally-summed NDVI needs to be reduced by 30-40% before a significant negative linear slope or Kendall\'s correlation coefficient was apparent, given an underlying positive trend caused by rainfall. The seasonally-summed data were reordered to remove this underlying positive trend, before simulating degradation again. With no underlying positive trend present, degradation of 20% resulted in significant negative trends. Since areas widely agreed to be degraded show only 10-20% reductions compared to non-degraded areas, this raises doubts over the ability of trend analyses to detect degradation in a timely way in the presence of underling environmental trends. Residual Trends Analysis (RESTREND) was applied in an attempt to correct for variability and trends in rainfall. However, a simulated degradation intensity >= 20% caused the otherwise strong relationship between NDVI and rainfall to break down, making the RESTREND an unreliable indicator of land degradation. The results of such analyses will vary between different environments and need to be tested for sample areas across regions. Although the paper does not claim to solve the challenge of detecting land degradation amidst rainfall variability, it introduces a method of assessing the sensitivity of land degradation monitoring using remote sensing data.

Our goal was to characterize forest-cover changes in the temperate zone of European Russia between 1985 and 2010 in 5-year increments using a stratified random sample of 12 Landsat footprints. We used Support Vector. Machines and post-classification comparison to monitor forest area, disturbance and reforestation. Where image availability was sub-optimal, we tested whether winter images help to improve classification accuracy. Our approach yielded accurate mono-temporal maps (on average > 95% overall accuracy), and change maps (on average 93.5%). The additional use of winter imagery improved classification accuracy by about 2%. Our results suggest that Russia\'s temperate forests underwent substantial changes during the observed period. Overall, forested areas increased by 4.5%, but the changes in forested area varied over time: a decline in forest area between 1990 and 1995 (- 1%) was followed by an increase in overall forest area in recent years (+ 1.4%, 2005-2010), possibly caused in part by forest regrowth on abandoned farmlands. Disturbances varied greatly among administrative regions, suggesting that differences in socioeconomic conditions strongly influence disturbance rates. While portions of Russia\'s temperate forests experienced high disturbance rates, overall forest area is expanding. Our use of a stratified random sample of Landsat footprints, and of summer and winter images, allowed us to characterize forest dynamics across a large region over a long time period, emphasizing the value of winter imagery in the free Landsat archives, especially for study areas where data availability is limited.

Thus, estimated temperatures and emissivities are the effective values that would be found if these simplified assumptions were met. In reality, the physical scene is neither homogeneous nor isothermal, and the effective values are not strictly representative of it. How much in error are they? In order to estimate this, a radiosity model used for predicting effective emissivity spectra and radiant temperatures for rough surfaces has been developed. Here we compare the computer model results to analytic model results in order to verify that the computer model is working properly. We validate the model against spectra measured in the field using a hyperspectral imaging spectrometer and a centimeter-scale DTM of the test scene acquired using a tripod-based LiDAR. The discrepancies between analytical and modeled values are less than 0.01%. Modeled emissivity spectra deviate from the measured by no more than 0.015 emissivity units.

Errors in geolocation of the ICESat tracks result in some error in the adjustment vectors, but these are small relative to the velocity adjustment for fast-moving ice shelves.

One of the most widely utilized understory component metrics is understory vegetation cover, often used as a measure of vegetation abundance. To date. understory vegetation cover estimation and prediction has proven to be inherently difficult using traditional explanatory variables such as: leaf area index, basal area, slope, and aspect. We introduce airborne lidar-derived metrics into the modeling framework for understory vegetation cover. A new airborne lidar metric, understory lidar cover density, created by filtering understory lidar points using intensity values increased traditional explanatory power from non-lidar understory vegetation cover estimation models (non-lidar R-2-values: 0.2-0.45 vs. lidar R-2-values: 0.7-0.8). Beta regression, a relatively new modeling technique for this type of data, was compared with a traditional weighted linear regression model using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. Both models provided similar understory vegetation cover accuracies (+/- 22%) and biases (similar to 0%) using 40.5 m(2) circular plots (n=154). The method presented in this paper provides the ability to accurately obtain census understory vegetation cover information at fine spatial resolutions over a broad range of stand conditions for the interior ponderosa pine forest type. Additional model enhancement and the extension of the method into other forest types warrant further investigation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However the ecological significance of these habitats at a landscape scale has not yet been determined. A remote-sensing model was developed to identify the frequency and distribution of groundwater upwellings in remote Arctic and alpine areas, using freely available satellite imagery. Field research has established that groundwater upwellings provide stable environments (reduced variability in flow and temperature regimes, and reduced channel slope and bed movement), with high water tables, supporting vegetation growth on otherwise barren glacial floodplains. Upwellings are therefore associated with characteristic isolated patches of dense vegetation. The model uses this characteristic profiling of groundwater upwellings in a four-step process; 1) removing temporal variance from the images; 2) identifying and isolating glacial floodplains from the satellite data, 3) removing snow and ice 4) identifying vegetation density (associated with sites of groundwater upwelling) within the floodplains. The model was calibrated in Denali National Park, and validated in Wrangell St. Elias National Park; the extent of groundwater-fed areas was calculated and compared between sites for the first time. Model accuracy during calibration was 94%, and was marginally lower during validation (88%). The high accuracy of the model supports the wider applicability of site-specific relationships determined thus far. In each region, groundwater upwellings contributed to similar to 40% of the total riverine habitat within glacial floodplains; in combination with their high biodiversity this suggests they are ecologically significant. This model facilitates study site location, and represents a significant development in macroscale studies of groundwater upwellings in glacierised catchments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Strategies for validation vary depending on the nature of the products. The validation process of the flood and standing water product (FSW) for the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite - R series (GOES-R) is presented in this paper. A major challenge in the validation of the FSW product is the lack of ground truth flood maps and similar reference products from other satellite systems and other sources. To overcome this limitation, a two-level validation scheme for the FSW product is developed using the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data as a proxy. In the first level, gauging station data collected by the US. Geological Survey (USGS) are employed as ground truth flood point information on local scales to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for flood detection. Gauging station data collected during 34 flood cases that occurred in 2010 and 2011 in the continental US were validated and assessed according to the rate of correct detection. Results showed that 79.71% of flooding stations were accurately detected from the MODIS 1 km images by the proposed FSW algorithm. In the second level of the validation. FSW detection results using the proposed algorithm were compared to the reference flood maps, which were generated by a supervised support vector machine (SVM) classification followed by human interpretation and editing. Flood detection accuracies for three major flood events occurred in Asia and Australia in 2010 were evaluated. Confusion matrices were employed as the accuracy measurement for the second level of the validation. Commission errors for the three flood cases were 6.75%, 13.45% and 21.45%, respectively. Omission errors of flood pixels varied between 9.58% and 19.61%. The validation results suggest that the employed FSW algorithm is capable of producing flood and standing water maps in an operational environment, and it meets the required accuracy and execution time of the product.

The performance of constituent retrieval algorithms is assessed based on matchup validation experiments published between January 2006 and May 2011. Validation practices range from singular vicarious calibration experiments to comparisons using extensive in situ time series. Band arithmetic and spectral inversion algorithms for all water types are classified using a method based scheme that supports the interpretation of algorithm validity ranges. Based on these ranges we discuss groups of similar algorithms in view of their strengths and weaknesses. Such quantitative literature analysis reveals clear application boundaries. With regard to chlorophyll retrieval, validation of blue-green band ratios in coastal waters is limited to oligotrophic, predominantly ocean waters, while red-NIR ratios apply only at more than 10 mg/m(3). Spectral inversion techniques although not validated to the same extent - are necessary to cover all other conditions. Suspended matter retrieval is the least critical, as long as the wavelengths used in empirical models are increased with concentrations. The retrieval of dissolved organic matter however remains relatively inaccurate and inconsistent, with large differences in the accuracy of comparable methods in similar validation experiments. We conclude that substantial progress has been made in understanding and improving retrieval of constituents in optically deep and complex waters, enabling specific solutions to almost any type of optically complex water. Further validation and intercomparison of spectral inversion procedures are however needed to learn if solutions with a larger validity range are feasible. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Retrieved LSTs were compared to concurrent ground measurements over homogeneous rice fields to assess the accuracy of the atmospheric profiles. These included radiosonde balloons launched at the test site near-concurrently to satellite overpasses, re-analysis profiles from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), and satellite sounder products from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and the Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS; MOD07 product). SC LSTs were computed for Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ (ETM+), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection radiometer (ASTER). MODIS, and Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR). Results show that radiosonde profiles provided the best agreement between ground-measured and satellite-derived LSTs, with root mean square difference (RMSD) better than 1.0 K and biases within +/- 0.5 K for most of the cases. As an alternative to radiosonde profiles. NCEP and MOD07 data yielded reasonable results with RMSDs around 1.0 K, although LSTs derived from MOD07 profiles showed a slight overestimation (0.5 to 1.0 K) of the ground LSTs. AIRS profiles usually underestimated the ground LSTs by 1 to 2 K, probably due to the large temporal gap (2-3 h) with the other satellite measurements. We propose a test to assess the suitability of atmospheric profiles applicable to sensors with bands at 11 and 12 mu m in the split-window. So this test plus the SC method may be called split-window SC algorithm, being significantly different from the simple SC method. It implies the calculation of the difference between the LST derived from both bands (T-ig-T-jg), which should be close to zero if the atmospheric profile is accurate and the surface emissivity is well known. A small range of T-ig-T-jg values around zero can be set for which the LST derived at 11 mu m is accurate. Using only the profiles passing the test, LSTs derived from MODIS band 31 agreed with the ground data with a mean bias of -0.1 K (ground minus satellite) and RMSD of 0.6 K, while AATSR band at 11 mu m yielded a -0.1 K bias and RMSD = 0.5 K.

It was found that 18 of 31 jets characterized from 13 SAR images followed the defined power laws, or classic case, and were similar to the defined scale equations. The remaining 13 jets did not follow the classic case and resulted from jet interaction with islands, adjacent jets, and variable atmospheric conditions. These non-classic jets were grouped based upon similarities and referred to as decreasing, increasing, and reverse classic cases. Distinct deviations from the classic case included downstream increases in velocity and decreases in jet width. It was found that the orientation of the wind field relative to topography significantly impacted jet classification, and thereby made it difficult to characterize jets by region. For all 31 jets, the initial jet width dictated the distance at which a jet became self-similar, wherein a larger initial jet width required a greater distance for self-similarity.

The work was conducted in an orchard where a regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) experiment generated a gradient in water stress levels. Stomatal conductance (Gs) and water potential (Psi) were measured over the season on each treatment block The airborne data consisted on thermal and hyperspectral imagery acquired at the time of maximum stress differences among treatments, prior to the re-watering phase, using a miniaturized thermal camera and a micro-hyperspectral imager on board an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The hyperspectral imagery was acquired at 40 cm resolution and 260 spectral bands in the 400-885 nm spectral range at 6.4 nm full width at half maximum (FWHM) spectral resolution and 1.85 nm sampling interval, enabling the identification of pure crowns for extracting radiance and reflectance hyperspectral spectra from each tree. The FluorMOD model was used to investigate the retrieval of chlorophyll fluorescence by applying the Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) principle using three spectral bands (FLD3), which demonstrated that fluorescence retrieval was feasible with the configuration of the UAV micro-hyperspectral instrument flown over the orchard. Results demonstrated the link between seasonal PRI and crown temperature acquired from instrumented trees and field measurements of stomatal conductance and water potential. The sensitivity of PRI and Tc-Ta time-series to water stress levels demonstrated a time delay of PRI vs Tc-Ta during the recovery phase after re-watering started. At the time of the maximum stress difference among treatment blocks, the airborne imagery acquired from the UAV platform demonstrated that the crown temperature yielded the best coefficient of determination for Gs (r(2) = 0.78; p<0.05) and Psi (r(2) = 0.34; p<0.001). Among the narrow-band indices calculated, the PRI515 index (reference band=515 nm) obtained better results than PRI570, with r(2) = 0.59 (p<0.01) for Gs, and r(2) = 0.38 (p<0.001) for Psi. The BGl1 index calculated from the blue (R-400) and green (R-550) bands resulted on the highest significance levels (p<0.001) for both Gs (r(2) = 0.62) and Psi (r(2) = 0.49). Out of the structural indices assessed, RDVI, MTVI1 and TVI showed greater sensitivity for Gs (r(2) = 0.6: p <0.01) and Psi (p <0.001) than NDVI. Chlorophyll fluorescence calculated from the micro-hyperspectral imagery with the FLD3 method tracked stress levels, obtaining r(2) = 0.67 (p<0.05) with stomatal conductance, and r(2) = 0.66 (p<0.001) with water potential. The work presented in this manuscript demonstrates the feasibility of thermal, narrow-band indices and fluorescence retrievals obtained from a micro-hyperspectral imager and a light-weight thermal camera on board small UAV platforms for stress detection in a heterogeneous tree canopy where very high resolution is required.

Most SST products are now available in a common format but show regional differences between datasets that must be removed before use. We have defined a simple method using the SST derived from the Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) onboard the European Space Agency (ESA) ENVISAT platform as a common reference for all SST products. This method is based on an analysis of the differences between a given dataset and the AATSR SST over the 10 preceding days and over a 5 degrees regular grid. These space-time characteristics have been defined empirically in a preliminary experiment. The efficiency of the method has been evaluated on a daily basis for a two year period (2007-2008) based on two SST products from the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT): the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager (SEVIRI) derived SST over the Atlantic and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) SST derived at fine scale over the North-East Atlantic. They have been compared to the AATSR and buoy SSTs and to the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO) AVHRR global SST product. The SEVIRI SST bias, which was reduced from -0.40 K to -0.02 K for the 0-20 N latitude band by this approach provides a good example of the performance of the method. Reductions in the bias are also demonstrated for the North Atlantic, where cloudiness related problems were expected. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Using thermal infrared satellite data, a recent study found that a global set of inland water bodies showed significant warming in seasonal nighttime lake Surface Water Temperatures (LSWTs) between 1985 and 2009. Split-window land surface temperature (LST) retrievals are typically tuned for a broad range of land surface emissivities and global atmospheric conditions, and are not optimized for inland water body surfaces, whereas split-window sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) are only tuned for a single emissivity (water), but over ocean atmospheres. Over inland water bodies, these two approaches can lead to region dependent errors in LSWTs, spurious trends, and inconsistencies between sensors in the long-term temperature record of inland water bodies. To address this issue, the primary goal of this paper was to develop a methodology for deriving a set of optimized split-window coefficients, individually tuned for the regional atmospheric conditions of 169 globally distributed, saline and freshwater inland water bodies from multiple satellite sensors including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra and Aqua; Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) including ATSR-1, ATSR-2, AATSR; and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR-3). The new Inland Water-body Surface Temperature (IWbST) v1.0 algorithm was applied to Terra MODIS and Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) data and validated with in situ water temperature data from sites with widely contrasting atmospheric conditions: Lake Tahoe in California/Nevada, a high-elevation cool and dry site, and the Salton Sea in California, a low-elevation warm and humid site. Analysis showed improved accuracy in LSWTs in terms of bias and RMSE when compared to the standard MODIS LST and AATSR SST products. For example, the IWbST RMSE at Salton Sea was reduced by 0.4 K when compared to the operational MODIS product. For the AATSR data, the IWbST RMSE was reduced by 036 K at Tahoe and 0.29 K at Salton Sea when compared to results obtained using the operational AATSR split-window coefficients. The IWbST improvements are significant in relation to the current accuracy of water temperature retrievals from space (<0.5 K), and will enable the derivation of long-term, accurate LSWFs consistently across multiple sensors for climate studies.

An individual tree canopy (ITC) method based on aerial LiDAR has been developed to assess forest structure by estimating the density and spatial configuration of trees in four different height classes. The method has been tested against field measured forest inventory data from two geographically distinct forests with independent LiDAR acquisitions. The results show two distinct patterns: accurate, unbiased density estimates for trees taller than 20 m, and underestimation of density in trees less than 20 m tall. The underestimation of smaller trees is suggested to be a limitation of LiDAR remote sensing. Ecological applications of the method are demonstrated through landscape metrics analysis of density and configuration rasters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

These forage quality nutrients are particularly crucial in the dry season when concentrations of limiting nutrients decline and non-digestible fibres increase. Using artificial neural networks we test the ability of a new imaging spectrometer (CAO Alpha sensor), both alone and in combination with ancillary data, to map quantities of grass forage nutrients in the early dry season within an African savanna. Respectively 65%, 57% and 41%, of the variance in fibre, phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations were explained. We found that all grass forage nutrients show response to fire and soil. Principal component analysis, not only reduced image dimensionality, but was a useful method for removing cross-track illumination effects in the CAO imagery. To further improve the mapping of forage nutrients in the dry season we suggest that spectra within the shortwave infrared (SWIR) region, or additional relevant ancillary data, are required.

The present study is aimed at evaluating the reliability of satellite-based aerosol climatologies, as inferred from level 2 standard aerosol products such as the Terra-MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Radiometer) MODO4 aerosol product, with an application over this region during the period 2000-2008.   This evaluation is carried out by means of comparison with ground-based data from the AERONET station of El Arenosillo (Spain, 37.1N, 6.7W), which has been providing continuous data since 2000. The focus of this paper is the climatology of two aerosol optical parameters: the aerosol optical depth (ADD) and the Angstrom exponent.   AERONET ground-based measurements give an annual mean value of 0.16 +/- 0.12 and a median of 0.12 for the AOD, and a mean value of 1.20 +/- 0.47 for the Angstrom exponent The seasonal pattern is characterized by two maxima, the most important maximum occurs in summer months, and the other one in late-winter/early-spring. Lowest values appear in fall and winter, however, a local minimum is observed in July which is only detected with the long-term data series.   The mean climatological AOD based on AERONET exhibits complex seasonal patterns (i.e. with multiple local extrema), which are not always captured by MODIS-based climatology. MODIS only reproduces low values of the AOD in winter and high values in summer, as well as the local minimum of July which is sharper when using over-land retrievals. The time series of the AOD retrieved from MODIS both over land and ocean are in relatively good agreement with the ground-based measurements, with a monthly overestimation of about 30% on average, and higher differences in spring. Seasonal patterns from MODIS are better reproduced over land than over ocean. The agreement between daily AERONET and MODIS, as assessed by linear regression, gives correlation coefficients above 80% and an intercept bias below 0.03. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We pre-filtered the raw GRACE Level-2 solutions using Gaussian filters of 300, 400, 500-km of radius to verify the non-Gaussianity condition which is necessary to apply the ICA. This linear inverse approach ensures to separate components of the observed gravity field which are statistically independent. The most energetic component found by ICA corresponds mainly to the contribution of continental water mass change. Series of ICA-estimated global maps of continental water storage have been produced over 08/2002-07/2009. Our ICA estimates were compared with the solutions obtained using other post-processing of GRACE Level-2 data, such as destriping and Gaussian filtering, at global and basin scales. Besides, they have been validated with in situ measurements in the Murray-Darling Basin. Our computed ICA grids are consistent with the different approaches. Moreover, the ICA-derived time series of water masses showed less north-south spurious gravity signals and improved filtering of unrealistic hydrological features at the basin-scale compared with solutions obtained using other filtering methods.

Enhanced ultraviolet (UV) aerosol index (Al) derived from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (ON) measurements correlates with these high CO concentrations. The Hybrid Single Particle Langrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model back trajectories trace selected air parcels, where TES observes enhanced CO in the upper and lower troposphere, to the SE Australia fire region as their initial location. Simultaneously, they show a lack of vertical advection along their tracks. TES retrieved CO vertical profiles in the higher and lower southern latitudes are examined together with the averaging kernels and show that TES CO retrievals are most sensitive at approximately 300-400 hPa. The enhanced CO observed by TES in the upper (215 hPa) and lower (681 hPa) troposphere are, therefore, influenced by mid-tropospheric CO. CEOS-Chem model simulations with an 8-day emission inventory, as the wildfire source over Australia, are sampled to the TES/MLS observation times and locations. These simulations only show CO enhancements in the lower troposphere near and down-wind from the wildfire region of SE Australia with drastic underestimates of UT CO plumes. Although CloudSat along-track ice-water content curtains are examined to see whether possible vertical convection events can explain the high UT CO values, sparse observations of collocated Aura CO and CloudSat along-track ice-water content measurements for the single event precludes any conclusive correlation. Vertical convection that uplifts the fire-induced CO (i.e., most notably referred to as pyro-cumulonimbus (pyroCb)) may provide an explanation for the incongruence between these simulations and the TES/MLS observations of enhanced CO in the UT.

The majority of phenological studies have focused on extracting critical points in the seasonal growth cycle, without exploiting the full temporal detail. The high degree of phenological variability between years demonstrates the necessity of distinguishing long-term phenological change from temporal variability. Here, we demonstrate the phenological change detection ability of a method for detecting change within time series. BFAST, Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend, integrates the decomposition of time series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components with methods for detecting change. We tested BFAST by simulating 16-day NDVI time series with varying amounts of seasonal amplitude and noise, containing abrupt disturbances (e.g. fires) and long-term phenological changes. This revealed that the method is able to detect the timing of phenological changes within time series while accounting for abrupt disturbances and noise. Results showed that the phenological change detection is influenced by the signal-to-noise ratio of the time series. Between different land cover types the seasonal amplitude varies and determines the signal-to-noise ratio, and as such the capacity to differentiate phenological changes from noise. Application of the method on 16-day NDVI MODIS images from 2000 until 2009 for a forested study area in south eastern Australia confirmed these results. It was shown that a minimum seasonal amplitude of 0.1 NDVI is required to detect phenological change within cleaned MODIS NDVI time series using the quality flags. BFAST identifies phenological change independent of phenological metrics by exploiting the full time series. The method is globally applicable since it analyzes each pixel individually without the setting of thresholds to detect change within a time series. Longterm phenological changes can be detected within NDVI time series of a large range of land cover types (e.g. grassland, woodlands and deciduous forests) having a seasonal amplitude larger than the noise level. The method can be applied to any time series data and it is not necessarily limited to NDVI. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Despite the vast details, the usefulness of the wetland InSAR observations is rather limited, because hydrologists and water resources managers need information on absolute water level values and not on relative water level changes. We present an InSAR technique called Small Temporal Baseline Subset (STBAS) for monitoring absolute water level time series using radar interferograms acquired successively over wetlands. The method uses stage (water level) observation for calibrating the relative InSAR observations and tying them to the stage\'s vertical datum. We tested the STBAS technique with two-year long Radarsat-1 data acquired during 2006-2008 over the Water Conservation Area 1 (WCA1) in the Everglades wetlands, south Florida (USA). The InSAR-derived water level data were calibrated using 13 stage stations located in the study area to generate 28 successive high spatial resolution maps (50 m pixel resolution) of absolute water levels. We evaluate the quality of the STBAS technique using a root mean square error (RMSE) criterion of the difference between InSAR observations and stage measurements. The average RMSE is 6.6 cm, which provides an uncertainty estimation of the STBAS technique to monitor absolute water levels. About half of the uncertainties are attributed to the accuracy of the InSAR technique to detect relative water levels. The other half reflects uncertainties derived from tying the relative levels to the stage stations\' datum. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The retrieval accuracies of the semi-analytical models were compared to those returned by optimally calibrated empirical band-ratio algorithms. The best-performing algorithm for the retrieval of Chl a was an empirical band-ratio model based on a quadratic function of the ratio of reflectance at 710 and 670 nm (R-2 = 0.832; RMSE =29.8%). However, this model only provided a marginally better retrieval than the best semi-analytical algorithm. The best-performing model for the retrieval of C-PC was a semi-analytical nested band-ratio model (R-2 = 0.984; RMSE = 3.98 mg m(-3)). The concentrations of C-PC retrieved using the semi-analytical model were correlated with cyanobacterial cell numbers (R-2 = 0.380) and the particulate and total (particulate plus dissolved) pools of microcystins (R-2 = 0.858 and 0.896 respectively). Importantly, both the empirical and semi-analytical algorithms were able to retrieve the concentration of C-PC at cyanobacterial cell concentrations below current warning thresholds for cyanobacteria in waterbodies. This demonstrates the potential of remote sensing to contribute to early-warning detection and monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms for human health protection at regional and global scales.

Current surface radiation budget products have fine temporal resolutions, but only coarse spatial resolutions that are not suitable for land applications. A hybrid algorithm was developed in this study to estimate S-n from MODIS data under both clear and cloudy sky conditions without requiring coarser resolution ancillary data. This algorithm was validated using ground measurements at seven sites of the SURFace RADiation budget observing network (SURFRAD) in the United States. Instantaneous S-n estimated by this method was also compared with GEWEX/SRB and ISCCP data, and other methods. The results indicate that our algorithm can produce S-n at 1-km resolution with improved accuracy and is easily implemented to generate operational global products. Daily integrated S-n is estimated at 1-km resolution using instantaneous S-n. These finer spatial resolution datasets capture the specific sequence of the redistribution of the available energy at the Earth\'s surface. Therefore, they support recent high resolution land surface models. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Kim, Hye-Yun; Liang, Shunlin] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

In Canada, few accuracy assessments have been undertaken to compare the accuracy of the dNBR algorithm to its relative form (RdNBR). To investigate the accuracies of these two algorithms in Canada\'s National Parks, we hypothesized that RdNBR would outperform dNBR in two specific applications based on former research by Miller and Thode (2007) The first was the capacity of the RdNBR to produce more accurate results than dNBR over a wide range of fires and secondly in pre-fire landscapes with low canopy closure and high heterogeneity. To investigate these questions, dNBR and RdNBR indices were extracted from Landsat imagery and compared to the measurements of the Composite Burn Index (Key & Benson, 2006). Following this, best fit models were developed and statistically tested at the individual, regional, overall, and vegetative levels We then developed confusion matrices to assess the relative strength and weakness of each model. As an additional means of comparing model accuracy, we tested Hall et al \'s (2008) non-linear model in estimating burn severity for the study\'s western boreal region and individual fires The results indicate that across all fires, the RdNBR-derived model did not estimate burn severity more accurately than dNBR (65.2% versus 70.2% classification accuracy, respectively) nor in the heterogeneous and low canopy cover landscapes. In addition, we conclude that RdNBR is no more effective than dNBR at the regional, individual, and fine-scale vegetation levels. The Hall et al. (2008) model was found to estimate burn severity in the western boreal region with a higher overall kappa than both the dNBR and RdNBR study models The results herein support the continued research and pursuit of developing regional remote sensing derived models in western Canada.

We developed a light use efficiency model, called EC-LUE, driven by only four variables: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), air temperature, and the Bowen ratio of sensible to latent heat flux. The EC-LUE model may have the most potential to adequately address the spatial and temporal dynamics of GPP because its parameters (i.e., the potential light use efficiency and optimal plant growth temperature) are invariant across the various land cover types. However, the application of the previous EC-LUE model was hampered by poor prediction of Bowen ratio at the large spatial scale. In this study, we substituted the Bowen ratio with the ratio of evapotranspiration (ET) to net radiation, and revised the RS-PM (Remote Sensing-Penman Monteith) model for quantifying ET. Fifty-four eddy covariance towers, including various ecosystem types, were selected to calibrate and validate the revised RS-PM and EC-LUE models. The revised RS-PM model explained 82% and 68% of the observed variations of ET for all the calibration and validation sites, respectively. Using estimated ET as input, the EC-LUE model performed well in calibration and validation sites, explaining 75% and 61% of the observed GPP variation for calibration and validation sites respectively. Global patterns of ET and GPP at a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees latitude by 0.6 degrees longitude during the years 2000 2003 were determined using the global MERRA dataset (Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). The global estimates of ET and GPP agreed well with the other global models from the literature, with the highest ET and GPP over tropical forests and the lowest values in dry and high latitude areas. However, comparisons with observed GPP at eddy flux towers showed significant underestimation of ET and GPP due to lower net radiation of MERRA dataset. Applying a procedure to correct the systematic errors of global meteorological data would improve global estimates of GPP and ET. The revised RS-PM and EC-LUE models will provide the alternative approaches making it possible to map ET and GPP over large areas because (1) the model parameters are invariant across various land cover types and (2) all driving forces of the models may be derived from remote sensing data or existing climate observation networks.

Hybrid classifiers integrate results from multiple algorithms and often improve classification accuracy. In this paper, a hybrid classification framework was used to evaluate two research hypotheses: i) can manipulated results from prior classifiers (\"intermediate inputs\" (IIs)) improve classification accuracy in subsequent classification steps. and ii) is there an optimal dataset proportion for creation and usage of intermediate inputs. These additional intermediate inputs were based on spatial and texture statistics calculated on a partially classified image. The implementation of intermediate inputs on an impervious surface classification task using a 2001 Landsat ETM+ image from central New York was demonstrated. The results suggested that there was an average accuracy improvement of 3.6% (maximum 6.6%) by using intermediate inputs. These improvements were proved statistically significant by a Z-test and tended to increase as classification difficulty increased. The experiments in this paper also showed that there was an optimal point that balanced the number of pixels and pixel classification accuracy from prior steps used to produce intermediate inputs. Additionally, some traditional problems such as separation of impervious surfaces and soil were successfully tackled through intermediate inputs. The concept of the intermediate inputs may easily apply to other sensors and/or ground features. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Another type of approach which is becoming very popular in atmospheric correction over water is based on the simultaneous retrieval of atmospheric and water parameters through the inversion of coupled atmospheric and bio-optical water models. Both types of approaches may lead to substantial errors over optically-complex water bodies, such as case 11 waters, in which a wide range of temporal and spatial variations in the concentration of water constituents is expected. This causes the water reflectance in the near-infrared to be non-negligible, and that the water reflectance response under extreme values of the water constituents cannot be described by the assumed bio-optical models. As an alternative to these methods. the SCAPE-M atmospheric processor is proposed in this paper for the automatic atmospheric correction of ENVISAT/MERIS data over inland waters. A-priori assumptions on the water composition and its spectral response are avoided by SCAPE-M by calculating reflectance of close-to-land water pixels through spatial extension of atmospheric parameters derived over neighboring land pixels. This approach is supported by the results obtained from the validation of SCAPE-M over a number of European inland water validation sites which is presented in this work. MERIS-derived aerosol optical thickness, water reflectance and water pigments are compared to in-situ data acquired concurrently to MERIS images in 20 validation match-ups. SCAPE-M has also been compared to specific processors designed for the retrieval of take water constituents from MERIS data. The performance of SCAPE-M to reproduce ground-based measurements under a range of water types and the ability of MERIS data to monitor chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin pigments using semiempirical algorithms after SCAPE-M processing are discussed. It has been found that SCAPE-M is able to provide high accurate water reflectance over turbid waters, outperforming models based on site-specific bio-optical models, although problems of SCAPE-M to cope with clear waters in some cases have also been identified.

Change detection methods are often not capable of detecting land cover changes within time series that are heavily influenced by seasonal climatic variations. Detecting change within the trend and seasonal components of time series enables the classification of different types of changes. Changes occurring in the trend component often indicate disturbances (e.g. fires, insect attacks), while changes occurring in the seasonal component indicate phenological changes (e.g. change in land cover type). A generic change detection approach is proposed for time series by detecting and characterizing Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST). BFAST integrates the decomposition of time series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components with methods for detecting change within time series. BFAST iteratively estimates the time and number of changes, and characterizes change by its magnitude and direction. We tested BFAST by simulating 16-day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series with varying amounts of seasonality and noise, and by adding abrupt changes at different times and magnitudes. This revealed that BFAST can robustly detect change with different magnitudes (> 0.1 NDVI) within time series with different noise levels (0.01-0.07 sigma) and seasonal amplitudes (0.1-0.5 NDVI). Additionally, BFAST was applied to 16-day NDVI Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) composites for a forested study area in south eastern Australia. This showed that BFAST is able to detect and characterize spatial and temporal changes in a forested landscape. BFAST is not specific to a particular data type and can be applied to time series without the need to normalize for land cover types, select a reference period, or change trajectory.

Since 2003 work has been proceeding with the reinforcement and extension of the existing jetties and the construction of breakwaters, harbors, and a small island within the Lido inlet. We detected significant local settlements of a few centimeters between March 2008 and January 2009 at the three inlets induced by the construction works through an interferometric analysis of 30 satellite radar images acquired by the new German TerraSAR-X mission.

Previous studies have discussed that the self-organizing map (SOM) can provide a promising alternative to the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks for image classification at both per-pixel and sub-pixel level. However, the performances of SOM and MLP have not been compared in the estimation and mapping of urban impervious surfaces. In mid-latitude areas, plant phenology has a significant influence on remote sensing of the environment. When the neural networks approaches are applied, how satellite images acquired in different seasons impact impervious surface estimation of various urban surfaces (such as commercial, residential, and suburban/rural areas) remains to be answered. In this paper, an SOM and an MLP neural network were applied to three ASTER images acquired on April 5, 2004, June 16, 2001, and October 3, 2000, respectively, which covered Marion County, Indiana, United States. Six impervious surface maps were yielded, and an accuracy assessment was performed. The root mean square error (RMSE), the mean average error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (R-2) were calculated to indicate the accuracy of impervious surface maps. The results indicated that the SOM can generate a slightly better estimation of impervious surfaces than the MLP. Moreover, the results from three test areas showed that, in the residential areas, more accurate results were yielded by the SOM, which indicates that the SOM was more effective in coping with the mixed pixels than the MLP. because the residential area prevailed with mixed pixels. Results obtained from the commercial area possessed very high RMSE values due to the prevalence of shade, which indicates that both algorithms cannot handle the shade problem well. The lowest RMSE value was obtained from the rural area due to containing of less mixed pixels and shade. This research supports previous observations that the SOM can provide a promising alternative to the MLP neural network. This study also found that the impact of different map sizes on the impervious surface estimation is significant. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We aim to further explore the capability of discrete-return lidar for estimating LAI over a pine-dominated forest in East Texas, with a secondary goal to compare the lidar-derived LAI map and the GLOBCARBON moderate-resolution satellite LAI product. Specific problems we addressed include (1) evaluating the effects of analysts and algorithms on in-situ LAI estimates from hemispherical photographs (hemiphoto), (2) examining the effectiveness of various lidar metrics, including laser penetration, canopy height and foliage density metrics, to predict LAI, (3) assessing the utility of integrating Quickbird multispectral imagery with lidar for improving the LAI estimate accuracy, and (4) developing a scheme to co-register the lidar and satellite LAI maps and evaluating the consistency between them. Results show that the use of different analysts or algorithms in analyzing hemiphotos caused an average uncertainty of 0.35 in in-situ LAI, and that several laser penetration metrics in logarithm models were more effective than other lidar metrics, with the best one explaining 84% of the variation in the in-situ LAI (RMSE = 0.29 LAI). The selection of plot size and height threshold in calculating laser penetration metrics greatly affected the effectiveness of these metrics. The combined use of NDVI and lidar metrics did not significantly improve estimation over the use of lidar alone. We also found that mis-registration could induce a large artificial discrepancy into the pixelwise comparison between the coarse-resolution satellite and fine-resolution lidar-derived LAI maps. By compensating for a systematic sub-pixel shift error, the correlation between two maps increased from 0.08 to 0.85 for pines (n = 24 pixels). However, the absolute differences between the two LAI maps still remained large due to the inaccuracy in accounting for clumping effects. Overall, our findings imply that lidar offers a superior tool for mapping LAI at local to regional scales as compared to optical remote sensing, accuracies of lidar-estimate LAI are affected not only by the choice of models but also by the absolute accuracy of in-situ reference LAI used for model calibration, and lidar-derived LAI maps can serve as reliable references for validating moderate-resolution satellite LAI products over large areas.

Long-term climate variability is expected to lead to increases in both the magnitude and distribution of disturbances. As a consequence it is important to develop monitoring systems to better understand these changes in the terrestrial biosphere as well to inform managers about disturbance agents more typically captured through specific monitoring programs (such as focused on insect. fire, or agricultural conditions). Changes in the condition, composition and distribution pattern of vegetation can lead to changes in the spectral and thermal signature of the land surface. Using a 6-year time series of MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data we apply a previously proposed Disturbance Index (DI) which has been shown to be sensitive to both continuous and discontinuous change. Using Canada as an example area, we demonstrate the capacity of this Disturbance Index to monitor land dynamics over time. As expected, our results confirm a significant relationship between area flagged as disturbed by the index and area burnt as estimated from other satellite sources (R(2)=0.78, p<0.0001). The DI also demonstrates a sensitivity to capture and depict changes related to insect infestations. Further, on a regional basis the DI produces change information matching measured wide-area moisture conditions (i.e., drought) and corresponding agricultural outputs. These findings indicate that for monitoring a large area, such as Canada, the time series based DI is a useful tool to aid in change detection and national monitoring activities.

For the identification, mapping, and quantification of such changes on various scales up to the entire circum-Arctic, remote sensing and spatial data analysis are essential tools. In this study an extensive field-work dataset including spectral surface properties, vegetation, soils, and geomorphology was acquired in the largest Arctic delta formed by a single river, the Siberian Lena River Delta. A portable field spectrometer (ASD FieldSpec Pro FR (R)) was used for spectral surveys of terrain surfaces, and optical satellite data (Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+), CHRIS-Proba) were used for the characterization, manual mapping, and automatic classification of typical periglacial land-cover units in the Lena Delta. Qualitative data from soils, vegetation, soil moisture. and relief units were correlated with the field-spectral data and catalogued for a wide variety of surface types. The wide range of micro- and mesoscale variations of periglacial surface features in the delta results in distinctive spectral characteristics for different land-cover units. The three main delta terraces could also be spectrally separated and characterized. The present dataset provides a basis for further spectral data acquisitions in the Lena Delta and for comparisons with periglacial surfaces from other regions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Expediting the rate of seafloor mapping requires the collection of multi-use datasets that concurrently address hydrographic charting needs and support decision-making in ecosystem-based management. While active optical and acoustic sensors have previously been compared for the purpose of hydrographic charting, few studies have evaluated the performance and cost effectiveness of these systems for providing benthic habitat maps. Bathymetric and intensity data were collected in shallow water (<50 m depth) coral reef ecosystems using two conventional remote sensing technologies: (1) airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and (2) ship-based multibeam (MBES) Sound Navigation and Ranging (SoNAR). A comparative assessment using a suite of twelve metrics demonstrated that LiDAR and MBES were equally capable of discriminating seafloor topography (r = >0.9), although LiDAR depths were found to be consistently shallower than MBES depths. The intensity datasets were not significantly correlated at a broad 4 x 5 km spatial scale (r = -0.11), but were moderately correlated in flat areas at a fine 4 x 500 m spatial scale (r = 0.51), indicating that the LiDAR intensity algorithm needs to be improved before LiDAR intensity surfaces can be used for habitat mapping. LiDAR cost 6.6% less than MBES and required 40 fewer hours to map the same study area. MBES provided more detail about the seafloor by fully ensonifying high-relief features, by differentiating between fine and coarse sediments and by collecting data with higher spatial resolutions. Surface fractal dimensions and fast Fourier transformations emerged as useful methods for detecting artifacts in the datasets. Overall, LiDAR provided a more cost effective alternative to MBES for mapping and monitoring shallow water coral reef ecosystems (<50 m depth), although the unique advantages of MBES may make it a more appropriate choice for answering certain ecological or geological questions requiring very high resolution data.

Traditional nearest neighbor imputation can preserve between-variable consistency within a unit, but not between geographically nearby units. The lack of spatial consistency may cause problems when data are used for purposes of forestry planning or scenario analysis. In spatially consistent nearest neighbor imputation, adjacent units are considered in the estimation. The first step of the method is a k-Nearest Neighbor imputation. Secondly, based on the initial imputation an optimization algorithm, Simulated Annealing, is applied in order to reach certain spatial variation targets. The proposed method was tested in a case study where tree stem volume data were imputed to each unit (pixel) of forest stands, using satellite digital numbers as carrier data. The spatial variation measures used were between-pixel correlation and short-range variance. In addition. accuracy of the estimated stand level mean volume was used as a target in order to avoid drifts in mean volume during the optimization. The method was successful in three out of four stands where it resulted in imputations corresponding exactly to the target spatial variation measures. In the fourth stand it was not possible to find an exact solution. However, in this case the two spatial variation targets were reached whereas the mean stem volume was slightly overestimated (stem volume of 375 m(3) ha(-1) rather than 336 m(3) ha(-1)).

Fire severity, defined as the degree to which a site has been altered, is often the variable mapped. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) used in an absolute difference change detection protocol (dNBR), has become the remote sensing method of choice for US Federal land management agencies to map fire severity due to wildland fire. However, absolute differenced vegetation indices are correlated to the pre-fire chlorophyll content of the vegetation occurring within the fire perimeter. Normalizing dNBR to produce a relativized dNBR (RdNBR) removes the biasing effect of the pre-fire condition. Employing RdNBR hypothetically allows creating categorical classifications using the same thresholds for fires occurring in similar vegetation types without acquiring additional calibration field data on each fire. In this paper we tested this hypothesis by developing thresholds on random training datasets, and then comparing accuracies for (1) fires that occurred within the same geographic region as the training dataset and in similar vegetation, and (2) fires from a different geographic region that is climatically and floristically similar to the training dataset region but supports more complex vegetation structure. We additionally compared map accuracies for three measures of fire severity: the composite burn index (CBI), percent change in tree canopy cover, and percent change in tree basal area. User\'s and producer\'s accuracies were highest for the most severe categories, ranging from 70.7% to 89.1%. Accuracies of the moderate fire severity category for measures describing effects only to trees (percent change in canopy cover and basal area) indicated that the classifications were generally not much better than random. Accuracies of the moderate category for the CBI classifications were somewhat better, averaging in the 50%-60% range. These results underscore the difficulty in isolating fire effects to individual vegetation strata when fire effects are mixed. We conclude that the models presented here and in Miller and Thode ([Miller, J.D. & Thode, A.E., (2007). Quantifying burn severity in a heterogeneous landscape with a relative version of the delta Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR). Remote Sensing of Environment, 109, 66-80.]) can produce fire severity classifications (using either CBI, or percent change in canopy cover or basal area) that are of similar accuracy in fires not used in the original calibration process, at least in conifer dominated vegetation types in Mediterranean-climate California.

The four models compared are based on: i) a canopy-to-total first returns ratio (FCLiDAR(FR)) method; ii) a canopy-to-total returns ratio (FCLiDAR(RR)); iii) an intensity return ratio (FCLiDAR(IR)): and iv) a Beer\'s Law modified (two-way transmission loss) intensity return ratio (FCLiDAR(BL)). It is found that for the entire dataset, the FCLiDAR(RR) model demonstrates the lowest overall predictive capability of overhead FC (annulus rings 1-4) (r(2)=0.70), with a slight improvement for the FCLiDAR(FR) model (r(2)=0.74). The intensity-based FCLiDAR(IR) model displays the best results (r(2)=0.78). However, the FCLiDAR(BL) model is considered generally more useful (r(2)=0.75) because the associated line of best fit passes through the origin, has a slope near unity and produces a mean estimate of FCHP within 5%. Therefore, FCLiDAR(BL) requires the least calibration across a broad range of forest cover types. The FCLiDAR(FR) and FCLiDAR(RR) models. on the other hand, were found to be sensitive to variations in both canopy height and sensor pulse repetition frequency (or pulse power); i.e. changing the repetition frequency led to a systematic shift of up to 11% in the mean FCLiDAR(RR) estimates while it had no effect on the intensity-based FCLiDAR(IR) or FCLiDAR(BL) models. While the intensity-based models were generally more robust, all four models displayed at least some sensitivity to variations in canopy structural class, suggesting that some calibration of FCLiDAR might be necessary regardless of the model used. Short (<2 m tall) or open canopy forest plots posed the greatest challenge to accurate FC estimation regardless of the model used. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Progress in using remote sensing together with field data for the development of robust habitat suitability models has been more modest. In this paper, we present a habitat suitability model developed by relating field data on habitat characteristics and habitat selection of a medium-sized primate (redtail monkey, Cercopithecus ascanius) with a small home range (in contrast to many studies that focus on large-bodied, wide-ranging animals) to satellite-derived data, for predicting animal occurrence. We examined the relative performance of two high-resolution satellite sensors (2.5 m resolution Quickbird and 30 m resolution Landsat ETM+) in capturing patterns of habitat selection by redtail monkeys in Kibale National Park. Overall, our analyses suggest that a model combining data from both the Quickbird and ETM+ sensors predicts monkey presence-absence best, and that, individually, ETM+ data are better predictors than Quickbird data. Moreover, model fit was best at larger scales (ETM+ 120 m, 150 m and 240 m pixels). These results have important implications for future habitat modeling, biodiversity analyses and conservation studies given Landsat\'s temporal and spatial resolutions, long history of use, relatively well-developed methods for processing and analysis, and relatively low cost in comparison with many higher resolution sensors.

Towards this end, we describe the integrated and individual capabilities of waveform lidar and hyperspectral data to estimate three common forest measurements - basal area (BA), above-ground biomass (AGBM) and quadratic mean stem diameter (QMSD) - in a northern temperate mixed conifer and deciduous forest. The use of this data to discriminate distribution and abundance patterns of five common and often, dominant tree species was also explored. Waveform lidar imagery was acquired in July 2003 over the 1000 ha. Bartlett Experimental Forest (BEF) in central New Hampshire (USA) using NASA\'s airborne Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS). High spectral resolution imagery was likewise acquired in August 2003 using NASA\'s Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). Field data (2001-2003) from over 400 US Forest Service Northern Research Station (USFS NRS) plots were used to determine actual site conditions.   Results suggest that the integrated data sets of hyperspectral and waveform lidar provide improved outcomes over use of either data set alone in evaluating common forest metrics. Across all forest conditions, 8-9% more of the variation in AGBM, BA, and QMSD was explained by use of the integrated sensor data in comparison to either AVIRIS or LVIS metrics applied singly, with estimated error 5-8% lower for these variables. Notably, in an analysis using integrated data limited to unmanaged forest tracts, AGBM coefficients of determination improved by 25% or more, while corresponding error levels decreased by over 25%. When data were restricted based on the presence of individual tree species within plots, AVIRIS data alone best predicted species-specific patterns of abundance as determined by species fraction of biomass. Nonetheless, use of LVIS and AVIRIS data - in tandem - produced complementary maps of estimated abundance and structure for individual tree species, providing a promising adjunct to traditional forest inventory and conservation biology planning efforts.

Erroneously high phytoplankton absorption coefficients, measured at short wavelengths using the filter technique suggested that this particle-bound DOM is removed along with phytoplankton pigments. during bleaching by sodium hypochlorite and as such is mistakenly incorporated into the phytoplankton absorption signal.

Inspection of these anomalous areas with multi-resolution data from Landsat, Ikonos, aerial photography, and ancillary data revealed a range of causes for the NDVI increases: climatic influences; severe drought and subsequent recovery; irrigated agriculture expansion; insect outbreaks followed by logging and subsequent regeneration; and forest fires with subsequent regeneration. Vegetation in areas in the high Northern Latitudes appear to be solely impacted by climatic influences. In other areas examined, the impact of anthropogenic effects is more direct. The pattern of NDVI anomalies over longer time periods appear to be driven by long-term climate change but most appear to be associated with climate variability on decadal and shorter time scales along with direct anthropogenic land cover conversions. The local variability of drivers of change demonstrates the difficulty in interpreting changes in NDVI and indicates the complex nature of changes in the carbon cycle within North America. Coarse scale analysis of changes could well fail to identify the important local scale drivers controlling the carbon cycle and to identify the relative roles of disturbance and climate change. Our results document regional land cover land use change and climatic influences that have altered continental scale vegetation dynamics in North America.

There is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena are completely understood and thus the capacity to handle scale is beneficial to methodological frameworks for analyzing and monitoring ecosystems. Although satellite imagery has been widely applied for the assessment of fire related topics, there are few studies that consider fire at several spatial scales simultaneously. This research explores the relationships between fire occurrence and several families of environmental factors at different spatial observation scales by means of classification and regression tree models. Predictors accounting for vegetation status (estimated by spectral indices derived from Landsat imagery), fire history, topography, accessibility and vegetation types were included in the models of fire occurrence probability. We defined four scales of analysis by identifying four meaningful thresholds related to fire sizes in the study site. Sampling methodology was based on random points and the power-law distribution describing the local fire regime. The observation scale drastically affected tree size, and therefore the achieved level of detail, and the most explanatory variables in the trees. As a general trend, trees considering all the variables showed a spectral index ruling the most explicative split. According to the comparison of the four pre-determined analysis scales, we propose the existence of three eventual organization levels: landscape patch or ecosystem level, local level and the basic level, the most heterogeneous and complex scale. Rules with three levels of complexity and applicability for management were defined in the tree models: (i) the repeated critical thresholds (predictor values across which fire characteristics change rapidly), (ii) the meaningful final probability classes and (iii) the trees themselves.

Recent progress in separating soil and canopy temperatures from dual angle composite radiometric temperature measurements has encouraged the development of two-source (soil and canopy) approaches to estimating surface energy fluxes given observations of component soil and canopy temperatures. A Simplified Two-Source Energy Balance (STSEB) model has been developed using a \"patch\" treatment of the surface flux sources, which does not allow interaction between the soil and vegetation canopy components. A simple algorithm to predict the net radiation partitioning between the soil and vegetation is introduced as part of the STSEB patch modelling scheme. The feasibility of the STSEB approach under a full range in fractional vegetation cover conditions is explored using data collected over a maize (corn) crop in Beltsville Maryland, USA during the 2004 summer growing season. Measurements of soil and canopy component temperatures as well as the effective composite temperature were collected over the course of the growing season from crop emergence to cob development. Comparison with tower flux measurements yielded root-mean-square-difference values between 15 and 50 W m(-2) for the retrieval of the net radiation, soil, sensible and latent heat fluxes. A detailed sensitivity analysis of the STSEB approach to typical uncertainties in the required inputs was also conducted indicating greatest model sensitivity to soil and canopy temperature uncertainties with relative errors reaching similar to 30% in latent heat flux estimates. With algorithms proposed to infer component temperatures from bi-angular satellite observations, the STSEB model has the capability of being applied operationally. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) holds considerable promise for detailed, large-area crop-related LULC mapping in this region given its global coverage, unique combination of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, and the cost-free status of its data. The objective of this research was to evaluate the applicability of time-series MODIS 250 in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data for large-area crop-related LULC mapping over the U.S. Central Great Plains. A hierarchical crop mapping protocol, which applied a decision tree classifier to multi-temporal NDVI data collected over the growing season, was tested for the state of Kansas. The hierarchical classification approach produced a series of four crop-related LULC maps that progressively classified: 1) crop/non-crop, 2) general crop types (alfalfa, summer crops, winter wheat, and fallow), 3) specific summer crop types (corn, sorghum, and soybeans), and 4) irrigated/non-irrigated crops. A series of quantitative and qualitative assessments were made at the state and sub-state levels to evaluate the overall map quality and highlight areas of misclassification for each map.   The series of MODIS NDVI-derived crop maps generally had classification accuracies greater than 80%. Overall accuracies ranged from 94% for the general crop map to 84% for the summer crop map. The state-level crop patterns classified in the maps were consistent with the general cropping patterns across Kansas. The classified crop areas were usually within 1-5% of the USDA reported crop area for most classes. Sub-state comparisons found the areal discrepancies for most classes to be relatively minor throughout the state. In eastern Kansas, some small cropland areas could not be resolved at MODIS\' 250 in resolution and led to an underclassification of cropland in the crop/non-crop map, which was propagated to the subsequent crop classifications. Notable regional areal differences in crop area were also found for a few selected crop classes and locations that were related to climate factors (i.e., omission of marginal, dryland cropped areas and the underclassification of irrigated crops in western Kansas), localized precipitation patterns (overclassification of irrigated crops in northeast Kansas), and specific cropping practices (double cropping in southeast Kansas).

The Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer (PSR)-based remotely sensed surface (similar to 0-5 cm) soil moisture at 800 m x 800 m resolution was used in this study. Wavelet-based multiresolution technique decomposed the soil moisture into large-scale mean soil moisture fields and fluctuations in horizontal, diagonal, and vertical directions at hierarchical spatial resolutions. Results suggested linearity in the log-log dependency of the variance of soil moisture up to a resolution of 6400 m x 6400 m on PSR sampling dates during SMEX02. The wet fields (with high soil moisture) show almost similar variance for all the resolutions signifying the strong spatial correlation. Analysis of the dry fields (with low soil moisture) indicated a log-log linearity of moments with various scales, and the slopes of these relationships exhibit a concave functional form with the order of moments, typically representing a multiscaling process. The scaling exponent of soil moisture during dry-down suggests a transition from simple scaling (in wet fields) to multiscaling (in dry fields) behavior. The fluctuation components of multiresolution analysis in the horizontal, diagonal, and vertical directions for dry and wet fields exhibited self-similarity. Another important finding of this study is the increase of subpixel soil moisture variability with increasing resolution, especially for the wet fields. These findings will help develop appropriate up-and down-scaling schemes of remotely sensed soil moisture data for various hydrologic and environmental modeling applications. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The first approach involved filtering backscatter for input to a retrieval model that was compared against field measures of soil moisture. The second approach involved spatially averaging raw and filtered imagery in an image-based statistical technique to determine the best scale for site-specific soil moisture retrieval. Field soil moisture was measured at 1225 m(2) sites in three watersheds commensurate with 7 m resolution Radarsat image acquisition. Analysis of speckle reducing block median filters indicated that 5 x 5 filter level was the optimum for watershed averaged estimates of soil moisture. However, median filtering alone did not provide acceptable accuracy for soil moisture retrieval on a site-specific basis. Therefore, spatial averaging of unfiltered and median filtered power values was used to generate backscatter estimates with known confidence for soil moisture retrieval. This combined approach of filtering and averaging was demonstrated at watersheds located in Arizona (AZ), Oklahoma (OK) and Georgia (GA). The optimum ground resolution for AZ, OK and GA study areas was 162 m, 310 m, and 1131 m respectively obtained with unfiltered imagery. This statistical approach does not rely on ground verification of soil moisture for validation and only requires a satellite image and average roughness parameters of the site. When applied at other locations, the resulting optimum ground resolution will depend on the spatial distribution of land surface features that affect radar backscatter. This work offers insight into the accuracy of soil moisture retrieval, and an operational approach to determine the optimal spatial resolution for the required application accuracy.

In order to assess the accuracy with which satellite-derived snow extent datasets capture the dynamic melt period (1 April-31 July), SCD datasets derived from the weekly NOAA snow chart record (1979-2004), daily IMS product (2000-2004), passive microwave (PMW) brightness temperatures (1979-2004), and Ku-band QuikSCAT scatterometer data (2000-2004) were assessed against in situ measurements across the Canadian Arctic (north of 60 degrees). The higher resolution IMS and QSCAT datasets showed the best ability to capture spatial variability in spring SCD over the Canadian Arctic, followed by the NOAA and PMW datasets. The poorer performance of the PMW was anticipated because of documented difficulties monitoring snow cover over forested and mountainous terrain. Both the IMS and the NOAA datasets exhibited positive biases of similar to 22-26 days which can be related to elevation effects and frequent cloud cover. The NOAA dataset was unable to capture interannual variability in spring snow cover over the central Canadian Arctic tundra region (66-74 degrees N, 80-120 degrees W) while the PMW was able to capture a significant fraction of the observed variability. This fact, combined with anomalous snow-cover temperature responses in the NOAA data further reinforces the conclusions of Wang et al.

QuikSCAT data were able to provide comparable results to IMS over the 2000-2004 period, indicating that Ku-band scatterometer measurements can make an important contribution to monitoring terrestrial snow extent during spring melt.

Snow and sea ice related products derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used for comparison. Retrieved seasonal variations of snow and sea ice cover extents were consistent with the MODIS and AMSR products. GLI derived snow surface temperatures were also correlated with the MODIS surface temperatures and exhibited latitudinal dependence over the northern hemisphere. Retrieved snow impurities were considered to be partly inaccurate over the Arctic sea ice in April and over inland areas of the continents possibly due to thin snow and/or dense vegetation. However, the snow cover around the northern Canadian Arctic tundra and Archipelago regions and the Greenland ice sheet in April to June was found to be very clean with a soot-equivalent impurity fraction of around 0.05 ppmw or less. Thus, these areas can be used as reference sites for monitoring pollution levels of the Arctic snow cover. Retrieved snow grain radii in the shallow layer seemed erroneous over thin snow covers, but indicated drastic spatial and seasonal evolution of the snow cover over the northern hemisphere with radius ranging from 50 mu m to over 1000 mu m synchronized with variations in surface temperature. The spatial variability of the top surface grain radius was partly different from that of the grain size in the shallow layer suggesting the possibility of detecting vertical inhomogeneity of the top 10 cm of the snow cover.

Endmembers with distinct spectral features (high spectral contrast) are easy to select, whereas those with minimal unique spectral information (low spectral contrast) are more problematic. Spectral contrast, however, is dependent on the endmember assemblage, such that as the assemblage changes so does the \"relative\" spectral contrast of each endmember to all other endmembers. It is then possible for an endmember to have low spectral contrast with respect to the full image, but have high spectral contrast within a subset of the image. The spatial-spectral endmember extraction tool (SSEE) works by analyzing a scene in parts (subsets), such that we increase the spectral contrast of low contrast endmembers, thus improving the potential for these endmembers to be selected. The SSEE method comprises three main steps: 1) application of singular value decomposition (SVD) to determine a set of basis vectors that describe most of the spectral variance for subsets of the image; 2) projection of the full image data set onto the locally defined basis vectors to determine a set of candidate endmember pixels; and, 3) imposing spatial constraints for averaging spectrally similar endmembers, allowing for separation of endmembers that are spectrally similar, but spatially independent. The SSEE method is applied to two real hyperspectral data sets to demonstrate the effects of imposing spatial constraints on the selection of endmembers. The results show that the SSEE method is an effective approach to extracting image endmembers. Specific improvements include the extraction of physically meaningful, low contrast endmembers that occupy unique image regions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

These factors modify the heat balance at the land surface and eventually raise the atmospheric temperature. It is important to quantify the surface heat balance in order to estimate the contributions of these factors. The present authors propose the use of storage heat flux to represent the heat flux between the land surface and the inside of the canopy for the heat balance analysis based on satellite remote sensing data. Surface heat fluxes were estimated around the city of Nagoya, Japan using Terra ASTER data and meteorological data. Seasonal and day-night differences in heat balance were compared using ASTER data acquired in the daytime on July 10, 2000, and January 2, 2004 and in the nighttime on September 26, 2003. In the central business and commercial districts, the storage heat flux was higher than those in the surrounding residential areas. In particular, in winter, the storage heat flux in the central urban area was 240 to 290 W m(-2), which was much larger than the storage heat fluxes in residential areas, which ranged from 180 to 220 W m(-2). Moreover, the negative storage heat flux in the central urban area was greater at night. This tendency implies that the urban surface stores heat during the daytime and discharges it at night. Extremely large negative storage heat flux occurred primarily in the industrial areas for both daytime and nighttime as a result of the enormous energy consumption by factories. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

However, the processes of infiltration, runoff, and evapotranspiration in the vadose zone of the soil are not easy to quantify or predict because of the difficulty in accurately representing soil texture and hydraulic properties in land surface models. This study approaches the problem of parameterizing soil properties from a unique perspective based on components originally developed for operational estimation of soil moisture for mobility assessments. Estimates of near-surface soil moisture derived from passive (L-band) microwave remote sensing were acquired on six dates during the Monsoon \'90 experiment in southeastern Arizona, and used to calibrate hydraulic properties in an offline land surface model and infer information on the soil conditions of the region. Specifically, a robust parameter estimation tool (PEST) was used to calibrate the Noah land surface model and run at very high spatial resolution across the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed. Errors in simulated versus observed soil moisture were minimized by adjusting the soil texture, which in turn controls the hydraulic properties through the use of pedotransfer functions. By estimating within a continuous range of widely applicable soil properties such as sand, silt, and clay percentages rather than applying rigid soil texture classes, lookup tables, or large parameter sets as in previous studies, the physical accuracy and consistency of the resulting soils could then be assessed. In addition, the sensitivity of this calibration method to the number and timing of microwave retrievals is determined in relation to the temporal patterns in precipitation and soil drying. The resultant soil properties were applied to an extended time period demonstrating the improvement in simulated soil moisture over that using default or county-level soil parameters. The methodology is also applied to an independent case at Walnut Gulch using a new soil moisture product from active (C-band) radar imagery with much lower spatial and temporal resolution. Overall, results demonstrate the potential to gain physically meaningful soil information using simple parameter estimation with few but appropriately timed remote sensing retrievals.

We expand on the novel approach used to develop SASI by proposing another index, the Angle at NIR (ANIR). We use laboratory and simulation datasets to validate the ability of SASI to estimate soil and vegetation moisture, and evaluate the advantage for using both SASI and ANIR as land-cover discrimination tools. Our results demonstrate that SASI is a good indicator of soil and vegetation moisture. ANIR shows promise in discriminating dry plant matter from soil and quantifying the amount of dry matter irrespective of changes in soil moisture or green vegetation. When SASI is combined with ANIR, discrimination between soil, dry plant matter, and low to high amounts of green vegetation is significantly improved. Angle indexes are an exciting new way to engineer indexes that contain valuable environmental information not accessible from other indexes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Satellite remote sensing data sets can be useful for quantifying habitat heterogeneity across a range of spatial scales. Past remote sensing analyses of species diversity have largely been limited to correlative studies based on the use of vegetation indices or derived land cover maps. A relatively new form of laser remote sensing (lidar) provides another means to acquire information on habitat heterogeneity. Here we examine the efficacy of lidar metrics of canopy structural diversity as predictors of bird species richness in the temperate forests of Maryland, USA. Canopy height, topography and the vertical distribution of canopy elements were derived from lidar imagery of the Patuxent National Wildlife Refuge and compared to bird survey data collected at referenced grid locations. The canopy vertical distribution information was consistently found to be the strongest predictor of species richness, and this was predicted best when stratified into guilds dominated by forest, scrub, suburban and wetland species. Similar lidar variables were selected as primary predictors across guilds. Generalized linear and additive models, as well as binary hierarchical regression trees produced similar results. The lidar metrics were also consistently better predictors than traditional remotely sensed variables such as canopy cover, indicating that lidar provides a valuable resource for biodiversity research applications.

The main outcomes of this assessment study are: i) the more complete, three-channel scheme seems to offer accurate ash detection and discrimination from meteorological clouds with a high level of reliability, better than traditional satellite schemes; ii) on the other hand, the simplified RAT configuration performs well in ash cloud monitoring and tracking, providing a better description of cloud characteristics and properties (e.g. size, shape, direction, etc.). Consequently, a specific protocol has been suggested and experimented, with both the two configuration schemes applied in cascade; it provides a first, accurate and reliable ash detection and discrimination and, after-wards, a more detailed description of the previously identified eruptive cloud, also in terms of its internal structure and density.

One challenge of remote sensing is to differentiate crop residues from bare soil and crop cover, especially when the residues have been weathered and/or when the crop cover phenology is more advanced. Several techniques for mapping and estimating crop residues exist in the literature. However, these methods are time consuming and not suited for quantitative evaluation. They have the disadvantage of being less rigorous and accurate because they do not consider the spectral mixture of different materials in the same pixel. In this study, the potential of hyperspectral (Probe-1) and multispectral high spatial resolution (IKONOS) data were compared for estimating and mapping crop residues on agricultural lands using the constrained linear spectral mixture analysis approach. Image data were spectrally and radiometrically calibrated, atmospherically corrected, as well as geometrically rectified. Pure spectral signatures of residues, bare soil and crop cover were manually extracted from image data based on prior knowledge of the fields. Percent (fraction) cover for each sampling point was extracted using unmixing and validated against ground reference measurements. The best results were achieved for the crop cover (index of agreement (D)=0.92 and root mean square error (RMSE)=0.09) adjusted for the impurity of the endmembers canola, pea and wheat, followed by the wheat residues (D=0.76 and RMSE=0.12). Considering only the wheat residues in fields with a canola crop, D increases to 0.86. The soil fractions were generally underestimated with D=0.72, and no significant improvements could be made after adjusting for the shadow effect. The estimations from the IKONOS data were poorer for the same cover types (residues: D=0.40 and RMSE=0.24; crop: D=0.51 and RMSE=0.38; soil: D=0.58 and RMSE=0.29). Relative to the IKONOS data, the better performance of the hyperspectral data is mainly due to the improved spectral band characteristics, especially in the SWIR, which is sensitive to the residues (lignin and cellulose absorption features), soil and crop cover.

Several studies have demonstrated, however, that gridding the land surface into coarse homogeneous pixels may cause important biases on ecosystem model estimations of water budget components at local, regional and global scales. These biases result from the overlook of sub-pixel variability of land surface characteristics. This study suggests a simple algorithm that uses sub-pixel information on the spatial variability of vegetation and soil cover, and surface topography to correct evapotranspiration (ET) estimates, made at coarse spatial resolutions where the land surface is considered as homogeneous within each pixel. The algorithm operates in such a way that the ET rates as obtained from calculations made at coarse spatial resolutions are multiplied by separate simple functions that attempt to reproduce the effects of sub-pixel variability of land cover, leaf area index, soil texture, and topography on ET. Its application to a remote sensing process-based model estimates made at a 1-km resolution over a watershed located in the southern part of the Canadian boreal forest improved estimates of average ET as well as its temporal and spatial variability.

Measuring the causes and consequences of these changes remains a challenge because of their fine spatial scale and complexity. Here, we measure long-term ecological changes, circa 1950 to 2002, within six 1 km(2) sites in densely populated rural China and in urban and suburban Baltimore, Maryland, USA using a standardized procedure for fine-scale feature-based ecological mapping from high spatial resolution (<= 1 in) imagery. The median size of ecologically distinct landscape features (ecotopes) mapped by this procedure was just 520 m(2), though size, count and perimeter of features varied considerably both within and between sites. Land management and vegetation cover changed substantially, over 28% to 87% of site areas, but most of this change occurred in small patches with area < 4000 m(2). Landscape complexity also increased over time by the fragmentation of landscapes into a larger number of smaller features with an increasing diversity of ecotope classes. Detailed analysis of fine-scale landscape transformations helped identify the causes and consequences of ecologically significant changes within and across sites, including unexpected increases in perennial vegetation cover and the linkage of impervious surface area with population density. These and other results demonstrate the general utility of anthropogenic ecotope mapping as a tool for cross-site comparison and sampled regional estimates of long-term ecological changes within densely populated landscapes.

Due to their economical and environmental importance, several models to simulate radiation transport and absorption by foliar tissues have been proposed in remote sensing and related fields. The main goal of this research is to present alternative modeling strategies for the investigation of these phenomena. These solutions consist in algorithmic models specifically designed to simulate the interaction of radiation with bifacial and unifacial plant leaves. Their flexible formulations based on standard Monte Carlo techniques make their implementation straightforward and allow their use in investigations involving different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum of radiation. In this paper, they are examined in the context of infrared applications. This choice is motivated by the simulation challenges posed by the processes that relate biophysical characteristics to optical properties of plant leaves in this domain. The accuracy and predictability of the proposed models have been evaluated through comparisons between modeled results and measured data. The results of these evaluations illustrate the applicability of the proposed models to investigations involving the predictive simulation of foliar spectral signatures. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The NDFI synthesizes information from several component fraction images derived from spectral mixture models. Interpretation of the NDFI data is facilitated by 4 contextual classification algorithm (CCA) that enables accurate mapping of logging and fire-derived canopy damages. The CCA utilizes detected log landings, which are the spatial signature of selective logging, as starting locations for searching the NDFI image for canopy damage. This process separates canopy changes due to logging and associated forest fires from those caused by other natural disturbances. These methods were tested in the Sinop region, in the Southern Brazilian Amazon. Forest transect inventories, conducted along a gradient of degraded forests, were used to evaluated the performance of the NDFI. The NDFI was more sensitive to canopy damage than any individual fraction and is shown to have the potential for further sub-classification of degradation levels in forest environments. Map accuracy of forest canopy damage using the CCA classifier, assessed with aerial videography images, was 94%. The proposed NDFI-CCA classifier approach can be fully automated and, therefore, holds great promise as a forest monitoring tool in tropical forests. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Lidar remote sensing has proven to be a valuable tool for measuring these attributes in many ecosystems, including tropical, boreal, and mid-latitude forests. However, there have been few studies in montane forests. Here, we examine the ability of a large footprint lidar system to retrieve forest structural attributes in the highly variable terrain and canopy conditions of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. Specifically, we examined the impact of slope, elevation, aspect, canopy cover, crown shape, and the spatial arrangement of canopy-forming trees on the accuracy of a large footprint lidar system in retrieving canopy height, canopy cover, and biomass. We found good agreement between field and lidar measurements of height, cover, and biomass at the footprint level, and canopy height and biomass at the stand level. Differences between field and lidar measurements are mainly attributable to the spatial configuration of canopy elements and are less sensitive to topography, crown shape, or canopy cover. The accuracy of canopy cover retrieval was highly sensitive to estimates of ground cover reflectivity and to ground sampling density. The accuracy of biomass retrieval was also good, and comparable to previous efforts in other biomes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we examine the use of an unsupervised clustering 4-m multispectral IKONOS imagery for the detection of mountain pine beetle red attack at sites with low and medium levels of attack. Independent validation data were collected from aerial photography and were used to determine the accuracy with which mountain pine beetle red attack could be detected using the multispectral IKONOS imagery. Concentric buffers, in 1-m increments to a maximum of 4 in, were applied to red attack pixels to characterize attribute accuracy as a function of positional accuracy. When a one-pixel buffer (4 in) is applied, the accuracy with which mountain pine beetle red attack could be detected using the multispectral IKONOS imagery was 71% (low attack) and 92% (medium attack). Analysis of red attack trees that were omitted in the analysis of the multispectral IKONOS image indicated that detection of red attack was most effective for larger tree crowns (diameter > 1.5 in) that were less than I I in from other red attack trees. These results demonstrate that the unsupervised classification of mountain pine beetle red attack using multispectral IKONOS imagery is an operationally viable approach.

Numerous papers have documented the use of lidar measurements to predict important aspects of forest stand structure, including aboveground biomass. Other papers have documented the ability to transform lidar measurements to approximate common field measures, such as cover, stand height, and vertical distributions of foliage density and light transmittance. However, only a small number of existing works have thoroughly examined relationships between comprehensive assemblages of forest canopy and forest stand structure indices. In this work, canonical correlation analysis of coincident lidar and field datasets in western Oregon and Washington is used to define seven statistically significant pairs of canonical variables, each defining an axis of variation that stand and canopy structure have in common. The first major axis relates mean stand height, and related variables, to aboveground biomass. The second relates canopy cover and volume to leaf area index and stem density. The third relates canopy height variability to mean stem diameter and the basal area of deciduous species. Of the four remaining axes, three are related to contrasts between mature and old-growth stands. Canonical correlation analysis provides a method for ranking the importance of these effects, and for placing both canopy and stand structure indices within the overall covariance structure of the two datasets. In this sense, and for the study area involved, the first three factors (mean height, cover or leaf index area, height variability) represent the same kind of enhancement of lidar data that the tasseled cap indices [Crist, C.P., R.C.

However, there are few broad scale techniques for quantifying the sources of sediment, i.e. upland vs. river bank erosion. This research was designed, to evaluate the use of airborne LIDAR for characterizing sediment and phosphorus contributions from river bank erosion. The evaluation was done on the main stem of the Blue Earth River in southern Minnesota. Detailed topographic data were collected on an annual basis in April 2001 and 2002 over a 56 km length of the river with a helicopter mounted Topeye laser system. The raw database included X, Y, Z coordinates of laser returns sampled from the river 2 valley with a density of 1-3.3 elevations per m(2). Uniform 1 m bare earth digital elevation models were constructed by stripping vegetation laser returns and interpolation. The two models were differenced to determine volume change over time, which was then converted to mass wasting by multiplying volume change with bulk density. Mass wasting rates were further converted to sediment load based on percentage of transportable material in the bank strata. The average difference between LIDAR measured elevations and RTK GPS surveyed elevations on 5 highway bridge surfaces was 2.5 and 8.8 cm for the 2001 and 2002 scans, respectively. The elevation errors were quasi-normally distributed with standard deviation of 6.7 and 6.1 cm for 2001 and 2002, respectively. No elevation or planimetric corrections were made to the laser data before calculating mass wasting rates because it was not possible to determine the source of error or if it was uniform within and between scans. The mass wasting estimate from the LIDAR surveys varied from 23% to 56% of the sediment mass transported past the downstream gauging station depending on the range of textural material that was entrained once in the river. These estimates are in the range of values reported in the literature. Total P contribution due to bank erosion from the river reach was estimated to be 201 t/yr. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The aims were (1) to test a proposed parameterization of the budget using two spectrally invariant canopy structural parameters (p and p(t)) governing canopy absorption and transmittance, respectively, and (2) to incorporate the effect of within-shoot scattering in the parameterization for shoot canopies. Results showed that canopy spectral absorption and scattering were well described by a single parameter, the canopy p value or \'recollision probability\', which was closely related to LAI, The relationship between p and LAI was however different in leaf and shoot canopy: e.g., at the same LAI the recollision probability was larger in the shoot canopy. It was shown that the p value of the shoot canopy could be decomposed into the p value of an individual shoot (p(sh)) and the p value of the leaf canopy with the same effective LAI (LAI(e)). The canopy p value allows calculation of canopy absorption and scattering at any given wavelength from the leaf (or needle) scattering coefficient at the same wavelength. To calculate canopy reflectance, separation of the downward and upward scattered parts is needed in addition. The proposed parameter p(t) worked rather well in the leaf canopy at moderate values of LAI, but not in the coniferous shoot canopy nor at high values of LAI. However, the simulated fraction of upward scattered radiation increased in a straightforward manner with LAI, and was not particularly sensitive to the leaf (or needle) scattering coefficient. Judged by this \'smooth\' behavior, the existence of another kind of simple parameterization for this separation remains an interesting possibility. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

We compared the recently available Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC-2000) and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) global land cover data to evaluate the similarities and differences in methodologies and results, and to identify areas of spatial agreement and disagreement. These two global land cover data sets were prepared using different data sources, classification systems, and methodologies, but using the same spatial resolution (i.e., 1 km) satellite data. Our analysis shows a general agreement at the class aggregate level except for savannas/shrublands, and wetlands. The disagreement, however, increases when comparing detailed land cover classes. Similarly, percent agreement between the two data sets was found to be highly variable among biomes. The identified areas of spatial agreement and disagreement will be useful for both data producers and users. Data producers may use the areas of spatial agreement for training area selection and pay special attention to areas of disagreement for further improvement in future land cover characterization and mapping. Users can conveniently use the findings in the areas of agreement, whereas users might need to verify the information in the areas of disagreement with the help of secondary information. Learning from past experience and building on the existing infrastructure (e.g., regional networks), further research is necessary to (1) reduce ambiguity in land cover definitions, (2) increase availability of improved spatial, spectral, radiometric, and geometric resolution satellite data, and (3) develop advanced classification algorithms.

To assess the applicability of hyperspectral remote sensing in the St. Austell china clay region, one line of airborne HyMap(R) hyperspectral data was acquired. These data were processed to correct for atmospheric and illumination effects by calibration from radiance to reflectance data, so that mineral abundance maps could be produced. Minerals associated with the primary granite and its subsequent kaolinisation were identified by image processing and used as mapping endmembers. These minerals include kaolinite, kaolinite with smectite, montmorillonite, muscovite, lepidolite (a lithium mica) and topaz.   Hyperspectral data analysis allowed for the identification of the different primary granite units. The spectrally observed compositional differences of the biotite and topaz granite units of the region allowed for fingerprinting of the source of mined waste material as originating from specific pits. The majority of waste tips in the region originate from the nearest china clay workings. However, waste material used in the construction of a mica dam and also as backfill in a disused pit is successfully identified to have been transported across a mapped granite boundary for storage.   The effect of mining and mineral processing on the abundance and spatial distribution of minerals in the region is also evident. Waste tips are classified as containing the greatest abundance of mica. This distribution results from the separation of kaolinite during the mineral processing stages. Kaolinite in lower abundance, however, is also identified within these waste areas and is the result of a less than 100% recovery by mining and processing. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Strong empirical relationships may be established between VI and FMC over grasslands, yet over shrublands and forests, the relationships are weaker. If FMC is to be estimated with greater accuracy and consistency than is currently achieved, it is necessary to fully understand the relative contribution that spatial and temporal variation in the various biophysical and geometrical variables make to reflectance variability at the leaf and canopy level.   This paper uses a modelling approach to investigate the sensitivity of reflectance data at leaf and canopy level to variation in the biophysical variables that are used to compute FMC. At the leaf level, the results show that the sensitivity of reflectance to variation in leaf water and dry matter content, used to compute FMC, is greatest in the SWIR and NIR, respectively. Variation in FMC has no effect ill the visible wavelengths. At the canopy level, the results show that the sensitivity of reflectance to variation in leaf water and dry matter content is heavily dependent upon the type of model used and the range of variation over which the variables are tested. In the longer wavelengths of the SWIR, the competing influence of variable leaf area index, fractional vegetation cover, and solar zenith angle is shown to be greater than that at the shorter wavelengths of the SWIR and NIR. Empirical relationships between the normalised difference water index (NDWI) and FMC are shown to be weaker than that with canopy water content. However, when the range of the variables under study is more limited, useful empirical relationships between FMC and remotely sensed VI may be established. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Sixteen in situ water samples were collected concurrently with the recording of the satellite image. These samples were used to establish regression models for total suspended sediment (TSS) concentration and Secchi depth with respect to a particular DOP zone. Containing identical bands and their transformations for both parameters, the models are linear for TSS concentration, logarithmic for Secchi depth. Based on these models, TSS concentration and Secchi depth were mapped from the satellite image in respective DOP zones. Their mapped patterns are consistent with the in situ observed ones. Spatially, overestimation and underestimation of the parameters are restricted to localised areas but related to the absolute value of the parameters. The mapping was accomplished more accurately using multiple DOP zones than using a single zone in shallower areas. The composite DOP approach enables the mapping to be extended to areas as shallow as <3 m. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The VPM model uses two improved vegetation indices (Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI)). We used multi-year (1998-2001) images from the VEGETATION sensor onboard the SPOT-4 satellite and CO2 flux data from a CO2 eddy flux tower site in Howland, Maine, USA. The seasonal dynamics of GPP predicted by the VPM model agreed well with observed GPP in 1998-2001 at the Howland Forest. These results demonstrate the potential of the satellite-driven VPM model for scaling-up GPP of forests at the CO2 flux tower sites, a key component for the study of the carbon cycle at regional and global scales.

The MISR standard products include green leaf area index (LAI) of vegetation and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (FPAR). These parameters are being routinely processed from MISR data at the Langley Atmospheric Sciences Data Center (ASDC) since October 2002. This paper describes the research basis for transitioning the MISR LAI/FPAR product from beta to provisional status. The quality and spatial coverage of MISR land surface reflectances that are input to the algorithm determine the quality and spatial coverage of the LAI and FPAR products. Therefore, considerable efforts have been expended to analyze the performance of the algorithm as a function of uncertainties of MISR surface reflectances and to establish the convergence property of the MISR LAI/FPAR algorithm, namely, that the reliability and accuracy of the retrievals increase with increased input information content and accuracy. An additional objective of the MISR LAI/FPAR algorithm is classification of global vegetation into biome types-information that is usually an input to remote sensing algorithms that use single-angle observations. An upper limit of uncertainties of MISR surface reflectances that allows discrimination between biomes, minimizes the impact of biome misidentification on LAI retrievals, and maximizes the spatial coverage of retrievals was estimated. Algorithm performance evaluated on a limited set of MISR data from Africa suggests valid LAI retrievals and correct biome identification in about 20% of the pixels, on an average, given the current level of uncertainties in the MISR surface reflectance data. The other 80% of the LAI values are retrieved using incorrect information about the type of biome. However, the use of multi-angle data minimizes the impact of biome misidentification on LAI retrievals; that is, with a probability of about 70%, uncertainties in LAI retrievals due to biome misclassification do not exceed uncertainties in the observations. We also discuss in depth the parameters that characterize LAI/FPAR product quality-such as quality assessment (QA) that is available to the users along with the product. The analysis of the MISR LAI/FPAR product presented here demonstrates the physical basis of the radiative transfer algorithm used in the retrievals and, importantly, that the reliability and accuracy of the retrievals increase with increased input information content and accuracy. Further improvements in the quality of MISR surface reflectances are therefore expected to lead to LAI and FPAR retrievals of increasing quality. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we consider three different statistical approaches to tackle this problem: two of them, namely the well-known maximum likelihood classification (ML) and the support vector machine (SVM), are noncontextual methods. The third one, iterated conditional modes (ICM), exploits spatial context by using a Markov random field. We apply these methods to Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data from Tenerife, the largest of the Canary Islands. Due to the size and the strong relief of the island, ground truth data could be collected only sparsely by examination of test areas for previously defined land cover classes.   We show that after application of an unsupervised clustering method to identify subclasses, all classification algorithms give satisfactory results (with statistical overall accuracy of about 90%) if the model parameters are selected appropriately. Although being superior to ML theoretically, both SVM and ICM have to be used carefully: ICM is able to improve ML, but when applied for too many iterations, spatially small sample areas are smoothed away, leading to statistically slightly worse classification results. SVM yields better statistical results than ML, but when investigated visually, the classification result is not completely satisfying. This is due to the fact that no a priori information on the frequency of occurrence of a class was used in this context, which helps ML to limit the unlikely classes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The sparse and complex configuration of the branches of the leaf-off forest provides sufficient returns to allow the detection of the trees as individual objects and to analyse their vertical structures. Initially, for the detection of the individual trees only, the lidar data are first inserted in a 21) digital image, with the height as the pixel value or brightness level. The empty pixels are interpolated, and height outliers are removed. Gaussian smoothing at different scales is performed to create a three-dimensional scale-space structure. Blob signatures based on second-order image derivatives are calculated, and then normalised so they can be compared at different scale-levels. The grey-level blobs with the strongest normalised signatures are selected within the scale-space structure. The support regions of the blobs are marked one-at-a-time in the segmentation result image with higher priority for stronger blobs. The segmentation results of six individual hectare plots are assessed by a computerised, objective method that makes use of a ground reference data set of the individual tree crowns. For analysis of individual trees, a subset of the original laser returns is selected within each tree crown region of the canopy reference map. Indices based on moments of the first four orders, maximum value and number of canopy and ground returns, are estimated. The indices are derived separately for height and laser reflectance of branches for the two echoes. Significant differences (p < 0.05) are detected for numerous indices for three major native species groups: oaks (Quercus spp.), red maple (Acer rubrum) and yellow poplar (Liriodendron tuliperifera). Tree species classification results of different indices suggest a moderate to high degree of accuracy using single or multiple variables. Furthermore, the maximum tree height is compared to ground reference tree height for 48 sample trees and a 1.1-m standard error (R-2 = 68% (adj.)) within the test-site is observed.

Satellite radar data appear well adapted to map biomass and to monitor biomass changes in this environment for two reasons: (a) the C-band (5.3 GHz) radar data is particularly sensitive to vegetation biomass when the canopy is over an underlying water surface or a water-saturated soil; this is through the dominant scattering mechanisms involving vegetation-water surface interaction; (b) the cloud cover during the growing period which corresponds to the rainy season. This paper assesses the potential of ERS satellite radar data for retrieving biomass information, which is spatially highly variable owing to the numerous small, nonuniform areas of totora harvesting and bofedal grazing. Ground data, including vegetation humid and dry biomass, were collected over 18 months during satellite descending passes at 12 sites located between the Eastern Cordillera and Titicaca Lake, representing three vegetation units: shoreline and inland totoras, and Puna bofedales.   ERS-SAR data were analysed as a function of plant biomass at homogeneous totora and bofedal areas. Because of the small size of these areas (typically 20 x 30 m), the SAR data need to be processed using an advanced multitemporal filter which improves radiometric resolution without significant reduction of the spatial resolution. The radar backscattering coefficient (sigmadegrees in dB) measured by ERS was found to be sensitive at both per site and per vegetation unit levels to humid and dry biomass of totora reeds and bofedal grasslands. The sensitivity of the signal to biomass variation is high for dry biomass ranges less than 1 kg/m(2) for totora, and less than 2 kg/m(2) for bofedal. The corresponding biomass maps provided by inversion of SAR data are valuable information for livestock management for three critical periods: after the calving season (October-November), when animal pressure is most significant; toward the end of the rainy season (March-April), as an indicator of coming trends to promote the adoption of measures aimed at preventing shortages during the winter season; in the middle of the winter dry season (June-July), to adjust animal charge.

Results from some specific simulations that explain the causes of the discontinuity lines in the derived products are presented. We show that these discontinuities appearing in the derived SeaWiFS products are the result of the atmospheric correction due to aerosol model effects. To remove the discontinuities, a simple modification to the current atmospheric correction algorithm is proposed and tested with both simulated and real SeaWiFS data. The modification has been implemented in the SeaWiFS fourth data reprocessing in August 2002. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

The sizes and movements of animal populations can be linked to resources provided by different plant species. This paper demonstrates the application of imaging spectroscopy to the study of vegetation in Yellowstone National Park (Yellowstone) using spectral feature analysis of data from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). AVIRIS data, acquired on August 7, 1996, were calibrated to surface reflectance using a radiative transfer model and field reflectance measurements of a ground calibration site. A spectral library of canopy reflectance signatures was created by averaging pixels of the calibrated AVIRIS data over areas of known forest and nonforest vegetation cover types in Yellowstone. Using continuum removal and least squares fitting algorithms in the US Geological Survey\'s Tetracorder expert system, the distributions of these vegetation types were determined by comparing the absorption features of vegetation in the spectral library with the spectra from the AVIRIS data. The 0.68 mum chlorophyll absorption feature and leaf water absorption features, centered near 0.98 and 1.20 mum, were analyzed. Nonforest cover types of sagebrush, grasslands, willows, sedges, and other wetland vegetation were mapped in the Lamar Valley of Yellowstone. Conifer cover types of lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, Douglas fir, and mixed Engelmann spruce/subalpine fir forests were spectrally discriminated and their distributions mapped in the AVIRIS images. In the Mount Washburn area of Yellowstone, a comparison of the AVIRIS map of forest cover types to a map derived from air photos resulted in an overall agreement of 74.1% (kappa statistic = 0.62).

Our previous approach to deriving continuous fields used a linear mixture model based on spectral endmembers of forest, grassland and bare ground training. We present here a new approach for estimating percent tree cover employing continuous training data over the whole range of tree cover. The continuous training data set is derived by aggregating high-resolution tree cover to coarse scales and is used with multi-temporal metrics based on a full year of coarse resolution satellite data. A regression tree algorithm is used to predict the dependent variable of tree cover based on signatures from the multi-temporal metrics. The automated algorithm was tested globally using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data, as a full year of MODIS data has not yet been collected. A root mean square error (rmse) of 9.06% tree cover was found from the global training data set. Preliminary MODIS products are also presented, including a 250-m map of the lower 48 United States and 500-m maps of tree cover and leaf type for North America. Results show that the new approach used with MODIS data offers an improved characterization of land cover. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The algorithm definition stage presented in this paper includes three steps: building of representative simulated brightness temperature databases, definition and analysis of formalisms on simulated brightness temperatures, and tests of these formalisms on a Matchup Database (MDB). A cloud-free, latitude equally distributed simulation database has been built to determine SST algorithms, which were further checked on a NOAA-14 latitude equally distributed validation database build from the Pathfinder MDBs. The tests showed that the presence of clouds in the training database increases the bias, while an underrepresentation of low-latitude profiles in the training database increases the standard deviation. The use of a cloud-free, latitude equally distributed training database reduced both the standard deviation in the algorithms and the bias consistently over the whole range of latitudes. The effect of the instrumental noise has been assessed and algorithms using noisy simulated data have been tested: they appear much more useful at daytime than at nighttime. Indications suggest that such noise algorithms should be more adaptive in atypical situations and that they should perform better than noise-free algorithms in the presence of cloud contamination or aerosols. The systematic procedure allowed us to test a large number of different algorithms. We determined that the best possible theoretical accuracy that may be obtained with NOAA-14 derived SSTs against buoy measurements on a global scale is 0.4 K. The successive steps that were performed in this study (cloud-free training database, algorithm determination, and noise scheme) allowed us to obtain retrievals with a 0.57 K standard deviation at both daytime and nighttime. These performances appears to be comparable or better than those obtained with algorithms directly derived by regression against in situ measurements. This proves that simulation-based SST retrievals are feasible and accurate when sufficient care is taken in the constitution of the training database. The effect of maritime aerosols has also been assessed and was found to be generally of little consequences for SST retrievals: a positive bias found to be lower than 0.08 K and no effect on the standard deviation. This bias is overestimated when maritime aerosols are used in the training of the algorithms using radiative transfer models. Current SST products (North Atlantic Regional and high latitudes) based on NOAA-14 and NOAA-16 data and routine validations against drifting buoys are available at (http://www.meteorologie.eu.org/safo).

This study strives to avoid such errors by introducing an \"optimal distance number\" into the structure function method that has been developed previously in estimating the AOD. The results of our experiment measured by a ground-based sunphotometer showed that the average errors of the estimated AOD values was reduced from 40% to 11% after the \"optimal distance number\" was used, indicating a significant improvement.

Far less attention has been given to the use of radar imagery, even though synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems have the advantages of cloud penetration, all-weather coverage, high spatial resolution, day/night acquisitions, and signal independence of the solar illumination angle. In this study, we obtained coincident optical and SAR images of an agricultural area to investigate the use of SAR imagery for farm management. The optical and SAR data were normalized to indices ranging from 0 to 1 based on the meteorological conditions and sun/sensor geometry for each date to allow temporal analysis. Using optical images to interpret the response of SAR backscatter (sigmadegrees) to soil and plant conditions, we found that SAR sigmadegrees was sensitive to variations in field tillage, surface soil moisture, vegetation density, and plant litter. In an investigation of the relation between SAR sigmadegrees and soil surface roughness, the optical data were used for two purposes: (1) to filter the SAR images to eliminate fields with substantial vegetation cover and/or high surface soil moisture conditions, and (2) to evaluate the results of the investigation. For dry, bare soil fields, there was a significant correlation (r(2) = .67) between normalized SAR sigmadegrees and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance, due to the sensitivity of both measurements to surface roughness. Recognizing the limitations of optical remote sensing data due to cloud interference and atmospheric attenuation, the findings of this study encourage further studies of SAR imagery for crop and soil assessment.

Independent evidence and unique in situ validation data from the NASA DC-8 encounter with volcanic products from the recent Hekla eruption further support our original analysis and conclusions. Factors affecting the usefulness of their algorithm within the context of aviation safety include, but are not limited to, ambient atmospheric water vapor, ground and juvenile water in the magma as well as its chemical composition, cloud cover, atmospheric ice crystals, and the general applicability of the theoretical assumptions underlying their T-4-T-5 volcanic ash detection algorithm.

The model was driven by daily meteorological data and simulated plant growth and water budget on the same time step. The model was coupled with a canopy reflectance model to yield the time course of shortwave radiometric profiles. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced TM Plus (ETM+) images from 10 consecutive years were used to refine the model on a spatially distributed basis. A calibration procedure, which minimized the difference between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) simulated from the coupled model and measured by the TM and ETM+ sensors, yielded the spatial distribution of an unknown parameter and initial condition. Accuracy of model products, such as daily aboveground biomass, leaf area index (LAI) and soil water content, was assessed by comparing them with field measurements.

High-resolution narrowband satellite observations contain important information that enables us to map land surface albedo globally, and validate the coarse-resolution albedo products from the broadband sensors using ground \"point/plot\" measurements. However, the conversions from narrowband to broadband albedos of a general surface type have not been well established Most studies compute total shortwave albedo based on either the empirical relations between surface total shortwave albedo measurements and satellite observations or radiative transfer simulations with the limited number of surface reflectance spectra because of the computational constraints. As a result, many conversion formulae for the same sensors are quite different. In this study, we applied an approach that decouples surface reflectance spectra from the real-time radiative transfer simulations so that many different surface reflectance spectra and the atmospheric conditions can be effectively incorporated. The conversion formulae. based on extensive radiative transfer simulations, are provided in this paper for calculating the total shortwave albedo, total-, direct-, and diffuse-visible, and near-infrared broadband albedos for several narrowband sensors, including ASTER, AVHRR, ETM+/TM: GOES, MODIS, MISR, POLDER, and VEGETATION. Some of these formulae were compared with the published formulae of the same sensors and further validations using Extensive ground measurements will be discussed in the companion paper.

The variation of snow reflectance with view angle can be large or small, depending on the view geometry. Thus, the snow reflectances of a common target, observed from different viewing angles, can be very different and hard to compare. Unfortunately, none represent the actual physical snow albedo, and the error in the converted broadband top of atmosphere (TOA) albedo could easily be larger than 10%, which implies a great effect on the solar radiation balance at TOA. For an accurate estimate of the solar energy budget from satellite observations, and anisotropic correction is required not only for those reflectance images with obvious angular variation, but also for seemingly \"isotropic\" scenes because this latter case might incorrectly estimate the albedo under general conditions. Two methods, on based on a radiative transfer model and the other on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\'s (NOAA) Earth Radiation Budget (ERB) experimental data, have been applied to AVHRR data to implement and anisotropic correction. The results show that both methods can remove the systematic variation of snow reflectance with view angle and can significantly reduce the large observed differences in reflectances from different satellite observations of a common snow target. The radiative transfer model-based method, however, unlike the NOAA experimental method, corrects the reflectances in the two AVHRR channels separately, has higher angular resolution than the NOAA experimental method, and can account for variations in snow condition (e.g., grain size). Moreover, the model-based anisotropic correction shows superior self-consistency compared to that produced by NOAA\'s experimental-based method. Finally, the model-based method provides a sound theoretical basis for anisotropic correction of satellite images of arctic snow reflectance.

The methodology is based on the relationship between spectral variability of BRDF effects and canopy geometry Tests with data acquired with the Advanced Solid-State Array Spectroradiometer (ASAS) over Canadian boreal forests during the BOREAS campaign show that vegetation structural characteristics can be derived from the spectral variability of BRDF effects. In addition, the incorporation of both BRDF effects and hyperspectral resolution data substantially improve the classification accuracy. Best classification results are obtained when hyperspectral resolution and BRDF data are combined, but the improvement is not consistent for all classes. For example, adding BRDF information to hyperspectral data increases the overall classification accuracy for a sirs-class fen site from 37.8% to 44.7%. The addition, however reduces the accuracy for the jack pine class from 43.6% to 28.8%. These new findings provide evidence for improved capabilities for applications of MISR and MODIS data. The spectral resolution of MODIS is expected to be sufficient to derive canopy structural information based on the spectral variability of BRDF effects, and for MISR a significant improvement of classification accuracies can be anticipated from the combination of nadir reflectance and off-nadir data.

Variations in sensor response associated with solar and sensor geometries, surface directional reflectance, topography, atmospheric absorption and scattering, and sensor electrical-optical engineering interact in complex manners that are difficult to deconvolve and quantify in individual images or in time series of images. We have developed a model of the remote sensing process to allow systematic examination of these factors. The model is composed of three main components, including a ground scene model, an atmospheric model, and a sensor model, and may be used to simulate imagery produced by instruments such as the Landsat Thematic Mapper and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer. Using this model, we examine the effect of subpixel variance in leaf area index (LAI) on relationships among LAI, the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). To do this, we use data from the first ISLSCP Field Experiment (FIFE) to parameterize ground scene properties within the model. Our results demonstrate interactions between sensor spatial resolution and spatial autocorrelation In ground scenes that produce a variety of effects in the relationship between both LAI and FPAR and NDVI. Specifically, sensor regularization, nonlinearity in the relationship between LAI and NDVI, and scaling the NDVI all influence the range, variance, and uncertainty associated with estimates of LAI and FPAR inverted from simulated NDVI data.

Images of band cover/land use during 1975 and 1985 were generated from a supervised density slicing technique applied to a mosaicked image of digitized aerial photos and from an unsupervised classification of the TM image. A geomorphic hydrologic model was used to simulate runoff and sediment yield from the drainage basin of the Guanajibo river; because land cover within the basin did not change significantly during 1975-1985, the hydrologic model provided estimates of sediment discharged by the Guanajibo river into the bay during this time period. Growth rates of the coral Montastrea annularis of Rodiguez reef were obtained from a previous study. Annual growth rates as determined from coral banding decreased significantly (r = 0.69) with increased sediment loading to the bay (tons/year). Evidence from remote sensing and hydrologic modeling suggests that sediment reaches the reef only during episodic, high-discharge events. During low to moderate discharge, sediments, both suspended within the river plume and resuspended sediments, are restricted to the near-shore regions by the prevailing circulation.

The mesoscale signature is characterized by a 25-35 degrees counterclockwise shift in the wind direction and a maximum of 4.9 dB increase in the backscattering cross section across the front. The mesoscale circulation is reduced when the wind direction reverses, and the ambient wind flow increases to 13.6 m/s. The maximum cross-section change across the front is reduced to 3.6 dB.

In this approach, the ecosystem model is not bound by the sole use of satellite data, but integrates the latter in an explicit formulation of the main processes of vegetation functioning. A close analysis of the relationships between processes described by the model and spectral measurements can therefore be carried out, and the capability of the model to be driven by remote sensing can also be investigated. This first article presents a regional ecosystem process model for Sahelian regions. The model describes a herbaceous layer composed of only annual species. The processes of the soil-plant-atmosphere system, such as water fluxes in the soil, evaporation, transpiration, photosynthesis, respiration, senescence, bitter production, and litter decomposition at the soil surface, are modeled. Moreover, structural parameters such as vegetation cover fraction, LAI, and canopy height, which are essential parameters for coupling with physical models of reflectivity, are also simulated.

The images were specifically chosen from months where past mean wind conditions indicated upwelling occurred because cold filaments appear to be more abundant during the upwelling season. The images also were chosen to provide independent realizations of filament structure. Distributions of average gradient magnitude as a function of gradient angle were used to provide a more compact representation of the frontal information contained in each image. An analysis of these distributions shows that the sharp/diffuse boundary structure associated with cold filaments observed in shipboard data dominates the total surface frontal structure found in satellite data for two of the three regions studied.

In terms of areal biomass, the stochastic errors in MDB and NDVI are both small compared to the pixel sampling error in the biomass field data.RP ROSEMA, A (通讯作者)，EARS LTD REMOTE SENSING CONSULTANTS,POB 449,2628 EB DELFT,NETHERLANDS.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 32, 20, 24, 1, 8, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

These radar systems observe a 475 km wide swath with 1-2 km horizontal spatial resolution. Wind velocities were inferred from sea surface radar scattering for speeds ranging from approximately 2 m/s to those of hurricane proportions. The wind speeds were within 10-20% of the measured in situ values, and the direction of the wind velocity inferred from the radar measurements agreed with in situ direction measurements within 20-50-degrees. Various atmospheric mesoscale eddies and tropical cyclones were thus located, and their strengths were inferred from sea surface reflectivity measurements. Rain cells were observed over both land and sea with these spaceborne radars. Algorithms to retrieve rainfall rates from spaceborne radar measurements were also developed. Spaceborne radars have been used to monitor various marine hazards. For example, information derived from those radars was used to plan rescue operations of distressed ships trapped in sea ice. Icebergs have also been monitored. Because oil films reduce the sea surface roughness and thereby alter the radar reflectivity, oil spills were also mapped. Tsunamis produced by underwater earthquakes were also observed from space by the radars on the Cosmos-1500 series of satellites. The Cosmos-1500 satellite series have provided all weather radar imagery of the earth\'s surface to a user community in, real time by means of a 137.4 MHz Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) channel.

The algorithms\' performance was assessed through a sensitivity analysis, taking into account the correlation among chlorophyll, sediment, and yellow substance contents, as well as the stratification characteristics of the water body. Sensitivity analysis techniques were similarly used to evaluate the performance in the coastal environment of three atmospheric correction models, which assume uniform aerosol load and composition, uniform aerosol composition, and varying aerosol load and composition, respectively. A comparison with sea-truth data collected for the Landsat overpass of 22 June 1988 showed a satisfactory correspondence between measured concentrations and concentrations retrieved from the TM data using the above atmospheric correction procedures and \'\'local\'\' biooptical algorithms.

Endmembers were derived from laboratory reflectance measurements of water-sediment mixtures with a range of sediment concentrations. Using these reference spectra, we applied a linear mixture analysis to multispectral images after accounting for instrument and atmosphere gains and offsets. Sediment concentrations were estimated for individual pixels from the mixture analysis results based on a nonlinear calibration curve relating laboratory sediment concentrations and reflectance to endmember fractions. The uncertainty in the sediment concentrations derived from this analysis for three Amazon images is predicted to be within +/- 20 mg/L, and the concentrations fall within a range of concentrations of suspended sediment that were measured at several times and places in the field over the past 15 years. The emphasis of our work is to use the patterns of sediment concentrations to compute the approximate volumes of sediment that are transferred between the main channel and floodplain of the Amazon River.

However, most satellite derived NPP (NPPSAT) algorithms used in the Arctic do not account for production at deep subsurface chlorophyll maxima (SCMs), a prominent feature in the Arctic Ocean during the summer months, leading to underestimations of NPP during the post-bloom period. In this study, a shallow SCM was observed in early summer (June/July 2016) in Baffin Bay at the time of the sea ice edge bloom, raising the question to what extent this SCM contributes to Rrs and how it is captured in NPPSAT estimates. Radiative transfer simulations based on in situ data of inherent and apparent optical properties and Chl a concentration in the water column were used to examine the effects of heterogeneous vertical Chl a profiles of various strength and depth on spectral reflectance, algorithm-derived surface Chl aSAT and NPPSAT. NPPSAT estimates for varying Chl a profile shapes were then compared to NPPSAT estimates of reference simulations for homogenous Chl a profiles, and to measured NPP calculated using observed Chl a profiles. Results show a significant impact of shallow SCMs on Rrs with the depth of maximum Chl a < 30 m, causing an increase in Chl aSAT by 17 +/- 6% relative to a vertically homogenous ocean. Interestingly, SCMs significantly influencing Rrs were found down to the fifth light penetration depth. The increase in Chl aSAT reduced the difference between predicted and measured NPP estimates to -25 +/- 12% at stations with a shallow SCM. Furthermore, due to the significant contribution of these shallow SCM stations to regional NPP, regional predicted NPPSAT was only 16% lower than measured NPP. Our results demonstrate that the partial representation of a shallow and very productive SCM in Chl aSAT minimizes errors in satellite-based NPPSAT estimates of the Arctic spring bloom during the sea ice melt period.', '[Matthes, L.

It is therefore important to develop methods that allow for its precise and reliable retrieval from radiance measurements with spectral resolutions that have been increasing over the past few years. Retrieval methods are catching up to the increasing complexity of the available datasets making use of their whole information extent (spectral, spatial and temporal) but the comparability of different SIF retrievals and consistency across scales is still limited. In this work we present the new retrieval method WAFER (WAvelet decomposition FluorEscence Retrieval) based on wavelet decompositions of the measured spectra of reflected radiance as well as a reference radiance not containing fluorescence. By comparing absolute absorption line depths by means of the corresponding wavelet coefficients, a relative reflectance is retrieved independently of the fluorescence, i.e. without intro-ducing a coupling between reflectance and fluorescence. The fluorescence can then be derived as the remaining offset. This method can be applied to arbitrary chosen wavelength windows in the whole spectral range, such that all the spectral data available is exploited, including the separation into several frequency (i.e. width of absorption lines) levels and without the need of extensive training datasets. At the same time, the assumptions about the reflectance shape are minimal and no spectral shape assumptions are imposed on the fluorescence, which not only avoids biases arising from wrong or differing fluorescence models across different spatial scales and retrieval methods but also allows for the exploration of this spectral shape for different measurement setups. WAFER is tested on a synthetic dataset as well as several diurnal datasets acquired with a field spectrometer (FloX) over an agricultural site. We compare the WAFER method to two established retrieval methods, namely the improved Fraunhofer line discrimination (iFLD) method and spectral fitting method (SFM) and find a good agreement with the added possibility of exploring the true spectral shape of the offset signal and free choice of the retrieval window. On our synthetic dataset, WAFER seems to outperform the SFM and works best in a spectral window only containing solar Fraunhofer lines where we achieve a relative retrieval error of 10% on average. Applied to the real dataset, the method returns reasonable diurnal cycles for SIF and can, due to the decoupling of reflectance and fluorescence retrieval, reveal interesting trends at times when vegetation canopies may experience a midday depression that remain largely unobserved with current methods.', '[Oehl, Veronika; Damm, Alexander] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.

The cycle begins with the arrival of high temperatures and increased solar radiation in the spring and summer seasons generating meltwater on the ice sheet\'s surface. Meltwater percolates to deeper ice layers, either refreezing within the firn, creating longer-term meltwater pockets (firn aquifers), or generating peripheral runoff. Depending on the location and climate, the refreeze duration, the depth of infiltration, and meltwater persistence are temporally and spatially complex. Our recent study showed that multi-frequency passive microwave measurements in the 1.4 GHz to 36.5 GHz range effectively distinguished seasonal meltwater between the immediate surface and deeper firn layers at an experiment site in the accumulation zone of the southwestern Greenland ice sheet. Here, we further explored the vertically and horizontally polarized multifrequency melt response at the pan-Greenland scale. We employed 1.4 GHz brightness temperature (TB) measurements from the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite and 6.9, 10.7, 18.9, and 36.5 GHz TB measurements from the JAXA Global Change Observation Mission-Water Shizuku (GCOM-W) satellite. The results show that the frequency-dependent response was consistent across the ice sheet. The multi-frequency melt indications match with lasting seasonal subsurface meltwater with delayed refreezing compared to the surface. These results suggest persistent seasonal subsurface meltwater occurrences that are spatially and temporally significant but concealed from the high-frequency observations.

However, the saturation phenomenon of VIs (i.e., insignificant change at moderate to high vegetation densities) poses a known limitation to their ability to characterize surface vegetation over the dense canopy. Although the mechanisms underlying saturation are relatively straightforward and several VIs have been proposed to mitigate the saturation effect, the assessment of the saturation effect of VIs remains insufficient. Notably, no unified metric has been proposed to quantify the VI saturation phenomenon, limiting VI selection in practical applications. In this study, we proposed two indicators to describe the saturation phenomenon and utilized a well-validated three-dimensional (3D) canopy radiative transfer (RT) model largescale remote sensing data and image simulation framework (LESS) to simulate the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) of six forests scenes and assessed the variations in VIs in relation to leaf area index (LAI) values over different backgrounds, sun-sensor geometries, and spatial distribution types. The saturation characteristics of 36 VIs were evaluated in combination with simulation results and satellite observations from multiple sensors. The ranking of VI saturation from simulated and satellite results revealed a good agreement. Our results indicated that the simple ratio vegetation index (SR) performed best with the highest saturation point and can well characterize the surface vegetation condition until LAI reaches 4. Besides, we found that the saturation effect of VIs was influenced by soil brightness, sun-sensor geometry, and canopy structure. SR, modified simple ratio (MSR) and normalized green red difference index (NGRDI) were the most susceptible to these disturbing factors, although they had higher resistance to saturation. Modified triangular vegetation index 1 (MTVI1), modified non-linear vegetation index (MNLI), triangular greenness index (TGI), and triangular vegetation index (TriVI) performed well overall, combining the ability to resist saturation and disturbance factors. Appropriate application of VIs can help better understand vegetation responses to climate change and accurately assess ecosystem status. Our results contribute to the understanding of the VI saturation effect and provide a combined model and satellite data experimental workflow in appropriate VI selection to accurately characterize vegetation.', '[Gao, Si; Yan, Kai; Qi, Jianbo] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Ctr GeoData & Anal, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.
