As part of this, a project was undertaken to map the extent of surface water across Australia using the multi-decadal archive of Landsat satellite imagery. A water detection algorithm was used based on a decision tree classifier, and a comparison methodology using a logistic regression. This approach provided an understanding of the confidence in the water observations. The results were used to map the presence of surface water across the entire continent from every observation of 27 years of satellite imagery. The Water Observation from Space (WOES) product provides insight into the behaviour of surface water across Australia through time, demonstrating where water is persistent, such as in reservoirs, and where it is ephemeral, such as on floodplains during a flood. In addition the WOfS product is useful for studies of wetland extent, aquatic species behaviour, hydrological models, land surface process modelling and groundwater recharge. This paper describes the WOES methodology and shows how similar time-series analyses of nationally significant environmental variables might be conducted at the continental scale.

The remote measurement of SIF opens a new perspective to assess actual photosynthesis at larger, ecologically relevant scales and provides an alternative approach to study the terrestrial carbon cycle. Recent studies demonstrated the reliability of measured SIF signals and showed significant relationships between SIF and gross primary production (GPP) at ecosystem and global scales. Despite these encouraging results, understanding the complex mechanisms between SIF and GPP remains challenging before SIF can be finally utilized to constrain estimates of GPP. In this study, we present a comprehensive assessment of the relationship between far-red SIF retrieved at 760 nm (SIF760) and GPP, and its transferability across three structurally and physiologically contrasting ecosystems: perennial grassland, cropland and mixed temperate forest. We use multi-temporal imaging spectroscopy (IS) data acquired with the Airborne Prism EXperiment (APEX) sensor as well as eddy covariance (EC) flux tower data to evaluate the relationship between SIF760 and GPP(Ec). We use simulations performed with the coupled photosynthesis-fluorescence model SCOPE to prove trends obtained from our observational data and to assess apparent confounding factors such as physiological and structural interferences or temporal scaling effects. Observed relationships between SIF760 and GPPEc were asymptotic and ecosystem-specific, i.e., perennial grassland (R-2 = 0.59, rRMSE = 27.1%), cropland (R-2 = 0.88, rRMSE = 3.5%) and mixed temperate forest (R-2 = 0.48, rRMSE = 15.88%). We demonstrate that asymptotic leaf level relationships between SIF760 and GPPEc became more linear at canopy level and scaled with temporal aggregation. We conclude that remote sensing of SIF provides a new observational approach to decrease uncertainties in estimating GPP across ecosystems but requires dedicated strategies to compensate for the various confounding factors impacting SIF-GPP relationships. Our findings help in bridging the gap between mechanistic understanding at leaf level and ecosystem-specific observations of the relationships between SIF and GPP. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The investigation is representative of the eastern subtropical North Atlantic region where the wind mobilization of mineral desert dust from the Sahara results in aerosol signals that are large enough to outweigh those from other aerosol types such as anthropogenic and marine aerosols. Ground-based estimates of AOD show frequency dependence as is expected from Mie theory. Our AOD signals agree well with satellite-based MODIS products and reveal AOD values exceeding 2.5 during the investigated dust storm event. We also demonstrate the use of satellite imagery with an atmospheric trajectory model to simulate time series of measurements at a given location. Using this approach, variations in AOD observed during February 7, 2012 can be rationalized as spatial inhomogeneities in the atmospheric dust load being advected laterally over the observing site. Our measurements suggest a dust forcing efficiency of around 90 W/m(2)/AOD at a wavelength of 380 nm, which is about 10-15% greater than reported in the literature indicative of a possible non-linear behavior at high AODs.

The spatial distribution and abundance, as well as the floral cycle, of melliferous plants are of utmost importance for evaluating pollination effects and to understand the relationship between melliferous plants in the landscape and the quantity and quality of bee keeping products. For a study site in Kenya, airborne AISA/Eagle hyperspectral data with 60 cm pixel resolution (400 to 990 nm spectral ranges) was captured in January 2014, at the beginning of the prime flowering period, and during the prime flowering period in February 2013. Aerial digital imagery with 10 cm pixel size and Smartphone captures in the field were used for reference data collection. The flowering species were grouped into functional flowering plant groups. Linear spectral unmixing and Change Vector Analysis (CVA) were used on the bi-temporal AISA/Eagle data to produce a hard cover map showing the spatial distribution, abundance and short-term flowering cycle of melliferous plants. Overall accuracies were slightly higher in the February 2013 imagery at the prime flowering period; all flowering plant groups together (\"All\") could be mapped with an overall accuracy of 83% (n = 512). The \"White forbs\" flowering plant group was most accurately mapped in both AISA/Eagle acquisition dates. Based on Duncan\'s inter-class similarity test, the \"White forbs\" group was also most distinct from other flowering plant groups. There is a need to investigate the effect of spectral endmember variability and upscaling options for space-borne monitoring of the floral cycle at key sites in Africa. Floral cycle maps can help decision makers and bee keepers to understand how bee colonies interact with the floral environment and what to expect from an apiary in terms of honey flow.

Interannual average values from the GEOV1 Copernicus Global Land time series of biophysical products at 1-km resolution and 10-day frequency are computed for 1999 to 2010. GEOCLIM provides the baseline characteristics of the seasonal cycle of the annual vegetation phenology for each 1-km pixel on the globe. The associated standard deviation characterises the interannual variability. Temporal consistency and continuity is achieved by the accumulation of multi-year observations and the application of techniques for temporal smoothing and gap filling. Specific corrections are applied over cloudy tropical regions and high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere where the low number of available observations compromises the reliability of estimates. Artefacts over evergreen broadleaf forests and areas of bare soil are corrected based on the expected limited seasonality. The GEOCLIM data set is demonstrated to be consistent, both spatially and temporally. GEOCLIM shows absolute differences lower than 0.5 compared with MODIS (GIMMS3g) climatology of LAI for more than 80% (90%) of land pixels, with higher discrepancies in tropical and boreal latitudes. ECOCLIMAP systematically produces higher LAI values. The phenological metric for the date of maximum foliar development derived from GEOCLIM is spatially consistent (correlation higher than 0.9) with those of MODIS, GIMMS3g, ECOCLIMAP and MCD12Q2 with average differences within 14 days at the global scale.

The area of the glaciers in Turkey decreased from 25 km(2) in the 1970s to 10.85 km(2) in 2012-2013. By 2012-2013, five glaciers had disappeared, six were less than 0.5 km(2), one was 0.8 km(2), and only two were 3.0 km(2) or larger. No trends in 1980 to 2012 annual precipitation, 1980 to 2012 winter precipitation, and 1980 to 2008 cloud cover extent were found, while surface temperatures increased, with summer minimum temperatures showing the greatest increases. We attribute glacier recession in Turkey from the 1970s to 2012-2013 to increasing summer minimum temperatures with no changes in precipitation or cloud cover over this time period.

So far no systematic study on the accuracy of such reconstruction has been done. This study aims at taking the global MODIS vegetation index as an example to develop a generic method to evaluate the reconstruction performance of HANTS. The overall reconstruction error was divided into gap related error and fitting-method related error. Firstly, ten annual NDVI time series for a pixel were used to extract reference series and gap statistics. Then the gap and fitting-method related errors were quantified independently. The results suggest that the gap related error for most of the high latitude forest area (between 50 degrees N and 70 degrees N) was rather large (the mean root mean squared deviation (RMSD) reached to 0.15), which may be attributed to the fact that large gaps appear in the NDVI profiles between snow melting and vegetation regreening season. The gap related error was found negligible for the other areas of the globe except the North China Plain, the North India and several mountainous areas where the mean RMSD is around 0.1. The inadequate capability of low frequency harmonics to capture the rapid transition during snowmelt in spring at the high latitude region of the North Hemisphere makes the fitting-method related error in this region rather large (RMSD can reach 0.1). The method developed in this study was applied to map globally the spatial pattern of HANTS performance in the reconstruction of NDVI time series and it can also be applied to evaluate the reconstruction performance of time series of other land surface variables or the performance of other time series reconstruction algorithms.

Extensive fieldwork took place during the dry and wet seasons of 2009 to 2011 at 15 sites distributed along a 950 km long transect, stretching across western Botswana, each site was visited once during the wet season and once during the dry season. Data collection included a traditional line-intercept transect (LPIT) and a new spectral line point intercept transect method (SLPIT) were used to test the performance of a variety of unmixing procedures (MESMA vs. SMA) and endmember models. The results for this structurally complex landscape are consistent with results from similar studies undertaken in more homogeneous areas. GV cover was retrieved much more accurately than NPV or soil cover. MESMA also produced estimates of fractional cover with less error than simple SMA. However, the errors observed are greater than those observed for more homogeneous environments. Unlike the line-point intercept method, which requires user interpretation of vegetation greenness, the new method uses spectral data collected across the entire reflected solar spectrum to derive estimates of GV, NPV and soil fractional cover through spectral unmixing. Our results show that that the SLPIT fractions generally agree better with remotely-derived fractions than the LPIT-derived fractions. However, remote sensing of GV, NPV, and soil fractional cover, especially in heterogeneous landscapes and at the spatial resolution of MODIS, remains challenging. Nonetheless, the data do show that at this resolution various unmixing methods have the potential to inform our understanding of ecosystem dynamics in these environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Several methods have been proposed for atmospheric correction over turbid waters, including modelling the marine contributions to the NIR signal or switching to longer short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths where the signal even in turbid waters can be assumed zero. Here we present the use of the high quality SWIR bands of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat-8, launched in 2013, to extend our existing turbid water atmospheric correction to extremely turbid waters. The atmospheric correction is image based, and no external measurements are required. The aerosol type is estimated using NIR and SWIR bands in clear water pixels, or in all water pixels using the two SWIR bands. The aerosol type is assumed to be constant over a single Landsat-8 tile (170 by 185 km), or allowed to vary spatially when using both SWIR bands. Realistic spatial patterns of marine reflectances are retrieved, uncorrelated with the estimated aerosol reflectance. Taking spatial and temporal variability into account, products from Landsat-8 compare well with those of MODIS Aqua and Terra also using the SWIR bands for atmospheric correction. The limitations of our previously published method (Vanhellemont & Ruddick, 2014a) are illustrated at higher turbidities, and removed by using the new method. The uncertainty caused by using a single aerosol type per scene is assessed. The advantages of the high spatial resolution L8/OLI data are clear for applications in coastal and estuarine waters. As an example of the advantage of high quality SWIR bands, and a SWIR-based atmospheric correction, an algorithm for detecting black suspended sediments from dredging and dumping operations is demonstrated here. In conclusion, L8/OLI is a powerful new tool for remote sensing of extremely turbid waters, and can be used as a precursor for future ocean colour missions with SWIR bands. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Also, we find that temporal changes in the elevation change rate can be derived from Envisat data, and show clear examples of this by generating five-year running means for selected areas of the Greenland ice sheet.

We focus on the area above the equilibrium line altitude, in order to specifically derive information on snow parameters. A comparison of the elevation changes observed by the two sensors shows a complex pattern, which can be explained regionally by model output describing the changes in both firn-air content and accumulation rates.

Because auditable information on flaring activity is difficult to obtain there have recently been attempts to detect flares using satellite imagery, typically at global scales. However, to adequately assess the environmental and health impacts of flaring from local to regional scales, it is important that we have a means of acquiring information on the location of individual active flaring sites and the volume of gas combusted at these sites. In this study we developed an approach to the retrieval of such information using nighttime MODIS thermal imagery. The MODIS flare detection technique (MODET) and the MODIS flare volume estimation technique (MOVET) both exploit the absolute and contextual radiometric response of flare sites. The levels of detection accuracy and estimation error were quantified using independent observations of flare location and volume. The MODET and MOVET were applied to an archive of MODIS data spanning 2000-2014 covering the Niger Delta, Nigeria, a significant global hotspot of flaring activity. The results demonstrate the substantial spatial and temporal variability in gas flaring across the region, between states and between onshore and offshore sites. Thus, whilst the estimated total volume of gas flared in the region over the study period is large (350 Billion Cubic Metres), the heterogeneity in the flaring indicates that the impacts of such flares will be highly variable in space and time. In this context, the MODET and MOVET offer a consistent and objective means of monitoring flaring activity over an appropriate range of scales and it is now important that their robustness and transferability is tested in other oil-producing regions of the world.

This will create unprecedented opportunities for a variety of environmental research fields and lead to manifold novel applications. These opportunities specifically apply to challenging environments, including heterogeneous urban landscapes. In this paper, we explored the potential of EnMAP data for quantifying land cover along the urban-rural gradient of Berlin, Germany. Land cover fraction maps from a simulated EnMAP scene at 30 m spatial resolution were derived based on support vector regression (SVR) combined with synthetically mixed training data. Results demonstrate that EnMAP imagery will be well suited for mapping impervious, vegetation and soil surface types according to the VIS framework. Moreover, EnMAP data will allow extending the VIS framework by more detailed sub-categories such as roof and pavement, or low vegetation and tree. However, we advise caution that spaceborne imaging spectrometer data of improved quality will not completely help to overcome well known phenomena of spectral similarity between materials and spectral confusion caused by the presence of shaded areas. To identify possible benefits and limitations of EnMAP data, comparisons to fraction maps derived from a higher resolution Hyperspectral Mapper (HyMap) image at 9 m spatial resolution and a multispectral Landsat ETM +-like image at 30 m spatial resolution were drawn. First, we demonstrate that both VIS and extended VIS mapping reveal similar accuracies compared to maps from spatially higher resolution data. Second, we illustrate the superiority of the higher spectral information content for improved and extended urban land cover mapping compared to multispectral data. Overall, this study provides important insights into the potential of spaceborne imaging spectrometer and specifically future EnMAP data for urban remote sensing.

Current monitoring efforts are limited in scope due to resource limitations, analytical complexity, and data integration efforts. The goals of this study were to validate an algorithm for satellite imagery that could potentially be used to monitor surface cyanobacteria events in near real-time to provide a compressive monitoring capability for freshwater lakes (>100 ha). The algorithm incorporated narrow spectral bands specific to the European Space Agency\'s (ESA\'s) MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) instrument that were optimally oriented at phytoplankton pigment absorption features including phycocyanm at 620 nm. A validation of derived cyanobacteria cell counts was performed using available in situ data assembled from existing monitoring programs across eight states in the eastern US over a 39-month period (2009-2012). Results indicated that MERIS provided robust estimates for low (10,000-109,000 cells/mL) and very high (>1,000,000 cells/mL) cell enumeration ranges (approximately 90% and 83%, respectively). However, the results for two intermediate ranges (110,000-299,000 and 300,000-1,000,000 cells/mL) were substandard, at approximately 28% and 40%, respectively. The confusion associated with intermediate cyanobacteria cell count ranges was largely attributed to the lack of available taxonomic data and distinction of natural counting units for the in situ measurements that would have facilitated conversions between cell counts and cell volumes. The results of this study document the potential for using MERIS-derived cyanobacteria cell count estimates to monitor freshwater lakes (>100 ha) across the eastern US.

In this paper we present an analytical forward model and develop an inversion scheme (2SeaColor) to retrieve the downwelling attenuation coefficients from remote sensing data. The forward formulation of 2SeaColor provides an analytical and stable solution of the direct and diffuse components of the radiative transfer equation. The common high turbidity of inland waters is accounted for in 2SeaColor by projecting its effect on the inherent optical properties (IOPs) using the similarity transform. The inversion scheme of 2SeaColor uses a novel approach to parameterize the spectral dependency of IOPs. In this parameterization 2SeaColor uses the curvature information of observed remote sensing spectra to deduce the spectral-shape of the total absorption coefficient.   The forward model is verified using simulated data from the International Ocean Colour Coordinating Group (IOCCG data) and is compared with two existing models.   Statistical analysis results of model verification show that the forward model is able to derive K-d values with 3% accuracy (relative mean absolute error). Our solution provides an improvement on the accuracy of the estimated Kd when compared to other models, and especially at larger depths. The inversion scheme is validated against three sets of data: IOCCG, field measured and satellite observed matchups. Field measurements were collected in the turbid Naivasha Lake, Kenya. The mean absolute relative error in the derived K-d in all data sets did not exceed 15%, with the satellite matchup set resulting in the largest discrepancy.   The developed model, 2SeaColor, is stable to noise up to 15% and consistently produces accurate results which make it an ideal candidate model for the future Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on board the Sentinel-3 mission.

Beginning with simple, often subjective, hand-drawn maps, habitat mapping now involves complex species distribution models (SDMs) using mapped predictor variables derived from remotely sensed data For species that inhabit large geographic areas, remote sensing technology is often essential for producing range wide maps. Habitat monitoring for northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina), whose geographic covers about 23 million ha, is based on SDMs that use Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery to create forest vegetation data layers using gradient nearest neighbor (GNN) methods. Vegetation data layers derived from GNN are modeled relationships between forest inventory plot data, climate and topographic data, and the spectral signatures acquired by the satellite. When used as predictor variables for SDMs, there is some transference of the GNN modeling error to the final habitat map.   Recent increases in the use of light detection and ranging (lidar) data, coupled with the need to produce spatially accurate and detailed forest vegetation maps have spurred interest in its use for SDMs and habitat mapping. Instead of modeling predictor variables from remotely sensed spectral data, lidar provides direct measurements of vegetation height for use in SDMs. We expect a SDM habitat map produced from directly measured predictor variables to be more accurate than one produced from modeled predictors.   We used maximum entropy (Maxent) SDM modeling software to compare predictive performance and estimates of habitat area between Landsat-based and lidar-based northern spotted owl SDMs and habitat maps.   We explored the differences and similarities between these maps, and to a pre-existing aerial photo-interpreted habitat map produced by local wildlife biologists. The lidar-based map had the highest predictive performance based on 10 bootstrapped replicate models (AUC = 0.809 +/- 0.011), but the performance of the Landsat-based map was within acceptable limits (AUC = 0.717 +/- 0.021). As is common with photo-interpreted maps, there was no accuracy assessment available for comparison. The photo-interpreted map produced the highest and lowest estimates of habitat area, depending on which habitat classes were included (nesting, roosting, and foraging habitat = 9962 ha, nesting habitat only = 6036 ha). The Landsat-based map produced an estimate of habitat area that was within this range (95% CI: 6679-9592 ha), while the lidar-based map produced an area estimate similar to what was interpreted by local wildlife biologists as nesting (i.e., high quality) habitat using aerial imagery (95% CI: 5453-7216). Confidence intervals of habitat area estimates from the SDMs based on Landsat and lidar overlapped.   We concluded that both Landsat- and lidar-based SDMs produced reasonable maps and area estimates for northern spotted owl habitat within the study area. The lidar-based map was more precise and spatially similar to what local wildlife biologists considered spotted owl nesting habitat. The Landsat-based map provided a less precise spatial representation of habitat within the relatively small geographic confines of the study area, but habitat area estimates were similar to both the photo-interpreted and lidar-based maps. Photo-interpreted maps are time consuming to produce, subjective in nature, and difficult to replicate. SDMs provide a framework for efficiently producing habitat maps that can be replicated as habitat conditions change over time, provided that comparable remotely sensed data are available. When the SDM uses predictor variables extracted from lidar data, it can produce a habitat map that is both accurate and useful at large and small spatial scales. In comparison, SDMs using Landsat-based data are more appropriate for large scale analyses of amounts and general spatial patterns of habitat at regional scales. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We present a novel pixel-based Multi-sensor Time-series correlation and Fusion approach (MulTiFuse) that exploits the full observation density of optical and SAR time series. We model the relationship of two overlapping univariate time series using an optimized weighted correlation. The resulting optimized regression model is used to predict and fuse two time series. Using the MulTiFuse approach we fused Landsat NDVI and ALOS PALSAR L-band backscatter time series. We subsequently used the fused time series in a multi-sensor change detection framework to detect deforestation between 01/2008 - 09/2010 at a managed forest plantation in the tropics (Pinus caribea; 2859 ha). 3-monthly reference data covering the entire study area was used to validate and assess spatial and temporal accuracy. We tested the impact of persistent cloud cover by increasing the per-pixel missing data percentage of the NDVI time series stepwise from similar to 53% (similar to 6 observations/year) up to 95% (similar to 0.5 observation/year) while fusing with a consistent PALSAR time series of similar to 2 observations/year. A significant linear correlation was found between the Landsat NDVI and ALOS PALSAR L-band SAR time series observables for logged forest. The multi-temporal filtered PALSAR HVHH backscatter ratio time series (HVHHmt) was most strongly correlated with the NDVI time series. While for Landsat-only the spatial and temporal accuracy of detected deforestation decreased significantly with increasing missing data, the accuracies for the fused NDVI-PALSAR case remained high and were observed to be above the NDVI- and PALSAR-only cases for all missing data percentages. For the fused NDVI-HVHHmt time series the overall accuracy was 95.5% with a 1.59 month mean time lag of detected changes.

While climate models are usually applied at coarse resolution, the energy balance studies, which are mainly focused on agricultural applications, require a high spatial resolution. In this context Landsat is one of the most used remote sensing sensors.   The albedo, estimated through the angular integration of the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), requires an appropriate angular sampling of the surface. However, Landsat sampling characteristics, with nearly constant observation geometry and low illumination variation, prevent from deriving a surface albedo product.   In this paper we present an algorithm to derive a Landsat surface albedo based on the BRDF parameters estimated from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) surface reflectance product (M{O,Y}D09) using the VJB method (Vermote, Justice, & Breon, 2009). We base our method on Landsat unsupervised classification to disaggregate the BRDF parameters to the Landsat spatial resolution. We tested the proposed algorithm over five different sites of the US Surface Radiation (SURFRAD) network and inter-compare our results with Shuai, Masek, Gao, and Schaaf (2011) method, which also provides Landsat albedo. The results show that with the proposed method we can derive the surface albedo with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.015 (7%). This result supposes an improvement of 5% in the RMSE compared to Shuai et al.\'s (2011) method (with a RMSE of 0.024, 12%) that is mainly determined by the correction of the negative bias (lower retrieved albedo than in situ data).

Field measurements recorded the dramatic biomass decrease from 2010 to 2011 and a biomass recovery in 2012 dominated by a decrease of live biomass, and the loss of marsh as part of the dieback event. Based on an established relationship, the near-infrared/red vegetation index (VI) and site-specific measurements delineated a contiguous expanse of marsh dieback encompassing 6649.9 ha of 18,2923 ha of S. alterniflora marshes within the study region. PoISAR data were transformed to variables used in biophysical mapping, and of this variable suite, the cross-polarization HV (horizontal send and vertical receive) backscatter was the best single indicator of marsh dieback and recovery. HV backscatter exhibited substantial and significant changes over the dieback and recovery period, tracked measured biomass changes, and significantly correlated with the live/dead biomass ratio. Within the context of regional trends, both HV and VI indicators started higher in pre-dieback marshes and exhibited substantially and statistically higher variability from year to year than that exhibited in the non-dieback marshes. That distinct difference allowed the capturing of the S. altemiflora marsh dieback and recovery; however, these changes were incorporated in a regional trend exhibiting similar but more subtle biomass composition changes.

Here we present a new active fire detection algorithm that fully exploits geostationary data\'s temporal dimension, including both for detecting actively burning fires and quantifying their fire radiative power (FRP). The approach uses a robust matching algorithm to model each pixels diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) in the middle infra-red (MIR) spectral band, the most important band for active fire detection. For each pixel, a Kalman filter (KF) is used to blend the set of basis DTCs with the actual geostationary observations during times of confirmed cloud-and fire-free measurements, allowing for estimates of the pixels true non-fire \'background\' signal to be provided throughout the day, even when a fire maybe present. This is different to the standard \'spatial contextual\' approach, where the non-fire background signal is estimated from nearby non-fire pixels. A series of spectral thresholds are then applied to the analyzed pixel in order to identify whether the actual observation departs sufficiently from the estimated non-fire signal to confidently suggest that the pixel contains an active fire. If it does, the difference between the fire pixel and non-fire background signal estimate in the MIR is used to estimate the fire radiative power (FRP) output. We apply this new \'Kalman Filter Algorithm\' (KFA) to one month of African imagery acquired by the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), which is carried onboard the geostationary Meteosat satellite. We compare the resulting active fire detections and FRPs to those produced using the prototype (offline) version of the \'spatial contextual\' based \'Fire Thermal Anomalies\' (FTA) algorithm, here termed the pFTA, now used to generate the operational SEVIRI FRP-PIXEL product in the EUMETSAT Land Surface Analysis Satellite Applications Facility (http://landsaf.meteo.pt/), and also compare results to simultaneous detections from the MODIS MOD14/MYD14 active fire products. The KFA shows some advantages over the pFTA algorithm, detecting a greater number of fire pixels, up to similar to 80% more at the peak of the diurnal fire cycle. These additional fire pixels are primarily low FRP fires (<30 MW), which results in the overall fire radiative energy (FRE) increasing by only 20% compared to the pFTA algorithm, though this is still a substantial difference. Comparison against simultaneous MODIS active fire observations confirms that the KFA detects more of the MODIS-detected active fires than does the pFTA (60% more), but at the expense of doubling the false alarm rate. Analysis of the ability of the KFA to aid in the estimation of FRP by providing a more certain estimate of the fire pixels background signal indicates a small 0.2 K reduction (rmsd) between the \'estimate\' of the background temperature and the \'truth\'. One limitation of the KFA approach currently is that it is computationally costly, and also requires the full day diurnal variation to be measured prior to the multi-temporal fire detection process. In its present form it is therefore unsuited to the generation of real-time products.   We recommend future work concentrate on extracting maximum performance and utility of geostationary active fire observations by blending both \'spatial contextual\' and \'multi-temporal\' approaches.

However, significant problems with the AVHRR calibration have been seen in two separate sources of early AVHRR data lack onboard calibration and observed trends and biases when the AVHRR radiances are compared with other accurate top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiances sources. In this paper, new calibration coefficients for channels 1 and 2 of the AVHRR sensors onboard 16 NOM satellites from TIROS-N, NOAA-6 to NOAA-19, and Metop-A, B are reported. The calibration slopes are derived based on several pseudo-invariant sites endorsed by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS). Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) channels 6 and 8 radiance data are applied in characterizing the bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDF) of the TOA reflectance over the employed targets, and MODTRAN simulations are carried out to parameterize the spectral channel adjustment factors (SBAFs) between SeaWiFS and each AVHRR sensor to eliminate the spectral response differences over different targets considering the impacts of observing geometries and gaseous absorption. The BRDFs and SBAFs are then applied to filtered AVHRR time-series to generate time series of calibration slopes presented in the form of quadratic polynomials as a function of time and applied in the recalibration of AVHRR data records. Comparisons with calibration coefficients generated from other products exhibit preferable validity and consistency, and notable incoherence and trend in the TOA reflectance time series of the L1B AVHRR data over each site from all the launched NOAA series polar orbiting satellites are largely eliminated after the recalibration. The long-term and inter-sensor consistent AVHRR data records after this post calibration can provide valuable insight into global climate changes since 1978.

While climate is often the primary driver for global to regional scale tree species distributions, modeling of presence and abundance patterns at finer scales, and in landscapes with less topographic variation may require predictors that capture biotic processes and local abiotic conditions. Proxies for biotic and disturbance processes may be captured by a combination of multispectral remote sensing and light detection and ranging (WAR) data. LiDAR data have shown great potential for capturing three-dimensional (3D) characteristics of the forest canopy and a number of these characteristics may have strong relationships with drivers of local tree species distributions. The objective of this study was to investigate the importance of remote sensing derived variables related to biotic and disturbance processes in predicting fine-scale abundance patterns of several dominant tree species in a mixed mature forest in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Forest Region, Ontario, Canada. Boosted regression trees, an ensemble classification and regression algorithm, was used to compare tree species abundance models that included LiDAR derived topographic variables with models that included spectral and LiDAR derived topographic and vegetation variables. Average model fit (rescaled Nagelkerke R-2) and predictive accuracy (correlation) improved from 0.12 to 0.63 and 0.25 to 0.71, respectively, when spectral and LiDAR derived vegetation variables were included in the tree species abundance models. This indicates that these variables capture some of the variance in local tree species\' abundance distributions generated by biotic and disturbance processes in a landscape with limited topographic and climatic variation. Decreased model performance at higher tree species\' abundances additionally suggests that our models do not capture all of the local drivers of tree species\' abundance. Variables related to historical and current silvicultural practices may be missing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

IMS detects open water earlier and freeze onset later than the automated microwave products, and also allows for the detection of opening, and the subsequent closing, of leads that the other datasets are unable to detect. Using RADARSAT-1 imagery for evaluation, IMS is shown to outperform the other datasets for the timing and extent of the first open water detection. IMS identified between 17 and 53% greater open water coverage than the other datasets in the narrow channels of the Northwest Passage (Barrow Strait). In order to further the use of IMS for sea ice applications, we derived two new spatial datasets using the full record of IMS data (4 km: 2004-present 24 km: 1997-present): melt duration to open water (duration from melt onset detected with SSM/I passive microwave until open water detected by IMS) and first year ice cover duration (duration from freeze onset until open water, both detected by IMS).

This information is used to retrieve values of the sea surface salinity (SSS) and soil moisture; two variables whose observation is a key to better understand the oceanic component of the water cycle. A hierarchy of SSS products has been defined in the SMOS data processing chain. This work focuses on the so-called Level 3 (binned maps of SSS) and Level 4 (products combining SMOS data with any other source of information). The objective is to illustrate the feasibility of using data assimilation to produce Level 4 maps of sea surface salinity. The numerical model will increase the geophysical coherence of SMOS data as a dynamical interpolator. Here, the employment of data assimilation differs from its usual applications (improving model outputs for example). Indeed, the numerical model will interpolate the observations according to the general laws of fluid mechanics and, if possible, reduce the error contained in the original observations. The data assimilation method analyzed is a nudging algorithm. The domain of application for this feasibility study is the Northeast subtropical Atlantic gyre, a challenging region due to the presence of a large amount of noise that deteriorates the SMOS data. The main sources of errors are the vicinity of large landmasses that introduce a spurious bias, and the presence of a significant amount of artificial radio frequency interferences (RFI). While the Quality Controls already set up in the SMOS processing chain do filter the retrievals containing too large errors, wrong data are still present in Level 3 maps. Despite this difficulty, the results provide meaningful SMOS SSS Level 4 products in terms of their geophysical coherence (estimated using singularity analysis) and better agreement with in-situ data than Level 3 product.

Using these data we investigated the changes in the vegetation photosynthetic activity in the Asia-Pacific (AP) (including Australia, South East Asia, China, and the Pacific Coast of North America) region, by discerning gradual changes into two key metrics: 1) the cumulative annual NDVI in each year and 2) the seasonality or variance in that index. We then assessed changes using break and turning points using three statistical models (least-square linear, expanded paired-consecutive linear and piecewise regression models). We found that the AP region overall experienced increasing NDVI from 1982 through 2011 with an average rate of 530 x 10(-4) NDVI yr(-1) (0.13% yr(-1)). The annual NDVI increased from 1982 at a faster rate of 26.14 x 10(-4) NDVI yr-1 (0.65% yr(-1)) until a break in the trend after 1991 (after that the trend reduced to 5.78 x 10(-4) NDVI yr(-1)). In the Asia-Australia (AA) subarea of the AP, vegetation greening slowly increased at 8.71 x 10(-4) NDVI yr(-1) before 2003 and then increased to 28.30 x 10(-4) NDVI yr(-1) after 2003. In contrast, in the North America (NA) subarea NDVI rapidly increased initially at 18.72 x 10(-4) NDVI yr(-1) before 1992 and then marginally increased (3.96 x 10(-4) NDVI yr(-1)) after 1992. The turning points were found to be 2008 and 1987 for the AA and NA subareas respectively. Analysis of monthly NDVI data showed that the trends were positive for most of the months of the study period, particularly during the growing season. Geospatial analyses demonstrated that cumulative annual NDVI and the variance or seasonality across the large AP region varied across the different subareas. As well, we found evidence for different spatial patterns of the NDVI changes with strong spatial heterogeneity in the patterns of the break and turning points. This suggests complex and nonlinear responses of vegetation photosynthetic activity to regional climatic changes and other drivers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

It is important to quantify, map and monitor forest dynamics resulting from natural and anthropogenic processes over time periods appropriate to the temporal scale of change as well as to land management goals and decision making. This paper presents temporal trend analyses of temperate mixed forest dynamics in Gatineau Park, Quebec, Canada, using a time series of Landsat 5 TM scenes. Several vegetation indices were first evaluated as indicators of field measured vegetation abundance parameters such as leaf area index, canopy openness, DBH, and basal area. Of these, Tasseled Cap Wetness (TON) provided the best relationships (e.g., r = 0.81 against LAI) and it differentiated between coniferous, mixed and deciduous forests. Thirteen clear sky 5 TM scenes from the growing seasons of 1987 to 2010 were relatively calibrated and assembled into an image time-series. TCW applied to the image time-series followed by Theil-Sen and Contextual Mann-Kendall trend analysis detected subtle and gradual field-verified forest change. Gradual and abrupt forest decline or regrowth periods were identified; over the full period, 641 ha (1.8% of the park) exhibited statistically significant growth, and 689 ha (1.9%) exhibited decline. Mapping the timing, location, magnitude, and duration of forest change will help inform land management policy and actions within Gatineau Park and such methods may be applied in other similar forests.

Ground in situ measurements of PM2.5 concentrations are considered to be the gold standard, but are time-consuming and costly. Satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) products have the potential to supplement the ground monitoring networks to provide spatiotemporally-resolved PM2.5 exposure estimates. However, the coarse resolutions (e.g., 10 km) of the satellite AOD products used in previous studies make it very difficult to estimate urban-scale PM2.5 characteristics that are crucial to population-based PM2.5 health effects research. In this paper, a new aerosol product with 1 km spatial resolution derived by the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm was examined using a two-stage spatial statistical model with meteorological fields (e.g., wind speed) and land use parameters (e.g., forest cover, road length, elevation, and point emissions) as ancillary variables to estimate daily mean PM2.5 concentrations. The study area is the southeastern U.S., and data for 2003 were collected from various sources. A cross validation approach was implemented for model validation. We obtained R-2 of 0.83, mean prediction error (MPE) of 1.89 mu g/m(3), and square root of the mean squared prediction errors (RMSPE) of 2.73 mu g/m(3) in model fitting, and R-2 of 0.67, MPE of 2.54 mu g/m(3), and RMSPE of 3.88 mu g/m(3) in cross validation. Both model fitting and cross validation indicate a good fit between the dependent variable and predictor variables. The results showed that 1 km spatial resolution MAIAC AOD can be used to estimate PM2.5 concentrations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In traditional post-stratification methods, the stratification variable must be known at the population level. When suitable covariates are available at the population level, an alternative approach consists of fitting a model on the covariates, making predictions for the population and then stratifying on these predicted values. This method is called Endogenous Post-Stratification Estimation (EPSE) and it is well suited for applications using remote sensing data. In this article, we investigate the performance of EPSE in a realistic setting using data from the United States Forest Service Forest Inventory Analysis and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus. This article has three specific objectives: first, to evaluate the statistical properties of EPSE when using linear regression, spline regression, and the machine learning tool Random Forest to predict tree canopy cover using remote sensing and Geographic Information System data; second, to investigate the effect on the EPSE variance estimator using estimated stratum boundaries instead of fixed stratum boundaries; and third, to investigate the effect on the EPSE variance estimator when optimizing the stratum boundaries to minimize the variance estimate. The main findings of this article are that the EPSE variance estimator performs well using Random Forests, but can underestimate the true variance if an optimization is performed on the stratum boundaries in an attempt to minimize the variance estimate. This result supports the use of the EPSE estimator using remote sensing data in cases where there is no optimization on the variance estimator. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In 2003, Ningxia was the first province to implement a province-wide grazing ban. The effect of this ban is contentious at all levels of government and has become a topic of public concern. Grassland desertification is the most direct indicator of the effect of the grazing ban. We selected 14 counties and cities in north-central Ningxia as the study area. A desertification classification and grading system for Ningxia\'s grassland was then designed based on fieldwork and expert review. Using the Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) and decision-tree methods, we interpreted Landsat TM/ETM + images of the study area during four years: 1993, 2000, 2006 and 2011. The following results were obtained: from 1993 to 2011, the area of desertified grassland in north-central Ningxia decreased gradually from 8702 km(2) in 1993 to 7485 km(2) in 2011, a decrease of 13.98%; the degree of desertification gradually decreased from 3573 km(2) of severely desertified grassland in 1993 to 1450 km(2) in 2011, a decrease of 59.41%; desertified grassland vegetation was restored rapidly during 2000-2006 and 2006-2011, reducing the total area of desertified grassland annually by 1.87 and 0.61%, respectively; finally, the area of severely desertified grassland decreased annually by 5.78 and 6.28% during 2000-2006 and 2006-2011, respectively. These results show that the region-wide grazing ban, together with other ecological engineering measures, has helped reverse desertification and promote the restoration of grassland vegetation.

Our study investigates possibilities and benefits of relating soil moisture products from remote sensing and hydrological modeling to information on total water storage change from satellite gravimetry. We use soil moisture data from the active satellite sensor ASCAT and the hydrological model WGHM as well as satellite gravity field observations from the GRACE mission. First we apply a data harmonization procedure to equalize the distinct data representations and formats of those data sets. Then we perform a correlation analysis. The results show correlations close to one between GRACE and soil moisture data specifically for humid and temperate regions. A comparison of correlation coefficients from different data pairs highlights that in arid environments total water storage from GRACE corresponds better to surface soil moisture captured by ASCAT than to total soil moisture from WGHM. In humid and temperate regimes the observation is reversed. Furthermore regions could be identified where the input data of the WGHM might be of low quality, producing higher correlations between ASCAT and GRACE than between ASCAT and WGHM. We therefore conclude that GRACE data can deliver valuable information for the quality assessment of soil moisture products and provide a link to their contribution to continental water storage.

The prevailing southerly winds stretched the erupted plume toward the Artic pole, thus preventing the ash cloud to move toward continental Europe and threatening the airline traffic (different from the less explosive Eyjafjoll eruption on April and May 2010). The 2011 Grimsvotn eruption has been continuously monitored by the Keflavik C-band weather radar, located at a distance of about 260 km from the volcano vent. The VARR methodology is summarized and applied to available radar time series to estimate the coarse ash particle category, volume, fallout, concentration and the plume maximum height, every 5 min within the volcano vent surroundings (i.e. an area of about 100 x 100 km(2) around the volcano). Due to the large distance from the volcano, fine-grained ash cannot be detected and estimated by the Keflavik C-band weather radar. Estimates of the eruption discharge rate, based on the retrieved ash plume top height, are provided together with an evaluation of the total erupted mass and volume. Deposited ash at ground is also retrieved from radar data by empirically reconstructing the vertical profile of radar reflectivity and estimating the near-surface ash fallout. Radar-based ash retrieval results can be compared with available satellite microwave radiometric imagery in order to show the potential contribution and limitations of these microwave remote sensing products to the understanding and modeling of explosive volcanic ash eruptions. Spaceborne microwave brightness temperatures show a correlation with ash columnar content, derived from VARR, depending on the millimeter-wave frequency and on the spatial averaging. Microphysical sensitivity of satellite microwave brightness temperatures to plume fine and coarse ash suggests their exploitation in synergy with satellite thermal infrared radiometer and ground-based microwave radar observations.

An error-adjusted estimator of area can be easily produced once an accuracy assessment has been performed and an error matrix constructed. The estimator presented is a stratified estimator which is applicable to data acquired using popular sampling designs such as stratified random, simple random and systematic (the stratified estimator is often labeled a poststratified estimator for the latter two designs). A confidence interval for the area of land change should also be provided to quantify the uncertainty of the change area estimate. The uncertainty of the change area estimate, as expressed via the confidence interval, can then subsequently be incorporated into an uncertainty analysis for applications using land change area as an input (e.g., a carbon flux model). Accuracy assessments published for land change studies should report the information required to produce the stratified estimator of change area and to construct confidence intervals. However, an evaluation of land change articles published between 2005 and 2010 in two remote sensing journals revealed that accuracy assessments often fail to include this key information. We recommend that land change maps should be accompanied by an accuracy assessment that includes a clear description of the sampling design (including sample size and, if relevant, details of stratification), an error matrix, the area or proportion of area of each category according to the map, and descriptive accuracy measures such as user\'s, producer\'s and overall accuracy. Furthermore, mapped areas should be adjusted to eliminate bias attributable to map classification error and these error-adjusted area estimates should be accompanied by confidence intervals to quantify the sampling variability of the estimated area. Using data from the published literature, we illustrate how to produce error-adjusted point estimates and confidence intervals of land change areas. A simple analysis of uncertainty based on the confidence bounds for land change area is applied to a carbon flux model to illustrate numerically that variability in the land change area estimate can have a dramatic effect on model outputs.

It is understood that REDD mechanisms must be supported by forest assessment programs that can monitor the carbon stocks by carbon pools and human activities. Reporting at a national level will be required but many countries are likely to benefit from more local monitoring programs within the countries as well, gauging the effects of national policies and local financial mechanisms aimed at reaching goals for emission control for the nation as a whole. Field-based forest sample surveys are typically used as support for national reporting purposes. However, monitoring within the countries will require huge investments in field surveys to provide reliable change estimates with high spatial and temporal resolution. Airborne scanning LiDAR has emerged as a promising tool to provide auxiliary data for sample surveys aiming at estimation of above-ground tree biomass. The aim of this study was to demonstrate how \"wall-to-wall\" LiDAR data can be used for change estimation. Estimators for areal changes of categories representing human activities such as \"deforestation\", \"degradation\" and \"untouched\" were presented. Corresponding estimators for variance were also provided. Furthermore, it was shown how net change in biomass for the defined activity categories and for the entire area of interest can be estimated from a field sample survey with and without support of LiDAR remote sensing data and how the uncertainty can be quantified by corresponding variance estimates. In a case study in a small boreal forest area in southeastern Norway (852.6 ha) a probability sample of 176 field sample plots distributed according to a stratified systematic design was measured twice over an 11 year period. Corresponding multi-temporal scanning LiDAR data were also available. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to predict change category for every LiDAR grid cell in the area, and areal changes were estimated from the pure field sample and with the support of the LiDAR data applying model-assisted estimators. The standard errors of the areal change estimates were reduced by 43-75% by adding LiDAR data to the estimation. The change categories were used as post-strata in a subsequent estimation of net change in biomass. The standard errors of the biomass change estimates for the respective change categories were reduced by 18-84% compared to the pure field survey when using LiDAR data as auxiliary information in a model-assisted estimation procedure, which translates to a need for 1.5-38.7 times as many field plots when relying only on the field data. For the entire area of interest, the standard error of the overall net change in biomass was reduced by 57% compared to the uncertainty reported from the pure field survey. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Traditional one-dimensional (1D) plane-parallel atmospheric radiative transfer models which use the independent pixel approximation (IPA) can only consider two extreme conditions, i.e., either cloud-free or overcast cases. In this paper, two cloud fraction related factors (hemispherical effective cloud fraction and regional cloud fraction) are calculated and incorporated into MODTRAN 4 (one of the most popular radiative transfer packages) to simulate the surface shortwave radiation components and the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance for all possible solar-cloud-viewing geometries. The accuracy of this modified solar radiative transfer model (named as MODTRAN-CF) is consistent with its prototype (MODTRAN 4) which has been widely used and validated in radiative transfer modeling. Some field measurements are used to validate the superiority of MODTRAN-CF. For further understanding and simplifying of this physical model, a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method is employed to analyze the effect of model parameters on each surface shortwave radiation component. Five parameters including solar zenith angle, surface albedo, hemispherical effective cloud fraction, ground altitude and atmospheric visibility show non-negligible impacts on almost all surface shortwave fluxes, which indicates that these five parameters should be carefully considered in the future modeling of the surface shortwave radiation fluxes. Two cloud optical thickness related parameters (cloud extinction coefficient and cloud thickness) exhibit obvious importance only under cloudy illumination condition especially with optically thin clouds. These findings on the improved model will enhance our knowledge on how to accurately model the surface shortwave radiation fluxes under all sky conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

To avoid or to minimize the hazards associated with sand dunes, it is critical to determine their rates and patterns of migration at high accuracy and over wide spatial coverage. This is, however, a real challenge using field work and traditional remote sensing approaches. The co-registration of optically sensed images and correlation (COSI-Corr) complements traditional approaches to provide accurate measurements at wide spatial coverage. Applying the COSI-Corr technique to two SPOT 4 panchromatic images acquired above North Sinai, we measured lateral migration of 6.0 to 19.4 m/yr with an average of 7.7 m/yr, and 9.3 to 15.0 m/yr with an average of 11.9 m/yr for the whole barchans dune areas and a selected sample of barchan dunes, respectively. We also detected that the lateral movements along the crest lines of linear dunes ranged from 4.0 to 20.1 m/yr with an average of 6.8 m/yr for the whole area occupied by linear dunes. For a selected linear dune within the study area, the lateral migration of peaks and saddles along the crest lines ranged from 5.5 to 16.7 m/yr with an average of 12.4 m/yr. The lateral migration of both barchans dunes and linear dunes showed high spatial variability. Validation of these results against the previously measured migration rates indicated high degree of accuracy of the technique. In addition, the displacement field produced from the correlation indicated that the direction of sand dune movements occurred towards the east and southeast, which is well aligned with the previously determined sand dune drifting potentials.

Current capabilities to model photosynthesis, however, are limited by accurate enough representations of the complexity of the underlying biochemical processes and the numerous environmental constraints imposed upon plant primary production. A potentially powerful alternative to model photosynthesis through these indirect observations is the use of multi-angular satellite data to infer light-use efficiency (epsilon) directly from spectral reflectance properties in connection with canopy shadow fractions. Hall et al. (this issue) introduced a new approach for predicting gross ecosystem production that would allow the use of such observations in a data assimilation mode to obtain spatially explicit variations in epsilon from infrequent polar-orbiting satellite observations, while meteorological data are used to account for the more dynamic responses of epsilon to variations in environmental conditions caused by changes in weather and illumination. In this second part of the study we implement and validate the approach of Hall et al. (this issue) across an ecologically diverse array of eight flux-tower sites in North America using data acquired from the Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (CHRIS) and eddy-flux observations. Our results show significantly enhanced estimates of epsilon and therefore cumulative gross ecosystem production (GEP) over the course of one year at all examined sites. We also demonstrate that epsilon is greatly heterogeneous even across small study areas. Data assimilation and direct inference of GEP from space using a new, proposed sensor could therefore be a significant step towards closing the terrestrial carbon cycle. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

One objective of the study was to develop classification procedures including accurate corrections of waveform data for environmental and lidar system factors, to make them useful for mapping areas with variable water quality. Other objectives were to evaluate the classification accuracy using a combination of depth-derived variables and additional waveform variables, and to compare the results with the classification accuracy obtained when classification is performed using depth-derived variables only (without additional waveform variables). The analysis was based on two waveform variables (bottom pulse width and pulse area), in addition to two depth-derived variables (slope and depth standard deviation). The classification was performed using a model-based maximum likelihood approach. The classification models were created and evaluated with lidar data taken from locations documented with underwater video. The results show that inclusion of the waveform variables significantly improved the classification accuracy. Classification of the seabed into three classes (hard substrate; soft substrate with high vegetation; and soft substrate with low vegetation) had an overall accuracy of 86% when evaluated with an independent data set. This highlights the potential of data from airborne lidar, including waveform data (bottom pulse width and pulse area), for mapping shallow seabed habitats in coastal areas. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

With this research we further develop our previously published (object-based) inversion approach [Atzberger, 2004, RSE 93: 53-67] and evaluate it against simulated Sentinel-2 data. The proposed RTM inversion takes advantage of the geostatistical fact that the biophysical characteristics of nearby pixels are generally more similar than those at a larger distance. This leads to spectral co-variations in the n-dimensional spectral features space, which can be used for regularization purposes. A simple two-step inversion based on PROSPECT + SAIL generated look-up-tables is presented that can be easily adapted to other radiative transfer models. The approach takes into account the spectral signatures of adjacent pixels in gliding (3 x 3) windows. Using a set of leaf area index (LAI) measurements (n = 26) acquired over alfalfa, sugar beet and garlic crops of the Barrax test site (Spain), it is demonstrated that the proposed regularization using neighbourhood information yields more accurate results compared to the pixel-based inversion. With the proposed regularization, the RMSE between ground measured and Sentinel-2 derived LAI is 0.54 m(2)/m(2) and hence significantly lower compared to the RMSE of the standard inversion approach (RMSE: 1.46 m(2)/m(2)) and also of higher accuracy compared to a scaled NDVI model (RMSE: 0.90 m(2)/m(2)). At the same time, a positive effect on the modelled leaf chlorophyll content (Cab) is noticed, albeit too few field measurements were available for deriving statistically sound results. For the other retrieved biophysical parameters such as leaf dry matter content (C-m), soil brightness (alpha(soil)) and average leaf angle (ALA) the proposed algorithm yields more plausible and spatially consistent results. Altogether the findings confirm the positive effect of regularizing the model inversion using spatial constraints. As for any other inversion strategy, the approach requires a RTM well suited for the crop under study. For three additional crops (maize, potatoes and sunflower), the forward modelling with field measured LAI did not match the observed signatures.

The tau-omega model is a zero-order RT solution that accounts for vegetation effects with two vegetation parameters (vegetation opacity and single-scattering albedo), which represent the canopy as a whole. This approach inherently ignores multiple-scattering effects and, therefore, has a limited validity depending on the level of scattering within the canopy. The fact that the scattering from large forest components such as branches and trunks is significant at L-band requires that zero-order vegetation parameters be evaluated (compared) along with their theoretical definitions to provide a better understanding of these parameters in the retrieval algorithms as applied to trees.   This paper compares the effective vegetation opacities, computed from multi-angular pine tree brightness temperature data, against the results of two independent approaches that provide theoretical and measured optical depths. These two techniques are based on forward scattering theory and radar corner reflector measurements, respectively. The results indicate that the effective vegetation opacity values are smaller than but of similar magnitude to both radar and theoretical estimates. The effective opacity of the zero-order model is thus set equal to the theoretical opacity and an explicit expression for the effective albedo is then obtained from the zero- and first-order RT model comparison. The resultant albedo is found to have a similar magnitude as the effective albedo value obtained from brightness temperature measurements. However, both are less than half of the single-scattering albedo estimated using the theoretical calculations (0.5-0.6 for tree canopies at L-band). This lower observed effective albedo balances the scattering darkening effect of the large theoretical single-scattering albedo with a first-order multiple-scattering contribution. The retrieved effective albedo is different from theoretical definitions and not the albedo of single forest elements anymore, but it becomes a global parameter, which depends on all the processes taking place within the canopy, including multiple-scattering and canopy ground interaction.

This research combined satellite and ground data to quantify the impact of the oil and dispersant on the salt marshes in terms of their photosynthetic capacity and physiological status over a large spatial scale. Two of the most important marsh biophysical characteristics, including distribution of canopy chlorophyll content and above ground green biomass, were monitored across the southeastern LA coast during the salt marsh growing season (May-October) of 2009 (pre-spill) and 2010 (post-spill) in order to compare and isolate the spill impacted areas. The initial assessment showed that there was a significant post-spill increase in areas with reduced biomass and canopy chlorophyll (>400 km(2)) during the 2010 growing season compared to 50-65 km(2) during the 2009 growing season. Phenological analysis of the post oil-spill data revealed a significant decrease in the magnitude of biomass and canopy chlorophyll during the peak of the 2010 growing season. June was consistently found to be the worst month in terms of salt marsh health across LA over the 2010 phenological cycle followed by the initial signs of recovery along the fringing marsh areas proximal to the shoreline that were first impacted by oil. Interior marsh patches exhibited persistent signs of stress towards the end of the growing season. Extensive reduction in photosynthetic activity was observed during the peak of the growing season, particularly in Plaquemines Parish and St. Bernard Parish. The products generated through this study successfully delineate the critical hotspots of marsh stress so that prioritization of areas needing immediate restoration can be performed.

Monitoring phytoplankton in these areas using Ocean Colour Remote Sensing is hampered by the high spatial and temporal variations in absorption and scattering properties. In this paper we demonstrate a clustering method based on specific-absorption properties that gives accurate water quality products from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). A total of 468 measurements of Chlorophyll a (Chla), Total Suspended Material (TSM), specific- (sIOP) and inherent optical properties (IOP) were measured in the North Sea between April 1999 and September 2004. Chla varied from 0.2 to 35 mg m(-3). TSM from 0.2 to 75 g m(-3) and absorption properties of coloured dissolved organic material at 442 nm (a(CDOM)(442)) was 0.02 to 0.26 m(-1). The variation in absorption properties of phytoplankton (a(ph)) and non-algal particles (a(NAP)) were an order of magnitude greater than that for a(ph) normalized to Chla (a(ph)*) and a(NAP) normalized to TSM (a(NAP)*). Hierarchical cluster analysis on a(ph)*, a(NAP). and a(CDOM) reduced this large data set to three groups of high a(NAP)*-a(CDOM). low a(ph)* situated close to the coast, medium values further offshore and low a(NAP)* a(CDOM), high a(ph)* in open ocean and Dutch coastal waters. The median sIOP of each cluster were used to parameterize a semi-analytical algorithm to retrieve concentrations of Chla, TSM and a(CDOM)(442) from MERIS data. A further 60 measurements of normalized water leaving radiance (nL(w)), Chla, TSM, a(CDOM)(442) and a(NAP)(442) collected between 2003 and 2006 were used to assess the accuracy of the satellite products. The regionalized MERIS algorithm showed improved performance in Chla and a(CDOM)(442) estimates with relative percentage differences of 29 and 8% compared to 34 and 134% for standard MERIS Chla and a(dg)(442) products, and similar retrieval for TSM at concentrations >1 g(-3).

Subsiding areas are distributed as either concentrated circular patterns corresponding to intense groundwater extraction (e.g., Rio Grande meander area; maximum deformation of 7-8 cm/yr) or as elongate patterns oriented along NE-SW or E-W directions and parallel to major faults (i.e. La Colina, La Paloma and Central Camionera; maximum deformation of 4-5 cm/yr). High subsidence rates are also measured on the hanging wall of major normal faults, where the thickest sequences of compressible Quaternary sediments crop out. Strong contrasts in subsidence rates are identified across major faults, suggesting that these faults act as barriers to horizontal movement of groundwater. Subsidence rates show a weak positive correlation with the total thickness of compressible deposits, while there is no correlation with either water extraction rates or changes in static water level. Time-lapse analysis of ground deformation with conventional InSAR reveals temporal variations of subsidence north of the La Canna fault and the Rio Grande meander area. For this latter area, cross sections and 3D perspectives of InSAR measures, and analysis of subsidence rates through time, show an acceleration of subsidence velocities since 2005, corresponding to recasing of the Prados Verdes II well, whose location is centered in the area of highest subsidence.

The ATSR Saharan dust index (ASDI) utilises only the thermal infrared channels and may therefore be applied consistently to the entire ATSR data record (1991 to present), for both day time and night time observations. The derivation of the ASDI is based on a principal component (PC) analysis (PCA) of two unique pairs of channel brightness temperature differences (BTDS). In 2-D space (i.e. BTD vs BTD), it is found that the loci of data unaffected by aerosol are confined to a single axis of variability. In contrast, the loci of aerosol-contaminated data fall off-axis, shifting in a direction that is approximately orthogonal to the clear-sky axis. The ASDI is therefore defined to be the second PC, where the first PC accounts for the clear-sky variability. The primary ASDI utilises the ATSR nadir and forward-view observations at 11 and 12 mu m (ASDI2). A secondary, three-channel nadir-only ASDI (ASDI3) is also defined for situations where data from the forward view are not available. Empirical and theoretical analyses suggest that ASDI is well correlated with aerosol optical depth (AOD: correlation r is typically >0.7) and provides an effective tool for detecting desert mineral dust Overall. ASDI2 is found to be more effective than ASDI3, with the latter being sensitive only to very high dust loading. In addition, use of ASDI3 is confined to night time observations as it relies on data from the 3.7 mu m channel, which is sensitive to reflected solar radiation. This highlights the benefits of having data from both a nadir- and a forward-view for this particular approach to aerosol detection. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Good, E.

The objectives of the mission are 1) to quantify the magnitude and distribution of forest biomass globally to improve resource assessment, carbon accounting and carbon models, and 2) to monitor and quantify changes in terrestrial forest biomass globally, on an annual basis or better, leading to improved estimates of terrestrial carbon sources (primarily from deforestation); and terrestrial carbon sinks due to forest regrowth and afforestation. These science objectives require the mission to measure above-ground forest biomass from 70 degrees N to 56 degrees Sat spatial scale of 100-200 m, with error not exceeding +/- 20% or +/- 10 t ha(-1) and forest height with error of +/- 4 m. To meet the measurement requirements, the mission will carry a P-Band polarimetric SAR (centre frequency 435 MHz with 6 MHz bandwidth) with interferometric capability, operating in a dawn-dusk orbit with a constant incidence angle (in the range of 25 degrees-35 degrees) and a 25-45 day repeat cycle. During its 5-year lifetime, the mission will be capable of providing both direct measurements of biomass derived from intensity data and measurements of forest height derived from polarimetric interferometry. The design of the BIOMASS mission spins together two main observational strands: (1) the long heritage of airborne observations in tropical, temperate and boreal forest that have demonstrated the capabilities of P-band SAR for measuring forest biomass; (2) new developments in recovery of forest structure including forest height from Pol-InSAR, and, crucially, the resistance of P-band to temporal decorrelation, which makes this frequency uniquely suitable for biomass measurements with a single repeat-pass satellite. These two complementary measurement approaches are combined in the single BIOMASS sensor, and have the satisfying property that increasing biomass reduces the sensitivity of the former approach while increasing the sensitivity of the latter. This paper surveys the body of evidence built up over the last decade, from a wide range of airborne experiments, which illustrates the ability of such a sensor to provide the required measurements.   At present, the BIOMASS P-band radar appears to be the only sensor capable of providing the necessary global knowledge about the world\'s forest biomass and its changes. In addition, this first chance to explore the Earth\'s environment with a long wavelength satellite SAR is expected to make yield new information in a range of geoscience areas, including subsurface structure in arid lands and polar ice, and forest inundation dynamics.

Vegetation structure information is particularly important for avian habitat models and has largely been unavailable for large areas at the desired resolution. Airborne LiDAR, with its combination of relatively broad coverage and fine resolution provides existing new opportunities to map vegetation structure and hence avian habitat. Our goal was to model the richness of forest songbirds using forest structure information obtained from LiDAR data. In deciduous forests of southern Wisconsin, USA, we used discrete-return airborne LiDAR to derive forest structure metrics related to the height and density of vegetation returns, as well as composite variables that captured major forest structural elements. We conducted point counts to determine total forest songbird richness and the richness of foraging, nesting, and forest edge-related habitat guilds. A suite of 35 LiDAR variables were used to model bird species richness using best-subsets regression and we used hierarchical partitioning analysis to quantify the explanatory power of each variable in the multivariate models. Songbird species richness was correlated most strongly with LiDAR variables related to canopy and midstory height and midstory density (R-2=0.204, p<0.001). Richness of species that nest in the midstory was best explained by canopy height variables (R-2=0.197, p<0.001). Species that forage on the ground responded to mean canopy height and the height of the lower canopy (R-2=0.149, p<0.005) while aerial foragers had higher richness where the canopy was tall and dense and the midstory more sparse (R-2=0.216. p<0.001). Richness of edge-preferring species was greater where there were fewer vegetation returns but higher density in the understory (R-2=0.153, p<0.005). Forest interior specialists responded positively to a tall canopy, developed midstory, and a higher proportion of vegetation returns (R-2=0.195, p<0.001). LiDAR forest structure metrics explained between 15 and 20% of the variability in richness within deciduous forest songbird communities. This variability was associated with vertical structure alone and shows how LiDAR can provide a source of complementary predictive data that can be incorporated in models of wildlife habitat associations across broad geographical extents.

For the whole study area, forest structural parameters including tree height (Ht) (m), first branch height (FBH) (m), crown width (ON) (m) and stand density (SD) (trees ha(-1)) were derived by stepwise multiple linear regressions of ground-based forest measurements and height quantiles and fractional canopy cover (f(c)) derived from the low density LiDAR data. The high density LiDAR data, which covered a much smaller area than the low density LiDAR data, were used to relate SPOT-5\'s reflectance to the effective plant area index (PAIe) of the forest. This was done by linear spectrum decomposition and Li-Strahler geometric-optical models. The result of the SPOT-5 spectrum decomposition was applied to the whole area to calculate PAIe (and leaf area index LAI). Then, four roughness models were applied to the study area with these vegetation data derived from the LiDAR and SPOT-5 as input. For validation, measurements at an eddy covariance site in the study area were used. Finally, the four models were compared by plotting histograms of the accumulative distribution of modeled d and z(0m) in the study area. The results showed that the model using by frontal area index (FAI) produced best d estimate, and the model using both LAI and FM generated the best z(0m). Furthermore, all models performed much better when the representative tree height was Lorey\'s mean height instead of using an arithmetic mean. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Historically, temporal composites of satellite data, ranging from 8 days to 16 days, have been used as a starting point for satellite-derived phenology data sets. In this study we assess how the temporal resolution of such composites affects the estimation of the start of season (SOS) by: 1) calibrating a relationship between satellite derived SOS with in situ leaf unfolding (LU) of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) across Canada and 2) quantifying the sensitivity of calibrated satellite SOS estimates and trends, over Canadian broadleaf forests, to the temporal resolution of NDVI data. SOS estimates and trends derived from daily NDVI data were compared to SOS estimates and trends derived from multiday NDVI composites that retain the exact date of the maximum NDVI value or that assume the midpoint of the multiday interval as the observation date. In situ observations of LU dates were acquired from the PlantWatch Canada network. A new Canadian database of cloud and snow screened daily 1-km resolution National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration advanced very high resolution radiometer surface reflectance images was used as input satellite data. The mean absolute errors of SOS dates with respect to in situ LU dates ranged between 13 and 40 days. SOS estimates from NDVI composites that retain the exact date of the maximum NDVI value had smaller errors (similar to 13 to 20 days). The sensitivity analysis reinforced these findings: SOS estimates from NDVI composites that use the exact date had smaller absolute deviations from the LU date (0 to 5 days) than the SOS estimates from NDVI composites that use the midpoint (-2 to -27 days). The SOS trends between 1985 and 2007 were not sensitive to the temporal resolution or compositing methods. However, SOS trends at individual ecozones showed significant differences with the SOS trends from daily NDVI data (Taiga plains and the Pacific maritime zones). Overall, our results suggest that satellite based estimates of vegetation green-up dates should preferably use sub-sampled NDVI composites that include the exact observation date of the maximum NDVI to minimize errors in both. SOS estimates and SOS trend analyses. For trend analyses alone, any of the compositing methods could be used, preferably with composite intervals of less than 28 days. This is an important finding, as it suggests that existing long-term 10-day or 15-day NDVI composites could be used for SOS trend analyses over broadleaf forests in Canada or similar areas. Future studies will take advantage of the growing in situ phenology networks to improve the validation of satellite derived green-up dates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

A sampling design stratified by an auxiliary variable correlated with forest cover change has this adaptability. A global stratified random sample can be augmented by additional sample units within a region selected by the same stratified protocol and the resulting sample constitutes a stratified random sample of the region. Stratified sampling allows increasing the sample size in a region by a few to many additional sample units. The additional sample units can be effectively allocated to strata to reduce the standard errors of the regional estimates, even though these strata were not initially constructed for the objective of regional estimation. A complete coverage map of deforestation within the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) is used as a population to evaluate precision of regional estimates obtained by augmenting a global stratified random sample. The standard errors of the regional estimates for the BLA and states within the BLA obtained from the augmented stratified design were generally smaller than those attained by simple random sampling and systematic sampling.

Monitoring of evergreen coniferous forest is more difficult than monitoring of deciduous forest, as the new buds only account for a small proportion of the green biomass, and the shoot elongation process is relatively slow. In this study, we have analyzed data from 186 coniferous monitoring sites in Sweden covering boreal, southern-boreal, and boreo-nemoral conditions. Our objective was to examine the possibility to track seasonal changes in coniferous forests by time-series of MODIS eight-day vegetation indices, testing the coherence between satellite monitored vegetation indices (VI) and temperature dependent phenology. The relationships between two vegetation indices (NDVI and WDRVI) and four phenological indicators (length of snow season, modeled onset of vegetation period, tree cold hardiness level and timing of budburst) were analyzed.   The annual curves produced by two curve fitting methods for smoothening of seasonal changes in NDVI and WDRVI were to a large extent characterized by the occurrence of snow, producing stable seasonal oscillations in the northern part and irregular curves with less pronounced annual amplitude in the southern part of the country. Measures based on threshold values of the VI-curves, commonly used for determining the timing of different phenological phases, were not applicable for Swedish coniferous forests. Evergreen vegetation does not have a sharp increase in greenness during spring, and the melting of snow can influence the vegetation indices at the timing of bud burst in boreal forests. However, the interannual variation in VI-values for specific eight-day periods was correlated with the phenological indicators. This relation can be used for satellite monitoring of potential climate change impacts on northern coniferous spring phenology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Jonsson, A.

As an alternative to the lack of high-resolution observations, kilometric thermal data can be disaggregated using a green (photosynthetically active) vegetation index e.g. NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) collected at high resolution. Nevertheless, this approach is only valid in the conditions where vegetation temperature is approximately uniform. To extend the validity domain of the classical approach, a new methodology is developed by representing the temperature difference between photosynthetically and non-photosynthetically active vegetation. In practice, both photosynthetically and non-photosynthetically active vegetation fractions are derived from a time series of Formosat-2 shortwave data, and then included in the disaggregation procedure. The approach is tested over a 16 km by 10 km irrigated cropping area in Mexico during a whole agricultural season. Kilometric MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) surface temperature is disaggregated at 100 m resolution, and disaggregated temperature is subsequently compared against concurrent ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) data. Statistical results indicate that the new methodology is more robust than the classical one, and is always more accurate when fractional non-photosynthetically active vegetation cover is larger than 0.10. The mean correlation coefficient and slope between disaggregated and ASTER temperature is increased from 0.75 to 0.81 and from 0.60 to 0.77, respectively. The approach is also tested using the MODIS data re-sampled at 2 km resolution. Aggregation reduces errors in MODIS data and consequently increases the disaggregation accuracy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Information on mean stand height is typically obtained through the manual interpretation of aerial photography, often supplemented by the collection of field calibration data. In remote areas where forest management practices may not be spatially exhaustive or where it is difficult to acquire aerial photography, alternate approaches for estimating stand height are required. One approach is to use very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite imagery (pixels sided less than 1 m) as a surrogate for air photos. In this research we demonstrate an approach for modelling mean stand height at four sites in the Yukon Territory, Canada, from Quick Bird panchromatic imagery. An object-based approach was used to generate homogenous segments from the imagery (analogous to manually delineated forest stands) and an algorithm was used to automatically delineate individual tree crowns within the segments. A regression tree was used to predict mean stand height from stand-level metrics generated from the image grey-levels and within-stand objects relating individual tree crown characteristics. Heights were manually interpreted from the Quick Bird imagery and divided into separate sets of calibration and validation data. The effects of calibration data set size and the input metrics used on the regression tree results were also assessed. The approach resulted in a model with a significant R-2 of 0.53 and an RMSE of 2.84 m. In addition, 84.6% of the stand height estimates were within the acceptable error for photo interpreted heights, as specified by the forest inventory standards of British Columbia. Furthermore, residual errors from the model were smallest for the stands that had larger mean heights (i.e., >20 m), which aids in reducing error in subsequent estimates of biomass or volume (since stands with larger trees contribute more to overall estimates of volume or biomass). Estimated and manually interpreted heights were reclassified into 5-metre height classes (a schema frequently used for forest analysis and modelling applications) and compared; classes corresponded in 54% of stands assessed, and all stands had an estimated height class that was within +/- 1 class of their actual class. This study demonstrates the capacity of VHSR panchromatic imagery (in this case QuickBird) for generating useful estimates of mean stand heights in unmonitored, remote, or inaccessible forest areas.

The effects of ground reference data error on the accuracy of land cover change detection and the accuracy of estimates of the extent of change were evaluated. Twelve data sets were simulated to allow the exploration of the impacts of a spectrum of ground data imperfections on the estimation of the producer\'s and user\'s accuracy of change as well as of change extent Simulated data were used since this ensured that the actual properties of the data were known and to exclude effects due to other sources of ground reference data error; although the impacts of simulated reference data error on two real confusion matrices are also illustrated. The imperfections evaluated ranged from the inclusion of small amounts of known error into the ground reference data through to the extreme situation in which ground data were absent. The results show that even small amounts of error in the ground reference data can introduce large error into studies of land cover change by remote sensing and reinforce the desire to avoid the expression ground truth as this might imply that the data are a gold standard reference. The effect of reference data imperfections was dependent on the degree of association between the errors in the cross-tabulated data sets. For example, in the scenarios investigated, a 10% error in the reference data set introduced an underestimation of the producer\'s accuracy of 18.5% if the errors were independent but an over-estimation of the producer\'s accuracy of 12.3% if the errors were correlated. The magnitude of the misestimation of the producer\'s accuracy was also a function of the amount of change and greatest at low levels of change. The amount of land cover change estimated also varied greatly as a function of ground reference data error. Some possible methods to reduce or even remove the impacts of ground reference data error were illustrated. These ranged from simple algebraic means to estimate the actual values of accuracy and change extent if the imperfections were known through to a latent class analysis that allowed the assessment of classification accuracy and estimation of change extent without the use of ground reference data if the underlying model is defined appropriately.

Satellite remote sensing has the potential to aid in determining the surface characteristics of active dust source regions that are of importance to dust emission modeling. This study uses data from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in conjunction with soil texture to investigate linkages of spatial distribution of surface characteristics related to dust emission, and their dynamics, at the seasonal time scale. In addition to standard MODIS land products such as surface albedo and NDVI which are strongly linked to dust emission, we introduce a roughness index (RI) and an arid soil surface index (ASSI) to aid in land surface characterization. Three regions of northwestern China known for dust emission, the Taklamakan, Badain Jaran, and Gurbantunggut Deserts, are examined for spatial and temporal changes of surface characteristics during winter-spring-summer transition February-July 2005. A new methodology is proposed by introducing regional masking derived from MODIS Band 10 surface albedo. The analysis demonstrates regional unique temporal and spatial characteristics in the 2005 seasonal transition for these areas. Seasonal modes of response are clearly present. The soil texture correlation results demonstrate that clay fraction has a consistently high negative correlation to albedo, as does vegetation. The analysis also demonstrates that RI is a dynamic characteristic changing both with season and on much shorter time scales. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

When thin cirrus clouds overlap the liquid cloud layer, the liquid information may be obtained by POLDER observations and the presence of the cirrus may be Inferred from the MODIS CO(2)-slicing technique. An initial comparison of the POLDER cloud phase and the MODIS cloud-top pressure for one scene over East Asia also shows that a large portion of clouds declared as liquid water clouds by POLDER-3 correspond to the lower cloud-top pressures derived from MODIS As a result, an overlapped cloud identification method is proposed under the assumption that the multilayered cloud would be present if the POLDER cloud phase is liquid water and the MODIS cloud-top pressure is less than 500 hPa. For the studied scene, the comparison of the multilayered cloud identification results with CloudSat and CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) observations illustrates that the proposed method could detect multilayered clouds when the upper cirrus has a visible optical thickness of less than 2 0 Then the identification results are compared with the MODIS Cloud_Multi_Layer_Flag. It is indicated that the consistency between the multilayered clouds from the proposed synergy and MODIS-operational algorithm increases gradually from over 40% to nearly 100% with the increase of the confidence level of the MODIS multilayered clouds from the lowest to the highest Further analysis suggests that the majority of multilayered clouds falsely classified as single-layered clouds by the proposed method may correspond to relatively thick cirrus covering lower-level water clouds. Additionally, an Index by using the multilayered cloud detection differences from the two methods is proposed to provide some information on the optical thickness of the cirrus covering lower-level water cloud Finally, quantitative comparisons are extended to four other scenes at different locations by using active measurements. The results also show that the mean visible optical thickness of the high-level clouds of the multilayered clouds detected by both methods (1 57) is remarkably less than that by only MODIS-operational method (2.84), which means that the differences between the results from the two methods are mainly caused by the different sensitivities to the visible optical thickness of the high-level cloud and could be used to indicate the range of the visible optical thickness of the cirrus clouds covering the lower-level water clouds.

Many satellite data, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), have been used to generate LAI products. It is important to characterize their spatial and temporal variations by developing mathematical models from these products. In this study, we aim to model MODIS LAI time series and further predict its future values by decomposing the LAI time series of each pixel into several components: trend, intra-annual variations, seasonal cycle, and stochastic stationary or irregular parts. Three such models that can characterize the non-stationary time series data and predict the future values are explored, including Dynamic Harmonics Regression (DHR), STL (Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure based on Loess), and Seasonal ARIMA (AutoRegressive Intergrated Moving Average) (SARIMA). The preliminary results using six years (2001-2006) of the MODIS LAI product indicate that all these methods are effective to model LAI time series and predict 2007 LAI values reasonably well. The SARIMA model gives the best prediction, DHR produces the smoothest curve, and STL is more sensitive to noise in the data. These methods work best for land cover types with pronounced seasonal variations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Debris on the glacier (referred as supraglacial debris) and that occurring outside the glacier boundaries (referred as periglacial debris) being derived from a common source, i.e. the valley rock, tend to have a similar spectral response in the reflection region which renders them mutually indistinguishable. However, there exist temperature differences between them. This aspect has been considered in this remote sensing based study to distinguish between the supraglacial and periglacial debris in a test area in the Chenab basin, Himalayas, by inclusion of thermal infrared (TIR) bands in remote sensing data processing. A synergistic multisensor approach for the delineation of debris-covered glacier boundaries is used here which integrates the inputs from thermal (TERRA-ASTER sensor) and optical (IRS-P6-AWiFS sensor) remote sensing data, multispectral classification techniques and the DEM derived geomorphometric parameters. The results of this study corroborate earlier findings on utilization of temperature differences as one of the parameters in glacial studies. The proposed synergistic approach therefore appears useful in accurate mapping of debris-covered glaciers in the Himalayan region. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.', '[Shukla, A.; Gupta, R.

The primary objective of this study is to examine the utility of computed Daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products relative to 16-day maximum value composite (MVC) datasets for observing early season green-up dynamics of Arctic tundra vegetation across the North Slope of Alaska. Greening in the Arctic typically occurs shortly after snowmelt and can potentially be captured by using satellite observations that are available on a daily basis. Daily MODIS Snow Cover products were employed to retrieve dates of complete snowmelt (DOCS) for 2003-2005 for pixels that were cloud free at the time of complete snowmelt. Given the sparseness of cloud-free observations in both space and time, early season NDVI trajectories for cloud-free pixels were derived using daily MODIS data based on two approaches: a chronosequence (temporally continuous but aspatial) and a pixel trajectory (temporally discontinuous but spatial explicit) approach.   On average during the three-year period, 12.5% of the North Slope region was cloud free at the time of complete snowmelt and a majority of these cloud-free pixels (65%) were associated with the Coastal Plain province. In contrast, the Foothills region was relatively less cloudy from the time following complete snowmelt until peak greenness (56%) than the Coastal Plain province (61%). As a result, vegetation communities that lie mostly in the Foothills province such as shrub tundra and moist acidic tundra classes had more cloud-free observations available to characterize NDVI trajectories using the pixel trajectory approach. Complete snowmelt in the North Slope generally occurred between day of year (DOY) 140 and 170 over the three years with areas covered by the shrub tundra vegetation community (Foothills province) experiencing snowmelt first in all three years with mean DOCS ranging from DOY 148 in 2004 to DOY 158 in 2003. For approximately two weeks following complete snowmelt (Phase I, a period of rapid NDVI increase), the Daily NDVI derived trajectories were substantially different from the MVC NDVI trajectories. Early season integrated NDVI (ESINDVI) values computed for Phase I were 7% higher using the Daily NDVI approaches relative to those derived from the MVC MODIS data for the North Slope region. Following this initial period, until peak greenness (Phase 2, a period of gradual NDVI increase), the Daily and MVC trajectories were similar in shape and magnitude. This study demonstrates the utility of the Daily MODIS Snow product for assessing cloud cover and snowmelt patterns and Daily MODIS NDVI data for observing and detecting sharp and rapid changes in early season vegetation phenology as seen during Phase I.

Satellite based imagers, such as the 300 m full resolution (FR) Medium Spectral Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), offer the potential for timely LAI mapping. The availability of multiple IMERIS LAI algorithms prompts the need for an evaluation of their performance, especially over a range of land use conditions. Four current methods for deriving LAI from MERIS FR data were compared to estimates from in-situ measurements over a 3 km x 3 km region near Ottawa, Canada. The LAI of deciduous dominant forest stands and corn, soybean and pasture fields was measured in-situ using digital hemispherical photography and processed using the CANEYE software. MERIS LAI estimates were derived using the MERIS Top of Atmosphere (TOA) algorithm, MERIS Top of Canopy (TOC) algorithm, the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing (CCRS) Empirical algorithm and the University of Toronto (UofT) GLOBCARBON algorithm. Results show that TOA and TOC LAI estimates were nearly identical (R(2)>0.98) with underestimation of LAI when it is larger than 4 and overestimation when smaller than 2 over the study region. The UofT and CCRS LAI estimates had root mean square errors over 1.4 units with large (similar to 25%) relative residuals over forests and consistent underestimates over corn fields. Both algorithms were correlated (R(2)>0.8) possibly due to their use of the same spectral bands derived vegetation index for retrieving LAI. LAI time series from TOA, TOC and CCRS algorithms showed smooth growth trajectories however similar errors were found when the values were compared with the in-situ LAI. In summary, none of the IMERIS LAI algorithms currently meet performance requirements from the Global Climate Observing System. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

This study is, to our knowledge, the first to use experimental data on this subject and was done in view of the SMOS mission, in order to contribute to calibration/validation studies and the analysis of heterogeneous surfaces. Because the multi-angle observations were contained in swaths, swaths were used instead of pixels as the basic surface unit in this study. Simultaneous retrievals of soil moisture (SM) and vegetation optical depth (tau(NAD)) were undertaken by inversion of the L-MEB zero-order radiative transfer model. This was done for two different retrieval configurations, the first consisting of swath-effective values of SM and tau(NAD) and the second consisting of values of SM and tau(NAD) for the non-forested (i.e. grass) fraction of the swath, with forest emission known from forward modelling. Model inputs for non-retrieved parameters were either default values taken from the literature or site- and time-specific values obtained from observations of nearby homogeneous swaths gathered during the same flight. The main focus of this study was on retrieval behaviour for various soil moisture conditions and forest fractions. Area-averaged retrieval results were generally very reasonable for both retrieval configurations. When retrieving swath-effective values of SM and tau(NAD), tau(NAD) showed an increased overestimation with increased forest fraction. Highest retrieved values of SM were found at intermediate values of forest fraction. The results show the difficulty in flagging upper limits of pixel forest fraction during soil moisture retrievals, besides the fact that erroneous parameter values can lead to high errors in retrieved SM, especially in wet conditions. This study is the first to give a realistic idea of the errors and uncertainties involved in soil moisture retrievals from partly forested swaths, and as such will contribute to a better understanding of SMOS calibration/validation issues.

Backward aerosol transport trajectories were also available for the AERONET sites. allowing identification of potential dust sources, especially for aerosol layers observed by the LIDAR. Over the study period, four aerosol events affected the buoy vicinity, but SMA retrievals proved superior to standard processing results only when dust was dominant, rather than when dust was simply present. The conditions appropriate for an SMA application could be defined using AERONET parameters. They are a combination of high aerosol optical depth tau(a) and low Angstrom exponent alpha (or tau(a)/alpha>0.2). Similar results are obtained using the equivalent SeaWiFS parameters produced by the M method although the threshold value is different Since it is preferable to apply the criterion on a per-pixel basis prior to atmospheric correction to select SMA or STD processing, an analogous test using aerosol model-independent quantities derived from SeaWiFS data is proposed.

We selected the slowly migrating, high-latitude, subarctic Great Kobuk Sand Dunes (GKSD), Kobuk Valley National Park, Alaska (USA), for our study. The COSI-Corr technique was used for precise orthorectification, co-registration, and subpixel correlation of satellite data. ASTER Visible Near Infrared (VNIR) and SPOT Panchromatic images with a 5-year temporal separation were correlated to measure the horizontal velocity of the GKSD. To reduce correlation noise, ASTER VNIR bands were linearly mixed to match the SPOT Panchromatic band, and raw correlation measurements were projected onto a local robust migration direction to estimate unbiased velocity magnitudes. The results show that the most likely migration rate for the GKSD ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 m/year. with peak velocities up to 3.8 m/year, and uncertainty of approximately 0.16 m/year. The unprecedented ability to measure slow migration rates, including those that may occur over a relatively short time interval, illustrates the value of this method to reliably detect and monitor subtle ground movements including dune migration, glacier flow, mass movements, and other small-scale processes.

Aqua MODIS LST at 7 km resolution during nighttime retrieved from a split-window algorithm is evaluated from 2002 to 2007. MODIS LST has an average bias of -0.2 degrees C. LST heterogeneity (defined as the Standard Deviation, STD, of ASTER LSTs in 1 x 1 km(2) region, 11 x 11 pixel in total) and instrument calibration error of pyrgeometer are key factors impacting the ASTER and MODIS LST evaluation using ground-based radiation measurements. The heterogeneity of nighttime ASTER LST is 1.2 degrees C, which accounts for 71% of the STD of the comparison, while the heterogeneity of the daytime LST is 2.4 degrees C, which accounts for 60% of the STD.

These airborne measurements are being used as benchmark data sets for validating the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) ground segment processor over prairies and crops. This paper presents results of soil moisture inversions and brightness temperature simulations at different resolutions from dual-polarisation and multi-angular L-band (1.4 GHz) measurements obtained from two independent radiometers. The aim of the paper is to provide a method that could overcome the limitations of unknown surface roughness for soil moisture retrievals from L-band data. For that purpose, a two-step approach is proposed for areas with low to moderate vegetation. Firstly, a two-parameter inversion of surface roughness and optical depth is used to obtain a roughness correction dependent on land use only. This step is conducted over small areas with known soil moisture. Such roughness correction is then used in the second step, where soil moisture and optical depth are retrieved over larger areas including mixed pixels. This approach produces soil moisture retrievals with root mean square errors between 0.034 m(3) m(-3) and 0.054 m(3) m(-3) over crops, prairies, and mixtures of these two land uses at different resolutions.

Near-coincidental plume acquisitions on 23 October from each of the sensors were compared spatially on a pixel-by-pixel basis in order to assess the level of agreement between the retrievals. The variation in pixel size and shape between sensors was accounted for by resampling MODIS data to the geometry of the UV sensors.   It was found that correlations between retrievals were wide ranging with estimates of total tonnage ranging from 60 kt up to 1800 kt. Spatial comparisons show variation according to plume altitude and overpass time and are compounded by interference from other volcanic species as well as individual instrument error.   The comparison of these sensors provides an insight into the relative merits of each method and illustrates the usefulness of a holistic approach to satellite remote sensing of sulphur dioxide. This will permit the development of more robust retrieval schemes and therefore increasingly reliable estimations of volcanic SO2 emissions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.', '[Thomas, H.

The model analyzes the MODIS visible, near infrared, and shortwave infrared bands with multiple endmember spectral mixtures from a library of snow, vegetation, rock, and soil. We derive snow spectral endmembers of varying grain size from a radiative transfer model specific to a scene\'s illumination geometry; spectra for vegetation, rock, and soil were collected in the field and laboratory. We validate the model with fractional snow cover estimates from Landsat Thematic Mapper data, at 30 m resolution, for the Sierra Nevada, Rocky Mountains, high plains of Colorado, and Himalaya. Grain size measurements are validated with field measurements during the Cold Land Processes Experiment, and albedo retrievals are validated with in situ measurements in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado. The pixel-weighted average RMS error for snow-covered area across 31 scenes is 5%, ranging from 1% to 13%. The mean absolute error for grain size was 51 mu m and the mean absolute error for albedo was 4.2%. Fractional snow cover errors are relatively insensitive to solar zenith angle. Because MODSCAG is a physically based algorithm that accounts for the spatial and temporal variation in surface reflectances of snow and other surfaces, it is capable of global snow cover mapping in its more computationally efficient, operational mode.

Results are also compared with output from two alternate models 1) the standard algorithm (Std) and 2) the standard atmospheric correction combined with the locally tuned GSM model (StdGSM). The comparisons indicate that the SOA is a viable alternative to both given models in Chesapeake Bay. In contrast, StdGSM appears to require improvement before it can be considered for operational use in these waters. Perhaps the most important result is the high-quality of CDM retrievals with the SOA, They suggest that there is value added using the SOA method in Chesapeake waters, as the Std method does not retrieve CDM. In a companion paper we describe in detail the model implementation, and its accuracy and limitations when applied to the Chesapeake Bay. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Kuchinke, C.

Two regional GLAS/MODIS timber volume products, one considering only those pulses falling on slopes <= 10 degrees and one utilizing all GLAS pulses regardless of slope, are generated. Using a two-phase (GLAS-ground plot) sampling design, GLAS/MODIS volumes average 163.4 +/- 11.8 m(3)/ha across all 16 forest classes based on GLAS pulses on slopes <= 10 degrees and 171.9 +/- 12.4 m(3)/ha considering GLAS shots on all slopes.

OE requires simulation of observations as part of the retrieval process, and this is done here using numerical weather prediction fields and a fast radiative transfer model. Bias correction of the simulated brightness temperatures (BTs) is found to be a necessary step before retrieval, and is achieved by filtered averaging of simulations minus observations over a time period of 20 days and spatial scale of 2.5 degrees in latitude and longitude. Throughout this study, BT observations are clear-sky averages over cells of size 0.5 degrees in latitude and longitude. Results for the OE SST are compared to results using a traditional non-linear retrieval algorithm (\"NLSST\"), both validated against a set of 30108 night-time matches with drifting buoy observations. For the OE SST the mean difference with respect to drifter SSTs is -0.01 K and the standard deviation is 0.47 K, compared to -0.38 K and 0.70 K respectively for the NLSST algorithm. Perhaps more importantly, systematic biases in NLSST with respect to geographical location, atmospheric water vapour and satellite zenith angle are greatly reduced for the OE SST. However, the OE SST is calculated to have a lower sensitivity of retrieved SST to true SST variations than the NLSST, This feature would be a disadvantage for observing SST fronts and diurnal variability, and raises questions as to how best to exploit OE techniques at SEVIRI\'s full spatial resolution.

Challenges in developing such ESDRs include problems in remote sensing science (modeling of variability in global vegetation, scaling, atmospheric correction) and sensor hardware (differences in spatial resolution, spectral bands, calibration, and information content). In this paper, we develop a physically based approach for deriving LAI and FPAR products from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data that are of comparable quality to the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI and FPAR products, thus realizing the objective of producing a long (multi-decadal) time series of these products. The approach is based on the radiative transfer theory of canopy spectral invariants which facilitates parameterization of the canopy spectral bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF). The methodology permits decoupling of the structural and radiometric components and obeys the energy conservation law. The approach is applicable to any optical sensor, however, it requires selection of sensor-specific values of configurable parameters, namely, the single scattering albedo and data uncertainty. According to the theory of spectral invariants, the single scattering albedo is a function of the spatial scale, and thus, accounts for the variation in BRF with sensor spatial resolution. Likewise, the single scattering albedo accounts for the variation in spectral BRF with sensor bandwidths. The second adjustable parameter is data uncertainty. which accounts for varying information content of the remote sensing measurements, i.e., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, low information content), vs. spectral BRF (higher information content). Implementation of this approach indicates good consistency in LAI values retrieved from NDVI (AVHRR-mode) and spectral BRF (MODIS-mode). Specific details of the implementation and evaluation of the derived products are detailed in the second part of this two-paper series. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The MODIS Level 1B (MOD02) swath level data are used as input to circumvent the problems with image distortion in the mid latitude and polar regions inherent to the global sinusoidal (SIN) projection utilized for the standard MODIS data products. The MODIS 500 m land bands B3 to B7 are first downscaled to 250 m resolution using an adaptive regression and normalization scheme for compatibility with the 250 m bands B1 and B2. A new method has been developed to produce the mask of clear-sky, cloud and cloud shadow at 250 m resolution. It shows substantial advantages in comparison with the MODIS 250 m standard cloud masks. The testing of new cloud mask showed that it is in reasonable agreement with the MODIS 1-km standard product once it is aggregated to 1-km scale, while the cloud shadow detection looks more reliable with the new methodology. Nevertheless, more quantitative analyses of the presented scene identification technique are required to understand its performance over the range of input scenes in various seasons. The new clear-sky compositing scheme employs a scene-dependent decision matrix. It is demonstrated that this new scheme provides better results than any others based on a single compositing criterion, such as maximum NDVI or minimum visible reflectance. To account for surface bidirectional properties, two clear-sky composites for the same time period are produced by separating backward scattering and forward scattering geometries, which separate pixels with the sun-satellite relative azimuth angles within 90 degrees-270 degrees and outside of this range. Comparison with Landsat imagery and with MODIS standard composite products demonstrated the advantage of the new technique for screening cloud and cloud shadow, and generating high spatial resolution MODIS clear-sky composites. The new data products are mapped in the Lambert Conformal Conic (LCC) projection for Canada and the Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area (LAEA) projection for North America.

Conventional, visible-near infrared, indices are often limited by the effects of atmosphere, background soil conditions, and saturation at high levels of vegetation. In this study, we will establish the theoretical basis for our new passive microwave vegetation indices (MVIs) based on data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) on the Aqua satellite. Through the analysis of numerical simulations by surface emission model, the Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM), we found that bare soil surface emissivities at different frequencies can be characterized by a linear function with parameters that are dependent on the pair of frequencies used. This makes it possible to minimize the surface emission signal and maximize the vegetation signal when using multi-frequency radiometer measurements. Using a radiative transfer model (omega-tau model), a linear relationship between the brightness temperatures observed at two adjacent radiometer frequencies can be derived. The intercept and slope of this linear function depend only on vegetation properties and can be used as vegetation indices. These can be derived from the dual-frequency and dual-polarization satellite measurements under assumption that there is no significant impact of the polarization dependence on the vegetation signals. To demonstrate the potential of the new microwave vegetation indices, we compared them with the Normalized Difference of Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived using MODIS the optical sensor at continental and global scales. The major purpose of this paper is to describe the concept and techniques involved in these newly developed MVIs and explore the general relationships between these MVIs and NDVI. In this first investigation, the information content of NDVI and MVIs, both are qualitative indices, was compared by examining its response in global pattern and to seasonal vegetation phenology. The results indicate that the MVIs can provide significant new information since the microwave measurements are sensitive not only to the leafy part of vegetation properties but also to the properties of the overall vegetation canopy when the microwave sensor can \"see\" through it. In combination with conventional optical sensor derived vegetation indices, they provide a possible complementary dataset for monitoring global short vegetation and seasonal phenology from space.

This study modelled habitat use and preferences of fin whales and striped dolphins (the two most abundant species in the area) with the aim of providing this information, using sighting data collected between 1993 and 1999. The study area was divided into a 21 latitude by 21 longitude grid. The explanatory variables considered in the models were physiographic variables (mean, range and standard deviation of depth and slope, and distance from the nearest coastline) and remotely-sensed data (Sea Surface Temperature and Chlorophyll-a concentration). The former were calculated for each cell using GIS tools, while the latter were obtained from AVHRR and SeaWiFS sensors. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with multidimensional smoothers were used to model the distribution of fin whales and striped dolphins in relation to these variables, and Classification And Regression Trees were used for habitat characterization and predictive models. The GAMs were coupled with Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) to account for temporal autocorrelation in the errors and to help ensure model selection was reliable; the QIC statistic was used alongside GEE-based p-values. Bathymetric features were the most valuable predictors in the Pelagos Sanctuary area for both species. Sea Surface Temperature values were indicators of striped dolphin and fin whale presence, with both species showing a tendency to prefer colder waters (21-24 degrees C). Chl-a levels were selected by the GAM models only for striped dolphins, and with large associated uncertainty; this may be related to the relatively brief period examined (only 2 years) and/or to any functional relationship operating at a different geographical or temporal scale. The boosted classification trees however indicated an importance of Chl-a for both species. The techniques applied to this dataset proved to be valuable tools to describe habitat use and preferences of cetaceans, and the use of the remotely-sensed data can substantially improve the predictions. The results of this study will be used for assessing critical habitats within the Pelagos Sanctuary and will provide information for conservation and management in the Sanctuary.

During this period, 127 encounters with B. acutorostrata were recorded during systematic boat-based surveys. The encounters were subsequently converted to number of animals sighted per unit of survey effort (SPUE) for comparison with mesoscale oceanographic features. Using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) imagery, monthly composite images of sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) were obtained. In the SST imagery two oceanographic features appeared to dominate the Moray Firth region: a cold water current and a warm water plume. The results show that the SPUE of B. acutorostrata was significantly higher during warm plume events than when the cold current was dominant (Mann-Whitney U, P=0.0167). Levels of phytoplankton biomass also appeared to be substantially greater during warm water plume events. In conclusion, it is hypothesised that those areas of highest minke SPUE are directly related to the presence of targeted prey attracted by high densities of phytoplankton. Although these whales were found to occur across the survey area, throughout the study period, their distribution is concluded to be highly dependent upon the presence of co-occurring mesoscale features. These, as well as other physiographic environmental determinants, are all thought to be important in forming this heterogeneous coastal ecosystem. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Here we present a new method that performs a relative calibration of reflectance data to produce consistent long-term vegetation information. It is based on a simple biological framework that assumes that the position of the vegetation cover triangle is invariant in reflectance space. This assumption is in fact an intrinsic assumption behind the commonly used Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and is violated when the NDVI is calculated from inadequately corrected reflectance data. In this new method, any temporal variability in the position of the cover triangle is removed by geometrically transforming the observed reflectance data such that two features of the triangle-the soil line and the dark point-are stationary in reflectance space. The fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation absorbed by vegetation (fPAR; 0.0-0.95) is then calculated, via the NDVI, from calibrated reflectances. This method was tested using two distinct, monthly AVHRR products for Australia: (i) the coarse-resolution, fully calibrated, partially atmospherically corrected PAL data (1981-1994); and (ii) the fine-resolution, fully calibrated, non-atmospherically Corrected HRPT data (1992-2004). Results show that, in the 20-month period when the two datasets overlap (1992-1994), the Australia-wide, root mean square difference between the two datasets improved from 0.098 to 0.027 WAR units. The calibrations have produced two approximately equivalent datasets that can be combined as a single input into time-series analyses. The application of this method is limited to areas that have a wide-enough variety of land-cover types so that the soil line and dark point are evident in the cover triangle in every image of the time-series. Another limitation is that the methodology performs only bulk, relative calibrations and does not remove the absolute effects of observation uncertainties. The simplicity of the method means that the calibration procedure can be easily incorporated into near-real-time operational remote-sensing environments. Vegetation information produced using this invariant-cover-triangle method is expected to be well suited to the analysis of long-term vegetation dynamics and change. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

This paper investigates the possibility to generate consistent global, to the exception of the polar regions, surface broadband albedo product from these satellites. In this context, the paper addresses two specific issues. Firstly, the spatial consistency of surface albedo derived from five different geostationary satellites is examined in detail. Secondly, this product is compared with the equivalent MODIS one to define the temporal consistency between surface albedo derived with old geostationary instruments and technologically advanced radiometers like MODIS. The analysis of the surface albedo products has revealed a good agreement between the products derived from the various geostationary satellites. Comparison of this global product with the one routinely derived from MODIS shows that on the average, the mean relative difference between these two data sets agree within 10%. These first encouraging results open therefore a new avenue for the exploitation of the archived data for the generation of long time series, covering the last 25 years or so, of global surface albedo from geostationary weather satellites.

The estimate of nitrate concentrations from space is generally based on empirical inverse relationships between sea surface temperature (SST) and nitrate concentrations. These relationships, however, are often highly variable spatially and temporally, and hardly applicable to large areas (i.e., larger than a few degrees in latitude). In this paper we propose a new approach specifically developed for areas influenced by upwelling processes. It relates the nitrate concentration to the difference between SST and the estimated temperature of the upwelled water (variable with latitude and season), delta T, which is an indicator of the time elapsed since upwelling. This approach is tested for the Benguela upwelling system, and algorithms are developed using in situ data provided by the World Ocean Database 2005 of the NOAA-NESDIS-National Oceanographic Data Center. The results reveal a significant improvement compared to the NO3-SST relationships, and a single algorithm can be applied to the whole upwelling area (15 to 35 degrees S). Further improvement is gained by coupling this approach with a method that derives sea surface nitrate concentrations from SST and surface chlorophyll a concentration using multiple regression analyses, as proposed by Goes et al.

However, field-based measurements of vegetation structure can be time consuming, costly, and difficult to undertake in areas that are remote and/or contain rough terrain. Light detection and ranging (lidar) is an active remote sensing technology that can quantify three-dimensional vegetation structure over large areas and thus holds promise for examining wildlife-habitat relationships. We used discrete-return airborne lidar data acquired over the Black Hills Experimental Forest in South Dakota, USA in combination with field-collected vegetation and bird data to assess the utility of lidar data in quantifying vegetation structural characteristics that relate to avian diversity, density, and occurrence. Indices of foliage height diversity calculated from lidar data were positively and significantly correlated with indices of bird species diversity, with the highest correlations observed when foliage height diversity categories contained proportionally more foliage layers near the forest floor (<5 m). In addition, lidar-derived indices of vegetation volume were significantly correlated with bird density. Using lidar-derived vegetation height data in combination with multispectral IKONOS data, we delineated five general habitat types within the study area according to the presence of prominent vegetation layers at lower levels of the forest and predominant tree type (deciduous or conifer). Habitat type delineations were tested by examining the occurrence and relative density of two bird species common to the study area that prefer lower level vegetation for foraging and nesting. Dark-eyed Juncos were significantly associated with the 0.5-2.0 m high vegetation layer in pine-dominated stands, and Warbling Vireos were significantly associated with this same layer in aspen-dominated stands. These results demonstrate that discrete-return lidar can be an effective tool to remotely quantify vegetation structural attributes important to birds, and may be enhanced when used in combination with spectral data.

Recent studies synthesizing plot data from the tropics indicate that lianas are increasing in both abundance and importance in tropical forests. Moreover, lianas exhibit competitive advantages over trees in elevated CO2 environments and under strong seasonal droughts, suggesting that lianas may be poised to increase not only in abundance but also in spatial distribution in response to changing climate. We used a combination of high-resolution color-infrared videography and hyperspectral imagery from EO-1 Hyperion to map low-lying lianas in Noel Kempff Mercado National Park (NKMNP) in the Bolivian Amazon. Evergreen liana forests comprise as much as 14% of the NKMNP landscape, and low-stature liana patches occupy 1.5% of these forests. We used change vector analysis (CVA) of dry season Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery from 1986 and 2000 to determine changes in liana-dominated patches over time and to assess whether those patches were regenerating to canopy forest. The spatial distribution of liana patches showed that patches were spatially aggregated and were preferentially located in proximity to waterways. The CVA results showed that most of the dense liana patches increased in brightness and greenness and decreased in wetness over the 14 years of the change analysis, while non-liana forest patches changed less and in more random directions. Persistent liana patches increased in area by an average of 59% over the time period. In comparison, large burned areas appeared to recover completely to canopy forest in the same time period. This suggests that the dense liana patches of NKMNP represent an alternative successional pathway characterized not by tree regeneration but rather by a stalled state of low-canopy liana dominance. This research supports hypotheses that liana forests can be a persistent rather than transitional component of tropical forests, and may remain so due to competitive advantages that lianas enjoy under changing climatic conditions.

Accurately mapped continuous tree cover fields would enable the depiction of forest extent over this ecotone, which is sensitive to climate change, natural disturbances and human activities. The objective of this study was to assess the explanatory power of multispectral, -temporal and -angular MODIS data to estimate tree cover at the regional scale in northernmost Finland. The standard MODIS BRDF/Albedo (MOD43B) data products at approximately 1 km resolution were used. The tree cover was estimated using generalized linear models (GLM), which were calibrated and evaluated by high resolution biotope inventory data. The benefit of coupling the multispectral, -temporal and -angular variables was assessed by variation partitioning. The predicted tree cover fields were also used for the forest-non-forest classification over a larger region and compared with the forest extent of Finnish CORINE land cover 2000 data set. The results show that multitemporal and -angular variables can increase the accuracy of the tree cover estimates and mapping of the forest extent in comparison to the peak of the growing season nadir-view multispectral data. The season of the data acquisition also affect the model performance, the late-spring and early-summer data being superior to mid- and late-summer data. Although the pure effect of the multiangular variables i.e. the parameters of the MODIS BRDF model and selected multiangular indices were relatively small in the models, the inclusion of these data increased the accuracy of the tree cover estimates in the mires in comparison to the peak of the growing season nadir-view multispectral data and multitemporal variables.

In contrast, few papers have addressed the effective model inversion of high resolution satellite images for a complete series of data for the various crop species in a given region. The present study is focused on the assessment of a LAI model inversion approach applied to multitemporal optical data, over an agricultural region having various crop types with different crop calendars. Both the inversion approach and data sources are chosen because of their wide use. Crops in the study region (Barrax, Castilla-La Mancha, Spain) include: cereal, corn, alfalfa, sugar beet, onion, garlic, papaver. Some of the crop types (onion, garlic, papaver) have not been addressed in previous studies. We use in-situ measurement sets and literature values as a priori data in the PROSPECT+ SAIL models to produce Look Up Tables (LUTs). Those LUTs are subsequently used to invert Landsat-TM and Landsat-ETM+ image series (12 dates from March to September 2003). The Look Up Tables are adapted to different crop types, identified on the images by ground survey and by Landsat classification. The retrieved LAI values are compared to in-situ measurements available from the campaign conducted in mid July-2003. Very good agreement (a high linear correlation) is obtained for LAI values from 0.1 to 6.0. LAI maps are then produced for each of the 12 dates. The LAI temporal variation shows consistency with the crop phenological stages. The inversion method is favourably compared to a method relying on the empirical relationship between LAI and NDVI from Landsat data. This offers perspectives for future optical satellite data that will ensure high resolution and high temporal frequency. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All fights reserved.', '[Gonzalez-Sanpedro, M.

The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), derived from NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery is currently used to calculate RG operationally. Here we evaluated an alternate measure of RG using the Visible Atmospheric Resistant Index (VARI) derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data. VARI was chosen because it has previously been shown to have the strongest relationship with Live Fuel Moisture (LFM) out of a wide selection of MODIS-derived indices in southern California shrublands. To compare MODIS-based NDVI-FPI and VARI-FPI, RG was calculated from a 6-year time series of MODIS composites and validated against in-situ observations of LFM as a surrogate for vegetation greenness. RG from both indices was then compared in terms of its performance for computing the FPI using historical wildfire data. Computed RG values were regressed against ground-sampled LFM at 14 sites within Los Angeles County. The results indicate that VARI-based RG consistently shows a stronger relationship with observed LFM than NDVI-based RG. With an average R-2 of 0.727 compared to a value of only 0.622 for NDVI-RG, VARI-RG showed stronger relationships at 13 out of 14 sites. Based on these results, daily FPI maps were computed for the years 2001 through 2005 using both NDVI-RG and VARI-RG. These were then validated against 12,490 fire detections from the MODIS active fire product using logistic regression. Deviance of the logistic regression model was 408.8 for NDVI-FPI and 176.2 for VARI-FPI. The c-index was found to be 0.69 and 0.78, respectively. The results show that VARI-FPI outperforms NDVI-FPI in distinguishing between fire and no-fire events for historical wildfire data in southern California for the given time period.

In this paper, a two-source energy balance model developed to use thermal and visible/near-infrared remotely sensed data is applied to Landsat imagery collected during the 2004 Soil Moisture Experiment (SMEX04) conducted in southern Arizona. Using a two dimensional flux-footprint algorithm, modeled surface fluxes are compared to tower measurements at three locations in the SMEX04 study area: two upland sites, and one riparian site. The effect of pixel resolution on evaluating the performance of the land surface model and interpreting spatial variations of land surface fluxes over these heterogeneous areas is evaluated. Three Landsat scenes were examined, one representing the dry season and the other two representing the relatively wet monsoon season. The model was run at three resolution scales: namely the Landsat visible/near-infrared band resolution (30 m), the Landsat 5 thermal band resolution (120 m), and 960 m, which is nominally the MODIS thermal resolution at near-nadir. Comparisons between modeled and measured fluxes at the three tower sites showed good agreement at the 30 m and 120 m resolutions - pixel scales at which the source area influencing the tower measurement (similar to 100 m) is reasonably resolved. At 960 m, the agreement is relatively poor, especially for the latent heat flux, due to subpixel heterogeneity in land surface conditions at scales exceeding the tower footprint. Therefore in this particular landscape, thermal data at 1-km resolution are not useful in assessing the intrinsic accuracy of the land-surface model in comparison with tower fluxes. Furthermore, important spatial patterns in the landscape are lost at this resolution. Currently, there are no definite plans supporting high resolution thermal data with regular global coverage below similar to 700 m after Landsat 5 and ASTER fail. This will be a serious problem for the application and validation of thermal-based land-surface models over heterogeneous landscapes.

The target satellite-derived snow parameters are snow surface temperature, mass fraction of soot, and two types of snow grain size retrieved from different spectral channels. The retrieved satellite products were compared with in-situ measured snow parameters based on snow pit work and snow sampling. The satellite-derived snow surface temperatures agreed well with in-situ measured values with a correlation coefficient (R-c) of 0.900 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.1 K. The satellite-derived mass fractions of soot were close to in-situ measured mass fractions of snow impurities for the snow layer between the surface and down to 7 or 10 cm rather than between 0 and 2 cm, while the satellite-derived absolute values were lower than the in-situ measured ones (R-c=0.506 and RMSE=5.0 parts per million by weight (ppmw)). This discrepancy is due primarily to the difference in the composition of snow impurities assumed in the satellite algorithm (soot) and measured in-situ (mineral dust) suggesting that the satellite retrieval of soot is not producing soot concentrations in many cases but rather dust. Snow grain sizes retrieved from two satellite channels lambda = 0.460 and 0.865 pm had better accuracy (R-c =0.840 and RMSE = 125 mu m) than those from a satellite channel at lambda = 1.64 mu m (R-c=0.524 and RMSE = 123 mu m) from the comparison with simply depth-averaged snow grain size. When similar comparisons are made with the depth-averaged measured grain size by a 1/e weighting using flux transmittance, the results for R-c and RMSE are not improved due to some difficulties in calculating the depth-averaging by a 1/e weighting. For all our satellite products, the possible causes of errors are (1) satellite sensor calibration and (2) the bidirectional reflectance model (directional emissivity model for surface temperature) used in the algorithm together with the atmospheric correction. Two ways to improve the in-situ measurements are (1) the representativeness of the measured values and (2) the measuring methods. Field measurements also indicated that the increased reflectance due to \"sun crust\" observed at wet snow surfaces under clear sky could cause an underestimation of satellite-derived snow grain size. This problem will be more severe for the grain size retrieved from the channel at lambda = 1.64 mu m. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

However, the first method is limited in terms of spatial coverage and cost effectiveness and the second is site- and data-specific. Since alternative approaches based on radiative transfer models (RTM) have been usefully applied in retrieving several biophysical plant parameters (leaf area index, water and dry matter content, chlorophyll), this paper has applied the inversion of a simulation model to estimate burn severity in terms of the Composite Burn Index (CBI). The performance of the model inversion method was compared to standard empirical techniques. The study area chosen was a large forest fire in central Spain which occurred in July 2005. The model inversion showed the most accurate estimation for high severity levels (for CBI > 2.7, RMSE=0.30) and for unburned areas (CBI < 0.5, RMSE=0). In both methodologies, the error associated to CBI from 0.5 to 2.7 was not acceptable (RMSE > 0.1), because it is higher than 25% of the total range of the index. Finally, burn severity maps from both methods were compared. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The region under study (3500 km(2)) presents a diversity of landscape units with open lakes, bogs, large meadows, savannahs, alluvial forests and terra firma forest, covered by 21 images acquired by J-ERS between 1993 and 1997. Ground data include in situ observations of vegetation structure and flood extent as well as water level records. Image analysis demonstrates that temporal variations of the radar backscatter can be used to monitor efficiently the flood extent regardless of the landscape units. Also, analysis of the backscatter temporal variation greatly reduces the confusion between smooth surfaces (e.g. open water bodies, bare soils) inherent to L-band backscatter. The mapping method is based on decision rules over two decision variables: 1) the mean backscatter coefficient computed over the whole time series; 2) the total change computed using an \"Absolute Change\" estimator. The first variable provides classification into rough vegetation types while the second variable yields a direct estimate of the intensity of change that is related to flood dynamics. The classifier is first applied to the whole time series to map the maximum and minimum flood extent by defining 3 flood conditions: never flooded (NF); occasionally flooded (OF); permanently flooded (PF). It also furnishes the broad land cover type: open water/bare soils/low vegetation/forest. The accuracy of the flood extent mapping shows a kappa value of 0.82. Then, the classifier is run iteratively on the OF pixels to monitor flood stages during which the occasionally flooded areas get submerged. The mapping accuracy is assessed on one intermediate flood stage, showing a precision in excess of 90%. The importance of the time sampling for flood mapping is discussed along with the influence of SAR backscatter accuracy and the number of images. Then general guidelines for floodplain mapping are presented. By combining water level reports with maps of different flood stages the flooding pattern can be retrieved along with the vegetation succession processes. It is shown that the spatial distribution of vegetation communities is governed by flood stress and can be modelled as a function of the mean annual exposure to floods. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast to many previous regional scale studies, we consider land cover and its environmental impact on an individual catchment-scale, using fine-resolution Quickbird data and a soil erosion model. First, using a detailed land cover map generated from Quickbird imagery, we establish basic relationships between land cover, dwelling density and topographic variability, which exist in a typical mid-elevation Nepalese catchment, the Pokhare Khola. These data suggest a strongly subsistence type of household economy based predominantly on terraced arable farming. We demonstrate using multitemporal vegetation indices that this farmland has existed in the region since the late 1980s, and that widespread deforestation has not taken place since then, possibly as a result of specific forest conservation policies of the government coupled with efforts by local communities. Further, through the use of soil erosion modelling we demonstrate the role that the terraced farming practices can play in reducing runoff and hence soil nutrient loss, thereby enabling restoration of vegetation in the previously deforested land terrains. Finally, by combining this information with regional land cover data, we show that the findings of this research can be scaled up to draw conclusions about environmental degradation across the Nepal Himalayan region.

MISR standard products include green leaf area index (LAI) of vegetation and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (FPAR). This paper describes the research basis for transitioning the MISR LAI/FPAR products from provisional to validation status. The efforts included not only comparisons to field data but also analyses of relationships, consistency and complementarity between various MISR products derived by independent algorithms. For example, we show how the energy absorbed by the ground below vegetation can be estimated from two independent MISR products, FPAR and BHRPAR (bi-hemispheric reflectance at PAR wavelengths). Further, we show that this information can be used to derive at least three measures of canopy structure - Beer\'s law extinction coefficient, mean leaf inclination and the gap fraction or vegetation ground cover. The spatial and temporal coverage of the LAI/FPAR product is mainly limited by cloud contamination. However, when a successful aerosol retrieval is performed, typically 95% of pixels have surface reflectance retrievals suitable as input to the LAI/FPAR algorithm. The algorithm provides LAI/FPAR retrievals in 50-80% of these pixels with suitable input. The early versions of the algorithm overestimated LAI values in grasses and broadleaf crops. The MISR LAI product from the recalibrated algorithm (version 3.3) is assessed by comparison with field data collected in a 3 x 3 km agricultural area (grasses and cereal crops) near Avignon, France. LAI retrievals in other biomes are compared to MODIS LAI product of known accuracy. The MISR LAI product shows structural and phenological variability in agreement with data. Our results suggest that the product is accurate to within 0.66 LAI in herbaceous vegetation and savannas and is an overestimate by about 1 LAI in broadleaf forests. LAI retrievals over needle leaf forests remain at provisional quality level. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', 'Boston Univ, Dept Geog, Boston, MA 02215 USA.

AERONET AOT data were first averaged within a two-hour time window and MISR data were collected using AOTs of the central regions covering the AERONET site and the average AOTs of the surrounding 3 x 3 regions. MISR and AERONET AOTs are highly correlated, with an overall linear correlation coefficient of 0.93 at 558 nm wavelength. On average, MISR AOT at 558 nm is 29% lower than the AERONET AOT at 558 nm interpolated from 440 rim and 675 nm. A linear regression analysis using MISR AOT as the response yields a slope of 0.58 0.03 and an intercept of 0.07 +/- 0.02 in the green band with similar results in the other three bands, indicating that MISR may underestimate AERONETAOT. After applying a narrower averaging time window to AERONET data and controlling their temporal variabilities, the agreement between MISR and AERONET AOTs is significantly improved with the correlation coefficient of 0.97 and a slope of 0.71 0.03 in an ordinary linear least squares fit. Aweighted linear least squares, which reduces the impact of spatial averaging, yields a better result with the slope going up to 0.73 +/- 0.03. When only the central region MISR AOTs are included in the regression analysis, the best agreement is achieved with a slope of 0.91 +/- 0.03 and an intercept of 0.00 +/- 0.01, and MISR AOT is only 9% lower than AERONET AOT on average. By investigating PM10 spatial distribution of Beijing, we found substantial spatial variations of aerosol loading with higher PM10 concentrations inthe MISR central region, which introduced low bias invalidating spatial average MISRAOT. When MISR andAERONETAOTare better spatiotemporally matched, their agreement can be much better than the previously reported results. Our findings also suggest that MISR aerosol retrieval algorithm might need to be adjusted for the extremely high aerosol loadings and substantial spatial variations that it will probably encounter in heavily polluted metropolitan areas.

MISR has been found to perform better than MODIS during both seasons, which we attribute to its unique design (viewing and spectral capability), despite its lower revisit frequency compared to MODIS. In both seasons, the MISR level 3 product distinctly shows a large gradient of AOD along north-south (N-S) and west-east (W-E) transects over the IG basin, compared to the southern part of the Indian subcontinent. An increase in satellite-derived aerosol loading over the 2000-2005 time period has been found over major cities located in the IG basin; this increase is also reflected in ground-based air quality data of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). High MISR AOD during the winter season can be attributed primarily to anthropogenic activities, as major dust storms take place during summer (April-June). We have computed the spatial correlation between MISR and MODIS AOD during the 2000-2005 winter (November-January) seasons, when the effect of desert dust is smallest and the anthropogenic component over the IG basin is largest. The average pixel count with MISR-MODIS correlation coefficient > 0.6 during the winter season has been found to be higher over the IG basin and India (35.6% and 32.2% of pixels, respectively) compared to the world (20.4% of pixels). Since the MODIS AOD retrieval algorithm works best for dense and dark vegetative regions, whereas the MISR retrieval is generally less sensitive to surface type, we attribute this result to the relatively high vegetation cover (using MISR Normalized Difference Vegetation Index as a proxy) found in the IG basin and over India.

These statistics, however, are not capable of quantifying the detailed relationship between VIs and biophysical parameters because the sensitivity of a VI is usually a function of the biophysical parameter instead of a constant. To better quantify this relationship, we developed a \"sensitivity function\" for measuring the sensitivity of a VI to biophysical parameters. The sensitivity function is defined as the first derivative of the regression function, divided by the standard error of the dependent variable prediction. The function elucidates the change in sensitivity over the range of the biophysical parameter. The Student\'s t- or z-statistic can be used to test the significance of VI sensitivity.

Our analyses indicate that C-a(Fluor) is 2.48 +/- 2.23 (n = 647) times greater than C-a(HPLC) between 0.05 and 1.5 mg m(-3) and that the percentage overestimation of in situ C, by fluorometric measurements increases with decreasing concentrations.

Furthermore, there is no significant bias in C-a(SWF) (12% and -0.07 in linear and log-transformed C-a, respectively) when C-a(HPLC) is used as ground truth instead of C-a(Fluor). The high C-a(Fluor)/C-a(HPLC) ratio may be attributed to the relatively low concentrations of chlorophyll b (C-b/C-a = 0.023 +/- 0.034, n = 482) and relatively high concentrations of chlorophyll c (C-c/C-a = 0.25 +/- 0.59, n = 482) in the phytoplankton pigment composition when compared to values from other regions.

Information on moisture fluxes between the surface and lower atmosphere reveals linkages and land-atmosphere feedback mechanisms, aiding our understanding of energy and water balance cycles. Techniques that combine information on land and atmospheric properties with remotely sensed variables would allow improved prediction for a number of hydrological variables. Over the last few decades, there has been a focus on better determining evapotranspiration and its spatial variability, but for many regions routine prediction is not generally available at a spatial resolution appropriate to the underlying surface heterogeneity. Over agricultural regions, this is particularly critical, since the spatial extent of typical field scales is not regularly resolved within the pixel resolution of satellite sensors. Understanding the role of landscape heterogeneity and its influence on the scaling behavior of surface fluxes as observed by satellite sensors with different spatial resolutions is a critical research need. To attend this task, data from Landsat-ETM (60 in), ASTER (90 m), and MODIS (1020 in) satellite platforms are employed to independently estimate evapotranspiration. The range of the satellite sensor resolutions allows analyses that span scales from (point-scale) in-situ tower measurements to the MODIS kilometer-scale. Evapotranspiration estimates derived at these multiple resolutions were assessed against eddy covariance flux measurements collected during the 2002 Soil Moisture Atmospheric Coupling Experiment (SMACEX) over the Walnut Creek watershed in Iowa. Together, these data allow a comprehensive scale intercomparison of remotely sensed predictions, which include intercomparisons of the evapotranspiration products from the various sensors as well as a statistical analysis for the retrievals at the watershed scale. A high degree of consistency was observed between the retrievals from the higher-resolution satellite platforms (Landsat-ETM and ASTER). The MODIS-based estimates, while unable to discriminate the influence of land surface heterogeneity at the field scale, effectively reproduced the watershed average response, illustrating the utility of this sensor for regional-scale evapotranspiration estimation.

Annually integrated MODIS PSN (MOD17A2 net photosynthesis, Collection 4) explains more of the observed biomass variation (r(2) = 0.77) than MODIS fAPAR (fraction Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation, Collection 4) (r(2) = 0.72), indicating the effect of including the canopy stress scalar (epsilon(s)) based on DAO data combined with modelled maintenance respiration costs (of leaf and fine roots). Annual MODIS NPP (MOD17A3, Collection 4 (C4) and Collection 4.5 (C4.5)) including growth respiration and live wood maintenance respiration costs and 2 modified DAO input (C4.5) however increases the residual unexplained observed AGNPP variance (C4 NPP; r(2) = 0.49) (C4.5 NPP; r(2) = 0.37). The overall quality of the annual NPP MODIS C4 and C4.5 products are moderate for the semi-arid Senegal because of the annual respiration cost modelling and a change in C4.5 biome-specific parameters stored in a Biome Properties Look-Up Table (BPLUT) is the main contributor to the observed discrepancy between C4 and C4.5 NPP. The dynamic range of the values of all MOD 17 products was too low when compared to observed AGNPP. An estimate of canopy water stress (SIWSI; Shortwave Infrared Water Stress Index) derived from MODIS channels 2 and 6 and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) irradiance derived from geostationary METEOSAT data were tested for primary production modelling using a stepwise linear regression analysis. PAR irradiance was combined with MODIS fAPAR into APAR (Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation) explaining 79% of the observed AGNPP variation. Introducing SIWSI significantly increased the explained variance of observed AGNPP (r(2)=0.89). MODIS-derived percentage tree cover was tested as a predictor based on the hypothesis that tree cover provides information on differences in respiratory costs between trees and grasses thereby accounting for variations in the LUE conversion efficiency epsilon. No significant reduction in residual unexplained AGNPP variance was found. Earth observation based derivation of PAR and canopy water stress from SIWSI suggest potential improvements to primary production models in semi-arid biomes that can be implemented in general NPP modelling LUE methodology.

The model estimates were found to be approximately 70% accurate using an independent set of beetle survey data as validation. This probability surface of red attack damage, along with forest inventory and terrain attributes, were used as inputs to decision tree analyses, in order to identify which forest attributes were associated with stands that had a greater likelihood of mountain pine beetle red attack damage. Three distinct decision tree models were developed, with each having a different set of input variables. The results of the analyses indicated that site index (an indicator of the quality of a forest site) and slope were the principal discriminators of the current mountain pine beetle attack, followed by basal area of pine dominated stands, and to a lesser extent, crown closure and stem density. The results suggest that indicators of site quality, particularly site index, could be a complementary addition to existing stand susceptibility rating models. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, five species were selected to examine crown-level spectral variation within and between species using HYperspectral Digital Collection Experiment (HYDICE) data collected over La Selva, Costa Rica. Spectral angle was used to evaluate the spectral variation in reflectance, first derivative and wavelet-transformed spectral domains. Results indicated that intra-crown spectral variation does not always follow a normal distribution and can vary from crown to crown, therefore presenting challenges to statistically define the spectral variation within species using conventional classification approaches that assume normal distributions. Although derivative analysis has been used extensively in hyperspectral remote sensing of vegetation, our results suggest that it might not be optimal for species identification in tropical forestry using airborne hyperspectral data. The wavelet-transformed spectra, however, were useful for the identification of tree species. The wavelet coefficients at coarse spectral scales and the wavelet energy feature are more capable of reducing variation within crowns/species and capturing spectral differences between species. The implications of this examination of intra- and inter-specific variability at crown-level were: (1) the wavelet transform is a robust tool for the identification of tree species using hyperspectral data because it can provide a systematic view of the spectra at multiple scales; and (2) it may be impractical to identify every species using only hyperspectral data, given that spectral similarity may exist between species and that within-crown/species variability may be influenced by many factors.

A method is presented where a fast atmospheric radiative transfer model and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model fields are used to correct brightness temperatures before they enter the sea ice concentration algorithm. The skill of the method is a function of the errors in the NWP model fields modulated by the sensitivities of the sea ice concentration algorithm used. The NWP model fields representing the most significant atmospheric parameters, i.e. water vapour, cloud liquid water, surface temperature and wind speed over open water are evaluated using remote sensing data. For wind speed and total water vapour, it is found that the standard deviation of the difference is less than the RMS error quoted for the remote sensing algorithms. The best consistency is found for water vapour followed by wind speed. The NWP model cloud liquid water displays standard deviations much higher than the RMS error of the remote sensing algorithm and close to the total average content. Nine sea ice concentration algorithms are further evaluated in a sensitivity study to the above-mentioned atmospheric constituents using a detailed atmospheric radiative transfer model. The result shows that the class of algorithms based solely on the 19 and 37 GHz vertically polarised channels display the smallest sensitivity to all three atmospheric parameters: total water vapour, wind speed and cloud liquid water. Finally, it is demonstrated that this method overcomes many problems associated with conventional weather filtering over mixed ice-water and new-ice pixels and allows the retrieval of sea ice concentrations below 10%.

Our study shows the power of integrating optical and flux data in LUE models to better understand factors driving surface-atmosphere carbon and water vapor flux cycles, one of the main goals of SpecNet.

Processing the raw data in individual flightlines maintained the high relative accuracy of the data set and allowed for the detection of sub-meter vegetation. First return LiDAR pulse data were used to both determine the ground surface as well as calculate vegetation heights. Surface roughness maps based on vegetation heights were found to best capture the variability of the canopy and accurately distinguish burned and unburned areas. Field validation of a sagebrush presence and absence classification based on a single roughness threshold value indicates an overall accuracy of 86%. The LiDAR-determined vegetation heights are moderately well correlated to those measured in the field, although the LiDAR heights uniformly underestimate the field heights. This underestimation is believed to be due to signal threshold limits within the LiDAR sensor, producing heights corresponding to the interior of the shrub canopy rather than the top.

Unsupervised, self-organizing ANNs have not been employed as frequently as supervised ANNs for vegetation mapping tasks, and further remote sensing research involving fuzzy ANNs is also needed. In this research, the utility of a fuzzy unsupervised ANN, specifically a fuzzy learning vector quantization (FLVQ) ANN, was investigated in the context of hyperspectral AVIRIS image classification. One key feature of the neural approach is that unlike conventional hyperspectral data processing methods, endmembers for a given scene, which can be difficult to deter-mine with confidence, are not required for neural analysis. The classification accuracy of FLVQ was comparable to a conventional supervised multi-layer perceptron, trained with backpropagation (MLP) (KHAT ((K) over cap) accuracy: 82.82% and 84.66%, respectively; normalized accuracy: 74.60% and 75.85%, respectively), with no significant difference at the 95% confidence level. All neural algorithms in the experiment yielded significantly higher classification accuracies than the conventional endmember-based hyperspectral mapping method assessed (i.e., matched filtering, where (K) over cap accuracy=61.00% and normalized accuracy= 57.96%). FLVQ was also dramatically more computationally efficient than the baseline supervised and unsupervised ANN algorithms tested, including the MLP and the Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM), respectively. The 400-neuron FLVQ network required only 3.6% of the computation time used by the MLP network, and only 5.9% of the MLP time was used by the 588-neuron FLVQ network. In addition, the 400-neuron FLVQ used only 16.7% of the time used by the 400-neuron SOM for model development. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Mapping vegetation with remote sensing covers large spatial areas and maps can be updated at an interval determined by management needs. The objective of the study was to map leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) and spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa Lam.) using 128-band hyperspectral (5-m and 3-m resolution) imagery and assess the accuracy of the resulting maps. Beiman Cutler classifications (BCC) were used to classify the imagery using the randomForest package in the R statistical program. BCC builds multiple classification trees by repeatedly taking random subsets of the observational data and using random subsets of the spectral bands to determine each split in the classification trees. The resulting classification trees vote on the correct classification. Overall accuracy was 84% for the spotted knapweed classification, with class accuracies ranging from 60% to 93%; overall accuracy was 86 for the leafy spurge classification, with class accuracies ranging from 66% to 93%. Our results indicate that (1) BCC can achieve substantial improvements in accuracy over single classification trees with these data and (2) it might be unnecessary to have separate accuracy assessment data when using BCC, as the algorithm provides a reliable internal estimate of accuracy.

Sensible heat flux consists of two components: exhausted anthropogenic heat, and heat radiation due to solar input. The latter may be enhanced by changes in the usage of artificial land surface. The authors have developed a new method to separate the anthropogenically discharged heat and natural heat radiation from the sensible heat flux, based on a heat-balance model using satellite remote sensing and ground meteorological data. This method was applied to ASTER and ETM+ data for the daytime during spring, summer and winter and for the nighttime during autumn in Nagoya, Japan. The increased sensible heat flux was approximately 100 W/m(2) in the central part of the city during the summer. Sensible heat flux at night during autumn was approximately 0 W/m(2), except in urban areas and over bodies of water. During the winter, anthropogenic heat accounted for almost all of the sensible heat flux in urban areas. The contribution of anthropogenic heat to sensible heat flux in spring was lower than the contributions in summer and winter. The anthropogenic heat flux was high in industrial areas throughout the year. These results are consistent with the fact that anthropogenic energy consumption is high in summer and winter and low in spring and autumn. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

This ET mapping algorithm (ETMA) is based on the surface energy budget and partitions the available energy between the latent and sensible heat fluxes. Two parameters T-latent and T-sensible are defined as the surface temperatures at which all of the turbulent heat flux is accounted for by the latent and sensible heat fluxes, respectively. These points are used to develop linear relationships between surface temperature and ET at specified times. Maps of ET at two times during the day are then used to model and integrate the diurnal pattern of ET using the Penman-Montieth and Jarvis-Stewart models of ET and surface resistance. The resulting maps of daily integrated ET have 1-m spatial resolution that is rarely available, yet important to the fields of hydrology, ecology, forestry, and agriculture. Our results comparing ET values to porometry-based local measurements within the meadows suggest that the mapped ETday values are accurate to within 10% of the potential ET rate or within 0.7 mm absolute error; however, under different conditions the error may be larger. The purpose of developing this algorithm was to investigate the hydroecology of restored and degraded meadows in the Sierra Nevada of northern California, USA. The pond-and-plug method of riparian restoration aims to raise the water table and re-establish native mesic vegetation that has been replaced by sagebrush and dryland species due to land-use practices over the past 150 years. By comparing the ET regime of two restored and two degraded meadows, we show that daily ET in the restored meadows (5-6.5 mm/day) was approximately twice that of the degraded ones (1.5-4 mm/day). The detailed images of ET show local impacts of land-use change and re-vegetation efforts. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

A mosaic of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) apparent surface reflectance imagery was compiled for Africa north of 10 degrees N. Landforrn image endmembers were chosen to characterize ten different types of vegetated and unvegetated desert surfaces: alluvial complexes, dunes, dry and ephemeral lakes, open water, basaltic volcanoes and flows, mountains, regs, stripped, low-angle bedrock surfaces, sand sheets, and Sahelian vegetation. Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) was applied to the MODIS mosaic to estimate landform and vegetation endmember fractions. The major landform in each MODIS pixel was identified based on the majority endmember fraction in two- or three-endmember models. Accuracy assessment was conducted using two data sources: the historic Landform Map of North Africa [Raisz, E. (1952). Landform Map of North Africa. Environmental Protection Branch, Office of the Quartermaster General.] and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data. Comparison with the Raisz landform map gave an overall classification accuracy of 54% with significant confusion between alluvial surfaces and regs, and between sandy and clayey surfaces and dunes. A second validation using 20 Landsat images in a stratified sampling scheme gave a classification accuracy of 70%, with confusion between dunes and sand sheets. Both accuracy assessment schemes indicated difficulty in vegetation classification at the margin of the Sahel. A comparison with minimum distance and maximum likelihood supervised classifications found that the MESMA approach produced significantly higher classification accuracies. This digital landform map is of sufficiently high quality to form the basis for geomorphic studies, including parameterization of the surface in global and regional dust models.

The spatial point patterns describing the distribution of very large trees in the forest within three sample blocks of 100 ha each are modeled by a series of Markov point process models. These models are fitted and assessed by standard spatial statistical methodology. Spatial distribution is regular, and interaction decreases with distance; very large trees are shown to exert repulsive interaction with their neighboring very large trees. The significance of these results for approaches of quantitative forest assessment in primary forests in the Brazilian Amazon is discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

However, these studies have also highlighted an inconsistent relationship between the actual lighted area and the boundaries of the urban areas considered. Applying detection frequency thresholds can reduce the spatial overextent of lighted area (\"blooming\") but thresholding also attenuates large numbers of smaller lights and significantly reduces the information content of the night lights datasets. Spatial analysis of the widely used 1994/1995 stable lights data and the newly released 1992/1993 and 2000 stable lights datasets quantifies the tradeoff between blooming and attenuation of smaller lights. For the 1992/1993 and 2000 datasets, a 14% detection threshold significantly reduces blooming around large settlements without attenuating many individual small settlements. The corresponding threshold for the 1994/1995 dataset is 10%. The size-frequency distributions of each dataset retain consistent shapes for increasing thresholds while the size-area distributions suggest a quasi-uniform distribution of lighted area with individual settlement size between 10 and 1000 kin equivalent diameter. Conurbations larger than 80 kin diameter account for < 1% of all settlements observed but account for about half the total lighted area worldwide. Area/perimeter distributions indicate that conurbations become increasingly dendritic as they grow larger. Comparison of lighted area with built area estimates from Landsat imagery of 17 cities shows that lighted areas are consistently larger than even maximum estimates of built areas for almost all cities in every light dataset. Thresholds > 90% can often reconcile lighted area with built area in the 1994/1995 dataset but there is not one threshold that works for a majority of the 17 cities considered. Even 100% thresholds significantly overestimate built area for the 1992/1993 and 2000 datasets. Comparison of lighted area with blooming extent for 10 lighted islands suggests a linear proportionality of 1.25 of lighted to built diameter and an additive bias of 2.7 kill. While more extensive analyses are needed, a linear relationship would be consistent with a physical model for atmospheric scattering combined with a random geolocation error. A Gaussian detection probability model is consistent with an observed sigmoid decrease of detection frequency for settlements < 10 km diameter. Taken together, these observations could provide the basis for a scale-dependent blooming correction procedure that simultaneously reduces geolocation error and scattering induced blooming.

A potentially efficient approach is one that detects vegetation changes over a hierarchy of spatial scales ranging from coarse to fine. This paper presents a Change Screening Analysis Technique (Change-SAT) designed as a coarse filter to identify the location and timing of large (> 5-10 km(2)) forest cover changes caused by anthropogenic and natural disturbances at an annual, continental scale. The method uses change metrics derived from 1-km multi-temporal SPOT VEGETATION and NOAA AVHRR imagery (reflectance, temperature, and texture information) and ancillary spatial variables (proximity to active fires, roads, and forest tenures) in combination with logistic regression and decision tree classifiers. Major forest changes of interest include wildfires, insect defoliation, forest harvesting, and flooding. Change-SAT was tested for 1998-2000 using an independent sample of change and no-change sites over Canada. Overall accuracy was 94% and commission error, especially critical for large-area change applications, was less than 1%. Regions identified as having major or widespread changes could be targeted for more detailed investigation and mapping using field visits, aerial survey, or fine resolution EO methods, such as those being applied under Canadian monitoring programs. This multi-resolution approach could be used as part of a forest monitoring system to report on carbon stocks and forest stewardship. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc.

The focus is the retrieval of water vapor, which is determined by the inversion of the radiative transfer equation in case of IASI and by the differential absorption lidar (DIAL) technique in case of WALES. It is realized that different techniques and definitions for the specification of errors exist which are subject of confusion in the remote sensing community. After a clarification of this issue, a comparison of IASI and WALES water vapor retrievals is performed using the same water vapor climatologies and the same 2-d water vapor fields provided by a global numerical weather prediction (NWP) model.   The methodologies and the capabilities of each instrument are compared in regions without clouds. Using end-to-end simulations for both instruments, which are to our knowledge performed for the first time, systematic errors are compared up to 16 km. It is found that the dependence of IASI retrievals on a variety of atmospheric parameters leads to compensating effects. Due to the multiwavelength retrieval, errors in the water vapor spectroscopy can partly cancel. The residual error is quantified by inversion of the radiative transfer equation in dependence of several atmospheric variables. In contrast, errors in water vapor DIAL are very sensitive to laser spectral properties as well as to the accuracy of water vapor spectroscopy, as single water vapor absorption lines are used for each vertical segment of the retrieval. As laser transmitters with excellent spectral specifications are feasible, this can still lead to very low systematic errors under all atmospheric conditions.   Noise errors are determined using analytical models and are compared up to 16 km. At the same vertical (1-2 km) and horizontal (100-200 km) resolutions, respectively, the average noise errors in each profile are of the order of 10% for both methods. Depending on the climatology, the vertical range of IASI measurements is always several kilometers lower than that of DIAL. The performance of IASI degrades in dry atmospheres whereas the DIAL performance remains nearly independent of the climatology chosen. Bias errors show a similar behavior. Neglecting bias errors in the spectral measurements, from mid-latitudes to the tropics, IASI biases are < 2% in the vertical range where the noise errors remain < 20%. In the sub-arctic winter atmosphere, the bias increases to about -4% close to the ground. Space home DIAL bias profiles range between -2-1% under all conditions plus an additional height independent bias of about +/- 2 due to remaining uncertainties in absorption line spectroscopy.   Operation in the region of clouds are not a focus of this publication but it is worth to mention that the results demonstrate that space home DIAL can perform measurements down to cloud tops and often through optically thin clouds. Particularly powerful is the synergistic combinations of both sensors in the future. Iteration between IASI temperature and DIAL water vapor retrievals will increase both accuracies.

In this study, we assess the ability of remote sensing to contribute to these objectives by (1) describing the underlying radiative transfer processes, drawing upon research conducted in shallow marine environments; (2) modeling the effects of water depth, substrate type, suspended sediment concentration, and surface turbulence; (3) quantifying the limitations imposed by finite detector sensitivity and linear quantization; and (4) evaluating two depth retrieval algorithms using simulated and field-measured spectra and archival imagery. The degree to which variations in depth and substrate can be resolved depends on bottom albedo and water column optical properties, and scattering by suspended sediment obscures substrate spectral features and reduces the resolution of depth estimates. Converting continuous radiance signals to discrete digital numbers implies that depth estimates take the form of contour intervals that become wider as depth increases and as bottom albedo and detector sensitivity decrease. Our results indicate that a simple band ratio can provide an image-derived variable that is strongly linearly related to water depth across a broad range of stream conditions. This technique outperformed the linear transform method used in previous stream studies, most notably for upwelling radiance spectra [R-2=0.79 for the ln(560 nm/690 nm) ratio]. Applied to uncalibrated multispectral and hyperspectral images of a fourth-order stream in Yellowstone National Park, this flexible technique produced hydraulically reasonable maps of relative depth. Although radiometric precision and spatial resolution will impose fundamental limitations in practice, remote mapping of channel morphology and in-stream habitat is feasible and can become a powerful tool for scientists and managers.

The RMS differences between SHFBWD and LHFB are estimated as 3.5 and 39.3 W/m(2), respectively. In addition, the differences of SHFBWD and LHFB during the boreal winters are smaller than that in the boreal summers. Finally, in order to study spatial and temporal variations, we apply Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis to SHFBWD and LHFB and compare with EOF analysis of Coupled Ocean and Atmosphere Data Set (COADS)\'s SHF and LHF.

Such dynamic variability of climate factors can also have significant implications for the vegetation and agricultural productivity of this region. Using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and wavelet decomposition techniques, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) monthly data over Indian sub-continent for 18 years from 1982 to 2000 have been used to study the variability of vegetation. The present study shows that the monsoon precipitation and land surface temperature over the Indian sub-continent landmass have significant impact on the distribution of vegetation. Tropospheric aerosols exert a strong influence too, albeit secondary to monsoon precipitation and prove to be a powerful governing factor. Local climate anomaly is seen to be more effective in determining the vegetation change than any global teleconnection effects. The study documents the dominating influence of monsoon precipitation and highlights the importance of aerosols on the vegetation and necessitates the need for remedial measures. The present study and an earlier one point towards a possible global teleconnection pattern of ENSO as it is seen to affect a particular mode of vegetation worldwide. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The data sets consist of radiance measurements in 356 spectral bands in visible and near-infrared wavelengths, and in either 61 or 358 different directions, but avoiding directions very close to the hot-spot. The singular value decompositions of the two-dimensional data sets are used to investigate their intrinsic dimensionality, and so also the redundancy contained in the data. A single directional function and a single spectral function together fit the data quite well in a least squares sense, with the root mean square residual amounting to one part in a hundred of the total sum of squares of the data. However, the residuals indicate that one or two further pairs of functions are needed to characterize the systematic variation of spectral reflectance with direction (or equivalently, of the angular reflectance distribution with wavelength). Three such pairs of functions are found to fit the data to better than one part in a thousand, with the residuals then showing no systematic structure. The consequences for atmospheric correction of multi-view remote sensing data are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

This study investigates the applicability of vegetation fraction derived from a spectral mixture model as an alternative indicator of vegetation abundance. This is based on examination of a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image of Indianapolis City, IN, U M, acquired on June 22, 2002. The transformed ETM+ image was unmixed into three fraction images (green vegetation, dry soil, and shade) with a constrained least-square solution. These fraction images were then used for land cover classification based on a hybrid classification procedure that combined maximum likelihood and decision tree algorithms. Results demonstrate that LST possessed a slightly stronger negative correlation with the unmixed vegetation fraction than with NDVI for all land cover types across the spatial resolution (30 to 960 m). Correlations reached their strongest at the 120-m resolution, which is believed to be the operational scale of LST, NDVI, and vegetation fraction images. Fractal analysis of image texture shows that the complexity of these images increased initially with pixel aggregation and peaked around 120 m, but decreased with further aggregation. The spatial variability of texture in LST was positively correlated with those in NDVI and in vegetation fraction. The interplay between thermal and vegetation dynamics in the context of different land cover types leads to the variations in spectral radiance and texture in LST. These variations are also present in the other imagery, and are responsible for the spatial patterns of urban heat islands. It is suggested that the areal measure of vegetation abundance by unmixed vegetation fraction has a more direct correspondence with the radiative, thennal, and moisture properties of the Earth\'s surface that determine LST.

Critical to the success of MODIS and other sensor products is an independent evaluation of product quality. In that context, we describe a study using field data and Landsat ETM+ to map land cover and LAI at four 49-km(2) sites in North America containing agricultural cropland (AGRO), prairie grassland (KONZ), boreal needleleaf forest, and temperate mixed forest. The purpose was to: (1) develop accurate maps of land cover, based on the MODIS IGBP (International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme) land cover classification scheme; (2) derive continuous surfaces of LAI that capture the mean and variability of the LAI field measurements; and (3) conduct initial MODIS validation exercises to assess the quality of early (i.e., provisional) MODIS products. ETM+ land cover maps varied in overall accuracy from 81% to 95%. The boreal forest was the most spatially complex, had the greatest number of classes, and the lowest accuracy. The intensive agricultural cropland had the simplest spatial structure, the least number of classes, and the highest overall accuracy. At each site, mapped LAI patterns generally followed patterns of land cover across the site. Predicted versus observed LAI indicated a high degree of correspondence between field-based measures and ETM+ predictions of LAI. Direct comparisons of ETM+ land cover maps with Collection 3 MODIS cover maps revealed several important distinctions and similarities. One obvious difference was associated with image/map resolution. ETM+ captured much of the spatial complexity of land cover at the sites. In contrast, the relatively coarse resolution of MODIS did not allow for that level of spatial detail. Over the extent of all sites, the greatest difference was an overprediction by MODIS of evergreen needleleaf forest cover at the boreal forest site, which consisted largely of open shrubland, woody savanna, and savanna. At the agricultural, temperate mixed forest, and prairie grassland sites, ETM+ and MODIS cover estimates were similar. Collection 3 MODIS-based LAI estimates were considerably higher (up to 4 m(2) m(-2)) than those based on ETM+ LAI at each site. There are numerous probable reasons for this, the most important being the algorithms\' sensitivity to MODIS reflectance calibration, its use of a prelaunch AVHRR-based land cover map, and its apparent reliance on mainly red and near-IR reflectance. Samples of Collection 4 LAI products were examined and found to consist of significantly improved LAI predictions for KONZ, and to some extent for AGRO, but not for the other two sites. In this study, we demonstrate that MODIS reflectance data are highly correlated with LAI across three study sites, with relationships increasing in strength from 500 to 1000 in spatial resolution, when shortwave-infrared bands are included.

The smoke and ash plume originating from the volcano stretched from the Sicily to the north African coast.   The plume from the volcano has been identified and tracked using half-hourly Meteosat-7 visible, infrared, and water vapor imagery in order to estimate the radiative forcing produced by the introduction of the volcanic cloud in a previously clear sky. Our results indicate that, while the volcanic cloud has introduced a well-discernable radiative perturbation, the magnitude of the shortwave volcanic forcing appears in the range of the one introduced by large clouds above the Mediterranean Sea. By contrast, the perturbation generated in the longwave spectrum at the top of the atmosphere is larger than the one introduced by large meteorological clouds. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

It was found that the NDVI derived from in situ measured spectral reflectance was closely correlated with percent grass cover (R-2 = 0.74), but not with its counterpart derived from the satellite image. After standardization of the latter with the former, the TM-derived NDVI bore a close regression relationship with the in situ measured samples (R-2 = 0.74).

Both melt pond development and its spatial distribution are needed to understand the surface energy balance in summer. Previously, a technique was developed for classifying summer sea ice characteristics, including the amount of open water, white (snow-covered) ice, wet ice, and melt ponds using Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) spectral information. In this paper, we refine this technique through the use of airborne video data coincident with Landsat ETM+ imagery obtained over Baffin Bay on June 27, 2000. The video images, having a resolution of about 1.5 m at an aircraft altitude of 1.4 km, are classified into open water, ponded or wet ice, and unponded sea ice. Comparison of the video and Landsat imagery shows that many of the melt ponds are too small to cover an entire Landsat pixel (resolution of 30 in) so that the Landsat classification scheme would underestimate melt pond fraction. Thirteen high-resolution video images are classified to develop a method to calculate fractions of open water, ponded or wet ice, and unponded ice from Landsat 7 data. A comparison between these classified video images and Landsat retrievals yields a correlation coefficient of 0.95 with rms errors of less than 9% for the two ice types and 2% for open water. Comparisons of Landsat and video analyses not used in the development of the algorithm yield correlation coefficients of 0.87 for open water, 0.68 for ponded ice, and 0.78 for unponded ice. The rms differences are 10%, 8%, and 11 %, respectively. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', 'NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Lab Hydrospher Proc, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.

Data were defined as ground elevation if heights were less than 0.6 m. A cluster analysis was used to discriminate crown base height, allowing identification of both tree and understory canopy heights. Tree height was defined as the 99 percentile of the tree crown height group, while crown base height was the I percentile of the tree crown height group. Tree cover (TC) was estimated from the fraction of total tree laser hits relative to the total number of laser hits. Surface canopy (SC) height was computed as the 99 percentile of the surface canopy group. Surface canopy cover is equal to the fraction of total surface canopy hits relative to the total number of hits, once the canopy height profile (CHP) was corrected. Crown bulk density (CBD) was obtained from foliage biomass (FB) estimate and crown volume (CV), using an empirical equation for foliage biomass. Crown volume was estimated as the crown area times the crown height after a correction for mean canopy cover. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

This set includes the soil reflectance, the single-scattering albedo, canopy transmittance, reflectance and interception, the portion of uncollided radiation in the total incident radiation, and portions of collided canopy transmittance and interception. All of these are measurable; they satisfy a simple system of equations and constitute a set that fully describes the law of energy conservation in vegetation canopies at any wavelength in the visible and near-infrared part of the solar spectrum. Further, the system of equations specifies the relationship between the optical properties at the leaf and the canopy scales. Thus, the information content of hyperspectral data can be fully exploited if these variables can be retrieved, for they can be more directly related to some of the physical properties of the canopy (e.g. leaf area index). This paper demonstrates this concept through retrievals of single-scattering albedo, canopy absorptance, portions of uncollided and collided canopy transmittance, and interception from hyperspectral data collected during a field campaign in Ruokolahti, Finland, June 14-21, 2000.

Mixture analysis approaches in remote sensing vary from conventional linear mixture models to nonlinear neural network mixture models. Linear mixture models are fairly simple and generally result in poor mixture analysis accuracy. Neural network models can achieve much higher accuracy, but typically lack interpretability. In this paper we present a mixture discriminant analysis (MDA) model for inferring land cover fractions within forest stands from Landsat Thematic Mapper images. Specifically, individual class distributions are modeled as mixtures of subclasses of Gaussian distributions, and land cover fractions are estimated using the corresponding posterior probabilities. Compared to a benchmark study on accuracy of mixture models with Plumas National Forest data, this MDA model easily outperforms traditional linear mixture models and parallels the performance of the ARTMAP neural network mixture model. In other words, the MDA model is observed to successfully combine the performance characteristics of more complex neural network models (due to the nonlinear nature of its classification rules), with the ease of interpretation associated with linear mixture models (due to its relatively simple structure). MDA models therefore offer an attractive alternative for addressing the mixture modeling problem in remote sensing. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Snow-field measurements coinciding with the RADARSAT SAR overpasses are used to explore and set out optimal conditions for wet snow detection, as a function of the sensor incidence angles. The conditions concern wet snow surface characteristics, mainly the roughness represented by the surface slope m and the volumetric liquid water content, snwc (vol.%). Based on the 3-dB threshold value used in several wet snow detection algorithms, the results show that in order to be discriminated from dry snow covers, wet snow surfaces must be characterized as: (a) m less than or equal to 0.058 and snwc greater than or equal to 1.1, if the sensor operates in the S1 mode (20-27degrees incidence angle range), and (b) m less than or equal to 0.082 and snwc greater than or equal to 3.0, if the observations are made in the S7 mode (45-49degrees incidence angle range). For the identification of a very wet snow, it is also shown that the S7 mode of RADARSAT SAR sensor is more suitable than the S 1 mode. The latter, however, provides better discrimination for low values of the snow liquid water content. Furthermore, for wet snow detection based on modeling, the present paper demonstrates the importance of using the appropriate methodology to assess the dielectric constant of the background medium.

The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which are correlated to a number of vegetation properties (e.g., net primary production, leaf area index), were compared. The results show that there is a large disagreement between NDVI and EVI anomalies in 1998 and 1999 for Northern Asia. The NDVI anomaly in 1998 was largely affected by atmospheric contamination, predominantly aerosols from extensive forest fires in that year. The EVI anomaly in 1998 was less sensitive to residual atmospheric contamination, as it is designed to be, and thus EVI is a useful alternative vegetation index for the large-scale study of vegetation. The EVI anomaly also suggests that potential vegetation productivity in Northern Asia was highest in 1998 but declined substantially in 2001, consistent with precipitation data from 1998-2001.

The results indicate that annual cycles dominate the two leading VEOF modes. The first VEOF shows the East Asian monsoon features and the second represents a spring-autumn oscillation. We removed the annual signal from the data set and calculated the interannual VEOFs. The first interannual VEOF represents the interannual variability existing in the spring-autumn oscillation. The temporal mode is correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index (Sol), but has a half-year lag with respect to the SOI. The spatial mode of the first interannual VEOF reflects the response of the tropical and extratropical winds to ENSO events. The second interannual VEOF is another ENSO related mode, and the temporal VEOF mode is correlated with the SOI with a correlation coefficient of 0.78, revealing the wind variability over mid-latitudes, which is associated with ENSO events. Further analysis indicated that the wind variability over the coast of East Asia represents anomalies of a Hadley cell. The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) was found in the temporal mode, indicating and verifying that the QBO in the wind fields is related to ENSO events. The third VEOF shows the interannaul variability in the winter-summer mode and displays the interannual variability of the East Asian monsoon. The three leading interannual VEOFs are statistically meaningful as confirmed by a significance test. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Ten soils covering a large range of composition have been sampled. To decrease the large dimensionality of the data set, we reduced the number of wavebands investigated thanks to a simple stepwise linear regression. Seven wavebands were selected, which represent the whole spectral domain for the 10 soils and all moisture conditions with a root mean square error (RMSE) better than 0.002, close to the experimental uncertainties. Each soil reflectance spectrum was normalized by the corresponding reflectance spectrum observed under the driest condition. This allows to minimize effects due to soil type, as well as those of other undesirable multiplicative factors such as roughness and measurement configuration. The relationship between the normalized soil reflectance and moisture was then investigated. For all the wavelengths and all the soils, results show that for low soil moisture levels, the reflectance decreased when the moisture increased. Conversely, after a critical point, soil reflectance increased with soil moisture. For some soils, the reflectance of the wettest conditions can overpass that of the driest conditions. The position of the critical point was related to soil hydrodynamic properties. For both low and high soil moisture levels, and the seven wavelengths selected, the relative reflectance was strongly correlated with moisture. Adjustment of the relationships over individual soil types provides better soil moisture retrieval performances. It also shows that the relationships are generally nonlinear. These results are discussed with regards to the underlying physical processes, as well as for application to soil moisture estimates from reflectance measurements. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

While random and stratified random sampling of calibration and validation into calibration (training) and validation (testing) subsets has often been based on pixel sampling, the resulting accuracy statements may be overly optimistic and biased due to spatial autocorrelation. This is especially true for decision tree and neural network algorithms that tend to learn examples well even when just a single pixel from a site is presented in the learning phase. Therefore, polygon- or site-based sampling (using groups of contiguous pixels) for calibration and validation may provide better estimates of prediction accuracies. This paper presents the results of pixel- versus polygon-based calibration and validation of a supervised Gaussian ARTMAP neural network algorithm. Both techniques were applied to (1) a multitemporal AVHRR vegetation index data set and (2) a multitemporal data set of NDVI, temperature, and additional temporal metric and physical data to map vegetation and land cover (VLC) based on a regional network of sites in Central America. Our results indicate that although pixel-based accuracy assessment because of spatial autocorrelation may overstate accuracy, polygon-based assessments are also problematic. The Gaussian ARTMAP algorithm was used to provide insight into the problems of site heterogeneity, per-class accuracy, sampling rate, sampling representativeness, and the generalization properties of sites and classes, as related to pixel- and polygon-based sampling.

This research specifically takes into account the uncertainties in albedo that we can expect due to the synergistic use of the European Polar System (EPS)/Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Meteosat Second Generation (MSG)/Scanning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) instruments data. Satellite orbital models and a Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves (SAIL)-hotspot canopy radiative transfer model were used to simulate synthetic bidirectional reflectance data sets for a broad range of vegetation canopies. The surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) database derived from the Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectance (POLDER) data was used in support of the simulations. Spectral atmospheric effects were generated using the 6S atmospheric radiative transfer code. Linear BRDF models, which are candidates for operational use, were inverted with the synthetic reflectance data sets of MSG, AVHRR and MSG-AVHRR combined. The BRDF parameters were then used to derive albedo by hemispherical angular integration. The retrieved model coefficients are discussed with regard to angular sampling and the implications these yield on spectral and broadband albedo determinations. It appears that the sampling problem is better conditioned thanks to the synergistic nature of MSG and AVHRR data. This synergy contributed to enhanced albedo retrievals, but can introduce larger uncertainties due to issues related to the differences in spectral bands and atmospheric state. Hence, the quality of the operational albedo products derived from one or More sources of satellite data will depend to a large extent on sensor characteristics (spectral, radiometric, and geometric), cloud detection, atmospheric correction, the angular distribution of the observations, and finally, the narrow-to-broadband albedo conversion.

In this article, a computer graphics method-Lindenmayer-systems (L-systems) - is used to render a series of leaf (grass) and architecturally realistic row-planted crop (corn-like) canopies that have a variety of geometrical structures. A radiosity-graphics combined model is then employed to calculate the radiation regime in a canopy, including canopy directional reflectance. An effectiveness ratio (E ratio) is proposed, which is able to evaluate the performance of a given measure or index in estimation of the parameter of interest under the influence of a number of \"noise\" factors (other geometric and optical parameters of the canopy) at various noise levels. This E ratio is then applied to evaluate reflectance and normalized reflectance in the hotspot region for leaf geometry characterization. The result from simulated hotspot reflectance demonstrates that for both canopies, leaf geometry is estimable by using normalized reflectance within +/-4-8degrees (or +/-2-4degrees) around the hotspot direction in the principal cone (or principal plane). However, the center position and angular width of the optimal sampling region are affected by the number of noise factors [such as leaf area index, leaf angle distribution for leaf canopies, plus row structure for row-plant crop canopies] and their variation ranges. In most cases, normalized spectral reflectance in the near-infrared at a high solar zenith angle in the PC produces the most reliable results. The reason for better estimation of leaf geometry for grass and crop canopies than forests from hotspot observations is also discussed in this article. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Remotely sensed observations by satellite sensors are the only feasible means of obtaining regional- and continental-scale measurements of climate at regular intervals for real-time epidemiological applications, such as disease early warning systems. The potential of Pathfinder AVHRR Land (PAL) data to provide surrogate variables for near-surface air temperature (T-a) and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) over Africa and Europe was assessed in this context. For the years 1988- 1990 and 1992, correlations were examined between meteorological ground measurements (monthly mean T-a and VPDgrd) and variables derived from advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data [land surface temperature (LST) and VPDsat]. The AVHRR indices were derived from both daily and composite PAL data so that their relative performance could be determined. Furthermore, the ground observations were divided into African and European subsets, so that the relative performance of the satellite data at tropical/subtropical and temperate latitudes could be assessed. Significant correlations were shown between T-a and LST in all months. Temporal variability existed in the strength of correlations throughout any 12-month period, with the pattern of variability consistent between years. The adjusted r(2) values increased when elevation and the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) were included, in addition to LST as predictor variables of T-a. Attempts to derive monthly estimates of atmospheric moisture availability resulted in an overestimation of VPDsat compared to ground observations, VPDgrd,. The use of daily PAL data to derive monthly mean climatic indices was shown to be more accurate than those obtained using monthly maximum values from 10-day composite data. A subset of the 1992 data was then used to build linear regression models for the direct retrieval of monthly mean T-a from PAL data. The accuracy of retrieved estimates was greatest when NDVI was included with LST as predictor variables, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) varying from 1.83degreesC to 3.18degreesC with a mean of 2.38degreesC over the 12-month period.

The surface forcing consists of wind stress and turbulent heat flux, which were estimated through the TOGA/COARE algorithm using Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) wind, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) SST, and surface atmospheric conditions derived from National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalyses data. Net heat flux was derived by combining the turbulent heat flux with net short- and long-wave radiation from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data set. SST cooling was monitored by using 9-km spatial resolution pathfinder SST that was derived from the AVHRR. The 7-year weekly mean maps of wind stress, net heat flux, and SST indicate that SST cooling is locally influenced by surface forcing in- and offshore of the Gulf of Mannar. A time series of these parameters near the Indian tip reveal that the strong wind stress and high surface heat loss, which are punctuated in time varying from 15 days to more than a month, occur every winter and lower SST by similar to1.5 degreesC. The occurrence of such a phenomenon is referred to as an event in this work. The bell-shaped events, which have a periodicity, of 15 days with a maximum wind stress around Day 8, occur every winter and are characterized by the SST cooling of less than a degree. The features of these events are studied by using the statistical correlation and composite technique. It is inferred that the SST cooling is strongly correlated with the surface forcing.

Commonly used frequencies of 1.4 GHz, 2.7 GHz, and 6.6 GHz at vertical and/or horizontal linear polarizations are considered. The best single-channel retrieval uses 1.4 GHz at vertical polarization (1.4 V). This channel is least sensitive to variable surface roughness and vegetation canopy, but all single-channel sensors, including 1.4 V, are degraded without some level of a priori information about these masking variables. The sensitivity to surface roughness is reduced significantly at 2.7 GHz and 6.6 GHz by increasing the angle of incidence beyond 25 degrees. The best two-channel case uses 1.4 V and 2.7 H to simultaneously retrieve both soil moisture and surface roughness. This improves the soil moisture retrieval and eliminates the need for a priori information about surface roughness. The sensitivity to variations in vegetation canopy is also acceptably small. Simultaneous use of all six channels to retrieve soil moisture, surface roughness, and vegetation canopy provides only marginal improvement over the best two-channel performance. The small amount of additional information contained in the other four channels is largely masked by typical levels of measurement noise.

Yet, remotely sensed data are not error-free. This paper presents a geostatistical method to model spatial uncertainty in estimates of the areal extent of land-cover types. The area estimates are based on exhaustive but uncertain (soft) remotely sensed data and a sample of reference (hard) data. The method requires a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive land-cover classes. Land-cover regions should be larger than the pixels\' ground resolution cells. Using sequential indicator simulation, a set of equally probable maps are generated from which uncertainties regarding land-cover patterns are inferred. Collocated indicator cokriging, the geostatistical estimation method employed, explicitly accounts for the spatial cross-correlation between hard and soft data using a simplified model of coregionalization. The method is illustrated using a case study from southern Spain. Demonstrated uncertainties concern the areal extent of a contiguous olive region and the proportion of olive vegetation within large pixel blocks. As the image-derived olive data were not very informative, conditioning on hard data had a considerable effect on the area estimates and their uncertainties. For example, the expected areal extent of the contiguous olive region increased from 65 ha to 217 ha when conditioning on the reference sample.

The standard errors of estimate of the surface variables are computed for variations configurations as a function of both the uncertainties associated with the space measurements and those associated with the ancillary information used in the retrievals. The potential of SMOS and the possibility to retrieve one, two, or three surface variables are investigated, depending on the view angle configuration. These questions are key issues to optimize the SMOS mission scenario to meet both the scientific requirements and the technical constraints of the mission.

This analysis decomposed the spatial variability of remotely sensed sea surface temperature in 124 images that covered an offshore distance of 200 km and an alongshore distance of 500 km. The first mode empirical orthogonal function described 65% of the spatial variability in the data set. The spatial amplitude patter of the first mode, which closely resembled the mean of all the images, revealed a strong cross-shore gradient with much cooler water nearshore and warmer water offshore. These areas of cool waters were associated with known upwelling locales, and the large-scale temperature structure compared favorably to that derived from historical California Cooperative Oceanographic Fisheries Investigation (CalCOFI) climatology. The mode 1 temporal amplitude function, representing the temporal modulation of this spatial patter, was coupled with changes in the alongshore component of the coastal wind field. Interannual variations in the timing of the spring transition were reflected in this temporal amplitude time series. The second mode empirical orthogonal function described 11% of the variability in the data set. The spatial pattern revealed a north-south structure that appeared to be related to regional spatial variations in the strength of upwelling-favorable wind. The third empirical orthogonal function described only 3% of the data variability and the spatial structure suggested a meandering of the coastal surface flow. The results of this investigation indicate that the empirical orthogonal function method was effective at characterizing front the satellite data the dominant nearshore surface properties of die California Current System related to upwelling and rc;ind and by extension suggest that it is a suitable approach for remotely investigating other less well known easter boundary current systems.

Quantifying plant litter cover is important for interpreting vegetated landscapes and for evaluating the effectiveness of conservation tillage practices. Current methods of measuring litter cover are subjective, requiring considerable visual judgment. Reliable and objective methods are needed. The spectral reflectance (0.4-2.5 mu m) of wet and dry soils (six types) and plant litters (2 crops, 14 forest, and 2 grasses) of different ages were measured. Discrimination of plant litters from the soils was ambiguous in the visible and near-infrared (0.4-1.1 mu m) wavelength region. An absorption feature associated with cellulose and lignin was observed at 2.1 mu m in the spectra of dry plant litter, which was not present in the spectra of soils. A new spectral variable, cellulose absorption index (CAI), was defined using the relative depth of the reflectance spectra at 2.1 mu m. CAI of dry litter was significantly greater than CAI of soils. CAI generally decreased with age of the litter. Water absorption dominated the spectral properties of both soils and plant litter and significantly reduced the CAI of the plant litters. Nevertheless, the CAI of wet litter was significantly greater than CAI of wet soil. This study provides a new methodology to discriminate plant litter from soils by differences in spectral reflectance produced by their physical and chemical attributes. This remote sensing method should improve quantification of plant litter cover and thus improve estimates of phytomass production, surface energy balance, and the effectiveness of soil conservation practices. Plant litter reflectance is a verifiable component in vegetative landscapes and should be labeled and modeled separately from soils in landscape studies.

In deriving surface parameters using remotely sensed data,the transportability of algorithms from one resolution to another is often of great concern because of the surface heterogenity. This article addresses this scaling issue through image degradation experiments using a Landsat TM image. It is shown theoretically that scaling problems in deriving surface parameters exist not only because of nonlinearity in the relationships between re-mofe sensing measurements such as NDVI(normalized difference vegetation index) and SR (simple ratio) and the parameters of interest, but also because of the discontinuity between contrasting cover types within a mixed pixel. To quantify the effects of the nonlinearity and discontinuity on scaling, it is found that contextural parameters are more: effective than textural parameters. Contexture-based functions ns are derived for the estimation of the scaling effects: on leaf area index (LAI) calculations using algorithms based on NDVI and SR separately. Based on NDVI-LAI and SR-LAI relationships that were derived at the Landsat TM scale (30 m) as part of the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS), the effects of scaling on the retrieval of LAI were investigated using nine selected areas of the same size (990 mX990 m) but different water area fractions The following conclusions are drawn from the investigation: 1) Negative biases in the estimation of LAI occur when either the NDVI or SR algorithm derived at a fine resolution (Landsat TM) is used for calculations at a coarse resolution (for example, AVHRR). 2) The amount of the biases depends on the surface heterogenity . For a pure forest pixel, the bias caused by the nonlinearity of the NDVI algorithm was smaller than 2% and the linear SR algorithm induces no error in scaling. Therefore, the scaling problem for pure pixels may be ignored for many applications using either linens or non-linear algorithms. 3) Large negative-biases occur when a pixel contains interfaces between two or more contrasting surfaces. In the case of two contrasting surfaces between vegetation and open water; the biases can be up to 45% of the correct value depending of the water area fraction in the pixel. The biases in this case depend on contexture and little on texture. Simulations show; that the most useful contextural parameter for quantifying the scaling effects in vegetation-water;ater mixed pixels is the water area fraction within each degraded pixel. Algorithms for remote sensing applications can be transported from one scale to another, if the information on the water body size is available. This study shows the need for global water masks; at high resolutions for the purpose of accurate derivation of surface parameters maps at various resolutions. In boreal regions, this is particularly important because of the large number of small water bodies. Crown copyright (C) 1999.

We flew over the Straits of Dover. The main goal of this activity was to see how well we can, characterize the atmospheric aerosols using POLDER data in order to achieve atmospheric corrections for ocean color purposes. We also set up atmospheric measurements (solar extinction, sky radiance, and degree of polarization) on which we tested classical aerosol medals (Junge size distribution; Shettle and Fenn, 1979) for retrieval. For standard meteorological visibilities, such models allow correct matching of the measurements. For most turbid days, if is shown that a submicron particles haze can be superposed to the continental aerosol background. But we indicated that the SF models enable a good retrieval of the measurements. They thus appear relevant to describe more complex situations. Classically, we first used POLDER images to select an aerosol model based on the spectral dependence of the aerosol reflectance between the red and the infrared for which the water is dark off-shore of the Straits. Compared again to the SF models, the spectral dependence observed differ substantially bl large angular variations. A detailed analysis showed that these large dispersions are not related to instrumental noise but to natural variation of the aerosols and to residual errors in the Fresnel reflection correction. By averaging, we can also propose SF models. Both ground-based and POLDER-derived aerosol models are consistent In terms of retrieval of the atmospheric functions required for atmospheric corrections. We also tried less successfully a selection based on the polarized reflectance which is a POLDER capability.

The use of polarimetric and multiwavelength SAR is reviewed and comments on the advantages of the various combinations are noted. SAR data are very useful in mapping dunes because of the ability to control illumination parameters such as look angle, wavelength, and polarization. Furthermore, the unique responses of SAR to surface roughness are found very useful in mapping dune forms. For most sites, the longer wavelengths, P- and L-band at lambda=68 cm and 24 cm, are advantageous over the shorter (C-band at lambda.=5.6 cm) providing better contrast. Overall, copolarized channels (HH and W) are found best for mapping the dunes and dune types. When trying to discriminate active from inactive dunes cross-polarized channels provide essential information on vegetation.

The interpretation of the sigma degrees temporal plots is performed with the assistance of a semiempirical backscattering model combined with an ecosystem grassland model. Contributions of the various components of the Sahelian landscape to the total backscattering are identified. Overall, the soil contribution is always large but the sigma degrees(45) temporal plots reflect well the vegetation development. The analysis of the different contributions leads to a simplification of the backscattering model. Finally, this latter is parameterized as a function of two surface parameters, namely, the soil volumetric water content and the vegetation biomass.

Spatial associations between broad-scale land-cover-change maps and fire-distribution maps were calculated.

The main conclusion is that the scale of the data analyzed in this study is inappropriate for reaching any definitive conclusion on the effect of fires on land cover.

The images were obtained during June 1994 and covered an agricultural site composed of large fields of partial-cover cotton, near-full-cover alfalfa, and bare soil fields of varying roughness. Results showed that the SAR Ku backscatter coefficient (Ku-band sigma degrees) teas sensitive to soil roughness and insensitive to soil moisture conditions when vegetation was present. When soil roughness conditions were relatively similar (e.g., for cotton fields of similar row direction and for all alfalfa fields), Ku-band sigma degrees was sensitive to the fraction of the surface covered by vegetation. Under these conditions, the Ku-band sigma degrees and the optical normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were generally correlated. The SAR C backscatter coefficient (C-band sigma degrees) was found to be sensitive to soil moistu re conditions for cotton fields with green leaf area index (GLAI) less than 1.0 and alfalfa fields with GLAI nearly 2.0. For both low-GLAI cotton and alfalfa, C-band sigma degrees was correlated with measurements of surface temperature (T-s). A theoretical basis for the relations between Ku-band sigma degrees and NDVI and between C-band sigma degrees and T-s was presented and supported with on-site measurements. On the basis of these findings, some combined optical and radar approaches are suggested for crop management applications.

In this paper we report the results of the land-cover classification of the SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data acquired during the Boreal Ecosystem Atmospheric Study\'s intensive field campaigns over the southern study area near Prince Albert, Canada. A Bayesian maximum a posteriori classifier was applied on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Jet Propulsion Laboratory airborne SAR images covering the region during the peak of the growing season in July 1994. The approach is supervised in the sense that a combination of field data and existing land-cover maps are used to develop training areas for the desired classes. The images acquired were first radiometrically and absolutely calibrated the incidence angle effect in airborne images was corrected to art acceptable accuracy, and the images were used in a mosaic form and geocoded and georeferenced with an existing land-cover map for validation purposes. The results shore that SAR images can be classified into dominant forest types such as jack pine, black spruce, trembling aspen, clearing, open. water and three categories of mired strands with better than 90% accuracy. The unispecies stands such as jack pine and black spruce are separated with 98% accuracy, but the accuracy of mixed coniferous and deciduous stands suffers from confusing factors such as varying species composition, surface moisture, and understory effects. To satisfy the requirements of process models, the number of cover types was reduced from eight to five general classes of conifer wet, conifer dry, mixed deciduous, disturbed, and open water. Reduction of classes improved the overall accuracy of the classification over the entire region from 77% to 92%.

We employed a PS-II (personal spectrometer II) portable field spectroradiometer to measure narrow-band spectra at nadir and the PARABOLA (portable apparatus for rapid acquisition of bidirectional observations of the land and atmosphere) three-channel radiometer to gather bidirectional radiometric data over almost the complete ground hemisphere. Measurements were taken at a lowland wet sedge site and at two tussock tundra sites containing different amounts of woody deciduous shrub cover. PS-II nadir measurements alone allowed spectral differentiation between the highly senescent wet sedge site and the two relatively greener tussock tundra sites but did not allow clear discrimination between tussock tundra sites. Off-nadir measurements, however, permitted good discrimination between the two tussock tundra sites. For example, the reflectance-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVIrho) difference between the tussock tunda sites at a 75 degrees forward-scatter view angle averaged 26% over a range of solar zenith angles (Theta(s)s). Similarly, NDVI rho calculated from PARABOLA spectral hemispheric data averaged 6% higher in woody tussock tundra than in nonwoody tussock tundra. Differences between the tussock sites calculated by using NDVI based on hemispheric radiance (NDVIL) were greater than those calculated by using hemispheric NDVI rho by approximately a factor of two regardless of Theta(s). Measurements taken when Theta(s)=75 degrees generally exhibited the largest differences between NDVI at the two tussock tundra sites. Although nadir measurements exhibited minimal differences between tussock tundra types, bidirectional and hemispheric-based NDVI values revealed differences in tussock tundra woody vegetation cover because large view zenith angles were sensitive to the woody shrub foliage that extends above the hummocky tundra surface in early spring. These results may be useful for detecting changes in tundra woody cover through time. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.', 'NASA, GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CTR, GREENBELT, MD 20771 USA.

Three separate regions (Plumas and Stanislaus National Forests and Lake Tahoe Basin) in the northern Sierra Nevada serve as test sites: the first for model calibration and the others for extrapolation and validation of the area correction methods. The use of one (or a few) large sites to calibrate models for extrapolative application over large areas represents a global test-site sampling strategy that most easily can be employed for the development of global land cover and land-cover change products. The inverse estimator, calibrated on scale-specific interclass transition matrices, produces the best overall results at the coarser scales for both validation sites. Good results probably occur because the conditional probabilities in the transition matrices implicitly carry information about the spatial organization of the landscape. This method performs poorly at finer scales, or in cases where the calibration and validation sites have dissimilar spatial organization, or class confusions. The slope estimator, calibrated on the coefficients of scale-specific proportion transition lines, produces improved estimates over uncorrected values at all scales. The slope estimator appears to generalize most successfully because It characterizes the basic tendency of small classes to diminish and large classes to increase in size as the landscape is represented at increasingly coarser scales. The positive results achieved using the inverse estimator and the slope estimator indicate potential for using such a posteriori calibration methods to improve coarse resolution land-cover area estimates over large regions.

This precision gain is achieved by employing a regression estimator commonly used in survey sampling. Practically important gains in precision can be achieved with no additional complication in the sampling design and without additional field visits. The only additional cost incurred is that of obtaining the auxiliary data. The regression estimator can be used with simple random or systematic sampling if auxiliary information is available on the entire region represented by the land cover map. Alternatively, a more practical design for accuracy assessment would be double sampling, which requires that the auxiliary information be obtained for only a subsample of the map region. Appropriate estimators and standard errors are presented for using the regression estimator with either simple random or double sampling.

The contributions to the overall surface reflectance in the visible spectral bands by the soil-reflectance, leaf-reflection, and leaf-transmission (which are assumed isotropic) are analyzed under different view/illumination geometries. High values of leaf reflectance r, relative to leaf transmittance t, produce significantly different patterns of bidirectional reflectance, because r and t control the backscattering and the forward scattering, respectively. These two effects, especially strong at large solar zenith angles, produce high canopy reflectance at large view zenith angles around the principal plane. Model inversion with the PARABOLA bidirectional reflectance measurements over the Konza Prairie yield values of r and t for grassblades of this grassland canopy. The inversion results point to a possibility of assessing canopy condition from its bidirectional reflectances, as both r and t are sensitive to plant vigor and phenology. In an inversion with satellite measurements over a desert-scrub surface in the northern Sinai, the optical thickness of these dark plants (inferred in the visible band) and the near-infrared reflectance of the plant elements were inferred.

In this study, the sensitivity of the backscattering coefficient was investigated in conjunction with the soil moisture content of vegetation-covered (corn) fields.

The AIRSAR overflight at Oberpfaffenhofen was complemented by intensive ground truth measurements The study was carried out with a monotemporal data set. The sampled corn fields are nearly in the same SAR incidence angle range (approximate to 30 degrees) to avoid effects caused by differences in the local incidence angle. The fields include three different soil types to get more variation in SMC. In summary, it can be stated that at L-band, and especially at C-band, frequencies and an incidence angle of approximately 30 degrees, the attenuation coefficient of the vegetation canopy is too high for monitoring soil moisture with only a monotemporal data set. Other parameters like phenology, plant density and geometry, and row direction mask differences in the SMC. The results show that the backscattering, measuring using the P-band, can be well described with just two parameters. SMC is the dominant parameter influencing the backscattering. The secondary parameter is the row direction of the corn plants relative to look direction. With these two parameters, about 90% of the backscattering can be described. The best polarization combinations for SMC analysis are HH polarization and the difference in power between HH and HV polarizations. The study results suggest that the P-band is very suitable for soil moisture analysis from SAR imagery.RP WEVER, T (通讯作者)，UNIV MUNICH,DEPT GEN & APPL GEOL,WORKING GRP REMOTE SENSING,LUISENSTR 37,D-80333 MUNICH,GERMANY.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 9, 7, 7, 0, 2, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE PUBL CO INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Satellite remote sensing holds the potential for mapping and monitoring the effects of such environmental changes over large geographic areas in a timely manner. Results from the application of a forest canopy reflectance model using multitemporal Landsat TM imagery and field measurements, indicate conifer mortality can be effectively mapped and inventoried. The test area for this project is the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit in the Sierra Nevada of California. The Landsat TM images are from the summers of 1988 and 1991. The Li-Strahler canopy model estimates several forest stand parameters, including tree size and canopy cover for each conifer stand, from reflectance values in satellite imagery. The difference in cover estimates between the dates forms the basis for stratifying stands into mortality classes, which are used as both themes in a map and the basis of the field sampling design. Field measurements from 61 stands collected in the summer of 1992 indicate 15% of the original timber volume in the true fir zone died between 1988 and 1992. The resulting low standard error of 11% for this estimate indicates the utility of these mortality classes for detecting areas of high mortality. Also, the patterns in the estimated mean timber volume loss for each class follow the expected trends. The results of this project are immediately useful for fire hazard management, by providing both estimates of the degree of overall mortality and maps showing its location.

Measurements of photosynthetic rates and stomatal conductance were conducted on groups of diseased and control leaves. Chlorophyll b content increased significantly as the pro-portion of leaf surface infected increased, but no statistically significant change was observed in chlorophyll a content. Rates of leaf photosynthesis were reduced significantly compared to healthy leaves even at low levels of infection (<10%). Reduced photosynthesis may be attributed to decreased stomatal conductance. No changes in spectral reflectance were evident before visual symptoms were observed. The most significant changes in spectral reflectance associated with the disease were a flattening of the response in the visible region and a decrease in the near-infrared reflectance shoulder at 800 nm. Both these responses may be attributed to collapse of leaf cell structure as the fungus spread. Correlations between percentage infection and reflectance in the visible region (peaks at 525 nm and 580 nm) were higher in the first-order derivative spectra than for the original, zero-order reflectance spectra, whereas the red-edge location was poorly correlated with infection. Second-order derivative spectra gave lower correlations with infection.

In this method, the integrated water vapor amount on a pixel by pixel basis is derived from the 0.94-mum and 1.1 4-mum water vapor absorption features. The transmission spectrum Of water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), ozone (O3), nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), and oxygen (O2) in the 0.4-2.5 mum region is simulated based on the derived water vapor value, the solar and the observational geometry, and through use of narrow band spectral models. The scattering effect due to atmospheric molecules and aerosols is modeled with the 5S computer code (Tanre et al., 1986). The AVIRIS radiances are divided by solar irradiances above the atmosphere to obtain the apparent reflectances. The scaled surface reflectances are derived from the apparent reflectances using the simulated atmospheric gaseous transmittances and the simulated molecular and aerosol scattering data. The scaled surface reflectances differ from the real surface reflectances by a multiplicative factor. In order to convert the scaled surface reflectances into real surface reflectances, the slopes and aspects of the surfaces must be known. For simplicity, the scaled surface reflectance is simply referred to as the \'\'surface reflectance\'\' in this article.

This result offers a method to evaluate the grain yield of crops whose grain weight increases during senescence and is therefore affected by the weather and agronomic conditions late in the season.RP SHIBAYAMA, M (通讯作者)，NATL INST AGR ENVIRONM SCI,DEPT ENVIRONM PLANNING,KANNONDAI 3-1-1,TSUKUBA,IBARAKI 305,JAPAN.RI 黄, 建荣 J/B-8070-2011', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 24, 71, 103, 1, 14, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

This study focused on 18 states that accounted for over 95% of the soybean area in the United States from 2013 to 2020. We proposed an SMFs-APTT method that integrates crop data layers (CDLs), time-series of VIIRS data, and meteorological data. It combines a shape-model function in separate meteorological stages (SMFs) with a crop model that relies on an accumulated photothermal time (APTT). This approach provides both full-season and within-season monitoring of four soybean growth stages (SGSs); i.e., emergence, blooming, pod-setting, and leaf-dropping. Based on the results obtained from the SMFsAPTT method, a long short-term memory (LSTM) model was employed to predict SGSs early. The dates of the detected and predicted SGSs were compared with National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Crop Progress and Condition Report (CPR) statistical data for analysis and verification. Our results show the following. (1) For the full-season extraction of SGSs, the average root mean square error (RMSE) derived using the SMFs-APTT method was 0.86-3.06 days and that obtained using the SMFs method was 1.56-3.26 days. (2) For the withinseason monitoring of SGSs, the SMFs-APTT method was also able to accurately track the growth stages as early as -30 days after they reach 50% completion with an average RMSE of 2.1 days. (3) For the early prediction of SGSs, the LSTM model that was trained based on the SMFs-APTT results achieved an RMSE of -4.3 days at the state scale and could approximately predict SGSs -30 days in advance. Our findings suggest that the SMFs-APTT method provides accurate and reliable extraction of SGSs for full-season and within-season monitoring, which is of benefit to crop modeling and management. Furthermore, the LSTM model successfully forecast SGSs, indicating its potential for making early predictions.', '[Lou, Zihang; Peng, Dailiang; Dou, Changyong] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Key Lab Digital Earth Sci, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.

However, separating DCCs from thick anvils with satellite passive measurements is challenging. In this work, a day/night unified tropical DCC detection approach for MODIS observations is developed with a CloudSat active sensor measurement trained machine learning model. This approach combines brightness temperatures (BTs) at 6.7 mu m (BT6.7) and 11 mu m (BT11) with derived variables describing horizontal structures of DCCs and improves the tropical DCC probability of detection (POD) from 45.0% for the widely-used BT11 < 215 K method to 67.9%, while the false alarm ratio (FAR) decreases from 43.9% to 32.6%. The Heidke skill score (HSS) of the new algorithm is 0.425, which is more than doubled compared to the HSS of the BT11 < 215 K method (0.182). Moreover, the new algorithm has small biases in DCC\'s total amount and spatial distribution compared with the CloudSat results. The monthly DCC variations from MODIS wide-swath measurements with the new algorithm demonstrate the ability to reliably provide high temporal and spatial resolution DCC distributions to support intra-seasonal to interannual climate variability studies, which the CloudSat narrow-swath measurements lack enough samples to do. Meanwhile, the new algorithm can also be applied to measurements from other satellite passive sensors when BT6.7 and BT11 are available.', '[Yang, Kang; Wang, Zhien; Dettmann, Brennan] Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.

Thus, developing tools for sensing diseases in a timely fashion is critical for managing threats at broad scales. Oak wilt -a disease caused by a pathogenic fungus (Bretziella fagacearum)- is threatening oaks, killing thousands yearly while negatively impacting the ecosystem services they provide. Here we propose a novel workflow for mapping oak wilt by targeting temporal disease progression through symptoms using land surface phenology (LSP) from spaceborne observations. By doing so, we hypothesize that phenological changes in pigments and photosynthetic activity of trees affected by oak wilt can be tracked using LSP metrics derived from the Chlorophyll/Carotenoid Index (CCI). We used dense time-series observations from Sentinel-2 to create Analysis Ready Data across Minnesota and Wisconsin and to derive three LSP metrics: the value of CCI at the start and end of the growing season, and the coefficient of variation of the CCI during the growing season. We integrate high-resolution airborne imagery in multiple locations to select pixels (n = 3872) from the most common oak tree health conditions: healthy, symptomatic for oak wilt, and dead. These pixels were used to train an iterative Partial Least Square Discriminant (PLSD) model and derive the probability of an oak tree (i.e., pixel) in one of these conditions and the associated uncertainty. We assessed these models spatially and temporally on testing datasets revealing that it is feasible to discriminate among the three health conditions with overall accuracy between 80 and 82%. Within conditions, our models suggest that spatial variations among three CCI-derived LSP metrics can identify healthy (Area Under the Curve (AUC) = 0.98), symptomatic (AUC = 0.89), and dead (AUC = 0.94) oak trees with low false positive rates. The model performance was robust across different years as well. The predictive maps were used to guide local stakeholders to locate disease hotspots for ground verification and subsequent decision-making for treat-ment. Our results highlight the capabilities of LSP metrics from dense spaceborne observations to map diseases and to monitor large-scale change in biodiversity.', '[Guzman, Q. J.

This work introduces a new, model-free analytical environment that assimilates daily TROPOMI NO2 measurements in a mass-conserving manner, to invert daily NOx emissions. This is applied over a rapidly developing and energy-consuming region of Northwest China, specifically chosen due to substantial economic and population changes, new environmental policies, large use of coal, and access to independent emissions measurements for validation, making this region representative of many rapidly developing regions found across the Global South. This technique computes a net NOx emissions gain of 118% distributed in a see-saw manner: a more than doubling of emissions in cleaner regions, chemical plants, and regions thought to be emissions-free, combined with a more than halving of emissions in city centers and at well-regulated steel and powerplants. The results allow attribution of sources, with major contributing factors computed to be increased combustion temperature, atmospheric transport, and in-situ chemical processing. Furthermore, sensitivity runs that represent the range of uncertainties in the TROPOMI NO2 retrievals themselves are performed, and it is determined that the differences between the errors in TROPOMI NO2 lead to smaller errors in the emissions estimates, due to non-linear buffering built in from the physical bounds on the underlying physical and chemical driving factors. It is also observed that errors in the priori dataset contribute more than the uncertainties in the TROPOMI retrievals, opening a new door to recursive iteration between this approach and new emissions dataset development. It is hoped that these findings will drive a new look at emissions estimation and how it is related to remotely sensed measurements and associated uncertainties, especially applied to rapidly developing regions. This is especially important for understanding the loadings and impacts of short-lived climate forcers, and provides a bridge between remotely sensed data, measurement error, and models, while allowing for further improvement of identification of new, small, and rapidly changing sources.', '[Qin, Kai; Lu, Lingxiao; He, Qin; Shi, Jincheng; Cohen, Jason B.] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Environm & Spatial Informat, Jiangsu Key Lab Coal Based Greenhouse Gas Control, Xuzhou, Peoples R China.

Canopy total SIF emissions (SIFtotal) are mechanistically linked to the plant photo-synthesis, and can be estimated from satellite observed SIF (SIFobs) through radiative transfer modeling. How-ever, the current satellite SIFobs and thus SIFtotal are available only at coarse spatial resolutions from several kilometers to tens of kilometers, inhibiting the application at fine spatial scales. Here, we proposed an algorithm to generate both global high-resolution SIFtotal (HSIFtotal) and high-resolution SIFobs (HSIFobs) at 1 km from low-resolution SIFobs (LSIFobs) from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which has a spatial resolution at nadir of 3.5 km by 5.6-7 km. Our statistical method is based on the law of energy conservation and uses satellite derived fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, fluorescence efficiency, and the escape probability of fluorescence. We evaluated the accuracy of our HSIFtotal using the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 SIF (R2 = 0.78). We found that the spatial resolution had clear effects on the relationship between HSIFtotal and GPP. We also compared HSIFtotal to 8-day averaged tower GPP from 135 flux sites and found that they were better correlated when HSIFtotal was averaged over a 1-km radius around the tower than when averaged over a larger radius.

Large area accurate mapping of soybean has long been a vital, but challenging issue in remote sensing, relying heavily on large-volume and representative training samples, whose collection is time-consuming and inefficient, especially for large areas (e.g., national scale). Thus, methods are needed that can map soybean automatically and accurately from single-date remotely sensed imagery. In this research, a novel Greenness and Water Content Composite Index (GWCCI) was proposed to map soybean from just a single Sentinel-2 multispectral image in an end-to-end manner without employing training samples. By capitalizing on the product of the NDVI (related to greenness) and the short-wave infrared (SWIR) band (related to canopy water content), the GWCCI provides the required information with which to discriminate between soybean and other land cover types. The effectiveness of the proposed GWCCI was investigated in seven typical soybean planting regions within four major soybean-producing countries across the world (i.e., China, the United States, Brazil and Argentina), with diverse climates, cropping systems and agricultural landscapes. In the experiments, an optimal threshold of 0.17 was estimated and adopted by the GWCCI in the first study site (S1) in 2021, and then generalised to the other study sites over multiple years for soybean mapping. The GWCCI method achieved a consistently higher accuracy in 2021 compared to two conventional comparative classifiers (support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)), with an average overall accuracy (OA) of 88.30% and a Kappa coefficient (k) of 0.77; significantly greater than those of RF (OA: 80.92%, k: 0.62) and SVM (OA: 80.29%, k: 0.60). Furthermore, the OA of the extended years was highly consistent with that of 2021 for study sites S2 to S7, demonstrating the great generalisation capability and robustness of the proposed approach over multiple years. The proposed GWCCI method is straightforward, reliable and robust, and represents an important step forward for mapping soybean, one of the most significant crops grown globally.', '[Chen, Hui; Li, Huapeng; Liu, Zhao; Zhang, Shuqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China.

Existing approaches for obtaining the penetration depth require good quality interferometric SAR (InSAR) data of very short temporal and long spatial baselines. Such data are often difficult to obtain in a highly dynamic desert. We propose a new machine learning (ML) based approach for inverting penetration depth of SAR signals over large desert areas by jointly using InSAR, polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) and optical remote sensing data. First, SAR scattering parameters and terrain properties are determined based on PolSAR and Landsat 5 TM multispectral data and a DEM. The penetration depth of SAR signals over a small desert area is obtained based on methods such as using a scattering model. A random forest model is then used to establish the relationship between the SAR scattering parameters and site features, and the penetration depth, and then is used to derive the penetration depth over a large desert area. The approach is applied to calculate the penetration depth of ALOS-1 PALSAR L-band signals for a large part of the Kufra Basin, an area of about 60, 000 km2. The penetration depths of four types of typical landforms in area (i.e., sandy plains, paleochannels, rocks and man-made features) are discussed in relation to the geological and climatic conditions. The average signal penetration depths over the paleochannels, sandy plains, and rocks and man-made features are 2.84 m, 1.97 m, 1.21 m, respectively. It is found that the backscattering coefficient, dielectric constant, surface roughness and mineral composition are the most important parameters in determining the signal penetration depths. An interesting point is that the existence of hematite in the sand can increase the dielectric dissipation of the sand medium and shorten the signal penetration depth.', '[Zhu, Jun] Changsha Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Traff & Transportat Engn, Dept Surveying Engn, Changsha, Peoples R China.

Due to the rela-tively short path lengths, the near-surface atmosphere contribution is generally ignored in radiation-based in-situ LST measuring for narrowband radiometers. However, it is necessary to investigate the influence for broadband radiometers. In this study, nine stations in China are selected to quantify the atmospheric influence. Furthermore, a correction method combining the Radiative Transfer Equation and Multi-Layer Meteorological Parameters (RTE-MLMP) is proposed to correct the influence on radiation-based in-situ LST. Results show that the influence follows diurnal patterns and seasonal differences. Depending on the station, ignoring the near-surface atmo-sphere influence can cause in-situ LST to be overestimated (underestimated) by up to 3.11 (1.21) K at nighttime (daytime). For the RTE-MLMP method, the key is to estimate the near-surface atmospheric transmittance (TNS) and radiance (LNS) and to establish equations for each station. Results show that the mean and standard deviation (STD) of the error are both lower than 0.001 for the estimated TNS, and lower than 0.1 W/m2 and 0.6 W/m2 for the estimated LNS, respectively. Then, the in-situ LST is corrected with the estimated TNS and LNS. The resulting LST mean and STD of its error are both lower than 0.1 K, which is significantly lower than ignoring the near -surface atmospheric influence. Our further analysis suggests that single-layer meteorological parameters can only be used when the installation height difference between the meteorological sensor and the long-wave radiometer is within 3 m. Since the correction method relies on readily available meteorological data, further research should focus on the generalizable coefficients or strategy for atmospheric correction to enhance the accuracy of radiation-based in-situ measured LST.', '[Ma, Jin; Zhou, Ji; Wang, Ziwei; Tang, Wenbin] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Resources & Environm, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China.

Cloud-aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) is an effective tool to detect sea fog, however it is ineffective for dense fog detection because the lidar signal has been fully attenuated before reaching the layer base. To address this issue by improving dense fog detection, a reanalysis-aided sea fog detection method using CALIOP lidar measurements and MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset is proposed taking the Northwestern Pacific (NP) as study area. In this method, CALIOP lidar measurements are used to locate the ceiling and base of the hydrometeor layers, and extract the candidate fog layers in the Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL). Reanalysis dataset are used to identify real fog from the candidate fog layers based on the near-surface meteorological difference under different weather conditions (sea fog, stratus and stratus precipitation). Method validation using in-situ weather records from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) and five climate stations, shows the detection accuracy and false alarm rate of 89.4% and 2.0%, respectively. Most importantly, about 87.4% of dense fogs are successfully discriminated with the aid of reanalysis data. Model application to CALIOP data from 2007 to 2019 shows pronounced spatial and seasonal characteristics of sea fog distribution over NP, with the highest frequency (>40%) found over the Kuril Islands, Sea of Okhotsk and Bering Sea from June to August. The example demonstrates that by using time series CALIOP observations and the proposed method, one may expect spatiotemporally complete sea fog information, which is important especially for remote regions with scarce in-situ measurements (e.g. polar regions). Our research proposes and proves a novel idea of sea fog detection from space by using satellite lidar and reanalysis data, which may benefit the sea fog forecasting and dynamics analysis, by providing unprecedented large-scale high-quality observations, especially over dense fog conditions.', '[Xiao, Yanfang; Liu, Rongjie; Ma, Yi] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 1, Qingdao, Peoples R China.

Planting date records are essential for yield gap analyses, accurate crop modeling, and tracking farmer adaptations to weather and climate change. Although planting dates have high variation at local scales due to heterogeneity in farm resources and decision-making, available long-term data on planting dates are largely restricted to aggregated regional statistics or, at best, satellite-derived datasets with limited spatiotemporal extent and at resolutions unable to distinguish individual fields. Here, we generated retrospective annual field-scale (30 m) planting date maps for both maize and soy-beans spanning 2000-2020 across a 12-state region in the United States Corn Belt based on Landsat satellite data and a large ground sample of over 28,000 maize and soybean fields. Using training data from 2015 to 2020 for model selection, we found that planting date predictions improved with harmonic regression of Landsat data and additional annual weather covariates. The preferred random forest model approximately doubled performance compared to a null model based on state median planting dates, capturing 47% of field-level variation for maize (mean absolute error, MAE = 7.4 days) and 44% for soybeans (MAE = 7.5 days) against held-out ground truth test data for 2008-2014. We also evaluated the full 2000-2020 dataset with state agricultural statistics, finding strong agreement with median planting dates for maize (R-2 = 0.76, MAE = 4.4 days) and slightly lower agreement for soybeans (R-2 = 0.65, MAE = 5.4 days) when aggregated to the state level. We then used this new dataset to analyze environmental determinants of planting dates at a finer-scale than previously possible, con-trolling for unobserved variation at the sub-state district level. We found that during 2000-2020, each standard deviation increase in early-season rainfall delayed planting by similar to 2.5 days, and fields with higher soil productivity ratings tended to be planted earlier. We did not find meaningful trends over the last two decades in planting dates for maize or soybeans, in contrast to trends towards earlier planting dates late last century and predicted for this period in climate adaptation studies. We hypothesize increases in early season rainfall or persisting early -season frost risks may have inhibited these shifts towards earlier planting. Remotely sensed planting dates will be a useful tool for yield gap analyses, crop simulation modeling, and ongoing assessment of climate adaptation.', '[Deines, Jillian M.; Lobell, David B.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Food Secur & Environm, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA USA.

Tree and stand age are typically measured directly on site, or estimated through visual photo interpretation, with spatially explicit maps of forest age not often produced over large areas. Remote sensing enables the generation of wall-to wall, spatially explicit maps of disturbance events within the satellite record; however, as disturbance is relatively rare on the landscape in a given year, additional means of determining forest age are required. As reviewed herein, the estimation of forest age using optical Earth observation data is challenging due to the limited spectral link to the attribute of interest, especially as forests get older. The temporally dictated multi-method approach to forest age estimation outlined herein acknowledges these limitations, by applying the approach that is best suited to the quality of the infor-mation available, depending on the epoch of interest. In this research, we combine three approaches to estimate forest age at a 30-m spatial resolution using Landsat data. The first approach uses change detection protocols to detect disturbance from 1985 to 2019, with time since disturbance used as a proxy for forest age. The second approach uses Landsat surface reflectance composites to identify pixels exhibiting evidence of recovery from a disturbance that occurred within the twenty years prior to 1985, allowing for the extension of forest age esti-mates to 1965. Finally, given an understanding of the linkage between forest age and canopy height, inverted allometric equations are coupled with maps of forest structure and productivity metrics to model forest age for those pixels that show no evidence of disturbance or recovery to a maximum of 150 years, acknowledging that uncertainty in age estimate increases with increasing age. Combining these three approaches, forest age esti-mates are made for every treed pixel found within the 650 Mha forested ecosystems of Canada. Nationwide, mean estimated forest age for forests <= 150 years old (representing 94.1% of treed area) was 70 years (standard deviation = 32.1 years). For confidence building, forest age estimates were compared to reported forest age in the National Forest Inventory (NFI) both spatially and aspatially. Nationally, 5.9% of the forested area was estimated to be older than 150 years, while 9.5% of area within in the NFI sample was recorded as older than 150 years. The median estimated forest age for forested pixels <= 150 years old was 68 years while median forest age reported in the NFI was 73 years, with regional variability matching expectations related to disturbance regimes and productivity. Spatially explicit maps of forest age provide important information for understanding forest ecosystems and can be used to inform a wide range of policy, science, and management needs.', '[Maltman, James C.; Coops, Nicholas C.] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Resources Management, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC 614, Canada.

Field measurements of Vcmax are very limited, so fixed Vcmax values over growing seasons are often used, causing considerable uncertainties in modelled results. Also, the lack of a global Vcmax dataset with seasonal variations limits our understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of Vcmax, and hence photosynthesis. This study proposes a refined data assimilation scheme to retrieve daily Vcmax using remotely sensed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) data. Using the refined method, we produced a global Vcmax dataset with daily 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees resolutions. The seasonal variations in Vcmax have been successfully retrieved. Vcmax retrieved in this study was compared with field-measured Vcmax from past literature. Good agreements were achieved in relation to Vcmax measured at 201 sites (R2 is 0.78, and relative RMSE is 34%) and the seasonal variation in Vcmax measured at 9 sites (R2 ranges from 0.57 to 0.99, and the relative RMSE ranged from 6% to 28%). Our method effectively utilizes the information from both SIF and LCC, showing advantages over previous approaches that estimate Vcmax based solely on using SIF or LCC. Our results suggest that the spatial distribution of Vcmax depends on the spatial distribution of biomes, along with air temperature and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR). Higher seasonal mean air temperature and APAR tend to lead to higher seasonal mean Vcmax. The seasonal variation in Vcmax is driven by the seasonal variations in air temperature and APAR, rather than their seasonal means. We also derived and analyzed Vcmax25, which is Vcmax normalized to 25 degrees C (Vcmax25) and has been found to be more closely related to the Rubisco content. Vcmax25 also has considerable spatiotemporal variations, and the variations differ to that in Vcmax. Different biomes have different ratios of Vcmax25 to LCC. Air temperature and APAR exert weak but positive effects on the seasonal variation in Vcmax25. Vcmax retrieved in this study enhances our understanding of the spatiotemporal pattern of leaf photosynthetic capacity on the global scale and is potentially useful to terrestrial carbon cycle modelling.', '[Liu, Yihong; Chen, Jing M.; Rogers, Cheryl; Li, Wenyu; Leng, Jiye] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Planning, Toronto, ON, Canada.

In order to study the performance of the state-of-the-art methods in an integrated way, a voluntary and open-access benchmark Atmospheric Correction Inter-comparison eXercise (ACIX) was initiated in 2016 in the frame of Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Calibration & Validation (WGCV). The first exercise was extended in a second edition wherein twelve at-mospheric correction (AC) processors, a substantially larger testing dataset and additional validation metrics were involved. The sites for the inter-comparison analysis were defined by investigating the full catalogue of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites for coincident measurements with satellites\' overpass. Although there were more than one hundred sites for Copernicus Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 acquisitions, the analysis presented in this paper concerns only the common matchups amongst all processors, reducing the number to 79 and 62 sites respectively. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Water Vapour (WV) retrievals were consequently validated based on the available AERONET observations. The processors mostly succeeded in retrieving AOD for relatively light to medium aerosol loading (AOD < 0.2) with uncertainties <0.08, while the overall uncertainty values were typically 0.23 +/- 0.15. Better performances were observed for WV retrievals with >90% of the results falling within the suggested empirical specifications and with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) being mostly <0.25 g/cm2. Regarding Surface Reflectance (SR) validation two main approaches were followed. For the first one, a simulated SR reference dataset was computed over all of the test sites by using the 6SV (Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum vector code) full radiative transfer modelling (RTM) and AERONET measurements for the required aerosol variables and water vapour content. The performance assessment demonstrated that the retrievals were not biased for most of the bands. The uncertainties ranged from approximately 0.003 to 0.01 (excluding B01) for the best performing processors in both sensors\' analyses. For the second one, measurements from the radiometric calibration network RadCalNet over La Crau (France) and Gobabeb (Namibia) were involved in the validation. The performance of the processors was in general consistent across all bands for both sensors and with low standard deviations (<0.04) between on-site and estimated surface reflectance. Overall, our study provides a good insight of AC algorithms\' performance to developers and users, pointing out similarities and differences for AOD, WV and SR retrievals. Such validation though still lacks of ground-based measurements of known uncertainty to better assess and characterize the uncertainties in SR retrievals.', '[Doxani, Georgia] SERCO SpA, European Space Res Inst ESRIN, European Space Agcy ESA, I-00044 Frascati, Italy.

This index has a strong penetrability within the vegetation canopy and is less impacted by atmosphere aerosol contamination effects, clouds and sun illumination than optical vegetation indices. VOD is thus increasingly applied in ecological applications, e.g., carbon stock, phenology and vegetation monitoring. However, VOD retrieval over dense forests is subject to uncertainties caused by the thick canopy and complex multiple scattering effects. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of VOD products over dense forests is needed for effective and accurate applications. This study evaluated the seasonal variations of eight recently developed/reprocessed VOD products at different frequencies (e.g., Ku-, X-, C-and L-band) over Amazon intact forests, supported by the ORCHIDEE-CAN-NHA model-simulated vegetation water content. Furthermore, we also explored the potential causes of VOD retrieval issues, in terms of retrieval algorithm uncertainties. We first confirmed that soil water availability dominated seasonal dynamics of vegetation water content over Amazon intact forests. This was verified by model-simulated vegetation water content and by C-band radar backscatter observations. Generally, evening or midday vegetation water content shows higher correlations with soil moisture than morning or midnight vegetation water content. In terms of ability of morning or midnight VOD products to follow the seasonality of soil moisture, active microwave ASCAT-IB C-VOD (median seasonal cor-relation with soil moisture (R) -0.50) outperforms the passive microwave VOD products, followed by passive microwave AMSR2 X-VOD (R -0.26) and VODCA X-VOD (R -0.16). However, SMOS-IC L-VOD (R --0.15)and AMSR2 C1-VOD (R --0.20)show obviously negative seasonal correlations with soil moisture across most pixels. This implausible behavior is likely to be caused by the inappropriate setting of time-invariant scattering effects in the passive microwave VOD retrieval algorithms, which could lead to an overestimation of the VOD amplitude during dry seasons. Thus, we recommend that the seasonal scattering effects be considered in the passive microwave VOD retrieval algorithms. These findings can contribute to the improvement of VOD retrieval algorithms and help with the development of their ecological applications over Amazon dense forests.', '[Wang, Huan; Tao, Shengli; Li, Shuangcheng] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Minist Educ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.

However, little is known about their distributions and particularly about their long-term changes. Here, using a deep learning (DL) model, we objectively delineate and quantify whiting features from Aqua MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite images (250-m resolution) and establish an 18-year data record (2003-2020) of whiting occurrences in the Bahama Banks. Both the Great Bahama Bank (GBB) and the Little Bahama Bank (LBB) show clear seasonality in whiting areas, where a primary peak in spring and a secondary peak in winter are found in the GBB but only one peak in winter is found in the LBB. Such a seasonality may be explained using a hydrodynamic hypothesis on calcium carbonate precipitation. The mean size of individual whiting patches in the GBB is about 2.4 +/- 6.1 km2 (-0.1 to 226 km2), while in the LBB is 1.4 +/- 2.7 km2 (-0.1 to 95 km2). The total whiting coverage in a typical cloud-free image is 87.1 km2 in the GBB and 32.0 km2 in the LBB, representing 0.14% and 0.76% of the entire GBB and LBB, respectively. Significant increases in the mean coverage have been found in the GBB since 2011, with peak coverage (-200 km2) in 2013-2015 being at least 4 times higher than before (20-70 km2). Although the whiting area started to decrease after 2015, it did not reach the pre-2011 level until 2020. On the other hand, correlation analysis and principal component analysis of several environmental factors (pH, light, salinity, carbonate, aragonite, winds, currents) provided some hints on which factors may have contributed. From these, we infer a potential \'Goldilocks\' scenario, whereby decreases in pH and carbonate concentration, concomitant with increases in Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and current speeds, created conditions increasingly favorable for whitings from 2011 to 2015. Continuation of these environmental trends after 2015, however, resulted in conditions increasingly unfavorable for whiting formation, yet without field-based measurements it is difficult to conclude the potential reasons for increases and decreases of whiting formation in the GBB.', '[Yao, Yao; Hu, Chuanmin; Barnes, Brian B.] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, 140 Seventh Ave South, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.', 'State University System of Florida; University of South FloridaRP Hu, CM (通讯作者)，Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, 140 Seventh Ave South, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.', 'huc@usf.edu', 'Barnes, Brian/0000-0003-0056-3500', 'U.S. NASA [80NSSC20M0264, 80NSSC21K0422]; University of South Florida', 'This work was supported by the U.S. NASA (80NSSC20M0264, 80NSSC21K0422)   and by a student fellowship offered by the University of South Florida.

Recently, we generated the ECOSTRESS LST product over Europe and Africa using both the temperature and emissivity separation (TES) and split-window (SW) algorithms under the European ECOSTRESS Hub (EEH). Here, we validated the official Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) TES (Collection 1), EEH TES and EEH SW ECOSTRESS LST products over Europe and Africa between August 1, 2018 and December 31, 2021 by comparing against the in-situ measurements at 9 sites over a wide variety of land cover types. Meanwhile, the validation results were compared with those obtained for ASTER and Landsat LST at the same sites for a thorough understanding of the consistency among these high spatial resolution LST products. The results reveal that the three ECOSTRESS LST products have consistent performances, with an overall RMSE around 2 K. A cold bias around 1 K exists for all three ECOSTRESS LST, which is presumably originated from the radiometric calibration of the sensor in Collection 1 data. The Landsat LST shows a similar accuracy, with an RMSE of 2.20 K and bias of 0.54 K. The EEHSW LST show the highest consistency with Landsat LST, possibly due to the identical emissivity correction process. The performance of ASTER LST is also similar, with an RMSE of 1.98 K and bias of 0.9 K. The precisions of all the LST products are around 1.5 K. Future recalibration of the ECOSTRESS Level 1 radiance data in Collection 2 is expected to further improve the accuracy of ECOSTRESS LST.

We demonstrate that, even when the solar contribution is large, with brightness temperatures increased by several tens of kelvin at the shortest wavelengths, very consistent SSTs are retrieved in both windows. Furthermore, the values obtained are, after correction for the cool-skin effect, in excellent agreement (<0.05 K on average) with the in-situ measurements of the depth temperature provided by nearby drifters. This opens renewed perspectives for daytime SST determinations from space, since the IASI mid-infrared windows used here provide SSTs that are, with respect to those retrieved around 9 and 11 mu m, much less sensitive to errors in the computed radiative contribution of water vapor.', '[Capelle, V; Hartmann, J-M] Sorbonne Univ, PSL Res Univ, Inst Polytech Paris, Lab Meteorol Dynam IPSL,CNRS,Ecole Polytech,Ecole, F-91120 Palaiseau, France.', 'UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Centre National de   la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Sorbonne UniversiteRP Capelle, V (通讯作者)，Sorbonne Univ, PSL Res Univ, Inst Polytech Paris, Lab Meteorol Dynam IPSL,CNRS,Ecole Polytech,Ecole, F-91120 Palaiseau, France.', 'virginie.capelle@lmd.ipsl.fr', NULL, 'CNRS; CNES; Ecole polytechnique', 'This work has been supported in part by CNRS, CNES and Ecole   polytechnique.

However, most approaches to date focus on site-specific applications and a small number of taxonomic groups. Little is known about how well these approaches generalize across broader geographic areas and ecosystems. Leveraging field surveys and hyperspectral remote sensing data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), we developed a continental-extent model for tree species classification that can be applied to the network, including a wide range of US terrestrial ecosystems. We compared the performance of a model trained with data from 27 NEON sites to models trained with data from each individual site, evaluating advantages and challenges posed by training species classifiers at the US scale. We evaluated the effect of geographic location, topography, and ecological conditions on the accuracy and precision of species predictions (72 out of 77 species).On average, the general model resulted in good overall classification accuracy (micro-F1 score), with better accuracy than site-specific classifiers (average individual tree level accuracy of 0.77 for the general model and 0.70 for site-specific models). Aggregating species to the genus-level increased accuracy to 0.83. Regions with more species exhibited lower classification accuracy. Predicted species were more likely to be confused with congeneric and co-occurring species and confusion was highest for trees with structural damage and in complex closed-canopy forests. The model produced accurate estimates of uncertainty, correctly identifying trees where confusion was likely. Using only data from NEON, this single integrated classifier can make predictions for 20% of all tree species found in forest ecosystems across the entire US, which make up to roughly 90% of the upper canopy of the studied ecosystems. This suggests the potential for integrating information from multiple datasets and locations to develop broad scale general models for species classification from hyperspectral imaging.', '[Marconi, Sergio; Weinstein, Ben G.; Steinkraus, Ashley; White, Ethan P.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32603 USA.

Thus, clarifying how primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems responds to climatic variability can reveal key mechanisms that will drive future changes in the global carbon budget. Satellite products of canopy greenness are widely used as proxies for vegetation productivity to evaluate how ecosystems respond to climate variability. However, to what degree inter-annual variations in productivity are consistent with greenness and how this relationship varies spatially remains unclear. Here we investigated the strength of the coupling between inter-annual variations in leaf area index (LAI, a measure of greenness) and ecosystem gross primary productivity (GPP) derived from eddy covariance towers, i.e., the r(2) of the LAI-GPP relationship. Overall, inter-annual GPP and LAI were highly coupled (i.e., high r(2)) in arid grasslands, but were fully decoupled in mesic evergreen broadleaf forests, indicating that this relationship varies strongly along aridity gradients. A possible mechanism of the spatial variation in the LAI-GPP relationship is that the tradeoff between ecosystem structure (LAI) and physiology (photosynthesis per unit leaf area) becomes stronger in more humid climates. Land models overestimated the r(2) of LAI-GPP correlation for most ecosystem types and failed to capture the spatial pattern along aridity gradients. We conclude that relying on greenness products for evaluating inter-annual changes in vegetation productivity may bias assessments, especially in tropical rainforest ecosystems. Our findings may also reconcile observed disparities between responses in greenness and GPP during drought in Amazon forests.', '[Hu, Zhongmin] South China Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Shipai Campus, Guangzhou 510631, Peoples R China.

Significant efforts have been exerted to correct for the clumping effect and derive the true LAI. Recent research has shown that the fractal dimension (FD) is directly related to the clumping effect of foliage, yet practical methods are needed to calculate field estimates. Considering that widely used LAI applications such as digital hemispherical photography (DHP), tracing radiation and architecture of canopies (TRAC), and digital cover photography (DCP) estimate LAI with one-dimensional (1D) gap probability and gap size data, we propose a method to correct for the clumping effect using 1D FD. Resulting formulae describing the relationship between LAI, CI, and 1D FD were based on the box-counting method (BCM) and a binomial distribution model. Sixty-four simulated scenes including four RAdiation transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI) actual canopies and field measurements from nine plots (four orchard plots and five coniferous forest plots) were used to validate the novel method. Results showed good agreement with reference LAI values for simulated scenes (R2 = 0.96 and RMSE = 0.35). The 1DFD method generated higher LAI estimates compared with the LAI measured using TRAC at the four orchard plots especially at high canopy closure, while its results were more consistent with LAI obtained by litter collection than those of comparable methods at coniferous forest plots (bias from-13.5% to 9.9% for DCP images, from-3.0% to 19.7% for DHP images, and from-3.8% to 17.0% for TRAC transects). Our validation efforts indicate that the method proposed herein corrects for the clumping effect of vegetated canopies more effectively with DCP images, DHP images, and TRAC measurement when compared with traditional indirect optical methods. The 1DFD method is expected to improve indirect measurement accuracy of LAI.', '[Lai, Yongkang; Mu, Xihan; Li, Weihua; Bian, Yuequn; Zhou, Kun; Xie, Donghui; Yan, Guangjian] Beijing Normal Univ, Inst Remote Sensing Sci & Engn, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

Increasing observation information is an effective means to make retrievals more robust. In this study, a multi-temporal and multi-angular (MTMA) approach is proposed using SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) satellite L-band data for retrieving vegetation optical depth (VODp, p indicates the polarization with H for horizontal and V for ver-tical)), effective scattering albedo (omega(eff)(p)), soil surface roughness (Z(p)(s)), and soil moisture (SMp). The advantage of the MTMA approach is that it does not need auxiliary data as inputs or constraints. SMOS polarization-dependent VOD are produced and compared at a global scale for the first time, and it is found that the polarization dif-ference of vegetation effects should not be ignored in the SM retrieval algorithm. The MTMA VOD retrievals are found to have a reasonable global spatial distribution, which is generally consistent with the VOD retrievals obtained from the SMOS Level 3 (SMOS-L3) and SMOS-IC Version 2 (V2) (referred to as SMOS-IC), except for showing relatively lower values over densely vegetated areas compared with the other two SMOS products. The spatial distribution of retrieved omega(eff)(p) generally shows a dependence on both VOD and land cover types. In addition, the values of MTMA-omega(eff)(V) are higher than that of MTMA-omega(eff)(H), indicating stronger microwave scattering of V-pol in the vegetation layer than that of H-pol. The retrieved surface roughness parameter (Z(p)(s)) ranges from 0.04 to 0.22 cm, and its spatial distribution is partially different from the existing roughness products/auxiliary data from SMOS and SMAP. The retrieved MTMA SM shows generally high correlations with in-situ measurements (11 dense observation networks) with overall correlation coefficients of > 0.75. The overall ubRMSE of MTMA-SMH and MTMA-SMV are < 0.055 m(3)/m(3) and lower than that of SMOS-IC and SMOS-L3 products. SMOS-IC generally presents higher correlation coefficients compared to MTMA in most sites outside China; in China, RFI filtering is crucial and makes it very difficult when comparing algorithms based on different brightness temperature products. The number of effective retrievals of MTMA-SMH and MTMA-SMV ranges from 1409 to 1640 and 1104 to 1603 respectively, which is more than that from SMOS-IC (from 236 to 1358) over the selected 11 networks. Therefore, it is concluded that by incorporating multi-temporal SMOS data, the proposed method of MTMA can be used to systematically retrieve SM, VOD and additional surface parameters (effective scattering albedo and surface roughness) with comparable or better performance of SM than that of SMOS-IC and SMOS-L3.

In this paper, we propose methods to analyse sources of errors of global BA products, which are applied to assess a widely used product, (FireCCI51), created under the ESA climate change initiative programme. The effect of several variables related to product accuracy are quantified by comparing the FireCCI51 BA product with a large global reference BA dataset for the years 2017-2019. These reference data were obtained from multitemporal analysis of Landsat-8 data. Error maps (commission and omission error layers) were generated for a sample of 316 units (100 km x 100 km) and as-sociations between errors and potential explanatory sources of error were spatially analysed to provide a comprehensive error assessment of the FireCCI51 product. Active fire density, burned severity, burned patch size and land cover class were selected as explanatory variables for omission and commission errors. The results indicated that the largest contribution to the commission errors (70-80%) was related to the pixel size, partic-ularly when pixels are only partially burned. Active fire densities were also associated to error distribution, with higher densities from products derived from the VIIRS sensors versus those generated from MODIS, indicating the potential benefit of the former as an alternative source in upcoming BA algorithms. Burn severity was also associated with error distribution, but this relation varied substantially across biomes. Land cover was also related to errors, with lowest accuracies for croplands with omission error percentages > 85%. Fire size and, to a lesser extent, the shape of burned areas also played a crucial role in determining the accuracy of the BA products. BA accuracy increased for larger and more compact burned patches. Although our results suggest that further improvement of global BA products is possible, they also indicate that the ability of coarse spatial resolution BA sensors to meet the accuracy recommendations of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) programme is limited.', '[Franquesa, Magi; Chuvieco, Emilio] Univ Alcala, Dept Geol Geog & Environm, Environm Remote Sensing Res Grp, Calle Colegios 2, Alcala De Henares 28801, Spain.

Changes in biomass of mat-forming pale lichens have the potential to affect vegetation, fauna, climate and human activities including reindeer husbandry. Lichens have a complex spectral signature and terricolous lichens have limited growth height, often growing in mixtures with taller vegetation. This has, so far, prevented the development of remote sensing techniques to accurately assess lichen biomass, which would be a powerful tool in ecosystem and ecological research and rangeland management. We present a Landsat based remote sensing model developed using deep neural networks, trained with 8914 field records of lichen volume collected for > 20 years. In contrast to earlier proposed machine learning and regression methods for lichens, our model exploited the ability of neural networks to handle mixed spatial resolution input. We trained candidate models using input of 1 x 1 (30 x 30 m) and 3 x 3 Landsat pixels based on 7 reflective bands and 3 indices, combined with a 10 m spatial resolution digital elevation model. We normalised elevation data locally for each plot to remove the region-specific variation, while maintaining informative local variation in topography. The final model predicted lichen volume in an evaluation set (n = 159) reaching an R2 of 0.57. NDVI and elevation were the most important predictors, followed by the green band. Even with moderate tree cover density, the model was efficient, offering a considerable improvement compared to earlier methods based on specific reflectance. The model was in principle trained on data from Scandinavia, but when applied to sites in North America and Russia, the predictions of the model corresponded well with our visual interpretations of lichen abundance. We also accurately quantified a recent historic (35 years) change in lichen abundance in northern Norway. This new method enables further spatial and temporal studies of variation and changes in lichen biomass related to multiple research questions as well as rangeland management and economic and cultural ecosystem services. Combined with information on changes in drivers such as climate, land use and management, and air pollution, our model can be used to provide accurate estimates of ecosystem changes and to improve vegetation-climate models by including pale lichens.', '[Erlandsson, Rasmus; Bjerke, Jarle W.; Finne, Eirik A.; Tommervik, Hans] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, FRAM High North Res Ctr Climate & Environm, NO-9296 Tromso, Norway.

Despite considerable progress, accurate estimates of daily ocean productivity from space have not been realized because polar-orbiting satellites are unable to account for variations in phyto-plankton physiology and carbon fixation rates from changing incident irradiance levels over the course of the day. Here we have attempted to exploit the unique short-temporal measurements provided by the Korean Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), to obtain for the first time, diurnal and daily measurements of sur- face-and euphotic-column integrated Net Primary Productivity (NPP). These estimates are based on the Ab-sorption Based Productivity Model (AbPM), and are calibrated with a bio-optical database of measurements made at different times of the day during the Korea-US Ocean Color (KORUS-OC) cruise in May-June 2016. Photo-physiological rate estimates, varied across different water types encountered around the Korean Peninsula, but on account of their limited number, were regionally scaled through the use of dynamic optical-biogeochemical (O-BGC) Biomes. Comparisons of GOCI derived estimates of daily and weekly integrated NPP against in-situ measurements, clearly underscore the superiority of geostationary over polar-orbiting ocean color satellites, which consider the strong short-term fluctuations in phytoplankton light absorption and incident irradiance fields over the course of the day.', '[Wu, Jinghui; Goes, Joaquim I.; Gomes, Helga do Rosario] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, New York, NY 10027 USA.

Although large-scale forest recovery capacity metrics have been derived from optical satellite image time series and validated over various ecosystems, their sensitivity to disturbance (e.g. disturbance magnitude, disturbance timing, and recovery time) and environmental data characteristics (e.g. noise magnitude, seasonality, and missing values) are largely unknown. This study proposes an open source simulation framework based on the characteristics of sampled original satellite image time series to (i) compare the reliability of recovery metrics, (ii) evaluate their sensitivity with respect to environmental and disturbance characteristics, and (iii) evaluate the effect of pre-processing techniques on the reliability of the recovery metrics for abrupt disturbances, such as fires, in the Amazon basin forests. The effect of three pre-processing techniques were evaluated: changing the temporal resolution, noise removal techniques (such as time series smoothing and segmenting), and using a varying time span after the disturbance to calculate recovery metrics. Here, reliability is quantified by comparing derived and theoretical values of the recovery metrics (RMSE and R-2). From the three recovery metrics evaluated, the Year on Year Average (YrYr) and the Ratio of Eighty Percent (R80p) are more reliable than the Relative Recovery Index (RRI). Time series segmentation tends to improve the reliability of recovery metrics. Recovery metrics derived from temporal dense Landsat time series tend to show a higher reliability than those derived from time series aggregated to quarterly or annual values. Although the framework is demonstrated on Landsat time series of the Amazon tropical forest, it can be used to perform such test on other datasets and ecosystems.', '[De Keersmaecker, Wanda; Milencovic, Milutin; Herold, Martin; Reiche, Johannes; Verbesselt, Jan] Wageningen Univ, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, Wageningen, Netherlands.

Beyond, patterns of urban morphology were discovered from the global classification map, confirming a morphologic relationship to the geographical region and related cultural heritage.

Since 2014, the spaceborne C-band SAR instruments of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 (S1) mission routinely acquire microwave Doppler data, distributed to users through operational S1 Level-2 ocean radial velocity (L2 OCN RVL) products. S1 L2 RVL data could produce high-resolution maps of ocean surface currents that would benefit ocean observing and modelling, particularly in coastal regions. However, uncorrected platform effects and instrument anomalies continue to impact S1 RVL data and prevent direct exploitation.   In this paper, a simple empirical method is proposed to calibrate and correct operational S1 L2 RVL products and retrieve two-dimensional maps of surface currents in the radar line-of-sight. The study focuses on the German Bight where wind, wave and current data from marine stations and an HF radar instrumented site provide comprehensive means to evaluate S1 retrieved currents. Analyses are deliberately limited to Sentinel-1A (S1A) ascending passes to focus on one single instrument and fixed SAR viewing geometry. The final dataset comprises 78 separate S1A acquisitions over 2.5 years, of which 56 are matched with collocated HF radar data. The empirical corrections bring significant improvements to S1A RVL data, producing higher quality estimates and much better agreement with HF radar radial currents.   Comparative evaluation of S1A against HF radar currents for different WASV corrections reveal that best results are obtained in this region when computing the WASV with sea state rather than wind vector input. Accounting for sea state produces S1 radial currents with a precision (std of the difference) around 0.3 m/s at similar to 1 km resolution. Precision improves to similar to 0.24 m/s when averaging over 21 x 27 km(2), with correlations with HF radar data reaching up to 0.93. Evidence of wind-current interactions when tides and wind align and short fetch conditions call for further research with more satellite data and other sites to better understand and correct the WASV in coastal regions.   Finally, 1 km resolution maps of climatological S1A radial currents obtained over 2.5 years reveal strong coastal jets and fine scale details of the coastal circulation that closely match the known bathymetry and deep-water coastal channels in this region. The wealth of oceanographic information in corrected S1 RVL data is encouraging for Doppler oceanography from space and its application to observing small scale ocean dynamics, atmosphere and ocean vertical exchanges and marine ecosystem response to environmental change.', '[Martin, Adrien C.

Old-growth forests are still often seen as a homogeneous whole and few remote-sensing approaches have been tested to identify their structural diversity, especially in boreal forests. The aim of this study is to use a combination of airborne LiDAR and satellite imagery to identify and discriminate old-growth forest structures resulting from different disturbance histories. The study area, which was located in the mixed boreal forest of Quebec (Canada), is Monts Valin National Park and adjacent managed territories. Balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill) is the dominant species in the study area, but hardwood species such as white birch (Betula pcupyrifera Marsh.) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) can also be abundant in the early succession stages. Four forest classes were studied: second-growth (logged between 1970 and 1980); transition old-growth (burned in 1920); undisturbed old-growth (unburned for at least 125 years); and disturbed old-growth forest (unburned for at least 125 years, but severely disturbed by an insect outbreak around 1980). A multivariate Random Forest model was used to discriminate the classes on 6466 1 ha tiles, based on 11 complementary LiDAR and satellite-derived indices describing stand vertical and horizontal structure, together with \"greenness\" and disturbance history over the last 30 years. This model had high predictive efficiency (AUC = 94.2), with 81.8% of the tiles accurately classified. Interestingly, undisturbed old-growth forests exhibited intermediate characteristics compared to transition and disturbed old-growth forests. This emphasizes that some structural attributes recognized as important for the classification of temperate and tropical old-growth forests, such as high vertical complexity, are of lesser relevance for boreal old-growth forests. In comparison to undisturbed old-growth forests, transition old-growth forests had a taller canopy of high \"greenness\" due to a greater hardwood abundance; disturbed old-growth forests had a higher gap fraction and heterogeneity in tree size; second-growth forests exhibited a lower and more even canopy. Misclassified tiles were explained by spatial variation in disturbance severity or different levels of forest resistance and resilience to disturbance. These misclassifications are also of ecological interest, as they highlight the nuances in structural diversity that are rarely identified by disturbance mapping. A reasonable combination of LiDAR and satellite indices was effective not only in discriminating old-growth forests from second-growth forests, but also identifying their different structures, which result from specific disturbance histories. This method could contribute to effective monitoring of changes in the areas and characteristics old-growth forest that are caused by anthropogenic and natural disturbances.', '[Martin, Maxence; Cerrejon, Carlos; Valeria, Osvaldo] Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, Inst Rech Forets, 445 Boul Univ, Rouyn Noranda, PQ J9X 5E4, Canada.

This study developed a new LUE model coupled with a passive microwave vegetation index (Emissivity Difference Vegetation Index, EDVI) for daily GPP estimation. Normalized EDVI (nEDVI), an indicator of canopy-scale leaf development and biomass change, was used as a proxy of fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR). EDVI-based evaporative fraction (EDVI-EF) under all sky was used to indicate synoptic-scale water stress on LUE. 8-year in-situ measurements from seven flux tower sites (four forests, two grasslands and one croplands) of ChinaFLUX network were used to evaluate the model. We found that nEDVI-based FPAR better captured the short-term variations in daily in-situ GPP (GPPobs) than other optic-based FPAR schemes. This capability of nEDVI was more noticeable under moderate and heavy cloud cover (Frc) conditions. Validations against daily GPPobs at all sites showed that EDVI-based GPP (GPPEDVI) generated an overall small bias of -0.47 gC m- 2 day- 1 (-8.1%) and good Taylor score (S) of 0.86 at the daily scale. Better accuracy of GPPEDVI was found at forests sites with R2 of 0.43 to 0.73, bias of-5.29% to 3.03% and S of 0.58 to 0.78, respectively. At a tropical forest site with most frequent cloud cover, the model also well captured the variation in GPPobs from clear sky to cloudy sky (R2 of 0.93) with stable accuracies. Furthermore, the accuracy of daily GPPEDVI was found to be comparable with global satellite optic MOD17 GPP (GPPMOD17) and EC-LUE GPP (GPPECLUE) from 8-day to yearly scales across the sites. In particular, GPPEDVI performed generally smaller bias at evergreen broadleaf forests, while both of GPPMOD17 and GPPECLUE were overestimated, suggesting that there could be less saturation for microwave-based LUE model over dense vegetation. Although all three satellite LUE models severely underestimated GPP of crop, GPPEDVI generated lower bias (-29.8%) than GPPMOD17 (-66.8%) and GPPECLUE (-59.5%). Overall, this study is the first attempt toward the integration of microwave-derived variables into LUE model for daily GPP estimation. The microwave-based LUE model has a potential of mapping spatiotemporally continues daily GPP under various clouds.', '[Wang, Yipu; Li, Rui; Hu, Jiheng; Fu, Yuyun; Duan, Jiawei; Cheng, Yuanxi] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China.

However, map validation is lagging, in the sense that the annual land cover maps are often not validated. Concurrently, users such as the climate and land management community require information on the temporal consistency of multi-date GLC maps and stability in their accuracy. In this study, we propose a framework for operational validation of annual global land cover maps using efficient means for updating validation datasets that allow timely map validation according to recommendations in the CEOS Stage-4 validation guidelines. The framework includes a regular update of a validation dataset and continuous map validation. For the regular update of a validation dataset, a partial revision of the validation dataset based on random and targeted rechecking (areas with a high probability of change) is proposed followed by additional validation data collection. For continuous map validation, an accuracy assessment of each map release is proposed including an assessment of stability in map accuracy addressing the user needs on the temporal consistency information of GLC map and map quality. This validation approach was applied to the validation of the Copernicus Global Land Service GLC product (CGLS-LC100). The CGLS-LC100 global validation dataset was updated from 2015 to 2019. The update was done through a partial revision of the validation dataset and an additional collection of sample validation sites. From the global validation dataset, a total of 40% (10% for each update year) was revisited, supplemented by a targeted revision focusing on validation sample locations that were identified as possibly changed using the BFAST time series algorithm. Additionally, 6720 sample sites were collected to represent possible land cover change areas within 2015 and 2019. Through this updating mechanism, we increased the sampling intensity of validation sample sites in possible land cover change areas within the period. Next, the dataset was used to validate the annual GLC maps of the CGLS-LC100 product for 2015-2019. The results showed that the CGLS-LC100 annual GLC maps have about 80% overall accuracy showing high temporal consistency in general. In terms of stability in class accuracy, herbaceous wetland class showed to be the least stable over the period. As more operational land cover monitoring efforts are upcoming, we emphasize the importance of updated map validation and recommend improving the current validation practices and guidelines towards operational map validation so that long-term land cover maps and their uncertainty information are well understood and properly used.', '[Tsendbazar, N.; Herold, M.; Li, L.; Tarko, A.; de Bruin, S.; Masiliunas, D.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.

On the other hand, human alterations such as inundation by water impoundment or rapid drawdown may also destabilize the surrounding slopes. The Guobu slope is an ancient rockslide on the banks of the Laxiwa hydropower station reservoir (China), which reactivated during the reservoir impoundment in 2009. We extracted three-dimensional surface displacements with azimuth and range radar interferometry using European Space Agency\'s Copernicus Sentinel-1 and German Aerospace Center\'s TerraSAR-X data during 20152019. The upper part of the Guobu rockslide is characterized by toppling and is mostly subsiding with maximum rates over 0.4 m/yr and 0.7 m/yr in the vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. During filling of the reservoir prior to 2014, there was a long-wavelength in-phase response between rising reservoir level and GPS-observed increased slope movements. After the reservoir water level stabilized from 2015 to 2019, the slide movement became seasonal and we see a correlation between rainfall and landslide movement. These observations suggest that the slide motion is now primarily controlled by rainfall. The spatiotemporal landslide displacements allow us to estimate the hydraulic diffusivity of the rock mass, to be on the order (similar to 1.05 x 10(-7) m(2)/s) and the thickness of the moving rock mass (similar to 200 m).

SIF measurements from ground-based towers can reveal diurnal SIF dynamics across biomes and environmental conditions; however, meaningful interpretation of diurnal variations requires disentangling impacts from canopy structure, plant physiology, instrument configuration and retrieval methods, which often interact with and confound each other. This study aims to unpack these drivers using 1) concurrent ground and airborne canopy-scale and leaf-scale measurements at a corn field, 2) a mechanistic SIF model that explicitly considers the dynamics of photochemistry (via the fraction of open photosystem II reaction centers, qL) and photoprotection (via nonphotochemical quenching, NPQ) as well as their interactive dependence on the sub canopy light environment, and 3) cross-comparison of SIF instrument configurations and retrieval methods. We found that crop row orientations and sun angles can introduce a distinctive midday dip in SIF in absence of stress, due to a midday drop of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) when crop rows are north south oriented. Canopy structure caused distinctive responses in both qL and NPQ at different positions within the vertical canopy that collectively influenced fluorescence quantum yield (Phi(F)) at the leaf scale. Once integrated at the canopy scale, diurnal dynamics of both APAR and canopy escape probability (epsilon) are critical for accurately shaping diurnal SIF variations. While leaf-level qL and NPQ exhibited strong diurnal dynamics, their influence was attenuated at the canopy scale due to opposing effects on SIF at different canopy layers. Furthermore, different system configurations (i.e., bi-hemispherical vs. hemispherical-conical) and retrieval methods can bias the SIF magnitude and distort its diurnal shapes, therefore confounding the interpretation of inherent strength and dynamics of SIF emission. Our findings demonstrate the importance of crop row structures, interactive variations in canopy structure and plant physiology, instrument configuration, and retrieval method in shaping the measured dynamics of diurnal SIF. This study highlights the necessity to account for these factors to accurately interpret satellite SIF, and informs future synthesis work with different SIF instrumentation and retrieval methods across sites.', '[Chang, Christine Y.] ARS, USDA, Adapt Cropping Syst Lab, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA.

Normalization metrics that remove magnitude variations can greatly clarify the nature of spectral differences, simplifying interpretation of reflectance features in spectral imagery. Normalized difference measures are particularly useful because of the simplicity of the computation, the convenient scaling, and the ease with which the normalized difference procedure can be extended to multiple dimensions. The twodimensional normalized difference space described here allows for improved discrimination among bare soils and emergent vegetation when there are multiple soil types in the scene.

Recent studies have shown the occurrence of such forest types in the lowlands of French Guiana, where early morning radiation fog was shown to modify the water and energy cycles at the canopy level of the tropical lowland rain forest (Gehrig-Downie et al., 2012; Obregon et al., 2011). Since this newly discovered Tropical Lowland Cloud Forest (TLCF) harbours a unique biodiversity comparable to mountain cloud forests, knowledge of its spatial distribution across tropical lowland forests is of large ecological interest, but so far fully unknown. A prerequisite to detect potential TLCF stands is knowledge on the spatial occurrence of fog/low stratus clouds (FLS) over longer time scales, indicating fog frequency. We address this need on a continental scale by presenting the first spatially-explicit, high-resolution product on nocturnal FLS occurrence over the entire tropical lowland rain forest area of South America. The product is based on a new FLS retrieval scheme that uses brightness temperature (BT) information of night-time satellite images acquired by the Aqua Moderate Imaging Spectror-adiometer (Aqua MODIS). Since landforms substantially influence small-scale FLS development, we used a dy-namic threshold technique depending on the spatially variable subpixel information on landform suitability for FLS generation. The product was successfully validated against in-situ visibility measurements combined with a plausibility analysis based on the published but scarce fog observations over the Amazon. The independence of the new algorithm from measured total precipitable water (TPW) is an improvement over existing procedures that are limited to the availability of these ancillary data. The FLS frequency map for the entire tropical lowland forest of South America derived from over 52,000 scenes (18 years from 2003 to 2020 inclusive) indicates that FLS is widespread, though spatially differentiated, throughout the tropical lowland forests of South America, providing suitable environmental conditions for the TLCF. This knowledge on the spatial distribution of potential TLCF is of major importance for conservation efforts. The new FLS scheme is applicable to all tropical lowland forests and can therefore support global conservation efforts of the valuable TLCF ecosystems.', '[Pohl, Marius J.; Viehweger, Jonas; Bendix, Joerg] Univ Marburg, Fac Geog, Lab Climatol & Remote Sensing, Deutschhausstr 12, D-35032 Marburg, Germany.

Similar to other satellite data, effective screening of clouds and cloud shadows in PlanetScope images is a prerequisite for these applications, yet remains challenging as PlanetScope has 1) fewer spectral bands than other satellites hindering the use of traditional methods, and 2) inconsistent radiometric calibration across satellite sensors making the cloud/shadow detection using fixed thresholds unrealistic. To address these challenges, we developed a SpatioTemporal Integration approach for Automatic Cloud and Shadow Screening (\'STI-ACSS\'), including two steps: (1) generating initial masks of clouds/shadows by integrating both spatial (i.e. cloud/shadow indices of an individual PlanetScope image) and temporal (i.e. reflectance outliers in PlanetScope image time series) information with an adaptive threshold approach; (2) a two-step fine-tuning on these initial masks to derive final masks by integrating morphological processing with an object-based cloud and cloud shadow matching. We tested STI-ACSS at six tropical sites representative of different land cover types (e.g. forest, urban, cropland, savannah, and shrubland). For each site, we evaluated the performance of STI-ACSS with reference to the manual masks of clouds/shadows, and compared it with four state-of-the-art methods, namely Function of mask (Fmask), Automatic Time-Series Analysis (ATSA), Iterative Haze Optimized Transformation (IHOT) and the default PlanetScope quality control layer. Our results show that, across all sites, STI-ACSS 1) has the highest average overall accuracy (98.03%), 2) generates an average producer accuracy of 95.53% for clouds and 89.48% for cloud shadows, and 3) is robust across sites and seasons. These results suggest the effectiveness of using STI-ACSS for cloud/shadow detection for PlanetScope satellites in the tropics, with potential to be extended to other satellite sensors with limited spectral bands.', '[Wang, Jing; Wu, Shengbiao; Bogonovich, Marc; Guo, Zhengfei; Wu, Jin] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Biol Sci, Div Ecol & Biodivers, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

Understanding the triggering and attenuation mechanisms of such mass movements is crucial to assessing their hazard. In December 2018, Etna volcano (southern Italy) began a very intense eruption, which was accompanied by a seismic swarm with magnitudes reaching 4.9. Synthetic aperture radar data identified local displacements over a hilly area to the west of Patern`o village. We evaluated the contribution of seismically induced surface instability to the observed ground displacement by employing a multidisciplinary analysis comprising geological, geotechnical and geomorphological data, together with analytical and dynamic modelling. The results allowed us to identify the geometry and kinematics of a previously unknown paleo-landslide, which was stable before the volcanic eruption. The landslide was triggered by the light-to-moderate seismic shaking produced by the strongest event of the seismic sequence, namely, the December 26, Mw 4.9 earthquake. This observation confirms that seismic shaking has a cumulative effect on landslides that does not necessarily manifest as a failure but could evolve into a catastrophic collapse after several earthquakes.', '[Saroli, Michele] Univ Cassino & Lazio Merid, Dipartimento Ingn Civile & Meccan DICeM, Via G de Biasio 43, I-03043 Cassino, FR, Italy.

This study proposes a modified polarimetric decomposition framework to retrieve SM from multiincidence and multitemporal PolSAR observations. The framework is constructed by combining the X-Bragg model, the extended double Fresnel scattering model and the generalised volume scattering model (GVSM). Compared with traditional decomposition models, the proposed framework considers the depolarisation of dihedral scattering and the diverse vegetation contribution. Under the assumption that SM is invariant for the PolSAR observations at two different incidence angles and that vegetation scattering does not change between two consecutive measurements, analytical parameter solutions, including the dielectric constant of soil and crop stem, can be obtained by solving multivariable nonlinear equations. The proposed framework is applied to the time series of L-band uninhabited aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar data acquired during the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment in 2012. In this study, we assess retrieval performance by comparing the inversion results with in-situ measurements over bean, canola, corn, soybean, wheat and winter wheat areas and comparing the different performance of SM retrieval between the GVSM and Yamaguchi volume scattering models. Given that SM estimation is inherently influenced by crop phenology and empirical parameters which are introduced in the scattering models, we also investigate the influence of surface depolarisation angle and copol phase difference on SM estimation. Results show that the proposed retrieval framework provides an inversion accuracy of RMSE<6.0% and a correlation of R >= 0.6 with an inversion rate larger than 90%. Over wheat and winter wheat fields, a correlation of 0.8 between SM estimates and measurements is observed when the surface scattering is dominant. Specifically, stem permittivity, which is retrieved synchronously with SM also shows a linear relationship with crop biomass and plant water content over bean, corn, soybean and wheat fields. We also find that a priori knowledge of surface depolarisation angle, co-pol phase difference and adaptive volume scattering could help to improve the performance of the proposed SM retrieval framework. However, the GVSM model is still not fully adaptive because the co-pol power ratio of volume scattering is potentially influenced by ground scattering.', '[Shi, Hongtao; Yang, Jie; Zhao, Jinqi; Sun, Weidong; Shi, Lei; Li, Pingxiang] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

Accurate and timely estimation of corn yield is therefore essential for commodity trading and global food security. Recently, several deep learning models have been explored for corn yield forecasting. Despite success, most existing models only provide yield estimations without quantifying the uncertainty associated with the predictions. Also, the traditional deep learning approaches typically require a large training set and are easily prone to overfitting when the number of samples in the training set is relatively small. To address these limitations, in this study, we developed a county-level corn yield prediction model based on Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) using multiple data sources that are publicly available, including time-series satellite products, sequential climate observations, soil property maps, and historical corn yield records. Using preceding years since 2001 for model training, the developed BNN model achieved an average coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.77 for late-season prediction across the U.S. Corn Belt in testing years 2010-2019, and outperformed five other state-of-the-art machine learning models. Detailed evaluation in three representative testing years demonstrated that the proposed BNN model could accurately estimate corn yield not only in normal years but also in abnormal years when extreme weather events happened. Moreover, the timeliness of the prediction was evaluated within the growing season with an R-2 similar to 0.75 achieved by middle August, which is about 2 months before the harvest. We also assessed the predictive uncertainty, and more than 84% of the observed yield records were successfully enveloped in the 95% confidence interval of the predictive yield distribution. Our results also showed that the uncertainty level decreased steadily as time proceeded and stabilized around early August. Uncertainties in yield prediction were mainly induced by the observation noise and also related to the inter-annual and seasonal variabilities of environmental stress such as heat and water stress. This paper provides a robust framework for the within-season prediction of crop yield and highlights the need to obtain a deeper understanding of the effects of environmental stress on agricultural productivity and crop yield estimation.', '[Ma, Yuchi; Zhang, Zhou] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

However, most mangrove studies focused on the top canopy layer without exploring the vertical structure of mangroves. This paper presents multi-layered mangrove mapping which considered both overstory and understory detection and species classification using multispectral WorldView-3 (WV-3) data, airborne hyperspectral images (HSI), and LiDAR point cloud. First, LiDAR returns were stratified into the overstory and understory by analyzing the profile of return height, which helped understand the vertical structure of the mangrove stands. Second, three classification algorithms Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were compared by applying WV-3, HSI, LiDAR data, and their combinations to map seven vegetative species. Feature selection was conducted to identify important features and the optimal feature size prior to classification tasks. The measured and estimated understory canopy heights reached a high correlation coefficient of 0.71, which demonstrated the effectiveness of using LiDAR data and the proposed procedure to stratify multi-layered canopies. The combined HSI and LiDAR data produced satisfactory results by the three classifiers with overall accuracy (OA) varying from 0.86 to 0.88. And the species was also accurately mapped by integrating WV-3 and LiDAR data using both RF and SVM algorithms with OA attaining between 0.84 and 0.86. The results of this study highlight that (1) LiDAR data provided superior information to map the vertical structure of multi-layered mangroves, which provided valuable information to classify single-layered and dual-layered Kandelia obovata with understory beneath; (2) the combination of spectral and LiDAR features improved mangrove species classification; (3) and species mapping results derived from combined datasets appeared to be more influential by LiDAR features when using RF and SVM, but spectral features played a more important role in CNN.', '[Li, Qiaosi; Wong, Frankie Kwan Kit; Fung, Tung] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

Glacier extraction from satellite images is an essential step in large-scale area change monitoring. However, glacier extraction is usually influenced by cloud cover and seasonal snow, and thus far, there is no effective and automatic method to monitor glacier area change in large regions. In this study, a new method `multi-temporal minimum NDSI composite\' is proposed for clean glacier and nonseasonal snow extraction, and the results agree well with the glacier inventory (excluding the debris part), except in Himalayan regions where non-seasonal snow exists widely out of glaciers. This method is also used to estimate the glacier and nonseasonal snow area changes in High Mountain Asia (HMA) over the past 29 years. With this method, we can use abundant Landsat images of summer seasons from continuous years to composite a cloud-free and seasonal snow-free glacial image pixel by pixel. Glacial maps for the whole HMA are produced every 10 years beginning in 1990, so glacier changes are presented in different subregions and periods. The number of images which is used to composite a glacial map in each pixel is also given for uncertainty analysis. According to the results, the clean glacier and nonseasonal snow area in HMA decreased by -0.43 +/- 0.19%/a during 1990-2018 but had high temporal and spatial heterogeneity.

Remote sensing has been widely used to quantify GPP at regional to global scales. However, polarorbiting satellites (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel, Terra, Aqua, Suomi NPP, JPSS, OCO-2) lack the capability to examine the diurnal cycles of GPP because they observe the Earth?s surface at the same time of day. The Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS), launched in June 2018, observes the land surface temperature (LST) at different times of day with high spatial resolution (70 m ? 70 m) from the International Space Station (ISS). Here, we made use of ECOSTRESS data to predict instantaneous GPP with high spatial resolution for different times of day using a data-driven approach based on machine learning. The predictive GPP model used instantaneous ECOSTRESS LST observations along with the daily enhanced vegetation index (EVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), land cover type from the National Land Cover Database (NCLD), and instantaneous meteorological data from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. Our model estimated instantaneous GPP across 56 flux tower sites fairly well (R2 = 0.88, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) = 2.42 ?mol CO2 m- 2 s- 1). The instantaneous GPP estimates driven by ECOSTRESS LST captured the diurnal variations of tower GPP for different biomes. We then produced multiple high resolution ECOSTRESS GPP maps for the central and northern California. We found distinct changes in GPP at different times of day (e.g., higher in late morning, peak around noon, approaching zero at dusk), and clear differences in productivity across landscapes (e.g., savannas, croplands, grasslands, and forests) for different times of day. ECOSTRESS GPP also captured the seasonal variations in the diurnal cycling of photosynthesis. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using ECOSTRESS data for producing instantaneous GPP (i.e., GPP for the acquisition time of the ECOSTRESS data) for different times of day. The ECOSTRESS GPP can shed light on how plant photosynthesis and water use vary over the course of the diurnal cycle and inform agricultural management and future improvement of terrestrial biosphere/land surface models.', '[Li, Xing; Xiao, Jingfeng] Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Earth Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA.

When working with ocean data, cloud shadows are often difficult to differentiate from non-shadow values, since they show similar spectral characteristics than water pixels. A methodology to detect cloud shadows over the ocean is proposed. The present approach combines a series of tests applied directly to the physical variables derived from the satellite measured radiances, and it therefore does not depend on the wavebands measured by a specific satellite sensor. The tests include a departure from an EOF basis calculated using DINEOF, a threshold test, a proximity to cloud test and a ray tracing test. The weighing of the different tests can be adapted to each case or domain of study. The results are compared to manually detected shadows and to another shadow detection method. The approach works with cloud shadows of all sizes, and also with very small objects shadows, like the shadows projected by offshore windmills.', '[Alvera-Azcarate, Aida; Barth, Alexander; Troupin, Charles; Beckers, Jean-Marie] Univ Liege, AGO GHER, Allee Six Aout 17, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.

However, our recent research into urban tree radiative performance at the crown level implied that tree crown surface albedo changes over time. Based on the in-situ spectroscopy protocols established previously to measure tree crown transflectance, variation in the characteristics of tree crown surface albedo was explored combining spectroscopy and solar shortwave radiometry. Three commonly planted native UK tree species, Carpinus betulus, Acer campestre, and Taxus baccata, were sampled. Spatial distribution profiles of tree crown transflectance measured at fixed solar altitudes were normalised by in-situ spectroradiometry. Tree crown transflectance in the near infrared (NIR) region was found to be proportionally linked to tree crown surface albedo. Within each species, mean tree crown transflectance in the NIR region of 800-900 nm was approximately 2.5 times tree crown surface albedo. It was further found that infrared radiation (700-2500 nm) accounted for more than 90% of the total transflected shortwave radiation from tree crowns. The results demonstrate that tree crown surface albedo linearly increases with momentary solar altitude and the maximum tree crown surface albedo corresponds to maximum solar altitude at solar noon on sunny days in summer. Tree crown surface albedo across species tends to be strongly dependent on leaf size if considering visibly dense crown foliage. Our findings provide important insights into tree radiative shading effects resulting from temporal variation in tree crown surface albedo, with consequences for urban microclimate modelling and the development of urban heat mitigation strategies.', '[Deng, Jie; Shao, Li] Univ Reading, Sch Built Environm, Reading RG6 6DF, Berks, England.

Drought effects are often studied at the local scale, but recent advances in remote sensing allow for observations of plant water status across broad geographic scales. The vegetation optical depth (VOD) derived from satellite-based surface microwave emission has been shown to be sensitive to canopy water content, which is increasingly recognized as an important indicator of water relations and incipient mortality in plants. We develop an index which quantifies the normalized difference between night- and daytime diurnal VOD retrievals (nVOD(r)) and apply it across the western U.S. to determine the relative sensitivity of plants to variations in water supply (soil moisture) and atmospheric water demand (vapor pressure deficit -VPD). Canopy water content dynamics were most sensitive to soil moisture variation at intermediate climatic water deficits where tree cover transitions to grass cover. These areas are in transitional climate zones and occur at ecotones between forest and non-forest vegetation where canopy water content dynamics are most sensitive to both soil moisture and VPD variation. Our results suggest that vegetation in semi-arid ecotones is likely to see the most proximal impacts of drought stress as the planet warms.', '[Lyons, Drew S.; Dobrowski, Solomon Z.] Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Dept Forest Management, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.

Previous studies have mainly focused on the measurement of fractures in the horizontal dimension. However, the vertical morphology of fractures could also be potentially important in determining their evolution and role in ice shelf stability. In this regard, the dense and high-resolution surface elevation measurements collected by the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) provide an excellent opportunity for studying fractures in the vertical dimension over a regional scale. Here we developed an object-oriented algorithm to automatically detect and characterize fracture features (including rifts, surface fractures, and the surface expressions of basal fractures) from ICESat-2 data. We successfully applied the algorithm to ICESat-2 L3A Land Ice Height (ATL06) data over the Amery Ice Shelf in East Antarctica, and retrieved the vertical structural information of two major fracture fields. The detected fracture features match well with the visible fracture lines in Landsat-8 satellite imagery, and the edges of fracture features are well-captured from the ATL06 data. We analyzed the fracture patterns in terms of surface depth, width, vertical shape, length, and orientation. We found that the fracture feature depth is a key factor determining the formation of new fractures and the spatial pattern of depth is closely related to rift formation. We anticipate that further application of the object-oriented method over other ice shelves will produce important insights regarding fracture formation and ice shelf vulnerability by combining ICESat-2-derived vertical information with the horizontal structure retrieved from satellite imagery.', '[Wang, Shujie] Penn State Univ, Dept Geog Earth & Environm Syst Inst EESI, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.

Studies mainly attribute this increase to rising sea surface temperatures and prolonged warm seasons in the mid-latitudes. Historically, temperature has been the main environmental determinant used to predict V. parahaemolyticus concentrations in shellfish and surface water. However, studies using in situ sampling campaigns have shown that additional water quality parameters can be useful in predicting the bacterium. While the time and cost of obtaining in situ samples throughout the Chesapeake Bay at regular time intervals can exceed available resources, satellite remote sensing has the potential to provide predictions at higher temporal and spatial resolutions. This study uses satellite ocean color remote sensing and sea surface temperature (SST) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to investigate the utility of remotely sensed information for Vibrio parahaemolyticus predictions in the Chesapeake Bay and whether additional remotely sensed information can improve predictions over conventional SST-based models. We find that the addition of remotely sensed salinity, total suspended solids, and chlorophyll-a generally improves presence and abundance predictions compared to SST-only models. Models using remote sensing reflectances and SST also show potential for V. parahaemolyticus predictions, which could bypass the intermediary step of deriving water quality products from reflectances. Remotely sensed ocean color products and SST from one week prior to in situ V. parahaemolyticus measurements are evaluated and shown to be useful in bacterium predictions, which could provide lead-time for management decisions. The forecast models using ocean color products in addition to SST showed improvement over SST-only forecast models. The results of this study suggest that remote sensing can be a valuable tool to aid in higher resolution V. parahaemolyticus predictions and forecasts in the Chesapeake Bay, particularly when multiple environmental predictors are employed.

Different approaches to monitor phenology at different spatial scales, from in situ monitoring to remote sensing, are used to investigate spring and/or autumn phenological changes. In Mediterranean area, most of phenological changes occur during cloudy periods (spring and autumn), leading to a loss of information also for very high temporal resolution satellites. Instead, cloud-uninfluenced sensors, such as radar sensors, can allow to bypass this problem and produce a temporally continuous coverage.   In this paper, we analyzed the spring phenology of two European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) populations, located at different latitudes in Mediterranean area. Weekly in situ monitoring of leaf-out has been correlated with data collected by Synthetic Aperture Radar. Spring phenological phases were monitored in situ following a modified BBCH-code with a 5-scores scale (from 1 buds closed and covered by scales, to 5 leaf completely unfolded). The score 3 (young leaves starting to emerge from the bud) was considered the bud break. Different site conditions based on aspect (northern and southern) and altitudinal gradient (high and low altitude) have been considered. The aim was to test and implement a new methodology able to decrease the frequency of the field sampling, using remote data, to extend more detailed information on geographical scale, and to reconstruct past phenology.   Results showed a statistically significant different length of the vegetative spring period, spanning from dormant buds, up to leaves completely unfolded, between sites. Through Synthetic Aperture Radar estimation, this study demonstrates that leaf-out can be monitored with an extreme accuracy. The phenophase score 4 and 5 estimation showed the best performance (RMSE < of 4 days), phenophases score 2 and 3 showed promising performances (4 days < RMSE < 5 days), while phenophases score 1 seems to be not easily detectable, although it can be extrapolated with an RMSE < 6 days.   This radar approach fixes the cloud problem typical of multispectral approach and very frequent in phenophase change periods in Mediterranean climate. This study promotes the proposed remote sensing approach as a very useful tool to monitor growing season starting in remote areas, helping to reduce in situ observations and allowing past phenology reconstruction.', '[Proietti, Roberta; Cristina, Maria Monteverdi; Manuela, Plutino; Andrea, Germani; Cristiano, Castaldi; Chiavetta, Ugo] CREA, Res Ctr Forestry & Wood, Viale S Margherita 80, I-52100 Arezzo, Italy.

Although geodetic-quality antennas are designed to boost the direct reception from GNSS satellites and to suppress indirect reflections from natural surfaces, the latter can still be used to estimate the sea level in a stable terrestrial reference frame. Here, typical GNSS-R retrieval methodology is improved in two ways, 1) constraining phase-shifts to yield more precise reflector heights and 2) employing an extended dynamic filter to account for the second-order height rate of change (vertical acceleration). We validate retrievals over a 4-year period at Palmer Station (Antarctica), where there is a co-located tide gauge (TG). Because ice contaminates the long-period tidal constituents, we focus on the main tidal species (daily and subdaily), by employing a deseasonalization filter. The difference between sub-hourly GNSS-R retrievals of the ocean surface and TG records has a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 15.4 cm and a correlation of 0.903, while the tidal prediction has a RMSE of 1.9 cm and a correlation of 0.998. There is excellent millimetric agreement between the two sensors for most eight major tidal constituents, with the exception of luni-solar diurnal (K-1), principal solar (S-2), and luni-solar semidiurnal (K-2) components, which are biased in GNSS-R due to the leakage of the GPS orbital period. We also compare the GNSS-R tidal constituents from seven additional POLENET sites, without co-located TG, to global and local ocean tide models. We find that the root-sum-square error (RSSE) of eight major constituents varies between 26.0 cm and 56.9 cm for different models. Given that the agreement in tidal constituents between the TG and GNSS-R was better at Palmer Station, we conclude that assimilating the GNSS-R retrievals into tidal models would improve their accuracy in Antarctica and Greenland, provided that care is exercised to avoid the orbital period overtones and also sea ice.', '[Tabibi, Sajad; Francis, Olivier; van Dam, Tonie] Univ Luxembourg, Fac Sci Technol & Commun, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.

We present a HIghly Scalable Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (HIST-ARFM) algorithm to combine multispectral images of different sensors to reduce noise and produce monthly gap free high resolution (30 m) observations over land. Our approach uses images from the Landsat (30m spatial resolution and 16 day revisit cycle) and the MODIS missions, both from Terra and Aqua platforms (500m spatial resolution and daily revisit cycle). We implement a bias-aware Kalman filter method in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to obtain fused images at the Landsat spatial-resolution. The added bias correction in the Kalman filter estimates accounts for the fact that both model and observation errors are temporally auto-correlated and may have a non-zero mean. This approach also enables reliable estimation of the uncertainty associated with the final reflectance estimates, allowing for error propagation analyses in higher level remote sensing products. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated products through comparison with other state-of-the-art methods confirm the validity of the approach, and open the door to operational applications at enhanced spatio-temporal resolutions at broad continental scales.', '[Moreno-Martinez, Alvaro; Camps-Valls, Gustau; Munoz-Mari, Jordi] Univ Valencia, Image Proc Lab IPL, Valencia, Spain.

While there are several global SM indices, none of them directly use SM observations in a near-real-time capacity and as an operational tool. This paper presents a near-real-time global SM index monitor based on integrated SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) and SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) remote sensing data. We make use of the short period (2015-2018) of SMAP datasets in combination with two approaches-Cumulative Distribution Function Mapping (CDFM) and Bayesian conditional process-and integrate them with SMOS data in a way that SMOS data is consistent with SMAP. The integrated SMOS and SMAP (SMOS/SMAP) has an increased global revisit frequency and a period of record from 2010 to the present. A four-parameter Beta distribution was fitted to the SMOS/SMAP dataset for each calendar month of each grid cell at similar to 36 km resolution for the period from 2010 to 2018. We used an asymptotic method that guarantees the values of the bounding parameters of the Beta distribution will envelop both the smallest and largest observed values. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test showed that more grids globally will pass if the integrated dataset is from the Bayesian conditional approach. A daily global SM index map is generated and posted online based on translating each grid\'s integrated SM value for that day to a corresponding probability percentile relevant to the particular calendar month from 2010 to 2018. For validation, we use the Canadian Prairies Ecozone (CPE). We compare the integrated SM with the SMAP core validation and RISMA sites from ISMN, compare our indices with other models (VIC, ESA\'s CCI SM v04.4 integrated satellite data, and SPI-1), and make a two-by-two comparison of candidate indices using heat maps and summary CDF statistics. Furthermore, we visually compare our global SM-based index maps with those produced by other organizations. Our Global SM Index Monitor (GSMIM) performed, in many tests, similarly to the CCI\'s product SM index but with the advantage of being a near-real-time tool, which has applications for identifying evolving drought for food security conditions, insurance, policymaking, and crop planning especially for the remote parts of the globe.', '[Sadri, Sara; Pan, Ming; Vergopolan, Noemi; Wood, Eric] Princeton Univ, 59 Olden St, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.

The goal of the measurements was to examine how the introduction of Delta PRI into the working dataset can improve the estimation of photosynthesis. Spectral and photosynthetic characteristics of European beech and Norway spruce saplings were periodically measured in growth chambers with an adjustable irradiance and temperature. Patterns of environmental changes inside the growth chambers were created by periodic changes in irradiance and temperature. Four general irradiance periods lasting 10-12 days each were established. Introduced irradiance regimes varied in the sum of daily irradiance and amplitude of irradiance changes. Temperature was changed with more complex patterns to induce changes in xanthophyll cycle pigments at various time scales within these regimes. Our measurements confirmed the PRI linkage to photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE). However, the strength of this connection was found to be dependent on changing pigment concentrations, specifically on the change in the ratio of chlorophylls to carotenoids. Furthermore, a negative interference in photosynthesis estimation from PRI was recorded if the temperature was lowered overnight to 12 degrees C. The differential PRI (Delta PRI), calculated as the simple difference between the PRI value measured during the daytime period and in early morning (PRI0), revealed a decreased effect from pigments and cold temperature on LUE estimation. The regression analysis among all measured data identified an increased association between PRI and LUE following the introduction of Delta PRI from R-2 = 0.26 to 0.69 in beech and from R-2 = 0.61 to 0.77 in spruce data. The analyses showed that both leaf carotenoid concentrations and the conversion state of xanthophyll cycle pigments played a significant role in determining PRI and PRI0 values and that the accurate assessment of these pigments in PRI across multiple levels of stress from irradiance and temperature might improve estimations of LUE through Delta PRI. In our data, Delta PRI appeared to be a good measure of photosynthesis, the dynamics of which differed between beech and spruce saplings upon switching temperatures.', '[Kovac, Daniel; Vesela, Barbora; Klem, Karel; Vecerova, Kristyna; Penuelas, Josep; Urban, Otmar] Czech Acad Sci, Global Change Res Inst, Belidla 986-4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic.

We constructed models that predict pico-, nano- and micro-phytoplankton size classes and assessed the impact of separately including sea surface temperature (SST) and estimates of light level in the surface mixed-layer on model skill. The empirical models were trained using size classes estimated by chemotaxonomic analysis of in situ high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigments and environmental data originating from the Atlantic Ocean. As the accuracy of transforming pigment data into quantitative size classes is crucial when constructing phytoplankton size composition (PSC) models, we also quantified the resulting differences of our and several existing PSC models when using class sizes derived from HPLC pigments by two common chemotaxonomic methods, CHEMTAX and Diagnostic Pigments (DP). Addition of the environmental variables to abundance-based models using our approach improved the skill of correctly predicting PSC, reducing the root mean square difference (RMSD) by 10 to 20% in the best cases. Addition of SST yielded the highest percentage decreases, on average, for all three size classes, with greatest improvement in microplankton and nanoplankton fractions. These models performed equal to or better than several existing abundance-based models. The improvements in model predictions, however, could be obscured by the choice of pigment method used to generate the initial PSC data set. Insufficient data is available to assess whether CHEMTAX or DP is the more appropriate chemotaxonomic method to employ when estimating PSC. Further collection and analysis of additional water samples for phytoplankton taxa and size by microscopic methods including traditional microscopic cell counts and automated methods - and HPLC pigment data are required to answer this question.', '[Moore, Timothy S.] Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA.

Where in-situ river discharge measurements are not available, it may be possible to use discharge estimates from a hydrological model, provided the model simulations are of sufficient quality, to construct satellite-based discharge gauging. We tested this approach by developing model- and gauge-based satellite gauging reaches (SGRs) using 0.05 degrees MODIS optical remote sensing at similar to 10,000 gauged and similar to 370,000 ungauged river reaches globally. Model-based SGRs are aimed to infer temporal flow patterns and reflect unusually high or low river discharge behavior (i.e, flood or drought conditions), if not necessarily absolute discharge volumes. The model-based SGRs achieved a discharge prediction skill that was often similar to gauge-based SGRs, and sometimes better than the model itself. Our results showed promising opportunities to develop model-based SGRs in sparsely gauged basins in South America, Africa, and Asia. We selected river reaches, with mean widths ranging from 67 to 3105 m, representing both poor and successful SGRs in different environments for case studies to analyze conditions for successful SGR development. River size and morphology were the main factors determining the performance of SGRs. Wide channels with strong temporal variations, broad floodplains and multiple braided or anastomosing channels provided the best conditions for SGRs. The probability of constructing a successful SGR could be predicted from high-resolution inundation summary data available globally, and can thus be predicted anywhere. Ongoing increases in the spatial and temporal resolution of remote sensing will further increase the number of river reaches for which satellite-based discharge gauging will become possible.', '[Hou, Jiawei; van Dijk, Albert I.

Satellite-based remote sensing provides a useful tool for assessing both ongoing activity and retrospective eruptions. This paper represents an initial application of a multi-sensor approach, in part to demonstrate its strengths and limitations in a single volcanic region that is fairly well monitored in situ. We utilize data from five NASA satellite-based instruments, having up to 18 years of global observations, to conduct in-depth investigations of eight volcanoes on the Kamchatka Peninsula (Russia) that were active between 2000 and 2018. From 169 eruptive plumes observed, we performed detailed plume-dynamics analysis in eighty-two cases for which sufficiently favorable observations were obtained. Plume heights from MISR and CALIOP, microphysical particle properties (e.g. fine ash, sulfates) from MISR, thermal anomalies generated by lava features from MODIS, and sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations from OMI and OMPS are all considered. Evidence of eruption evolution over months-to-years was identified at Shiveluch, Kliuchevskoi, Kizimen, Karymsky, Zhupanovsky, Koryaksky and Kambalny. In cases with extensive data coverage (Kliuchevskoi, Kizimen, Karymsky and Zhupanovsky), underlying subsurface dynamics is inferred, corroborated where possible with detailed ground-based data records. The 1.1 km resolution of the particle property retrievals from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument capture downwind plume-particle evolution in many cases. Comparison of changes in aerosol optical depth (AOD), retrieved effective particle size (REPS) and retrieved effective particle absorption (REPA) map to six plume transport regimes, indicating varying degrees of downwind particle aggregation, deposition, and/or new particle formation. Distinct meteorological conditions are identified as likely driving these evolutionary processes, most notably the atmospheric static stability and wind shear at plume altitude. This approach can be applied to volcanic plumes globally, including those for which surface monitoring is limited or entirely absent.', '[Flower, Verity J.

Focusing on the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR) in Perak Province, Peninsular Malaysia, this study aimed to retrieve comprehensive information on the biophysical properties of mangroves from spaceborne optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to support better understanding of their dynamics in a managed setting. For the period 1988 to 2016 (29 years), forest age was estimated on at least an annual basis by combining time-series of Landsat-derived Normalised Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) and Japanese L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The NDMI was further used to retrieve canopy cover (%). Interferometric Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) X/C-band (2000), TanDEM-X-band (2010-2016) and stereo WorldView-2 stereo (2016) data were evaluated for their role in estimating canopy height (CH), from which above ground biomass (AGB, Mg ha(-1)) was derived using pre-established allometry. Whilst both L-band HH and HV data increased with AGB after about 8-10 years of growth, retrieval was compromised by mixed scattering from varying amounts of dead woody debris following clearing and wood material within regenerating forests, thinning of trees at similar to 15 and 20 years, and saturation of L-band SAR data after approximately 20 years of growth. Reference was made to stereo Phantom-3 DJI stereo imagery to support estimation of canopy cover (CC) and validation of satellite-derived CH. AGB estimates were compared with ground-based measurements. Using relationships with forest age, both CH and AGB were estimated for each date of Landsat or L-band SAR observation and the temporal trends in L-band SAR were shown to effectively track the sequences of clearing and regeneration. From these, four stages of the harvesting cycle were defined.

While this is a well-established area of research, replete with a number of cloud detection methodologies, many issues persist for detecting clouds over areas of high albedo surfaces (snow and sand), detecting cloud shadows, and transferring a given algorithm between observational platforms. Particularly for the latter, algorithms are often platform-specific with corresponding rule-based tests and thresholds inherent to instruments and applied corrections. Here, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm for the detection of cloud and cloud shadow fields in multi-channel satellite imagery from World-View-2 (WV-2) and Sentinel-2 (S-2), using their Red, Green, Blue, and Near-Infrared (RGB, NIR) channels. This algorithm is developed within the NASA NeMO-Net project, a multi-modal CNN for global coral reef classification which utilizes imagery from multiple remote sensing aircraft and satellites with heterogeneous spatial resolution and spectral coverage. Our cloud detection algorithm is novel in that it attempts to learn deep invariant features for cloud detection utilizing both the spectral and the spatial information inherent in satellite imagery. The first part of our work presents the CNN cloud and cloud shadow algorithm development (trained using WV-2 data) and its application to WV-2 (with a cloud detection accuracy of 89%) and to S-2 imagery (referred to as augmented CNN). The second part presents a new domain adaptation CNN-based approach (domain adversarial NN) that allows for better adaptation between the two satellite platforms during the prediction step, without the need to train for each platform separately. Our augmented CNN algorithm results in better cloud prediction rates as compared to the original S-2 cloud mask (81% versus 48%), but still, clear pixels prediction rate is lower than S-2 (81% versus 91%). Nevertheless, the application of the domain adaptation approach shows promise in better transferring the knowledge gained from one trained domain (WV-2) to another (S-2), increasing the prediction accuracy of both clear and cloudy pixels when compared to a network trained only by WV-2. As such, domain adaptation may offer a novel means of additional augmentation for our CNN-based cloud detection algorithm, increasing robustness towards predictions from multiple remote sensing platforms. The approach presented here may be further developed and optimized for global and multi-modal (multi-channel and multi-platform) satellite cloud detection capability by utilizing a more global dataset.', '[Segal-Rozenhaimer, Michal; Li, Alan; Chirayath, Ved] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA.

Shifts of ISP have cascading effects on food production, carbon sequestration, water consumption, biodiversity, and public health. Previous studies mainly focused on investigating the effects of urbanization on the spatial patterns of ISP by comparing phenological metrics, e.g. start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS), between urban center and the surrounding rural regions. However, it remains unclear how urbanization-induced land cover conversions and climate change jointly influence the temporal variations of SOS and EOS within the urban ecosystem. To fill this knowledge gap, we utilized daily two-band enhanced vegetation index, daily meteorological record, and annual land cover dataset to investigate the respective impacts of urbanization and climate change on temporal shifts of ISP between the post- and the pre-urbanization periods over 196 large cities in the northern mid-latitudes. We found 51% of the cities experienced an advanced SOS with an average of -6.39 +/- 5.82 days after urbanization has occurred, while the remaining 49% of the cities had a delayed SOS with an average of 7.56 +/- 5.63 days. We also found a later EOS at 53% of the cities and an earlier EOS at 47% of the cities with an average of 8.43 +/- 7.59 and - 5.57 +/- 4.99 days between the post- and pre-urbanization periods, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis indicates that climate variables (i.e. temperature, precipitation, and insolation) play dominant roles in regulating the temporal shifts of ISP. Furthermore, the earlier SOS and later EOS were significantly correlated with the amplitude of urbanization (i.e. increase of impervious surface area) in cities after controlling for effects of climate factors. These patterns were generally consistent across eight climate zones.

Achieved results are compared to in-situ air temperature data and to a well-known 19 GHz and 37 GHz passive-microwave melt characterization technique known as the cross-polarized gradient ratio (XPGR). The L-band based snow wetness retrievals often detect the onset of seasonal melt earlier than the XPGR algorithm without the need for empirically tuned thresholds. We also demonstrate the performance of the SMOS based snow wetness retrievals based on error statistics compared with an air temperature melt proxy.

Seasonality induced fluctuations can severely impede the reliability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) applications like forest classification, deforestation detection and biomass estimation. In the past, the seasonality effects on SAR data acquired over tropical forests have been largely ignored due to the lack of consistent time-series data for the entire region. To overcome this knowledge gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive statistical assessment of L-band SAR backscatter variability in tropical forests by means of a homogeneous big data analysis on multitemporal ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 dual-polarization ScanSAR data. Virtually the entire tropical forest region was monitored from 2016 to 2018 with 42 days intervals. Approximately 250 TB of ScanSAR data were computed on a 0.05 decimal degrees grid to produce forest maps which provide more detailed and reliable information about the spatial and temporal behavior of tropical forests. The first, easy to understand global forest variability maps provide unseen insights into forest structures for the entire tropical belt from local to continental scale. While the differences between the evergreen rainforest and the (semi-) deciduous dry forest is obviously large in the spatial domain, in the temporal domain seasonal changes can easily cause variations in the same order of magnitude within the same forest class. Depending on the area, natural environmental factors like flooding or leaf shedding can result in seasonal gamma naught ranges exceeding 3 dB in both HH and HV polarization. The findings of this study should have important implications for all future remote sensing research efforts on tropical forests. With drastically increasing availability of more frequent high-resolution L-band observations in the coming decade, these characteristic forest variabilities must be considered in the development of active and passive microwave remote sensing algorithms. The better understanding of the underlying dynamics and processes is expected to improve forest remote sensing applications for the upcoming L-band SAR satellite generation including ALOS-4, NISAR, and Tandem-L.', '[Koyama, Christian N.; Watanabe, Manabu; Shimada, Masanobu] Tokyo Denki Univ, Sch Sci & Engn, Hatoyama, Saitama 3500394, Japan.

In this study, a bivariate probabilistic framework is developed for assessing vegetation vulnerability and mapping drought-prone ecosystems more informatively, which is different from previous studies conducted in a deterministic way.

Afterward, the monthly NDVI series is connected with the most correlated SPI to derive joint distributions using a copula method. On such basis, conditional probabilities of vegetation losses are estimated under multiple drought scenarios and used for revealing tempo-spatial patterns of vegetation vulnerability. Particular focus is directed to the Loess Plateau (LP), China, which is a world-famous environmentally fragile area. Results indicate that the proposed framework is valid for vegetation vulnerability assessment as the pair-wise SPI-NDVI observations fall within high-density areas of the estimated NDVI distributions. From a probabilistic perspective, roughly 95% of the LP exhibits greater probability of vegetation losses when suffering from water deficits rather than water surplus. Vegetation loss probabilities reaching their peak (39.7%) in summer indicate the highest vegetation vulnerability to drought stress in summer months sequentially followed by autumn (32.9%) and spring (31.0%), which is linked to marked variations in water requirement at different stages of vegetation growth. Spatially, drought-vulnerable regions are identified in the western edge with vegetation loss probability 20.6% higher than the LP mean value, suggesting higher vulnerability in more arid areas. Irrigation practices and large-scale vegetation restoration, as two important sources of anthropogenic disturbance in the LP, benefit the decreased vegetation vulnerability over the majority of affected areas. Results may increase our knowledge about climatic controls on vegetation health and support the ecosystem restoration planning in the LP.', '[Fang, Wei; Huang, Shengzhi; Huang, Qiang; Wang, Lu; Guo, Yi] Xian Univ Technol, Sch Water Resources & Hydropower, State Key Lab Ecohydraul Northwest Arid Reg China, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.

Previously reported evaluations focused on the accuracy of above-ground biomass (AGB) estimates but did not distinguish between the influences from the data and those from the algorithm of data processing. Therefore, insufficient information has been available for hardware and software developers to prioritize future developments. In the present study, we evaluated the amount of trees digitized in terrestrial and aerial point clouds by means of manual tree detection. On a plot-level (a fixed size of 32 m x 32 m), approximately 97%, 93%, and 75% of individual trees could be recorded in easy (ca. 700 stems/ha), medium (ca. 900 stems/ha), and difficult stands (ca. 2, 200 stems/ha), respectively, using five-scan terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). With aerial point cloud from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne laser scanning (ULS) (ca. 450 points/m(2)), promising digitization can be expected for 87%, 69%, and 55% of individual trees in easy, medium and difficult stands, respectively. Plot level AGB concentrates on big trees. The dominant and codominant trees combined accounted for 90.7%, 86.0%, and 69.7% of the plot-level AGB, and their population combined accounted for 73.2%, 55.3%, and 31.0%, respectively, in easy, medium, and difficult stands. Therefore, missing of dominant and codominant trees in data has a greater influence on plot-level AGB estimates than missing intermediate and suppressed trees. At a tree level, when AGB was predicted from tree height and DBH, the relative root mean square error (RMSE%) of AGB estimates in easy, medium, and difficult plots were 10.1%, 14.6%, and 20.4%, respectively, based on manually measured tree parameters from TLS point clouds. The manual measurements from ULS point clouds provided RMSE%s of 30.4%, 51.1%, and 76.9% in easy, medium, and difficult plots, respectively. These results indicate the magnitude of errors introduced by the data, and for ULS, by the tree height DBH allometry used. When using automated in-house algorithms of the Finnish Geospatial Research Institute (FGI), the RMSE%s of tree-level AGB estimates using TLS were 11.5%, 17.8%, and 43.9% in easy, medium, and difficult plots, respectively. When using ULS, the corresponding errors were 31.7%, 57.7%, and 73.3%, respectively. Such results suggest that the automated algorithms perform similarly to manual processing in the tree-level ABG estimation from terrestrial and aerial point clouds, specifically in easy and medium forest stands. The incomplete tree digitization in the data was the main factor affecting the accuracy of tree-centric AGB estimates. Fusion of the terrestrial and aerial observation perspectives provided promising results. When manual TLS-based DBH and manual ULS-based tree height were used, the RMSE% was reduced to 8.6%-12.7%, compared to 10.1%-20.4% when only TLS-manual tree parameters were used and 30.3%-76.9% when only ULS-manual tree parameters were used.', '[Wang, Yunsheng; Pyorala, Jiri; Liang, Xinlian; Lehtomaki, Matti; Kukko, Antero; Yu, Xiaowei; Kaartinen, Harri; Hyyppa, Juha] Finnish Geospatial Res Inst, Dept Remote Sensing & Photogrammetry, Masala 02431, Finland.

As our climate changes, it is likely that drought events will become more intense and frequent. Effective drought monitoring is therefore critical, both to the research community in developing an understanding of drought, and to those responsible for drought management and mitigation. Over the past 50 years remote sensing has shifted the field away from reliance on traditional site-based measurements and enabled observations and estimates of key drought-related variables over larger spatial and temporal scales than was previously possible. This has proven especially important in data poor regions with limited in-situ monitoring stations. Available remotely sensed data products now represent almost all aspects of drought propagation and have contributed to our understanding of the phenomena. In this review we chart the rise of remote sensing for drought monitoring, examining key milestones and technologies for assessing meteorological, agricultural and hydrological drought events. We reflect on challenges the research community has faced to date, such as limitations associated with data record length and spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. This review then looks ahead to the future in terms of new technologies, such as the ESA Sentinel satellites, analytical platforms and approaches, such as Google EarthEngine, and the utility of existing data in new drought monitoring applications. We look forward to the continuation of 50 years of progress to provide effective, innovative and efficient drought monitoring solutions utilising remote sensing technology.', '[West, Harry; Quinn, Nevil; Horswell, Michael] Univ West England, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Ctr Water Communities & Resilience, Bristol, Avon, England.', 'University of West EnglandRP West, H (通讯作者)，Univ West England, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Ctr Water Communities & Resilience, Bristol, Avon, England.', 'harry.west@uwe.ac.uk', 'Quinn, Nevil Wyndham/0000-0001-6510-3041; West,   Harry/0000-0002-2704-5474', NULL, NULL, 245, 195, 203, 38, 326, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

However, variations in top-of-canopy (TOC) SIF cannot be directly interpreted as physiological changes because of the confounding effects of vegetation biochemistry (i.e. pigments, dry matter and water) and structure. In this study, we propose an approach of using radiative transfer models (RTMs) and TOC reflectance to estimate the biochemical and structural effects on TOC SIF, as a necessary step in retrieving physiological information from TOC SIF. The approach was assessed by using airborne (HyPlant) reflectance and SIF data acquired over an agricultural experimental farm in Germany on two days, before and during a heat event in summer 2015 with maximum temperatures of 27 degrees C and 34 degrees C, respectively. The results show that over 76% variation among different crops in SIF observations was explained by variation in vegetation biochemistry and structure. In addition, the changes of vegetation biochemistry and structure explained as much as 73% variation between the two days in far-red SIF, and 40% variation in red SIF. The remaining unexplained variation was mostly attributed to the variability in physiological status. We conclude that reflectance provides valuable information to account for biochemical and structural effects on SIF and to advance analysis of SIF observations. The combination of RTMs, reflectance and SIF opens new pathways to detect vegetation biochemical, structural and physiological changes.', '[Yang, Peiqi; van der Tol, Christiaan; Verhoef, Wout] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.

However, annual 25 m spatial resolution forest maps during 2011-2014 are missing because of the gap in operation between ALOS and ALOS-2, preventing the construction of a continuous, fine resolution time-series dataset on the world\'s forests. In contrast, the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI images were available globally since 2000. This research developed a novel method to produce annual 25 m forest maps during 2007-2016 by fusing the fine spatial resolution, but asynchronous PALSAR/PALSAR-2 with coarse spatial resolution, but synchronous MODIS NDVI data, thus, filling the four-year gap in the ALOS and ALOS-2 time-series, as well as enhancing the existing mapping activity. The method was developed concentrating on two key objectives: 1) producing more accurate 25 m forest maps by integrating PALSAR/PALSAR-2 and MODIS NDVI data during 2007-2010 and 2015-2016; 2) reconstructing annual 25 m forest maps from time-series MODIS NDVI images during 2011-2014. Specifically, a decision tree classification was developed for forest mapping based on both the PALSAR/PALSAR-2 and MODIS NDVI data, and a new spatial-temporal super resolution mapping was proposed to reconstruct the 25 m forest maps from time-series MODIS NDVI images. Three study sites including Paraguay, the USA and Russia were chosen, as they represent the world\'s three main forest types: tropical forest, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, and boreal conifer forest, respectively. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed approach produced the most accurate continuous time-series of fine spatial resolution forest maps both visually and quantitatively. For the forest maps during 2007-2010 and 2015-2016, the results had greater overall accuracy values (> 98%) than those of the original JAXA forest product. For the reconstructed 25 m forest maps during 2011-2014, the increases in classifications accuracy relative to three benchmark methods were statistically significant, and the overall accuracy values of the three study sites were almost universally > 92%. The proposed approach, therefore, has great potential to support the production of annual 25 m forest maps by fusing PALSAR/PALSAR-2 and MODIS NDVI during 2007-2016.', '[Zhang, Yihang; Ling, Feng; Li, Xiaodong; Du, Yun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geodesy & Geophys, Key Lab Monitoring & Estimate Environm & Disaster, Wuhan 430077, Hubei, Peoples R China.

Compared to traditional mapping practices that require intensive field surveys, remote sensing technologies offer efficient and cost-effective means for crop type mapping from regional to global scales. However, mapping heterogeneous agricultural landscape is a challenge because of diverse and complex spectral profiles of crops. We propose a novel deep learning method, namely deep progressively expanded network (dPEN), for mapping nineteen different objects including crop types, weeds and crop residues, in a heterogeneous agricultural field using WorldView-3 (WV-3) imagery. To assess the mapping accuracy of dPEN, we created a calibrated WV-3 dataset with the corresponding ground truth. In addition, the suitability of visible/near-infrared (VNIR, 400-1040 nm) and short-wave infrared (SWIR, 1195 nm-2365 nm) bands of WV-3 to classification accuracy were examined and discussed in detail. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to explore the significance of all SWIR bands in WV-3 for classification accuracy in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape. The results demonstrated that: (1) The proposed dPEN allows for building a deeper neural network from multi spectral data which was the limitation of many convolutional neural networks; (2) dPEN was able to extract more discriminative features from VNIR and SWIR bands by producing the highest overall accuracy (OA: 86.06%) over competing methods such as support vector machine and random forest; (3) The inclusion of WV-3 SWIR bands greatly improved the classification accuracy; (4) SWIR bands were particularly beneficial to improve the classification accuracy of some individual classes such as weeds, crop residues, and corn and soybean during late developmental stages; (5) The red-edge band (705-745 nm) was identified as the most important band affecting the classification accuracy nearly 10%, whereas the coastal band (400-450 nm) provided the lowest contribution; and (6) SWIR-5 band (2145-2185 nm) contributed most to OA by enhancing it approximately 4% when combined with VNIR bands, while SWIR-1 (1195-1225 nm) yielded the lowest improvement (1.55%) for OA. These research outcomes provide useful information for efficiently mapping agricultural landscape, and indicate the potential practices of dPEN and contributions of spectral bands in WV-3 for plant phenotyping, weed control, and crop residue retention.', '[Sidike, Paheding; Sagan, Vasit; Maimaitijiang, Maitiniyazi; Maimaitiyiming, Matthew] St Louis Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, St Louis, MO 63108 USA.

However, the accurate estimation of the carbon sequestration capacity of disturbed forests is still challenging due to large uncertainties in their spatial distribution. Using Google Earth Engine (GEE), we developed a novel approach to map cumulative disturbed forest areas based on the 27-year time-series of Landsat surface reflectance imagery. This approach integrates single date features with temporal characteristics from six time-series trajectories (two Landsat shortwave infrared bands and four vegetation indices) using a random forest machine learning classification algorithm. We demonstrated the feasibility of this method to map disturbed forests in three different forest ecoregions (seasonal, moist and dry forest) in Mato Grosso, Brazil, and found that the overall mapping accuracy was high, ranging from 81.3% for moist forest to 86.1% for seasonal forest. According to our classification, dry forest ecoregion experienced the most severe disturbances with 41% of forests being disturbed by 2010, followed by seasonal forest and moist forest ecoregions. We further separated disturbed forests into degraded old-growth forests and post-deforestation regrowth forests based on an existing post-deforestation land use map (TerraClass) and found that the area of degraded old-growth forests was up to 62% larger than the extent of post-deforestation regrowth forests, with 18% of old-growth forests actually being degraded. Application of this new classification approach to other tropical areas will provide a better constraint on the spatial extent of disturbed forest areas in Tropics and ultimately towards a better understanding of their importance in the global carbon cycle.', '[Wang, Yunxia; Ziv, Guy; Batterman, Sarah A.; Galbraith, David] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.

Here, we take the opportunity to test the GlobCurrent surface ocean current products against in-situ observations in these two contrasting regimes. Observations by Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) instruments of Australia\'s Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and drifting buoys of the Global Drifting Programme (GDP) are used.   The monthly-timescale variability of the GlobCurrent alongshore current component is in moderately good agreement with the observations on the continental shelf in the South-East but neither the shorter period variability nor the long-term mean are representative of the ADCP observations. While the observed tidal currents are negligibly small, the wind-driven signals are not. But these are evidently too transient to be adequately sampled by altimetry. The inclusion of an Ekman component does not represent these signals because the interaction of the Ekman transport with the coastal boundary condition is not included. Similarly, the error of the time-mean velocity, which is the dominant error, is because that product is not designed to represent the highly anisotropic nature of the sea level gradients over the continental shelf nor the constraints on the flow field that are imposed by the topography. We thus conclude that the GlobCurrent product needs improvements before it can be described as very suitable for applications on this, and probably other, narrow continental shelf. Off the continental shelf, in contrast, the GlobCurrent products compare quite well with the trajectories of drifting buoys, confirming that the products are quite suitable for blue-water applications.   In contrast to the South-East, the tides are very strong in the North-West region of Australia. The sub-tidal variability is weak, in both relative and absolute senses. Consequently, the removal of the tidal signal from the sea level observations needs to be very complete for the residual error to be smaller than the true sub-tidal signal. Transient wind forced signals are also occasionally large so this step of the de-aliasing also needs to be very accurate. Unfortunately, it appears that more work is required before accurate estimates of sub-tidal variability are available from GlobCurrent: the magnitude of the GlobCurrent estimates of sub-tidal current variability far exceed the magnitude of, and are uncorrelated with, the detided ADCP data.', '[Cancet, Mathilde] NOVELTIS, 153 Rue Lac, F-31670 Labege, France.

Traditional mapping of croplands using medium resolution (10-100m) remote sensing imagery involving a \"one-time, one-place\" approach requires significant computing and labor resources. Although high mapping accuracies can be achieved using this approach, it is tedious and expensive to collect reference information to train the classifiers at each location and to apply over large areas, such as a continent. Moreover, large area cropland mapping presents additional challenges including a wide range of agricultural management practices, climatic conditions, and crop types. To overcome these challenges, here we report on a generalized image classifier to map cropland extent, which builds a classification model using training data from one location and time period, applied to other times and locations without the need for additional training data. The study was demonstrated across eight agro-ecological zones (AEZs) in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa using Landsat data acquired between 2009 and 2011. To reduce between-scene variability associated with image availability and cloud cover, input data were reduced to salient temporal statistics derived from enhanced vegetation index (EVI) combined with topographic variables. The generalized classifier was then tested across three levels of generalization: 1. individual - where training data were extracted from and applied to the same Landsat footprint; 2. AEZ where training data were extracted from a set of Landsat footprints within an AEZ and applied to any other Landsat footprint in the same AEZ; and 3. regional where training data were extracted from a set of Landsat footprints in the whole study area and applied to any other Landsat footprint inside the study area. Results showed that the generalized classifier is successful in identifying and mapping croplands with comparable success across all three levels of generalization with minimal cost: average loss in accuracy (as measured by overall accuracy) from the individual level (average overall accuracy of 80 +/- 5%) to regional level (average overall accuracy of 74 +/- 10%) is between 2 and 10% depending on the location. Results also show that generalization is not sensitive to the choice of the classification algorithm the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model performs equally well compared to many popular machine learning algorithms found in the literature. This work suggests the generalization/signature extension framework has a great potential for rapid identification and mapping of croplands with reasonable accuracies over large areas using only easily computed vegetation indices with very little user input and ground information requirement.', '[Phalke, Aparna R.; Ozdogan, Mutlu] Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Ctr Sustainabil & Global Environm, Madison, WI 53706 USA.', 'University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin MadisonRP Phalke, AR (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Ctr Sustainabil & Global Environm, Madison, WI 53706 USA.', 'phalke@wisc.eduRI Phalke, Aparna/AAE-5276-2020', 'Phalke, Aparna/0000-0001-6059-8305', 'USGS cooperative agreement [G13AC00061];  [GFSAD30]', 'This research was partially funded by USGS cooperative agreement number   G13AC00061.

By combining activity classes estimated during different time spans allows to determine if a phenomenon is active, reactivated, or dormant. Furthermore, an innovative confidence degree assessment was carried out to verify the reliability of the procedure, by considering the measuring points distribution and the variability of the movements for each landslide. The results were validated using the landslide inventory of the study area and in-situ monitoring systems for representative case studies. Thanks to this approach an updated state of activity until 2014 was assigned to 507 landslides out the 1657 which were previously mapped in the study area.', '[Boni, Roberta; Bordoni, Massimiliano; Meisina, Claudia] Univ Pavia, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Via Ferrata 1, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.

Using retrieved satellite data as input, the new, global, multistage interpolation technique generates a trigonometric polynomial, providing a representation of the underlying physical SST field in functional form. The resulting interpolating function can be efficiently and accurately evaluated anywhere within the domain over which it was derived and its moments calculated to estimate the mean and variance of the field over desired sub-regions. Application of the technique is demonstrated for SST retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) sensors. Comparison of the functional form with the data from which it was derived demonstrates how the technique can potentially help to identify small observational artifacts such as MODIS scan striping and residual cloud contamination. Integrals of the interpolating functions over successively larger spatial scales successfully emulate the retrieved SST at the different effective spatial resolutions and the second moments are consistent with the direct sample variances, and hence representative of the spatial SST variability of the available finer-resolution observations over the coarser scales. Using the approach, the variability of 1-km-resolution SST observations on open ocean grids of both 5- and 25 km resolution is found to be similar to 0.07 K. In regions of sharper gradients such as associated with strong localized diurnal warming, the variability within 25-km-resolution grids increases to as much as 0.4 K for sampling at 1 km resolution. The variability of 1-km observations on a 25-km-resolution grid is about 2.4 times greater than that on a 5-km-resolution grid. Broader application of the technique globally could help better quantify regional variations in the spatial variability, which would subsequently improve uncertainty estimates for existing satellite-based SST products.', '[Castro, Sandra L.] Univ Colorado, Colorado Ctr Astrodynam Res, 431 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.

As it is extremely difficult to access the interior of a glacier, our knowledge relies mostly on the observation of input variables such as air temperature, and output variables such as the ice flow velocities reflecting the englacial water pressure, and the dynamics of plumes reflecting the discharge of meltwater into the ocean. In this study we use a cost-effective Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to monitor the daily movements of Bowdoin Glacier, north-west Greenland, and the dynamics of its main plume. Using Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry and feature-tracking techniques, we obtained 22 high-resolution ortho-images and 19 velocity fields at the calving front for 12 days in July 2016. Our results show a two-day-long speed-up event (up to 170%) caused by an increase in buoyant subglacial forces with a strong spatial variability revealing that enhanced acceleration is an indication of shallow bedrock. Further, we used the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) method to analyze water flow from successive UAV images taken while flying over the main plume of the glacier. We found that PIV successfully captures the area of radially diverging flow of the plume, and provides information on spatial and time variability as no other remote sensing technique can. Most interestingly, the active part of the plume features pulsating water jets at the time scale of seconds, and is 1 to 5 times smaller than its visual footprint defined by the iceberg-free area. Combined with an ice flow model or a non-steady plume model, our approach has the potential to generate a novel set of input data to gather information about the depth of the bedrock, the discharge of meltwater, or the subglacial melting rate of tidewater glaciers.', '[Jouvet, Guillaume; Weidmann, Yvo; Kneib, Marin; Detert, Martin; Seguinot, Julien] ETHZ, VAW, Zurich, Switzerland.

Spatial and temporal quantification of floodplain dynamics is needed for assessing the impacts of hydromorphological controls on river ecosystems. However, estimation of land cover dynamics in a post-classification setting is hindered by a high contribution of classification errors. A possible solution relies on the selection of specific information of the change map, instead of increasing the overall classification accuracy. In this study, we analyze the capabilities of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), the associated classification processes and their respective accuracies to extract a robust estimate of floodplain dynamics. We show that an estimation of dynamics should be built on specific land cover interfaces to be robust against classification errors and should include specific features depending on the season-sensor coupling. We use five different sets of features and determine the optimal combination to use information largely based on blue and infrared bands with the support of texture and point cloud metrics at leaf-off conditions. In this post-classification setting, the best observation of dynamics can be achieved by focusing on the gravel-water interface. The semi-supervised approach generated error of 10% of observed changes along highly dynamic reaches using these two land cover classes.

Unfortunately, as this often depends on detailed field mapping and intensive absolute dating techniques, it can be a challenging, expensive and time-consuming exercise. In this study, we demonstrate that quantitative information about the ages of alluvial fan surfaces in Owens Valley, California, is recorded by Landsat-8 multispectral satellite imagery. We show that systematic changes in the wavelength-dependent brightness of fan surfaces occur gradually over a timescale of similar to 100 kyr in this semi-arid setting, and are highly correlated with known deposit ages. Using spectro-radiometry and X-ray diffraction analysis of sediment samples collected in the field, we interpret that surface reflectance evolves primarily in response to the in-situ production of secondary illite and iron oxide by weathering in this landscape. Furthermore, we demonstrate that first-order predictions of absolute fan surface age can be derived from multispectral imagery when an initial age calibration is available. These findings suggest that multispectral imagery, such as Landsat data, can be used (i) for preliminary mapping of alluvial fans prior to detailed field work and before choosing sampling sites for conventional dating techniques, and (ii) to extend age models to undated neighbouring surfaces with equivalent physical properties, once an age-brightness calibration has been established.', '[D\'Arcy, Mitch] Univ Potsdam, Inst Earth & Environm Sci, Karl Liebknecht Str 24-25, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.

In Brazil, deforestation has been closely coupled to the expansion of grazing and cropping systems primarily in the tropical forest, but no spatially explicit high resolution database on deforestation exists that captures tropical forest clearing prior to 2000. The open Landsat archive provides > 45 years of imagery and is well suited for wall-to-wall assessments of historic deforestation dynamics which are valuable to policy development and environmental impact assessments. Image analysis procedures for reconstructing long-term deforestation dynamics over large areas need to cope with regions and time periods for which the archive contains heterogeneous data densities on a yearly and decadal basis. We create for the first time yearly 30 m maps of long term, annual deforestation dynamics (LTAD) covering the period from 1984 to 2014 for Path and Mato Grosso, two Brazilian federal states that cover much of the Brazilian arc-of-deforestation. Our results provide valuable insights into historic deforestation trends, with annually increasing deforestation from 1990 to 1999 for both Para and Mato Grosso. Peak deforestation occurred in 2004 after which deforestation leveled off - with a more pronounced decrease in Mato Grosso than in Path. Contrary to Mato Grosso, Para again experienced increasing annual forest clearing in recent years. For the time period after 2000, we provide an indepth comparison with two widely used products, the Brazilian PRODES and the Global Forest Change maps (GFC, Hansen et al., 2013). Our deforestation estimates (407,000 +/- 42,000 km(2) at 95% confidence level) are above those provided by PRODES, while GFC results are closer to our estimates for the comparison period. Recent PRODES estimates are consistently below our and the GFC results.

Herein, using 17 years of ocean-color composites, we investigate differences in the regional patterns of interannual variability in satellite-derived chlorophyll (Chl), a proxy for phytoplankton biomass. A neural network classification, based on the Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) analysis in the time domain, is used to reveal regions of similar temporal variability of Chl in the Mediterranean Sea. Characteristic temporal patterns extracted by the SOM analysis show different scales of variation that can be related to already identified oceanographic features and biogeochemical variability in the Mediterranean Sea. Clear differences are noticed between regions located in the Western basin and Adriatic Sea, where rivers, winter mixing and winds are known to drive variations in primary production at regional scale and regions located in the Eastern basin, represented by a large and rather homogeneous region. Using the SOM-defined characteristic temporal patterns of Chl, we analyzed the regional influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the long-term ( > 1 year) Chl variability. Our results indicate that NAO has more influence in the Chl variations occurring in regions located in the Western basin whereas ENSO exhibits higher impact on the central Mediterranean and Eastern basin during its positive phase. Both NAO and ENSO show non-stationary coherence with Mediterranean Chl. The analysis also reveals a sharp regime shift occurring in 2004-2007, when NAO changed from positive to negative values. This shift particularly affected the winter phytoplankton biomass and it is indicative of climate driven ecosystem-level changes in the Mediterranean Sea.

Accurate detection of clouds and cloud shadows can help exclude these contaminated pixels in further applications. Existing cloud screening methods are challenged by cloudy regions where most of satellite images are contaminated by clouds. To solve this problem for landscapes where the typical frequency of cloud-free observations of a pixel is too small to use existing methods to mask clouds and shadows, this study presents a new Automatic Time-Series Analysis (ATSA) method to screen clouds and cloud shadows in multi-temporal optical images. ATSA has five main steps: (1) calculate cloud and shadow indices to highlight cloud and cloud shadow information; (2) obtain initial cloud mask by unsupervised classifiers; (3) refine initial cloud mask by analyzing time series of a cloud index; (4) predict the potential shadow mask using geometric relationships; and (5) refine the potential shadow mask by analyzing time series of a shadow index. Compared with existing methods, ATSA needs fewer predefined parameters, does not require a thermal infrared band, and is more suitable for areas with persistent clouds. The performance of ATSA was tested with Landsat-8 OLI images, Landsat-4 MSS images, and Sentinel-2 images in three sites. The results were compared with a popular method, Function of Mask (Fmask), which has been adopted by USGS to produce Landsat cloud masks. These tests show that ATSA and Fmask can get comparable cloud and shadow masks in some of the tested images. However, ATSA can consistently obtain high accuracy in all images, while Fmask has large omission or commission errors in some images. The quantitative accuracy was assessed using manual cloud masks of 15 images. The average cloud producer\'s accuracy of these 15 images is as high as 0.959 and the average shadow producer\'s accuracy reaches 0.901. Given that it can be applied to old satellite sensors and it is capable for cloudy regions, ATSA is a valuable supplement to the existing cloud screening methods.', '[Zhu, Xiaolin] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

However, such information is usually limited to field studies performed at the plot level (similar to 1 ha). The combination of imaging spectroscopy with physically based radiative transfer (RT) models holds great promise for generalizing and extrapolating insights from plot-based studies to whole landscapes. Here, we tested the capacity of a simplified 3D RT approach to retrieve the structural and chemical traits of individual tree crowns (ITCs) from a highly diverse tropical forest. We first produced two datasets called measured and simulated. The measured dataset was composed of ITC reflectance extracted from sunlit imaging spectroscopy pixels. The simulated dataset was produced using a look-up-table approach and the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model. We then compared the simulated and measured reflectances of ITCs in terms of shape difference by computing the spectral angle. The results showed small disagreements between the simulated and measured reflectances. Such differences impacted neither the spectral variability nor the spectral regions recognized as useful for species discrimination, showing that the spectral angle was a suitable measure of spectral similarity. Simulation robustness was assessed by comparing model parameters obtained by inversion to imaging spectroscopy vegetation indices and the proportion of non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), green photosynthetic vegetation (GV) and shade estimated within ITCs. DART canopy structural parameters were related to NPV (R-2 = 0.71), GV (R-2 = 0.78) and shade (R-2 = 0.55). DART canopy foliar parameters such as chlorophyll and carotenoids were related to the ratio of TCARI/OSAVI (R-2 = 0.80) indices and the simple ratio between reflectances at 515 nm and 570 nm (R-515/R-570) (R-2 = 0.54), respectively. Species-related differences in NPV, GV and shade were explained by variations in crown architectural characteristics.

These requirements, which are laid down in, for example, European Union directives and the Clean Water Act in the United States, share two core elements with respect to status assessments: 1) the status assessment is done using discrete classes, typically for water bodies, sub-areas or critical sites representative for certain area of interest, and 2) phytoplankton chlorophyll a (chl-a) is one of the main variables considered. We analysed the benefits of using chl-a concentrations derived from EO data for the status assessments specified in the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). Our study focused especially on EO observations\' ability to capture extreme and transient events (such as instances of cyanobacteria blooms) more frequently than the monitoring-station data conventionally employs. The accuracy of EO-based chl-a assessment was studied for, in all, 129 Finnish water bodies in the area of the Baltic Sea, in Northern Europe. Natural conditions in this coastal area particularly its multitude of small bays, numerous estuaries, and mosaic of islands impose exceptionally strict requirements for an EO instrument\'s spatial resolution. The analysis revealed that an instrument with a 300 m resolution, such as the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) or Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI), can be used to estimate the water quality in 62% of these water bodies. Processing of MERIS data into chl-a concentrations by means of a FUB inversion model demonstrated good accuracy relative to monitoring stations\' measurements for the open-water season in 2003-2011. This extensive dataset showed a 23% difference in modal values between EO- and station sampling -based chl-a concentrations. The bias in EO chl-a estimates was found to increase with low Secchi disk depth, elevated turbidity, and the presence of intensive phytoplankton blooms. The monitoring-station and EO data showed similar distributions of chl-a observations for a given day and location, a finding that supports the comprehensive use of EO-derived chl-a concentrations in assessment. For determination of a water body\'s status, the EO data required but also allowed for statistical analysis that differs from what has typically been utilised with sparse measurements from monitoring-station data. The geometric mean or the mode of the EO observations was found to represent the main bulk of the chl-a concentrations well statistically. In contrast, the arithmetic mean of EO observations yields chl-a concentrations that are roughly 1.1-1.6 mu g/I higher and hence can lead to over-estimation in the associated status assessment. This paper also presents a new approach applicable for evaluating the validity of EO-based algorithms for any coastal water area requiring assessment. With this quality-grade (QG) method, the EO chl-a estimation accuracy is rated in terms of three grades, with water bodies taken as the evaluation units. For this, the method utilises statistical differences between EO and station-sampling chl-a concentrations and applies background information on optical properties obtained from measurements at routine-monitoring stations. The QG method showed the EO-based chl-a accuracy to suffice for assessing the status of 65% of the coastal water bodies examined. At concentrations representing the threshold for the target of \"good status\" under the WFD, the EO approach produced 0.   6 mu g/I higher chl-a values than the stations\' sampling did. The MERIS results point to clear benefits of using OLCI-based status assessment throughout the Sentinel-3 era.', '[Attila, Jenni; Kauppila, Pirkko; Kallio, Kari Y.; Alasalmi, Hanna; Keto, Vesa; Bruun, Eeva; Koponen, Sampsa] Finnish Environm Inst, POB 140, FI-00251 Helsinki, Finland.', 'Finnish Environment InstituteRP Attila, J (通讯作者)，Finnish Environm Inst, POB 140, FI-00251 Helsinki, Finland.', 'jenni.attila@ymparisto.fiRI Koponen, Sampsa/AAX-5895-2021', 'Koponen, Sampsa/0000-0002-2959-5699', 'Finnish Environment Institute', 'We are grateful to Sari Mitikka for her highly valuable comments during   the method-development work.

In recent years, more efforts have been made to explore the sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), particularly polarimetric SAR signatures, to crop biophysical parameters or phenological stages. In this study, phenological metrics of canola (Brassica napus) and spring wheat (Triticum spp.) are related with temporal evolution of polarimetric SAR parameters derived from the C-band RADARSAT-2 full polarimetric SAR data. Both crops are very common in north eastern Ontario, Canada, but have very anatomically different development processes. From multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 data acquired in three consecutive years (2012-2014), significant correlations were observed between a number of SAR polarimetric parameters and the growth parameters of both crops. Strong correlation was observed between plant height and the Alpha angle of the Cloude-Pottier decomposition, with the R-2 of 0.91 and 0.66 for canola and wheat, respectively. The R-2 increased when the polarimetric parameters were smoothed in the time domain (R-2 of 0.98 for canola and 0.88 for wheat). Strong correlation was also observed for the two crops between the effective leaf area index (LAIe) and the Beta angle, and between days-after-seeding (DAS) and a combination of the Alpha and the Beta angles.

These wind jets bring relatively cold and dry air from the Arabian Desert, increasing heat loss and evaporation over the region similar to cold-air outbreaks from mid and subpolar latitudes. QuikSCAT captures the spatial structure of the wind jets and agrees well with in situ observations from a heavily instrumented mooring in the northern Red Sea. The local linear correlations between QuikSCAT and in situ winds are 0.96 (speed) and 0.85 (direction). QuikSCAT also reveals that cross-axis winds such as the mountain-gap wind jets are a major component of the regional wind variability. The cross-axis wind pattern appears as the second (or third) mode in the four vector Empirical Orthogonal Function analyses we performed, explaining between 6% to 11% of the wind variance. Westward wind jets are typical in winter, especially in December and January, but with strong interannual variability. Several jets can occur simultaneously and cover a large latitudinal range of the northern Red Sea, which we call large-scale westward events. QuikSCAT recorded 18 large-scale events over ten years, with duration between 3 to 8 days and strengths varying from 3-4 to 9-10 m/s.

The primary goal of the work was to develop a feasible means for accurately and rapidly reconstructing or \"digitizing\" entire trees in order to specify the position, orientation, and size of every leaf in digital tree models that provide geometric inputs for high-resolution biophysical models or analyses. As with any optical measurement technique, a primary challenge is accurately accounting for plant matter that is occluded from view of the sensor. The present method is termed \"semi-direct\" because it uses a triangulation procedure to approximately directly reconstruct as many leaves as possible that are in view of the scanner. For plant matter obstructed from view, a statistical backfilling procedure was used to add additional leaves such that the three-dimensional distribution of leaf area and orientation of the reconstructed plant matched that of the actual plant on average. In a best case scenario such as when leaf density is low, nearly all leaf area is directly reconstructed from the scan and the branch and clumping structure is preserved within the reconstruction. In the worst case scenario such as when the leaf density is very high and nearly all leaves are occluded from view of the scanner, only a small fraction of leaves can be directly reconstructed, but at a minimum the distribution of leaf area and the leaf angle distribution across the reconstructed plant will be consistent with that of the actual plant. Unlike many other approaches, the present method does not rely on the woody matter of the plant to provide a skeleton for reconstruction, and can be used in dense plants where little woody matter is visible from the scanner.', '[Bailey, Brian N.; Ochoa, Miguel H.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.', 'University of California System; University of California DavisRP Bailey, BN (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.', 'bnbailey@ucdavis.edu', 'Bailey, Brian/0000-0003-1919-2324', 'American Vineyard Foundation [2015-1825/2016-1825/2017-1825]; U.S.   National Science Foundation [1664175, DGE-1650042]; USDA National   Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch project [CA-D-PLS-2401-H]; ICER;   Directorate For Geosciences [1664175] Funding Source: National Science   Foundation', 'Financial support of this work by the American Vineyard Foundation   grants 2015-1825/2016-1825/2017-1825, U.S. National Science Foundation   grants AGS PREEVENTS 1664175 and DGE-1650042 (Graduate Research   Fellowship), and the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture   Hatch project number CA-D-PLS-2401-H.', 41, 14, 15, 2, 44, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data provide demonstrated capacity to systematically and accurately detect and map canopy gaps over large forest areas. Digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) is emerging as an alternative, lower-cost source of three-dimensional information for characterizing forest structure and modelling forest inventory attributes. In this study we compared the relative capacities of ALS and DAP data to map canopy gaps in a complex coastal temperate rainforest on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. We applied fixed-and variable-height threshold approaches for gap detection using both ALS and DAP data, and validated outcomes using independent data derived via visual image interpretation. Overall accuracies for ALS-derived gaps were 96.50% and 89.50% for the fixed-and variable height threshold approaches respectively, compared to 59.50% and 50.00% for the DAP-derived gaps, with DAP data having large errors of omission ( > 88%). We found that 70% of ALS-derived gaps were identified in old seral stage stands (age > 250 years), while 65% of DAP-derived gaps were located in early seral stage stands (age < 40 years). For the DAP data, gap detection accuracy was 80% in early seral stands, compared to 50% in old seral stands. In contrast, ALS detection accuracy varied by only similar to 6% between early and old seral stages. We compared detected gaps using a variety of metrics and found significant differences in the number and average size of gaps detected using ALS and DAP data. Using the fixed-height threshold, the ALS data identified 16 times more gaps and 6.5 times more gap area than the DAP data, with a mean ALS-derived gap size that was half that of the DAP data. The average amount of overlap between ALS- and DAP-detected gaps was 13.26% and 42.90% for the variable and fixed thresholds, respectively. We attribute these differences in gap detection to the nature of the DAP data itself, which characterizes primarily the outer canopy envelope, as well as to the confounding effects of canopy complexity and related occlusions and shadows on image matching algorithms. We conclude that DAP data do not provide analogous results to ALS data for canopy gap detection and mapping in coastal temperate rainforests, and that ALS data enable markedly superior accuracy and detailed gap characterizations.', '[White, Joanne C.; Wulder, Michael A.] Nat Resources Canada, Pacific Forestry Ctr, Canadian Forest Serv, 506 West Burnside Rd, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada.

However, few studies have conducted high spatial resolution assessments of ground-level PM2.5 for China at the national scale, due to the limitations of high-resolution AOD products. To generate high-resolution PM2.5 for the entirety of mainland China, a combined 3 km AOD dataset was produced by blending the newly released 3 km-resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Dark Target AOD data with the 10 km-resolution MODIS Deep Blue AOD data. Using this dataset, surface PM2.5 measurements, and ancillary information, a space-time regression model that is an improved geographically and temporally weighted regression(GTWR) with an interior point algorithm (IPA) based efficient mechanism for selecting optimal parameter values, was developed to estimate a large set of daily PM2.5 concentrations. Comparisons with the popular spatiotemporal models (daily geographically weighted regression and two-stage model) indicated that the proposed GTWR model, with an R-2 of 0.80 in cross-validation (CV), performs notably better than the two other models, which have an R-2 in CV of 0.71 and 0.72, respectively. The use of the combined 3-km high resolution AOD data was found not only to present detailed particle gradients, but also to enhance model performance (CV R-2 is only 0.32 for the non-combined AOD data). Furthermore, the GTWR\'s ability to predict PM2.5 for days without PM2.5-AOD paired samples and to generate historical PM2.5 estimates was demonstrated. As a result, fine-scale PM2.5 maps over China were generated, and several PM2.5 hotspots were identified. Therefore, it becomes possible to generate daily high-resolution PM2.5 estimates over a large area using GTWR, due to its synergy of spatial and temporal dimensions in the data and its ability to extend the temporal coverage of PM2.5 observations.', '[He, Qingqing; Huang, Bo] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

In-situ gauging stations are distributed sparsely and heterogeneously and do not cover much of the world, whereas remotely sensed images are spatially and temporally dense and available globally. Remotely sensed multispectral images, such as the ones acquired by Landsat missions, are available to enable the analysis and surveying of rivers using suitable algorithms. However, existing algorithms are limited in ways that restrict the coverage of the produced results and that prevent the automated analysis of river networks at large scales over short periods of time. Ideally, river maps should be as \"live\" as possible, e.g., computed quickly and continuously as new Earth imaging data becomes available. Towards advancing progress on this problem, we describe an automated river analysis and mapping engine, RivaMap, that enables the computation of large-scale hydrography data sets from remotely sensed data in a short period of time. RivaMap facilitates water resource management by providing tools to delineate rivers and to estimate their width. As a practical application of RivaMap, we present a continental-scale centerline and width data set of North American rivers, that is automatically computed on Landsat data. We validate our mapping engine by comparing the RivaMap-generated data to a similar data set, NARWidth, and also to in-situ measurements. Our experimental results show that RivaMap is able to efficiently and accurately extract rivers from remotely sensed images at large scales. The outcomes of this research, the software, and the computed exemplary data set are publicly available. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The latter is leading to heterogeneous forest landscapes with predominant and varying intensity of human modification. Optical Earth observation data offers the most feasible and accessible means of mapping and monitoring the forest cover heterogeneity in this region. Further, difficulties in ground data collection in this region present the need for more robust physically-based interpretation of satellite data which extends beyond simple empirical correlations of reflectance data with forest characteristics. We present an application of forest reflectance parameterization based on spectral invariants in lowland humid tropical forests of Malaysian Borneo. Our framework combined field measurements (hemispherical photos) of canopy structure, radiative transfer modelling at leaf (PROSPECT) and canopy scale (PARAS), and assessments using satellite data (Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, ETM +). Field data were collected representing a gradient of forest degradation within a large-scale experimental landscape. Results showed limited ability of Landsat-class satellites to uncover the full gradient of forest degradation in this biome due to similarity in canopy structure as characterized by effective canopy cover, leaf area index, and angular profile of canopy gap fraction. Our findings, however, showed strong expression of leaf optical properties at canopy level.

The state-ofthe-art in monitoring changes in grassland species composition is to conduct repeated plot-based vegetation surveys that assess the occurrence and cover of plants. These plot-based surveys are typically limited to comparably small areas and the quality of the cover estimates depends strongly on the experience and performance of the surveyors. Here, we investigate the possibility of a semi-automated, image-based method for cover estimates, by analyzing the applicability of very high spatial resolution hyperspectral data to classify grassland species at the level of individuals. This individual-oriented approach is seen as an alternative to community oriented remote sensing depicting canopy reflectance as the total of mixed species reflectance. An AISA + imaging spectrometer mounted on a scaffold was used to scan 1 m(2) grassland plots and assess the impact of four sources of variation on the predicted species cover: (1) the spatial resolution of the scans, (2) complexity, i.e. species number and structural diversity, (3) the species cover and (4) the share of functional types (graminoids and forbs). Classifications were conducted using a support vector machine classification with a linear kemel, obtaining a median Kappa of 0.8. Species cover estimations reached median r(2) and root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.6 and 6.2% respectively. We found that the spatial resolution and diversity level (mainly structural diversity) were the most important sources of variation affecting the performance of the proposed approach. A spatial resolution below 1 cm produced relatively good models for estimating species-specific coverages (r(2) = similar to 0.6; RMSE = similar to 7.5%) while predictions using pixel sizes over that threshold failed in this individual-oriented approach (r(2) = similar to 0.17; RMSE = similar to 20.7%). Areas with low inter-species overlap were better suited than areas with frequent inter-species overlap.

The extent to which diagnostic rock features are preserved despite the presence of lichens is of major concern in remotely sensed geological studies and estimates of the critical level of lichen coverage, below which spectral features of the mineral substrate can still be identified, are needed. We investigated how surficial lichen cover affects the characteristics of shortwave infrared (SWIR) mineral absorption features and the efficacy of automated absorption feature extraction. For this purpose, mixed spectra were synthetically generated from laboratory spectra of common rock forming SWIR absorbing minerals and lichens. Wavelength displacements of characteristic absorption features for each mixed spectrum were then analyzed as a function of percentage lichen cover. Distinctive trends were identified that can be used in future analysis: The strong spectral features of mica group minerals around 2200 and 2340-2350 nm maintain their integrity for up to 30% lichen cover, despite the related shift toward shorter wavelengths for higher percentage lichen cover. In contrast, very weak absorption bands around 2440 nm in (white) micas spectra are completely obscured for a lichen cover of >= 50%. Our observations suggest that the chlorite feature around 2250 nm is shifted toward longer wavelengths and the depth of this feature as well as the contrast between lichen and substrate spectra define the amount of lichen needed to mask it. Furthermore, lichens induce a spectral shift towards shorter wavelengths for the features around 2320 nm for the rocks containing amphibole, chlorite, carbonate and serpentine group minerals. In addition, no wavelength displacement is observed for chlorite, biotite and phlogopite features around 2380 nm in mixtures with lichens. By quantifying lichen cover effects on mineral absorption features, our study highlights the importance of being precautious in any interpretation in areas characterized by abundant lichen-covered outcrops. This can be of significant importance for mineral and deposit vectoring as the presence of abundant lichen coverage causing slightly shifted features for a given spectra can be erroneously identified as a path to a deposit (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Thanks to its capacity to acquire synoptic and detailed data during day and night, and in all weather conditions, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite remote sensing is considered one of the best tools for the acquisition of flood mapping information. However, specific factors contributing to SAR backscatter in urban environments, such as shadow and layover effects, and the presence of water surface-like radar response areas, complicate the detection of flood water pixels. This paper describes an approach for near-real-time flood mapping in urban and rural areas. The innovative aspect of the approach is its reliance on the combined use of very-high-resolution SAR satellite imagery (C-band, HH polarization) and hydraulic data, specifically flood return period data estimated for each point of the floodplain. This approach was tested and evaluated using two case studies of the 2011 Richelieu River flood (Canada) observed by the very-high-resolution RADARSAT-2 sensor. In both case studies, the algorithm proved capable of detecting flooding in urban areas with good accuracy, identifying approximately 87% of flooded pixels correctly. The associated false negative and false positive rates are approximately 14%. In rural areas, 97% of flooded pixels were correctly identified, with false negative rates close to 3% and false positive rates between 3% and 35%. These results highlight the capacity of flood return period data to overcome limitations associated with SAR-based flood detection in urban environments, and the relevance of their use in combination with SAR C-band imagery for precise flood extent mapping in urban and rural environments in a crisis management context.

The European Space Agency P-band radar BIOMASS mission will help to reduce this uncertainty by providing unprecedented information on the distribution of forest above-ground biomass (AGB), particularly in the tropics where the gaps are greatest and knowledge is most needed. Mission selection was made in full knowledge of coverage restrictions over Europe, North and Central America imposed by the US Department of Defense Space Objects Tracking Radar (SOTR) stations. Under these restrictions, only 3% of AGB carbon stock coverage is lost in the tropical forest biome, with this biome representing 66% of global AGB carbon stocks in 2005. The loss is more significant in the temperate (72%), boreal (37%) and subtropical (29%) biomes, with these accounting for approximately 12%, 15% and 7%, respectively, of the global forest AGB carbon stocks. In terms of global carbon cycle modelling, there is minimal impact in areas of high AGB density, since mainly lower biomass forests in cooler climates are affected. In addition, most areas affected by the SOTR stations are located in industrialized countries with well-developed national forest inventories, so that extensive information on AGB is already available. Hence the main scientific objectives of the BIOMASS mission are not seriously compromised. Furthermore, several space sensors that can estimate AGB in lower biomass forests are in orbit or planned for launch between now and the launch of BIOMASS in 2021, which will help to fill the gaps in mission coverage.

The three cornered hat method is used to quantify uncertainties in TWS changes from GRACE observations, land surface models, and global hydrological models, indicating that the WaterGap Global Hydrological Model (WGHM)-based TWS changes show the lowest uncertainty over sixty basins covering a range of climate settings and levels of human activities globally. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) using WGHM TWS output for training (2003-2006) is subsequently used to merge TWS changes from various GRACE products. Results indicate that the BMA-based TWS changes show the highest consistency with the WGHM output for the validation period (2007-2009) in terms of the highest medium of the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) coefficient of 0.714 among all TWS change products for the sixty basins. The mascon solution shows a medium of NSE of 0.682, higher than other GRACE TWS change products. Analysis of spatiotemporal variability in BMA-based TWS changes and the mascon solution indicates that higher depletion rates for the 13-year period (Apr 2002-Mar 2015) occurred over major aquifers due to groundwater withdrawals for irrigation (e.g., Tigris, Central Valley, Ganges, upper Arkansas, and Indus), basins subject to great glacier and snow melting (e.g., Yukon, Fraser, and eastern Ganges), the north Caspian Sea (e.g., Don and Ural), and the Caspian Sea. Significant increasing trends in TWS are found over west (e.g., Gambia and Niger) and South Africa (e.g., Zambezi), South America (e.g., Essequibo), North America (e.g., Koksoak and Missouri), central India (e.g., Narmada and Godavari), the north Tibetan Plateau, and the middle Yangtze River basin. Empirical Orthogonal Function decomposition is used to investigate spatiotemporal variations in the GRACE mascon solution-based TWS changes during the study period, showing a detailed pattern of increasing and decreasing long-term trends, interannual and seasonal variations in TWS over the global land surface.

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in aquatic carbon cycling. The chromophoric fraction of DOM (CDOM) can be readily detected via in situ and remotely-sensed optical measurements. DOM properties, including CDOM absorption coefficient at 412 nm (a(g)412) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were examined in Apalachicola Bay, a national estuarine research reserve located in the northeast Gulf of Mexico, using in situ and satellite observations during the spring and fall of 2015. Synoptic and accurate representation of estuarine-scale processes using satellite ocean color imagery necessitates the removal of atmospheric contribution (similar to 90%) to signals received by satellite sensors to successfully link to in situ observations. Three atmospheric correction schemes (e.g., Standard NIR correction, Iterative NIR correction, and SWIR correction) were tested first to find a suitable correction scheme for the VIIRS imagery in low to moderately turbid Apalachicola Bay. The iterative NIR correction performed well, and validation showed high correlation (R-2 = 0.95, N = 25) against in situ light measurements. A VIIRS-based CDOM algorithm was developed (R-2 = 0.87, N = 9) and validated (R-2 = 0.76, N = 20, RMSE = 0.29 m(-1)) against in situ observations. Subsequently, a(g)412 was used as a proxy of DOC in March (DOC = 1.08 + 0.94 x a(g)412, R-2 = 0.88, N = 13) and in November (DOC = 1.61 + 1.33 x a(g)412, R-2 = 0.83, N = 24) to derive DOC maps that provided synoptic views of DOC distribution, sources, and their transport to the coastal waters during the wet and dry seasons. The estimated DOC stocks were similar to 3.71 x 10(6) kg C in March and similar to 4.07 x 10(6) kg C in November over an area of similar to 560 km(2). Volume flux (out of the bay) almost doubled for March 24 (735 m(3) s(-1)) relative to November 4 (378 m(3) s(-1)). However, estimates of DOC fluxes exported out of the bay from model-derived currents and satellite-derived DOC were only marginally greater in March (0.163 x 10(6) kg C d(-1)) than in November (0.124 x 10(6) kg C d(-1)) and reflected greater DOC stocks in the fall. The combination of satellite-, field-, and model-based observations revealed the strong linkage between the Apalachicola River plume, a major source of DOM, and the overall hydrodynamic forcing that controlled distributions of CDOM abundance, DOC concentration, stocks, and fluxes in the bay.

In this work, a dataset of 34 TerraSAR-X StripMap images (October 2013-October 2014) has been processed by two PSI techniques- Coherent Pixel Technique-Temporal Sublook Coherence (CPT-TSC) and Small Baseline Subset (SBAS)- in order to study the evolution of a slow-moving landslide which occurred on February 23, 2012 in the Papanice hamlet (Crotone municipality, southern Italy) and induced by a significant rainfall event (185 mm in three days). The mass movement caused structural damage (buildings\' collapse), and destruction of utility lines (gas, water and electricity) and roads. The results showed analogous displacement rates (30-40 mm/yr along the Line of Sight- LOS-of the satellite) with respect to the pre-failure phase (2008-2010) analyzed in previous works. Both approaches allowed detect the landslide-affected area, however the higher density of targets identified by means of CPTTSC enabled to analyze in detail the slope behavior in order to design possible mitigation interventions. For this aim, a slope stability analysis has been carried out, considering the comparison between groundwater oscillations and time-series of displacement. Hence, the crucial role of the interaction between rainfall and groundwater level has been inferred for the landslide triggering. In conclusion, we showed that the integration of geotechnical and remote sensing approaches can be seen as the best practice to support stakeholders to design remedial works. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

It is challenging for users to determine which of these products is most accurate and best suited for their applications. Nine different SST analyses and two single sensor satellite products are compared with independent observations from Upper Temperature of the polar Oceans (UpTempO) buoys deployed in the Beaufort Sea in 2012 and 2013 during the Marginal Ice Zone Processes Experiment (MIZOPEX). The relative skill of the different SST products is evaluated using a combination of Taylor diagrams and two different verification scores that weight different statistical measures. Skill thresholds based on satellite accuracy requirements are chosen to map products with similar performance into three discrete skill categories: excellent, good, and poor. Results are presented for three subsets of the buoys corresponding to different regimes: coastal waters, northerly waters, and extreme weather. The presence of strong thermal gradients and cloudiness posed problems for the SST products, while in more homogeneous regions the performance was improved and more similar among products. The impact of variations in the ice mask between the SST products was mostly inconsequential. While the relative performance of the analyses varied with regime, overall, the best performing analyses for this region and period included the NOM Optimal Interpolation SST (OISST), the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) SST, and the Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) Multi-Product Ensemble (GMPE).

To date, processing of these massive data repositories has focused mostly on tracing forest growth and loss across very large areas within pre-defined study periods. Despite these very considerable advances, there is a need for methodology that could allow analysts to use their own specific land-cover categories of interest, and update existing land-cover classifications either forward or backward to a desired point in time. Here we demonstrate an algorithm (Bayesian Updating of Land-Cover, or BULC) developed for the continuous updating of land-cover classifications through time in large data sets. The BULC algorithm is designed to permit users to build new classifications or update existing classifications based on long streams of imagery, but with minimal storage and memory requirements. The algorithm ingests a sequence of classified land-cover data for a user-specified set of detectable classes, and maintains a continually updated estimate of land-cover probabilities and the most probable class at all time points along the sequence. We tested this algorithm in central Quebec with Landsat 8 imagery for summer 2013, when a series of large fires erupted and burned through forests. In this very dynamic setting, many of the summer\'s images were contaminated by ordinary standards, yet parts of the region could be seen through the clouds, smoke, and haze of each image. Across 11 dates of widely varying quality, BULC tracked the fires, ignored contaminated image information, and mapped fire borders consistently throughout the summer, autumn, and subsequent winter and spring. Building on images having a median accuracy of 78% and 8% NoData, the BULC algorithm created 11 sequenced land-cover maps each having more than 90% overall accuracy and covering the entire study area. BULC\'s classifications mapped each of the land-cover categories with user\'s and producer\'s accuracies that compared well to the best individual images used as input, while accurately tracking land-cover change that occurred between those infrequent clear images. As we leave remote sensing\'s data-poor era and enter a period with many images of Earth\'s surface supplied by multiple sensors over a short period of time, the BULC algorithm may help to sift through images of varying quality to extract the most useful information for mapping time series of land-cover classifications.

However, fire activity is expected to increase given the current rate of climate change, with uncertain outcomes. A fire impact that has not been widely addressed is the development of unburned islands; areas within the fire perimeter that do not burn. These areas function as critical ecological refugia for biota during or following wildfires, but they have been largely ignored in methodological studies of remote sensing assessing fire severity under the assumption that they will be detected by algorithms for delineating fire perimeters. Our objective was to develop a model for classifying unburned areas within wildfire perimeters using moderate resolution satellite (i.e., Landsat) and ancillary data. We performed field observations at locations that were unburned or lightly burned within the perimeters of 12 wildfires that burned in 2012 and 2014, and augmented this with field data previously acquired on another seven wildfires across the study region. We used randomForest and classification trees to separate burned from unburned locations with high overall classification accuracy (91.7% and 89.2%, for randomForest and classification tree methods respectively). Classification accuracy was significantly higher than the semi-automated classification products from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) program. After application of the most parsimonious and accurate classification tree model, we found that the average unburned proportion of the fires was 20% with high variability between fires (standard deviation: 16.4%). The total area of unburned islands in non-forested areas was significantly higher than the total unburned area in forested areas. Accurate detection and delineation of unburned areas is increasingly critical, as some of these unburned areas contain habitat (i.e., wildfire refugia) that are crucial for maintaining biodiversity and functioning of ecosystems, particularly given observed and projected anthropogenic climate change.

Conventional plant functional types (cPFTs) based on a few productivity-related traits have been previously used to simplify and represent major differences in global plant functions, but more recent research has directly focused on the use of functional trait information. Still, sampling limitations have constrained efforts to truly understand the variance and covariance of functional traits globally. Reflectance spectra offer a fast, repeatable, simultaneous measurement of a wide variety of leaf functional traits and could be used to optically define leaf functional types. To evaluate this concept, we measured leaf reflectance from a wide range of species in a diverse set of ecosystems across central and northern California, including observations from multiple individuals, sites, and seasons. Using principal components analysis, we analyzed spectral variation in relation to categorical attributes such as species and cPFTs, as well as to a set of functional trait metrics calculated from the spectra. We found the first three principal components (PCs) to be weakly related to categorical attributes and more strongly related to spectrally-derived functional metrics. Each PC was more strongly associated with different portions of the spectrum and contained different functional information. We applied a hybrid clustering algorithm to the PC coordinates of the observations to define potential optical leaf functional types. Twelve spectral clusters were identified, and these did not correspond directly to either single cPFTs or species. However, each cluster had a unique functional metric profile. Clusters represented both inter- and intra-species and cPFT functional differences driven by taxonomy, trait evolution and environmental responses, demonstrating their value as optical leaf functional types and the value of the clustering approach used here for defining optical types from leaf spectra. Our findings support the notion that cPFTs do not adequately capture differences in leaf function. They demonstrate that spectral measurements can be used to improve both the definition of PFTs as well as our knowledge regarding the covariance of functional traits within these classes.

Questions such as, how large is the representativeness error of surface measurements in the validation and how much of the product-measurement difference can be attributed to their inherent differing spatial scales, cast doubts on the suitability of this direct validation approach. In this paper, we will investigate and quantify the representativeness errors of point-scale ground-based measurements using the surface flux observation matrix from HiWATER (Li et al., 2013) and the solar radiation data retrieved from geostationary meteorological satellite (Huang, Li, Ma, & Li, 2016). The current study demonstrates that wildly fluctuating representativeness errors exist which are strongly contingent on the time and space scales of remote sensing products, as well as instant atmospheric conditions. For example, for an area of 5 x 5 km(2) 1.4-8.1% of representativeness errors are found from monthly to \"instantaneous\" timescales; while for an area of 1 degrees x 1 degrees grid 3.1-8.1% of representativeness errors are seen. Such scale-dependent representativeness errors offer some implications for validations of remote sensing products. On timescales longer than or equal to one day, representativeness errors do not need to be considered for validations of kilometer-level products, but on shorter timescales representativeness errors will affect the validation results to some extent. For instantaneous products with 5 km resolution, our study indicates over 13% of errors can be attributed to the inherent representativeness error, and 30-minute surface measurements are recommended for a routine validation. However, for validations of grid-level products, representativeness errors basically cannot be neglected regardless of timescales. The errors caused by the poor representativeness of surface sites, likely significantly contribute to the large differences between measurements and products. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, a hybrid phenology detection method is presented that incorporates the \"shape-model fitting\" concept of the two-step filtering method and a simulation concept of the crop models to detect the critical vegetative stages and reproductive stages of corn (Zea mays L.) and soybeans (Glycine max L.) from MODIS 250-m Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) time-series data and 1000-m Land Surface Temperature (LST) data. The method was first developed and tested at the field scale over a ten-year period (2003-2012) for three experimental study sites in eastern Nebraska of USA, where the estimated phenology dates were compared to the ground-based phenology observations for both corn and soybeans. The average root mean square error (RMSE) of phenology stage estimation of the individual development stages across all sites ranged from 1.9 to 43 days for corn and from 1.9 to 4.9 days for soybeans. The approach was then tested at a regional scale over eastern Nebraska and the state of Iowa to evaluate its ability to characterize the spatio-temporal variation of targeted corn and soybean phenology stage dates over a larger area. Quantitative regional assessments were conducted by comparing the estimated crop stage dates with crop developmental stage statistics reported by the USDA NASS Crop Progress Reports (NASS-CPR) for both eastern Nebraska and Iowa. The accuracy of the regional-scale phenology estimation in Iowa (RMSE ranged from 2.6 to 3.9 days for corn and from 3.2 to 3.9 days for soybeans) was slightly lower than in eastern Nebraska (RMSE ranged from 1.8 to 2.9 days for corn and from 1.7 to 2.9 days for soybeans), However, the estimation accuracy in Iowa was still reasonable with the estimated phenology dates being within 4 days or less of the observed dates for both corn and soybeans.

The commissioning phase ended in May 2010. Subsequently, the satellite has been in operation for over six years while the retrieval algorithms from Level 1 (L1) to Level 2 (L2) underwent significant evolutions as knowledge improved. Moreover, other approaches for retrieval at L2 over land were investigated while Level 3 (L3) and Level 4 (L4) were initiated. In this paper, these improvements were assessed by inter comparisons of the current L2 (V620) against the previous version (V551) and new products (using neural networks referred to as SMOS-NN) and 1.3 (referred to as SMOS-L3). In addition, a global evaluation of different SMOS soil moisture (SM) products (SMOS-L2, SMOS-L3, and SMOS-NN) was performed comparing products with those of model simulations and other satellites. Finally, all products were evaluated against in situ measurements of soil moisture (SM). To achieve such a goal a set of metrics to evaluate different satellite products are suggested.   The study demonstrated that the V620 shows a significant improvement (including those at L1 improving L2) with respect to the earlier version V551. Results also show that neural network based approaches can often yield excellent results over areas where other products are poor. Finally, global compa\'rison indicates that SMOS behaves very well when compared to other sensors/approaches and gives consistent results over all surfaces from very dry (African Sahel, Arizona), to wet (tropical rain forests). RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) is still an issue even though detection has been greatly improved through the significant reduction of RFI sources in several areas of the world. When compared to other satellite products, the analysis shows that SMOS achieves its expected goals and is globally consistent over different eco climate regions from low to high latitudes and throughout the seasons.

However, agricultural applications (irrigation, crop monitoring) and some hydrological applications (floods and modeling of small basins) require higher resolution SM information. In order to overcome this spatial mismatch, a disaggregation algorithm called Disaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale Change (DISPATCH) combines higher-resolution data from optical/thermal sensors with the SM retrieved from microwave sensors like SMOS, producing higher-resolution SM as the output. A DISPATCH-based processor has been implemented for the whole globe (emerged lands) in the Centre Aval de Traitement des Donnees SMOS (CATDS), the French data processing center for SMOS Level 3 products. This new CATDS Level-4 Disaggregation processor (C4DIS) generates SM maps at 1 km resolution. This paper provides an overview of the C4DIS architecture, algorithms and output products. Differences with the original DISPATCH prototype are explained and major processing parameters are presented. The C4DIS SM product is compared against L3 and in situ SM data during a one year period over the Murrumbidgee catchment and the Yanco area (Australia), and during a four and a half year period over the Little Washita and the Walnut Gulch watersheds (USA). The four validation areas represent highly contrasting climate regions with different landscape properties. According to this analysis, the C4DIS SM product improves the spatio-temporal correlation with in situ measurements in the semi-arid regions with substantial SM spatial variability mainly driven by precipitation and irrigation. In sub-humid regions like the Little Washita watershed, the performance of the algorithm is poor except for summer, as result of the weak moisture-evaporation coupling. Disaggregated products do not succeed to have and additional benefit in the Walnut Gulch watershed, which is also semi-arid but with well-drained soils that are likely to cancel the spatial contrast needed by DISPATCH. Although further validation studies are still needed to better assess the performance of DISPATCH in a range of surface and atmospheric conditions, the new C4DIS product is expected to provide satisfying results over regions having medium to high SM spatial variability.

This method was first introduced to reduce the noise level in a map of a given ocean variable provided that a higher-quality map of a second ocean variable is available. In this work, we go one step further in both the theoretical justification and the application of the multifractal fusion. In the first part of the paper we explore if the quality of the derived maps can be improved by using a higher-dimensional tensor relating the gradient of one variable with that of the other. Higher dimension tensors require the introduction of appropriate integration schemes to avoid inducing long-range artifacts, something that is not completely solved yet. The results show that although higher-dimension tensors lead to an improvement in the spatial consistency of the derived maps (i.e., a higher quality of the associated singularity exponents), the comparison with in situ data still show significant reconstruction errors as compared to the simplified scalar approach. In the second part of the paper we have used the scalar approach to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of the current Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Level 3 sea surface salinity (SSS) maps produced at the Barcelona Expert Center (BEC). As such, new daily SMOS SSS global maps are generated at a 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees grid resolution. The quality of the resulting products has been assessed using in-situ comparison, singularity analysis and power density spectra. It is concluded that the multifractal fusion can be used to significantly increase the spatial and temporal resolution of the SSS maps. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

All algorithms were compared with narrow band hyperspectral aircraft images. These images were subsequently upscaled spectrally and spatially to simulate 5 current and near future satellite imaging systems. Established and new Chl-a algorithms were then applied to the synthetic satellite images and compared to coincident surface observations of Chl-a collected from 44 sites within 1 h of aircraft acquisition of the imagery. We found several promising algorithm/satellite imager combinations for routine Chl-a estimation in smaller inland water bodies with operational and near-future satellite systems. The CI, MCI, FLH, NDCI, 2BDA and 3 BDA Chl-a algorithms worked well with CASI imagery. The NDCI, 2BDA, and 3BDA Chl-a algorithms worked well with simulated WorldView-2 and 3, Sentinel-2, and MERIS-like imagery. NDCI was the most widely applicable Chl-a algorithm with good performance for CASI, WorldView 2 and 3, Sentinel-2 and MERIS-like imagery and limited performance with MODIS imagery. A new fluorescence line height \"greenness\" algorithm yielded the best Chl-a estimates with simulated Landsat-8 imagery. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, they still do not apply well to close-range imaging spectroscopy, especially because directional effects are usually not taken into account. For this purpose, we introduce a physical approach to describe and simulate the variation in leaf reflectance observed at this scale. Two parameters are thus introduced to represent (1) specular reflection at the leaf surface and (2) local leaf orientation. The model, called COSINE (ClOse-range Spectral ImagiNg of lEaves), can be coupled with a directional-hemispherical reflectance model of leaf optical properties to relate the measured reflectance to the foliar content. In this study, we show that, when combining COSINE with the PROSPECT model, the overall PROCOSINE model allows for a robust submillimeter retrieval of foliar content based on numerical inversion and pseudo-bidirectional reflectance factor hyperspectral measurements.   The relevance of the added parameters is first shown through a sensitivity analysis performed in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) ranges. PROCOSINE is then validated based on VNIR and SWIR hyperspectral images of various leaf species exhibiting different surface properties. Introducing these two parameters within the inversion allows us to obtain accurate maps of PROSPECT parameters, e.g., the chlorophyll content in the VNIR range, and the equivalent water thickness and leaf mass per area in the SWIR range. Through the estimation of light incident angle, the PROCOSINE inversion also provides information on leaf orientation, which is a critical parameter in vegetation remote sensing.

Hake recruitment shows high interannual variability, yet the environmental and biological factors that influence reproduction are not fully understood. The increasing availability of ocean color data presents an opportunity to investigate a wide variety of fundamental topics including ocean primary productivity, climate change, and fisheries, among others. However, differences in the timing, length, and radiometer characteristics of the different missions result in a number of relatively short data records that are not suitable, individually, for the analysis of interdecadal changes. The combination of these datasets to produce longer time series of consistent data is essential for interpreting variability and trends in key parameters. We analyzed almost 5 years of high spatial resolution overlapping data from the SeaWiFS and MODIS Aqua sensors in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean to assess differences in chlorophyll concentration retrievals, estimate uncertainties, and develop corrections. Data from SeaWiFS (1997-2006) and corrected MODIS (2007-2015) were analyzed jointly as a >17-year time series of consistent and continuous chlorophyll concentration data, the longest record to date in the region. Trend analyses performed in the main spawning and nursery areas of M. hubbsi revealed significant increases in chlorophyll concentrations since 1997. The environmental factors likely influencing the observed changes and the potential implications for recruitment of M. hubbsi are discussed. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Large negative anomalies in backscatter are evident over the U.S. during the 2011 and 2012 growing seasons, coincident with two instances of severe drought. The backscatter anomalies were correlated with diminished growing season precipitation and with reduced crop yields reflecting where drought-induced impacts on above-ground biomass production occurred. During periods of acute drought, differences in diurnal backscatter were reduced and in some cases reversed reflecting diminished nocturnal leave rehydration. The results indicate that the C-band, VV-polarized ASCAT backscatter data is sensitive to interannual variability in agricultural productivity rather than soil moisture, and can offer an important geophysical monitoring tool capable of identifying and assessing drought-related vegetation responses independent of and complementary to satellite optical/near-infrared remote sensing data. This technique is flexible and adaptable, providing a capability to address region-specific needs. The twice-daily, weather independent and near-real time global monitoring capabilities of ASCAT and similar microwave instruments (e.g. RapidSCAT, Sentinel-1) can help improve drought preparedness and mitigation planning allowing improved water resource management for agriculture on the local as well as the state level.

To improve available regional information related to the coupled dynamics between these two land use types, we fused data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and stable nighttime lights observations from DMSP/OLS instruments to map fractional urban cover at 250 m spatial resolution for cities in Eastern, Central, and Southern China where recent urban expansion has been rapid and pronounced. To accomplish this, we constructed Random Forest regression models to estimate sub-pixel urban percentage for 2001 and 2010 using high quality calibration information derived from Landsat data. Separate models were built for temperate and tropical regions and then evaluated for nine cities between 18,000 and 31,000 km(2) in area. Urban area estimated from MODIS compared favorably with Landsat-based results, with mean absolute errors of similar to 9-15%. Tests of different input feature sets showed that including data from downscaled MODIS 500 m bands and nighttime lights can improve estimates of urban land area compared to using MODIS 250 m features alone. Based on these results we produced wall-to-wall maps of urban land use in 2001 and 2010 for four MODIS tiles covering temperate and subtropical China, thereby demonstrating the utility of coarse spatial resolution data for mapping urban land use and loss of agricultural land at regional and larger scales.

LiDAR-derived variables were significantly correlated with the similarity in community composition; the strongest correlation was with the canopy laser penetration rate down to 1-m height above ground (r(s) = 0.81, p < 0.001). The predictive model for similarity in community composition developed using the canopy laser penetration rate at 0-m height and the maximum height had R-adj(2) = 0.71 (p < 0.001). We applied this equation to the entire study area and compared the output with the human disturbance histories. A predictive map based on the equation suggested that the similarity in community composition changes in proportion to the degree of human disturbances. Our findings indicate that the similarity attributed to human disturbances in tropical forests can be predicted and monitored by means of airborne LiDAR. This approach could be combined with ground-based monitoring data to map the patterns of biodiversity in tropical rainforest. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

More specifically, images acquired during late fall and early winter are used for saltcedar identification as the plant\'s foliage turns a unique orange-yellow color (coloration) during this time of a year, which makes them easily distinguishable from other plant species. However, saltcedar coloration usually lasts for only several weeks, and the timing of this phenological event varies across space. Therefore, without prior knowledge of saltcedar phenology, it is often challenging to select the remote sensing image collected at the optimal time of the year to capture the distinctive spectral signature of the coloring saltcedar. Moreover, the timing of saltcedar coloration also varies within a single remote sensing scene making it inappropriate to use an entire scene as the mapping unit. In our study, we found that the timing of saltcedar peak coloration and leaf drop were linearly correlated with each other and we were able to model this relationship using the MODIS End of Season-Time (EoST) product and Landsat TM images. Guided by a per-pixel model estimation of saltcedar coloration date, we constructed composite Landsat images at two study sites along the Rio Grande River such that each pixel in the composite images was acquired during saltcedar peak coloration. Classification results showed that the phenology-informed composite image was better for saltcedar identification than the single scene image as it was able to capture the within-scene variations in saltcedar phenology. In addition, given our lack of training data for the model, the successful classification results obtained at the Middle Rio Grande River site also demonstrated the potential of our proposed method to be applied for large-scale saltcedar mapping.

We apply a forest reflectance model (FRT) to estimate the seasonal contribution of understow vegetation to forest reflectance from a time series of three Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) Hyperion images acquired in May, June and July. The reflectance simulations are based on detailed seasonal series of leaf area index and understory spectra measurements carried out in ten stands at the Hyytiala Forestry Field Station in Finland. Our results show that the contribution of understory to boreal forest reflectance is high in the visible domain, but it drops at the red edge and stays relatively low and constant in near infrared (NIR). Throughout the growing season, the contribution of the understory remains approximately the same in the NIR domain, whereas larger changes can be observed in the visible domain. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Limitations of optical data associated with non-uniform and temporally variable spectral signatures suggested investigating alternative approaches towards a more consistent and reliable detection of water bodies. Multi-year (2005-2012) observations of SAR backscattered intensities at moderate resolution from the Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) instrument were used in this study to generate an indicator of open permanent water bodies (SAR-WBI) for the year 2010 time frame and for all land surfaces excluding Antarctica and the Greenland ice sheet A first map of potential water bodies with a spatial resolution of 150 m was obtained with a global detection algorithm based on a set of thresholds applied to multi-temporal metrics of the SAR backscatter (temporal variability, TV, and minimum backscatter, MB). Local refinements were then used to reduce systematic commission and omission errors (4.6% of the total area mapped) due to the similarity of TV and MB over open water bodies and other land surface types primarily in cold and arid environments. The refinement rules are here explained by means of a detailed signature analysis of the SAR backscatter in such environments. The accuracy of the SAR-WBI was 80% when compared against 2078 manually interpreted footprints with a size of 150 x 150 m(2). Omission errors were primarily observed along coast- and shorelines whereas commission errors were associated with (i) ephemeral water bodies, (ii) seasonally inundated areas, and (iii) an incorrect choice of the local refinement.

However, burnt area records for many ecosystems are non-existent or incomplete, and those that are documented rarely include fire severity data. Retrospective analysis using satellite remote sensing data captured over extended periods can provide better estimates of fire history. This study aimed to assess the relationship between the Landsat differenced normalised burn ratio (dNBR) and field measured geometrically structured composite burn index (GeoCBI) for retrospective analysis of fire severity over a 23 year period in sclerophyll woodland and heath ecosystems. Further, we assessed for reduced dNBR fire severity classification accuracies associated with vegetation regrowth at increasing time between ignition and image capture. This was achieved by assessing four Landsat images captured at increasing time since ignition of the most recent burnt area. We found significant linear GeoCBI-dNBR relationships (R-2 = 0.81 and 0.71) for data collected across ecosystems and for Eucalyptus racemosa ecosystems, respectively. Non-significant and weak linear relationships were observed for heath and Melaleuca quinquenervia ecosystems, suggesting that GeoCBI-dNBR was not appropriate for fire severity classification in specific ecosystems. Therefore, retrospective fire severity was classified across ecosystems. Landsat images captured within similar to 30 days after fire events were minimally affected by post burn vegetation regrowth.

Algorithms were tested using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images and historical ground-truth observations collected from August 2002 to December 2011. A total of 2323 phytoplankton cell count samples collected by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) matched valid ocean color satellite observations over this period. Techniques were tested using the F-measure (FM) statistic. FM evaluates the proportion of image pixels that matches or misclassifies ground-based K. brevis observations. Several ocean color data products, such as normalized Fluorescence Line Height (nFLH), were also tested independently or combined to evaluate their effectiveness to detect K. brevis blooms. Techniques were optimized by altering their specific thresholds until the maximum FM was obtained. The historical techniques with the best performance were the Red Band Difference (RBD) and the R-rs-nFLH technique. This last method (R-rs-nFLH) is a combination of two standard ocean color data products: nFLH (>0.033 mW cm(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1) ) and the remote sensing reflectance at 555 nm (R(rs)555 <0.007 sr(-1)). Both techniques resulted in an FM of 0.62 and less than 3% false positives. The performance of most of the techniques improved significantly after optimization (the average FM increased from 0.47 to 0.57). The addition of a nFLH criterion improved the performance of most methods. We provide a list of recommendations on how to best apply the various techniques. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This transparency has been explained in the past 60 + years with the underwater visibility theory, the branch of the general visibility theory for visual ranging in water. However, through a thorough review of the physical processes involved in visual ranging in water, we show that this theory may not exactly represent the sighting of a Secchi disk by a human eye. Further, we update the Law of Contrast Reduction, a key concept in visibility theory, and develop a new theoretical model to interpret ZsD. Unlike the classical model that relies strongly on the beam attenuation coefficient, the new model relies only on the diffuse attenuation coefficient at a wavelength corresponding to the maximum transparency for such interpretations. This model is subsequently validated using a large (N = 338) dataset of independent measurements covering oceanic, coastal, and lake waters, with results showing excellent agreement (similar to 18% average absolute difference, R-2 = 0.96) between measured and theoretically predicted ZsD ranging from <1 m to >30 m without regional tuning of any model parameters. This study provides a more generalized view of visual ranging, and the mechanistic model is expected to significantly improve the current capacity in monitoring water transparency of the global aquatic environments via satellite remote sensing.

Deconstructing the role of these drivers at local scale is critical for managing the impact of projected climate and land use changes on savanna ecosystems. Focusing on an area encompassing Africa\'s largest terrestrial protected area, this study utilized time-series MODIS NDVI (2000-2014) and employed a robust trend analysis technique to detect significant temporal trend in key greenness metrics including overall greenness, peak and timing of the peak of annual greenness and examined how spatial variability in vegetation morphology and land use impacted the distribution of these greenness parameters. To access causation of change, we linked detected greenness trends to precipitation trends derived from Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM), annual burnt area extent and fire frequency and compared multi-temporal imagery in Google Earth. Results show that distribution of both overall and peak annual greenness was vegetation morphology specific as with decreasing woody cover the proportion of pixels showing negative overall and peak annual greenness trend increased consistently. Majority of the area with significant trend in the timing of the peak of annual greenness showed late greenup, implying changing phenological patterns. Trend analysis of TRMM derived mean annual precipitation showed no significant change in precipitation over the study period. At local scale, increase in overall and peak annual greenness was associated with woody plant encroachment due to increased moisture availability and reduced fire frequency due to construction of fire breaks in areas under farm/ranch land use. In protected areas, negative overall and peak annual greenness was driven by unmanaged high intensity mega fire events and outside due to anthropogenic land clearing for pastoral agriculture. These results further our understanding of the complex interaction of multiple ecological factors and resultant spatial variability in savanna inter-annual vegetation greenness patterns and are useful for implementing local scale management strategies.

However, its ability to accurately map forest AGB changes in high-biomass tropical forests has seldom been investigated. Here, we assess the ability of repeated LiDAR acquisitions to map AGB stocks and changes in an old-growth Neotropical forest of French Guiana. Using two similar aerial small-footprint LiDAR campaigns over a four year interval, spanning ca. 20 km(2), and concomitant ground sampling, we constructed a model relating median canopy height and AGB at a 0.25-ha and 1-ha resolution. This model had an error of 14% at a 1-ha resolution (RSE = 54.7 Mg ha(-1)) and of 23% at a 0.25-ha resolution (RSE = 865 Mg ha(-1)). This uncertainty is comparable with values previously reported in other tropical forests and confirms that aerial LiDAR is an efficient technology for AGB mapping in high-biomass tropical forests. Our map predicts a mean AGB of 340 Mg ha-1 within the landscape. We also created an AGB change map, and compared it with ground-based AGB change estimates. The correlation was weak but significant only at the 0.25-ha resolution. One interpretation is that large natural tree-fall gaps that drive AGB changes in a naturally regenerating forest can be picked up at fine spatial scale but are veiled at coarser spatial resolution. Overall, both field-based and LiDAR-based estimates did not reveal a detectable increase in AGB stock over the study period, a trend observed in almost all forest types of our study area. Small footprint LiDAR is a powerful tool to dissect the fine-scale variability of AGB and to detect the main ecological controls underpinning forest biomass variability both in space and time.

Our ability to project the role of vegetation carbon feedbacks on future climate critically depends upon our understanding of this tropical ecosystem, its tolerance to climate extremes and tipping points of ecosystem collapse. Satellite remote sensing is the only practical approach to obtain observational evidence of trends and changes across large regions of the Amazon forest; however, inferring these trends in the presence of high cloud cover fraction and aerosol concentrations has led to widely varying conclusions. Our study provides a simple and direct statistical analysis of a measurable change in daily and composite surface reflectance obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) based on the noise level of data and the number of available observations. Depending on time frame and data product chosen for analysis, changes in leaf area need to exceed up to 2 units leaf area per unit ground area (expressed as m(2) m(-2)) across much of the basin before these changes can be detected at a 95% confidence level with conventional approaches, roughly corresponding to a change in NDVI and EVI of about 25%. A potential way forward may be provided by advanced multi-angular techniques, such as the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction Algorithm (MAIAC), which allowed detection of changes of about 0.6-0.8 units in leaf area (2-6% change in NDVI) at the same confidence level. In our analysis, the use of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) did not improve accuracy of detectable change in leaf area but added a complicating sensitivity to the bidirectional reflectance, or view geometry effects.

Evacuations are used to manage both types of threat given situational information about fires and their behaviour. However, there has been limited documented use of objective remote sensing data to inform the decision-making process. We conduct a retrospective assessment of 41 smoke-related evacuations in Canada between 2000 and 2007 using smoke and cloud data from the Terra MODIS. Daily mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements were used to represent smoke levels in the area surrounding each evacuation site. Time series of these data were plotted for the four days prior to evacuation, the evacuation date, and the four days following the evacuation. Daily ADD values were scaled using the daily cloud mask to crudely account for the fact that heavy aerosol can be classified as cloud. Time series plots and the percentage differences between pre- and post-evacuation AOD were used to contextualize each evacuation. Out of 41 cases, approximately half met each of the criteria used to assess public health protection: (1) post-evacuation AOD values over the risk threshold for sensitive populations; (2) peak AOD exposures occurring post-evacuation; and (3) mean AOD higher post-evacuation than pre-evacuation. Some evacuations did not meet any of these criteria. Although evacuation decisions would never be made in the absence of situational intelligence, we conclude that systematic use of objective and readily available remote sensing data can help to retrospectively evaluate smoke-related evacuations, and may be useful for prospective, real-time application with further development.

This method calculates the LAD distribution from the contact frequency between the laser beams and leaves by tracing the laser beam paths. Multiple returns were used to capture the foliage distribution in the inner part of the crown. Each laser beam is traced from a location of the last return to the location of the first or intermediate return that is recorded immediately before the last return. We verified the estimation accuracy of the LAD distribution using terrestrial LiDAR data from single trees (Zelkova serrata and Cinnamomum camphora). The appropriate voxel size for representing the LAD distribution from the airborne LiDAR data was determined to be 1 m x 1 m x 0.5 m. The accuracy of the estimated LAD distribution for this voxel size was then examined while considering the number of airborne incident laser beams on the voxel (N) and the return type used. When only the first and single returns were used, the LAD was overestimated even for the voxels with large N. LAD was estimated as zero for most voxels with small N, although LAD was significantly overestimated for several voxels. We found that using the last and intermediate returns improved the LAD estimation accuracy even if N was the same. The mean LAD estimation error was 0.25-03 m(2)/m(3) for both species. Assigning different weights to the first and intermediate returns improved the accuracy slightly. Estimation error clearly corresponded to N, and N of 8-11 could be a criterion for an accurate LAD estimation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study is focused on analyzing VIIRS radiometric performance using well established calibration sites and through the inter-comparison with other satellite instruments such as AQUA MODIS and Landsat 8 OLI The paper analyzes stability of VIIRS reflective solar bands over more than two years by using sites such as Libya 4, Sudan 1 and Dome C. VIIRS absolute radiometric accuracy is quantified using AQUA MODIS over the above mentioned sites. For VIIRS band M11 (2.1 mu m), since there is no matching MODIS band pair, this study uses matching SWIR band from Landsat 8 OLI as a reference to quantify the absolute calibration accuracy of M11. The study shows that VIIRS moderate resolution reflective solar bands are stable with better than 0.5% for most of the bands with uncertainty on the order of 1%. After accounting the spectral differences, the absolute radiometric bias estimated through VIIRS and MODIS intercalibration is within 2% for bands M1-5 and M10 and about 3% for bands M7-8. Similarly, M11 bias estimated using VIIRS and OLI inter-comparison is 5.4%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Uprety, Sirish] Colorado State Univ, CIRA, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.

In an effort to better quantify the spatial variability and overall representativeness of single-point LST measurements being recorded at NOAA\'s Climate Reference Network (CRN) sites and to improve the accuracy of satellite LST measurements, airborne flight campaigns were conducted over a CRN site in Crossville, Tennessee, USA during 2010 to 2011. Multiple measurements of LST were made using infrared temperature sensors at micrometeorological tower sites and onboard an instrumented Piper Navajo airborne research aircraft. In addition to this, coincident LST products from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments (Collection 5), onboard NASA Terra and Aqua Earth Observing System satellites were used. In this paper the comparison of LST measurements made from multiple platforms are presented. Our study showed that the temporal and spatial variability of surface temperature as indicated by the standard deviation of the brightness temperature (T-b) during the flight periods were <1.7 degrees C. Aircraft and tower-based T-b during the flight periods agreed well with a root mean square error (RMSE) of <1.3 degrees C. The daytime MODIS LST was lower than the tower and aircraft-based LST, but higher than the daytime near surface air temperature (T-a). MODIS LST showed a positive and lower bias with the nighttime tower-based LST, but with slightly higher RMSE than the daytime dataset The MODIS LST showed better correlation with the tower-based LST than T-a during clear sky conditions due to the complex relationship between air and surface temperature. Including both day and nighttime data the MODIS LST showed a bias of -056 degrees C, RMSE of 2.84 degrees C, and standard deviations of the difference of 2.79 degrees C when compared to the mean tower-based LST at the site. Tower-based 11 explained 98% of the variance in LST during nighttime conditions with a bias of similar to 0.8 degrees C and RMSE of 0.86 degrees C. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

High SAR backscatter values (>-6 dB) suggest that an ice-dammed lake was present adjacent to the south coast of Petersen Bay from 1992 until 2005. Following a large calving event of the adjacent Petersen Ice Shelf (-8.07 km(2)) in August 2005, the lake drained through a region where the ice shelf had separated from the coastline. This loss of freshwater and replacement of lake ice with sea ice along the southern coast of Petersen Bay were confirmed from analyses of ice core samples and conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) profiles. The exception to this pattern was one distinct area where terrestrial streams entered the edge of Petersen Bay and freshwater continued to collect from 2006 to 2008. However, this ephemeral area of freshwater has not reformed since 2009 due to the persistence of open water events in Petersen Bay (observed in optical satellite imagery), which likely facilitated mixing of freshwater with sea water. Based on the continued break-ups of Petersen Ice Shelf and the frequency of open water events, it is unlikely that this ice-dammed lake will reform. The results of this study underscore the utility of SAR for reconstructing past hydrographic conditions in the water column below. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The data collected by the first spectrometer allow retrieval of VNIR reflectance, while the higher spectral resolution data from the second device permit estimation of vegetation Sun-Induced Fluorescence (SIF) in the O-2-A band. The instruments are constructed by assembling commercial and on-the-shelf optoelectronic devices to facilitate reproduction of the instrument for promoting measurements over different ecosystems. The instrument\'s optical design, data collection and processing, laboratory and in-field calibration methods are reported and discussed. The high spectral resolution and the rigorous calibration methods enable accurate estimation of SIF in physical units by exploiting almost the same retrieval concept as that of the European Space Agency FLuorescence EXplorer mission. The instruments have been operated in several field campaigns with the aim to show: i) the possibility of continuous and seasonal monitoring of plant growth and activity of an agricultural crop; and ii) the diverse and specific daily course patterns of different types of canopy.

Our algorithm combined temporal series of MERIS reflectances with thermal information from MODIS HS (hotspot) product. The algorithm included two-steps. Firstly, cumulative distribution functions were computed to discriminate the most clearly burned pixels using regionally-oriented near infrared reflectance thresholds. Secondly, a contextual criterion improved the spatial detection of the burned patches from the seed pixels. BA estimates for the three target years range from 3.6 to 3.8 million km(2). Results were validated from a statistically designed sample of fire perimeters generated from Landsat multi-temporal imagery. Intercomparison with existing BA products was also carried out. Results from global validation datasets provided an average overall accuracy higher than 0.95. The accuracy of the BA category was lower than the accuracy of the unburned one. Within the former, average omission and commission errors were lower for areas where the proportion of burned area was higher (for pixel-based error matrices, commission error (CE) was 0.52 and omission error (OE) was 0.51), than for those areas with very low BA proportion (CE = 0.60 and OE = 0.74). In terms of total BA estimation, errors were generally well balanced, with a tendency towards underestimation.(34%). Relevant impact of temporal reporting accuracy was found for these validation datasets. Intercomparison with other existing BA datasets pointed out similar spatial and temporal trends, with high correlation with GFED v4 BA estimations for the three years (r(2) > 0.974).

In the study, in-situ soil moisture measurements from three networks which represent different climatic and vegetation conditions over the Tibetan Plateau are used to evaluate the skill of seven remotely sensed soil moisture products and one reanalysis soil moisture product in the period of 2002-2012. The remotely sensed soil moisture products include three widely used products derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Earth Observing System (AMSR-E): the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) soil moisture product, the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) soil moisture product, and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) soil moisture product; the remaining products are the JAXA AMSR2 soil moisture product, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) soil moisture product, the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) soil moisture product, and the Essential Climate Variable (ECV) soil moisture product which is a new merged product using both active and passive soil moisture products. The reanalysis product is the latest ERA-Interim product produced by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The results show that all these products can generally capture the soil moisture dynamics well except for the NASA product which significantly underestimates the soil moisture and also lacks temporal dynamics. The JAXA AMSR-E and AMSR2 products underestimate the ground measurements at most of the time, whereas the LPRM product gives much larger seasonal amplitude than the in-situ observations with a large positive bias. It seems that the SMOS observations are severely affected by the well-known radio-frequency interference (RFI) which leads to a big noise and bias in the SMOS product. The ASCAT product overestimates the ground measurements, but it correlates with in-situ soil moisture very well and is also less influenced by vegetation cover. In general, the ECV and ERA products outperform other products. Though the ECV product underestimates the soil moisture, it shows the best correlation with ground measurements and captures the variation of in-situ soil moisture very well while the ERA product is closest to the absolute values of soil moisture observations. Overall, most of the products give reasonable results in terms of correlation in sparsely vegetated areas. We expect that the validation results can be used as a feedback to the algorithm developers to further enhance the accuracy of soil moisture retrievals over the Tibetan Plateau.

In this paper, we present how we combine passive microwave and thermal infrared data to estimate LST during summer snow-free periods over northern high latitudes. The methodology is based on the SSM/I-SSMIS 37 GHz measurements at both vertical and horizontal polarizations on a 25 km x 25 km grid size. LST is retrieved from brightness temperatures introducing an empirical linear relationship between emissivities at both polarizations as described in Royer and Poirier (2010). This relationship is calibrated at pixel scale, using cloud-free independent LST data from MODIS instruments. The SSM/I-SSMIS and MODIS data are synchronized by fitting a diurnal cycle model built on skin temperature reanalysis provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The resulting temperature dataset is provided at 25 km scale and at an hourly time step during the ten-year analysis period (2000-2011). This new product was locally evaluated at five experimental sites of the EU-PAGE21 project against air temperature measurements and meteorological model reanalysis, and compared to the MODIS LST product at both local and circumpolar scale. The results giving a mean RMSE of the order of 2.2 K demonstrate the usefulness of the microwave product, which is unaffected by clouds as opposed to thermal infrared products and offers a better resolution compared to model reanalysis.

The goal of the CCI is to generate and deliver data sets of various satellite-derived Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) in line with GCOS (Global Climate Observing System) requirements. The \"ECV Greenhouse Gases\" (ECV GHG) is the global distribution of important climate relevant gases - atmospheric CO2 and CH4 - with a quality sufficient to obtain information on regional CO2 and CH4 sources and sinks. Two satellite instruments deliver the main input data for GHG-CCI: SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT and TANSO-FTS/GOSAT. The first order priority goal of GHG-CCI is the further development of retrieval algorithms for near-surface-sensitive column-averaged dry air mole fractions of CO2 and CH4, denoted XCO2 and XCH4, to meet the demanding user requirements. GHG-CCI focuses on four core data products: XCO2 from SCIAMACHY and TANSO and XCH4 from the same two sensors. For each of the four core data products at least two candidate retrieval algorithms have been independently further developed and the corresponding data products have been quality-assessed and inter-compared. This activity is referred to as \"Round Robin\" (RR) activity within the CCI. The main goal of the RR was to identify for each of the four core products which algorithms should be used to generate the Climate Research Data Package (CRDP). The CRDP will essentially be the first version of the ECV GHG. This manuscript gives an overview of the GHG-CCI RR and related activities. This comprises the establishment of the user requirements, the improvement of the candidate retrieval algorithms and comparisons with ground-based observations and models. The manuscript summarizes the final RR algorithm selection decision and its justification. Comparison with ground-based Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) data indicates that the \"breakthrough\" single measurement precision requirement has been met for SCIAMACHY and TANSO XCO2 (<3 ppm) and TANSO XCH4 (<17 ppb). The achieved relative accuracy for XCH4 is 3-15 ppb for SCIAMACHY and 2-8 ppb for TANSO depending on algorithm and time period. Meeting the 0.5 ppm systematic error requirement for XCO2 remains a challenge: approximately 1 ppm has been achieved at the validation sites but also larger differences have been found in regions remote from TCCON. More research is needed to identify the causes for the observed differences. In this context GHG-CCI suggests taking advantage of the ensemble of existing data products, for example, via the EnseMble Median Algorithm (EMMA).

This paper proposes a support vector machine (SVM) method to estimate subsurface temperature anomaly (STA) in the Indian Ocean from a suite of satellite remote sensing measurements including sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA), sea surface height anomaly (SSHA), and sea surface salinity anomaly (SSSA). The SVM estimation of STA features the inclusion of in-situ Argo STA data for training and testing. SVM, one of the most popular machine learning methods, can well estimate the STA in the upper 1000 m of the Indian Ocean from satellite measurements of sea surface parameters (SSTA, SSHA and SSSA as input attributes for SVM). The results, based on the common SVM application of Support Vector Regression (SVR), were validated for accuracy and reliability using the Argo STA data Both MSE and r(2) for performance measures are improved after including SSSA for SVR (MSE decreased by 12% and r(2) increased by 11% on average). The results showed that SSSA, in addition to SSTA and SSHA, is a useful parameter that can help detect and describe the deeper ocean thermal structure, as well as improve the STA estimation accuracy. Moreover, our method can provide a useful technique for studying subsurface and deeper ocean thermal variability which has played an important role in recent global surface warming hiatus since 1998, from satellite measurements in large basin-wide scale.

For more accurate understanding of phytoplankton community structure and its implications for ocean color remote sensing applications, we investigated seasonal changes in phytoplankton pigments with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), hyperspectral absorption coefficients of detritus (a(d)(lambda)), phytoplankton (a(ph)(lambda)), and colored dissolved organic matter (a(CDOM)(lambda)), and hyperspectral a(ph)(X) derived from remote sensing reflectance (a(ph_Rrs-derived)(lambda)) in the coastal waters of Funka Bay from 2010 to 2012. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations measured by HPLC ranged from 029 to 8.6 mg m(-3). Phytoplankton community compositions, as estimated by chemotaxonomic analysis (CHEMTAX) based on HPLC phytoplanIcton pigments, showed a seasonal succession of diatoms, chlorophyll b-containing phytoplankton (chlorophytes and prasinophytes), and cyanobacteria. Additonally, to identify the dominant type of phytoplankton with an alternative technique to CHEMTAX analysis, we employed a derivative spectroscopy/similarity index (SI) approach for a(ph)(X) as an optical detection technique for discriminating between different types of phytoplankton. In particular for diatom-dominated stations, SI values relative to the second derivative spectra of a(ph)(lambda) of diatom cultures, isolated from our study region, were significantly higher than those for chlorophyll b-containing phytoplankton- and cyanobacteriadominated stations. Furthermore, we found a strong relationship between the SI values calculated from the second derivative spectra and the composition of diatoms as estimated by CHEMTAX. These results suggest that the two different methods validated each other\'s performance and precision in estimating relative diatom abundance from bulk samples and that it is possible to optically discriminate the dominance of diatoms using derivative spectra of a(ph)(lambda). We extended this combination approach to hyperspectral a(ph_Rrs_derived)(lambda), using a quasi-analytical algorithm within 400-546 nm range. We found a significant correlation between SI values obtained from the second derivative spectra of a(ph_Rrs-derived)(lambda)/a(ph_Rrs-derived)(443) and the composition of diatoms derived by CHEMTAX, but it was not as high as for a(ph)(lambda) measured by filter-pad analysis. These results indicate that using hyperspectral optical data of a(ph)(lambda) and R-rs(lambda) with derivative spectroscopy is potentially a promising approach to identify seasonal variability in the composition of diatoms in coastal waters. Furthermore, a hyperspectral approach in combination with CHEMTAX analysis as a reference for phytoplankton community structure has proven useful in improving our understanding of phytoplankton community structure in the coastal waters of Funka Bay.

To circumvent high uncertainty in single-date analyses of such areas, we propose to characterize them as dynamic cover types (DCTs), or sequences of wetland states and transitions informed by physically and ecologically plausible surface processes. This study delineated DCTs for one 2007-2008 flood cycle at Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater wetland in China, using spatial and temporal orientation modes of extended principal components analysis (EPCA) and supervised object-based classification of multi-spectral and radar image series. Classification accuracy was compared among three sets of attributes selected by machine-learning optimization from object-level mean and standard deviations of: 1) image time series alone; 2) the most informative EPCA outputs alone and 3) image time series and EPCA results together. Classification uncertainty was additionally assessed as low values of object\'s maximum class membership (<0.5). The highest accuracy was achieved with a larger set of 33 attributes selected from combined time series and EPCA results (overall accuracy 95.0%, kappa 0.94); however, accuracies with smaller sets of variables from input image series or EPCA results alone were comparably high (93.1% and 94.7%, respectively). All three selected attribute sets included standard deviations of image and/or EPCA values, suggesting the utility of object texture in dynamic class discrimination. The highest classification uncertainty was observed primarily along the mapped class boundaries, in some cases indicating minor change trajectories for which prior reference data were not available. Results indicate that DCTs provide a reasonable classification framework for complex and variable Poyang Lake wetlands that can be facilitated by EPCA transformation of complementary remote sensing time series. Future work should test this approach over multiple change cycles and assess sensitivity of results to temporal frequency of input image series, alternative variable selection algorithms and other remote sensors.

The mosaic with a pixel size of 100 m was used to determine iceberg size distributions around Antarctica, combining an automated detection with a visual control of all icebergs larger than 5 km(2) and correction of recognized false detections. For icebergs below 5 km(2) in size, the numbers of false detections and accuracies of size retrievals were analyzed for three test sites. Nearly 7000 icebergs with horizontal areas between 0.3 and 4717.7 km(2) were identified in a near-coastal zone of varying width between 20 and 300 km. The spatial distributions of icebergs around Antarctica were calculated for zonal segments of 20 degrees angular width and related to the types of the calving fronts in the respective section. Results reveal that regional variations of the size distributions cannot be neglected. The highest ice mass accumulations were found at positions of giant icebergs (>18.5 km) but also in front of ice shelves from which larger numbers of smaller icebergs calve almost continuously. Although the coastal oceanic zone covered by RAMP is too narrow compared to the spatial coverage needed for oceanographic research, this study nevertheless demonstrates the usefulness of SAR images for iceberg research and the need for repeated data acquisitions extending ocean-wards over distances of 500 km and more from the coast to monitor iceberg melt and disintegration and the related freshwater input into the ocean.

Methods for estimating photosynthesis (A) vary in their complexity and in which driving processes they capture. Whilst the effect of diffuse shortwave irradiance on A is well understood, few models have explicitly incorporated the diffuse effect into estimates of A. Here we present the DIFFUSE model, a simple, generic, diffuse-light-based method for estimating A at the monthly time scale. This model is based on the assumption that, at the monthly time scale, the majority of variability in A can be explained by the variability in total and diffuse irradiance and in the fraction of shortwave irradiance absorbed by foliage (f). Comparison of model estimates to eddy flux tower-derived monthly A showed that the majority (83%) of variability in observed A could be explained by the DIFFUSE model. The diffuse fraction contributed 5 to 10% of the model\'s accuracy across many of Australia\'s coastal regions, but contributed up to 50% in the monsoonal north. Various aspects of the DIFFUSE model were tested including its performance relative to an example of the more commonly used \"stress-scalar\" type of photosynthesis model. In all tests, the DIFFUSE model performed at least as well as more complex alternative models, and often outperformed them. The strengths of DIFFUSE are its physical basis, its simplicity and transparency, and its minimalist data requirements all of which are expected to make it useful to a wide variety of contexts and applications.

The available twenty interferometric pairs with good coherence selected from the ALOS/PALSAR imagery data covering the Longmen Shan mountainous area are used in the study. We have constructed a natural geodetic observation network with numerous scattered bare rocks emerging after the earthquake and coseismic landslide events, which are effectively recognized as the radar persistent scattering objects. The spatial connections between adjacent PS are established to form observation baselines with differential parameters related to topography and deformation, which are determined by the least squares method from time-series interferometric phase analysis. The post-seismic topographic change relative to the pre-seismic over the landslide area is spatially mapped from the PS network adjustment solution. The quantitative estimation of local elevation change, mass sliding volume and deposit thickness associated with the landslide is conducted. The spatial pattern of mass movement suggests that the giant landslide is characterized by a major sliding length of 4350 m along the NE-SW directions with an extension width of 3400 m along the Huangdongzi gully, and a peak height change of 535 m in the vertical direction. The affected area of landslide mass movement reaches 7.2 km(2) with the volume up to 1.28 billion m(3). The study also demonstrates the potential of persistent scatterer InSAR technique as an alternative to allow the quantitative measurement of mass wasting volume associated with earthquake-induced giant landslides.

To date, albedo satellite products have not been linked to extensive forest inventory data sets due to the lack of ground reference data. Here, we used comprehensive and detailed maps of forest inventory variables to couple forest structure and MODIS albedo products for both winter and summer conditions. We investigated how the relationships between forest variables and albedo change seasonally and along latitudinal gradients in the forest biomes of Finland between 60 degrees and 70 degrees N. We observed an increase in forest albedo with increasing latitude in winter but not in summer. Also, relationships between forest variables and the black-sky albedo or directional-hemispherical reflectance (DHR) at different latitudes were tighter in winter than in summer, especially for forest biomass. Summer albedo was only weakly correlated with the traditional inventory variables. Our findings suggest that the relationships between forest variables and DHR depend on latitude.

Monte Carlo (MC) simulations offer a practical, empirical method of accounting for potential map errors in broader ecosystem assessments. However, unless steps are taken across simulations to vary the probability density functions (PDFs) that control simulated map error, the large number of map units to which those PDFs are applied may cause convergence of mean simulated conditions and an artificial reduction of MC estimates of uncertainty. For MC simulation of errors in categorical maps, we introduce a technique we call \"PDF weaving\" which both: 1) allows variation of PDFs across simulations; and, 2) explicitly aligns the resulting range of simulated populations with estimates and uncertainties identified by traditional monitoring methods such as design-based inventories. This approach is based on solving systems of linear equations and inequalities for each simulation. Each system incorporates linear constraints related to the unchanging distribution of area among classes in the original map (akin to the fixed longitudinal \"warp\" on a loom) with variable linear constraints related to the class distribution to be simulated in any one iteration (analogous to the perpendicular, variable fibers of the \"weft\"). Additional constraints specify how many map units to treat as \"correct\" based on validation exercises at the map unit level. Solution of these systems provides PDFs which will simulate error at both the map unit level and the population level in a way that is consistent with validation exercises and available population-level estimates. We illustrated this approach in an assessment of the effects of wildfire and harvest on carbon storage over 20 years on a forested landscape in the western United States (US). This assessment utilized the Forest Carbon Management Framework (ForCaMF) approach, which is being implemented by the US National Forest System (NFS). Results showed that simulating map error through the use of dynamic PDFs can contribute significant, realistic uncertainty in a Monte Carlo analysis, but that impacts of fire and harvest on carbon storage may nevertheless be dearly identified and differentiated using remotely sensed maps of vegetation and disturbance.

Remote sensing estimation of LFMC often relies on an assumption of changing water and stable dry mass over time. Fundamental understanding of seasonal variation in plant water and dry mass is needed to explain the spectral expression of LFMC changes over time. We conducted a five-month experiment to continuously measure field LFMC samples, biochemical components of dry matter, and leaf spectroscopic data for two species common in the western U.S., lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon) and big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentate Nutt). Our results showed that new lodgepole pine needles initially had higher LFMC and a smaller proportion of dry mass, but differences between new and old needles converged as the new needles matured. New needle dry mass had strong temporal trends, and dry mass explained more variation in LFMC than water in both new and old needles. Sagebrush leaves exhibited decreasing trends in LFMC, but water and dry mass comparably contributed to LFMC seasonal variation. Spectroscopic analysis using partial least squares regression (PLSR) showed good modeling accuracy for LFMC temporal variation in new needles (R-2 = 0.94, RMSE = 5.84%), old needles (R-2 = 0.72, RMSE = 3.51%), and sagebrush (R-2 = 0.91, RMSE = 21.03%). Spectral variation in response to changing LFMC and dry mass was difficult to isolate from broader spectral trends due to chlorophyll absorption, leaf structure, water absorption, and co-varied biochemical components. Our results stress cautious spectral interpretation and wavelength selection for LFMC estimation in some species (e.g. lodgepole pine), since temporal changes in spectra may dominantly reflect temporal variation in dry mass, pigments, and/or structure rather than water content. Since new needles should have stronger spectral expression at the canopy scale, differing temporal trends in new and old lodgepole pine needles provides an additional complicating factor for remote monitoring of LFMC.

In situ OCR measurements are used in the development and validation of bio-optical models and vicarious calibration of satellite ocean-color sensors. It is thus crucial to obtain accurate in situ OCR measurements, which is a challenge, especially in regions subjected to adverse environmental conditions and where waters are optically complex. In the present work, the accuracy of in situ OCR is analyzed with data acquired in a wide range of bio-geographic provinces across the Southern Atlantic and Southeastern Pacific during the R/V Melville MV1102 cruise. Varied techniques employed to measure above-water remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) are inter-compared. Measured R is also compared with modeled R-rs in a closure experiment. The impact of R-rs uncertainties on the retrieval of chlorophyll a concentration (Chla) and inherent optical properties (IOPs) is evaluated using operational bio-optical algorithms. The relative percent difference (RPD) between R-rs measured by the various techniques ranged from 12 to 26% for the ocean-color bands (412-555 nm), and 3-12% for the ratios (412-510/555). A merged R-rs obtained by averaging the different types of measurements, INS, is recommended to reduce uncertainties. The coefficient of variation of INS and reflectance ratios was 11-13% and 3-5%, respectively. The RPD between INS and modeled R-rs and the corresponding ratios ranged from 18 to 34% and from 13 to 17%, respectively. Complete closure could not be obtained due to both measurement and modeling uncertainties. The impact of INS uncertainties on retrieved Chla and IOPs was generally smaller than the intrinsic errors of the inversion schemes. The results suggest that even though more accurate ocean-color radiometry is desirable, improving retrieval algorithms is essential to properly describing and furthering our understanding of bio-optical variability in the world\'s oceans.

In this article, we focus on high frequency SST variability induced by tidal currents in the Iroise Sea, west of Brittany (France). This region is known for its strong tidal currents that are responsible in summer for the generation of an intense thermal front, the Ushant front We use hourly MSG/SEVIRI derived SST to compute the displacements of this front In the northern part of the front, at 48.75 degrees N, we show that the longitudinal displacements of the front on subdiurnal time scales can be explained by the Lagrangian advection induced by surface currents.   We also present maps of surface currents computed from hourly SEVIRI derived SST data using the Maximum Cross Correlation (MCC) method. Comparison of SEVIRI derived velocities with velocities obtained with high frequency (HF) radar measurements and a hindcast numerical simulation (Mercator Ocean) gives encouraging results in the northern part of the Ushant front, near the Ushant Island. Within that region, the mean bias of the SEVIRI velocities was below 0.12 m.s(-1), with the standard deviation ranging from 0.26 ms(-1) during moderate tides to 0.49 m.s(-1) during spring tides. Further offshore, where the surface thermal structures are weaker and the SST more homogeneous, currents derived using the MCC method were overestimated by 0.3 m.s(-1) and showed larger error standard deviations.

A plot of the backscattering coefficient against particle area shows two distinct trends: one for particles with high mineral content and another for particles with low mineral content. Backscattering per unit particle area (effective backscattering efficiency, Q(bb)) shows a continuous non-linear dependence on the ratio of mineral to total suspended solids (MSS/TSS) over the range 0.35 < MSS/TSS < 0.91. The relationship can be represented by an exponential function: Q(bb) = 0.000087 exp(6.9 MSS/TSS), which explains 62% of the observed variance in backscattering efficiency. Changes in particle size have no significant influence on Q(bb). As the MSS/TSS ratio increases, the backscattering ratio (b(b)/b) also increases. The implication for the quantitative remote sensing of marine suspended sediments is that the mass specific backscattering coefficient, b(b)* depends on the particle area per unit mass multiplied by a function which depends on the mineral content of the particles.

One of the most basic classification tasks is to distinguish water bodies from dry land surfaces. Landsat imagery is among the most widely used sources of data in remote sensing of water resources; and although several techniques of surface water extraction using Landsat data are described in the literature, their application is constrained by low accuracy in various situations. Besides, with the use of techniques such as single band thresholding and two-band indices, identifying an appropriate threshold yielding the highest possible accuracy is a challenging and time consuming task, as threshold values vary with location and time of image acquisition. The purpose of this study was therefore to devise an index that consistently improves water extraction accuracy in the presence of various sorts of environmental noise and at the same time offers a stable threshold value. Thus we introduced a new Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) improving classification accuracy in areas that include shadow and dark surfaces that other classification methods often fail to classify correctly. We tested the accuracy and robustness of the new method using Landsat 5 TM images of several water bodies in Denmark, Switzerland, Ethiopia, South Africa and New Zealand. Kappa coefficient, omission and commission errors were calculated to evaluate accuracies. The performance of the classifier was compared with that of the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) classifiers. In four out of five test sites, classification accuracy of AWEI was significantly higher than that of MNDWI and ML (P-value < 0.01). AWEI improved accuracy by lessening commission and omission errors by 50% compared to those resulting from MNDWI and about 25% compared to ML classifiers. Besides, the new method was shown to have a fairly stable optimal threshold value. Therefore, AWEI can be used for extracting water with high accuracy, especially in mountainous areas where deep shadow caused by the terrain is an important source of classification error.

Recently C-band backscatter data were made available for altimeters on board the JASON-1 and JASON-2 satellites. In this paper we used experimental data from the same cruises to show that using the difference between the Ku-band and C-band signals to estimate sea surface roughness, and thus reducing the contribution from longer waves, improved the K estimates. This is consistent with the theory that gas transfer is largely controlled by short capillary-gravity waves. For satellite data closer than 2 hr and 0.5 degrees from the K sample stations, the dual-frequency parameterization is found to perform better than a wind speed parameterization that uses in situ wind speed. The improvement supports the hypothesis that gas transfer is more directly related to surface roughness than to surface wind. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The goal of this study was to compare hyperspectral narrowband (HNB) versus multispectral broadband (MBB) reflectance data in studying irrigated cropland characteristics of five leading world crops (cotton, wheat, maize, rice, and alfalfa) with the objectives of: 1. Modeling crop productivity, and 2. Discriminating crop types. HNB data were obtained from Hyperion hyperspectral imager and field ASD spectroradiometer, and MBB data were obtained from five broadband sensors: Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +), Advanced Land Imager (ALI), Indian Remote Sensing (IRS), IKONOS, and QuickBird. A large collection of field spectral and biophysical variables were gathered for the 5 crops in Central Asia throughout the growing seasons of 2006 and 2007. Overall, the HNB and hyperspectral vegetation index (HVI) crop biophysical models explained about 25% greater variability when compared with corresponding MBB models. Typically, 3 to 7 HNBs, in multiple linear regression models of a given crop variable, explained more than 93% of variability in crop models. The evaluation of X1 (400-2500 nm) versus X2 (400-2500 nm) plots of various crop biophysical variables showed that the best two-band normalized difference HVIs involved HNBs centered at: (i) 742 nm and 1175 nm (HVI742-1175), (ii) 1296 nm and 1054 nm (HVI1296-1054), (iii) 1225 nm and 697 nm (HVI1225-697), and (iv) 702 nm and 1104 nm (HVI702-1104). Among the most frequently occurring HNBs in various crop biophysical models, 74% were located in the 1051-2331 nm spectral range, followed by 10% in the moisture sensitive 970 nm, 6% in the red and red-edge (630-752 nm), and the remaining 10% distributed between blue (400-500 nm), green (501-600 nm), and NIR (760-900 nm). Discriminant models, used for discriminating 3 or 4 or 5 crop types, showed significantly higher accuracies when using HNBs (>90%) over MBBs data (varied between 45 and 84%). Finally, the study highlighted 29 HNBs of Hyperion that are optimal in the study of agricultural crops and potentially significant to the upcoming NASA HyspIRI mission. Determining optimal and redundant bands for a given application will help overcoming the Hughes\' phenomenon (or curse of high dimensionality of data).

We demonstrate a spatial modeling framework that integrates above-ground biomass transects, derived from plot-based field data and small-footprint discrete return LiDAR, with complete wall-to-wall spaceborne L-band and C-band SAR to predict biomass over a larger area. Transect intervals of 2000 m, 1000 m, and 500 m were tested. Co-kriging, regression kriging, and regression co-kriging were used to extend the LiDAR-derived biomass transects. LiDAR-derived above-ground biomass and L-band backscatter (HV polarization) were moderately correlated, with a maximum semivariance distance between the LiDAR-derived biomass and SAR data of 374 m. Regression kriging at a sample interval of 500 m showed the smallest root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) at 203.9 Mg ha(-1) and 131.6 Mg ha(-1), respectively. The mean error (ME) showed an average bias of -14.0 Mg ha(-1). Predictions using regression co-kriging at a sample interval of 2000 m resulted in the highest RMSE and MAE values at 2382 Mg ha(-1) and 164.6 Mg ha(-1), respectively. ME also was highest, averaging - 37.4 Mg ha(-1). Regardless of the spatial modeling technique employed, lower errors in predicted above-ground biomass were associated with smaller transect intervals. Moderate correlations between the LiDAR-derived above-ground biomass and the radar data impacted the predictive accuracy of the spatial models; however, overall variation in above-ground biomass in the study area was well represented. This study demonstrated that a sampling framework integrating LiDAR data with space-borne radar data using a spatial modeling approach can provide spatially-explicit above-ground biomass estimates for large areas. Such a sampling framework can be used in combination with ground plot and land cover data to assess carbon stocks under conditions where more common optical remote sensing approaches are difficult to implement.

MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) imagery and subsequent MODIS products provide near-daily global coverage and have transformed the ways we study and monitor the Earth. To monitor forest disturbance, it is necessary to be able to compare observations of the same place from different times, but this is a challenging task using MODIS data as observations from different days have varying view angles and pixel sizes, and cover slightly different areas. In this paper, we propose a method to fuse MODIS and Landsat data in a way that allows for near real-time monitoring of forest disturbance. The method is based on using Landsat time-series images to predict the next MODIS image, which forms a stable basis for comparison with new MODIS acquisitions. The predicted MODIS images represent what the surface should look like assuming no disturbance, and the difference in the spectral signatures between predicted and observed MODIS images becomes the \"signal\" used for detecting forest disturbance. The method was able to detect subpixel forest disturbance with a producer\'s accuracy of 81% and a user\'s accuracy of 90%. Patches of forest disturbance as small as 5 to 7 ha in size were detected on a daily basis. The encouraging results indicate that the presented fusion method holds promise for improving monitoring of forest disturbance in near real-time. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We used remotely sensed datasets and gridded population to estimate the magnitude of thermal differentials (urban heat islands and/or sinks), the timing of heat differential events, and the controlling variables. The global scope of the study provides a consistent analytical environment that enables identification of the key factors that contribute to deleterious heat differentials. We propose new indices of thermal differential and use them to show particular prevalence of heat islands and sinks in arid regions. A variable ranking analysis indicates that development intensity, vegetation amount and the size of the urban metropolis are the most important urban variables to predict heat differentials. Population was of lesser importance in this study. Urban structure indices were also ranked lower, though a different measurement scale qualifies this conclusion.

Other space-borne data sets (scatterometric wind, microwave sea surface temperature (SST), altimetric sea level, and surface currents) were used together with barrier layer thickness derived from Argo floats to investigate the variability of the oligotrophic zone and of its eastern and western boundaries, and to propose processes that could explain why surface chlorophyll is so low in this region. The eastern limit of the oligotrophic waters matches the eastern edge of the warm pool and moves zonally both at seasonal time scale and with the El Nino/La Nina phases whereas the western limit moves mostly at intraseasonal and interannual time scales. On average, about half of the surface of the zone is occupied by very oligotrophic waters (chl < 0.07 mg m(-3)) located in the eastern part. The degree of oligotrophy of the zone increases when its width is maximum during boreal fall and winter and during El Nino events. Oligotrophy in the eastern part of the warm pool most likely persists because of the lack of vertical or horizontal penetration of nutrient-rich water due to the following processes. 1/ The equatorial oligotrophic warm pool is bounded poleward by the oligotrophic subtropical gyres. 2/The deep nutrient pool prevents strong vertical nutrient inputs into the euphoric layer and the barrier layer above it potentially reduces the efficiency of mixing. 3/ During westerly wind events, mesotrophic waters in the far western basin are too distant from the oligotrophic zone to be efficient nutrient and phytoplankton sources, and become nutrient and phytoplankton depleted during their eastward advection. 4/ Nutrient-rich waters from the central basin and nutrient-poor surface waters of the warm pool do not blend because of subduction at the eastern limit of the oligotrophic zone.

Upwelling events are associated with changes in the magnitude and location of frontal structures. SST gradients from four different data sets, NCDC, REMSS, OSTIA, and MUR are compared in two test areas off the PCUS: Paita (5 degrees S) and Pisco (14 degrees S). In both areas gradients derived from the MUR data set show greater magnitudes, as well as larger seasonal cycles. Off Pisco, the magnitude of the seasonal cycle of 2.2 degrees C/100 km in MUR is larger than the one derived from the lower resolution data sets. All data sets at Pisco exhibit a seasonal cycle that peaks in late Austral summer and early fall. Hovmoller diagrams calculated at 5.5 degrees S, 10.5 degrees S, and 14.5 degrees S show clearly defined offshore maxima in the cross-shore gradients for all the data sets. Upwelling scales determined by the distance to the first maxima vary depending on the data set used. At 5.5 degrees S upwelling scales vary from 10 km for MUR to 50 km for NCDC At 14.5 degrees S the scales vary from 20 km for MUR to 40 km for OSTIA. All four data sets show similar large-scale structures associated with the Peruvian upwelling. However, MUR shows finer scale structures that are most likely due to submesoscale to mesoscale eddies. Sub-sampled MUR 1 km data at the 25 km, 9 km, and 4 km resolutions compare well in magnitude and phase with the lower resolution products. Agreement in gradient magnitude between the lower resolution data sets and the MUR sub-sampled at their respective resolutions implies that the pixel-to-pixel analysis noise in MUR is at a similar level as the other data sets.

Remote sensing instruments, such as lidar and radar provide a means of obtaining highly accurate and well resolved biomass estimates over global scales. This has sparked interest in mission concepts such as DESDynI. One of the core objectives of the proposed DESDynI mission was global carbon accounting and monitoring through a combination of lidar and radar measurements. In this article, the relationship between field biomass and lidar metrics is analyzed using data from coordinated field measurements and lidar overflights at the Harvard and Howland Forests in North-Eastern United States to assess the performance of a potential biomass mapping instrument. Results show that the performance of lidar estimates of biomass vary significantly between the two sites even though they belong to the same northern temperate forest ecoregion. An attempt is made to isolate the reasons behind the dissimilarities. While RMS errors as low as 30 tons/ha can be seen, these are limited to biomass ranges of up to 300 tons/ha.

There are many good methods for observing the dynamics of GV with optical remote sensing, but there are fewer good methods for observing the dynamics of NPV and soil. Given the difficulty of remotely deriving information on NPV and soil, the purpose of this study is to evaluate several methods for the retrieval of information on fractional cover of GV, NPV, and soil using 500-m MODIS nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) data. In particular, three spectral mixture analysis (SMA) techniques are evaluated: simple SMA, multiple-endmember SMA (MESMA), and relative SMA (RSMA). In situ cover data from agricultural fields in Southern Australia are used as the basis for comparison. RSMA provides an index of fractional cover of GV, NPV, and soil, so a method for converting these to absolute fractional cover estimates is also described and evaluated. All methods displayed statistically significant correlations with in situ data. All methods proved equally capable at predicting the dynamics of GV. MESMA predicted NPV dynamics best RSMA predicted dynamics of soil best The method for converting RSMA indices to fractional cover estimates provided estimates that were comparable to those provided by SMA and MESMA. Although it does not always provide the best estimates of ground component dynamics, this study shows that RSMA indices are useful indicators of GV, NPV, and soil cover. However, our results indicate that the choice of unmixing technique and its implementation ought to be application-specific, with particular emphasis on which ground cover retrieval requires the greatest accuracy and how much ancillary data is available to support the analysis.

While soil properties are not directly available from remote sensing data, they can potentially be inferred from linking these properties to observations that are readily available from satellite data, such as vegetation leaf area. We took advantage of the direct link that exists between above-ground productivity and maximum leaf area index (LAI(max)) to derive and map soil fertility (FR) and available soil water storage capacity (ASWC) at 1 km resolution across forested areas in western North America. Initially, we generated estimates of LAI(max) with a process-based growth model (3-PG), holding soil properties constant (FR=50% of maximum, ASWC=200 mm). To derive more realistic estimates of soil properties we inverted the model to infer FR and ASWC from iterative non-linear adjustments of the two soil properties so that model-predicted LAI(max) values corresponded closely with MODIS-derived observations. We parameterized 3-PG for the most widely distributed tree species in the region, Douglas-fir. The resulting maps were notably more detailed than those derived from the globally available Harmonized World Soil Database. Among 51, level III ecoregions, and the ranges in the two soil properties tended to increase in parallel with LAI(max). Further improvements in the approach are envisioned by combining MODIS and LiDAR observations to extend the range and accuracy of LAI(max) observations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In this research, a new method integrating the range dimension is presented for retrieving element clumping index using a unique series of images of gap probability (Pgap) with range from EVI. From these images, we identified connected gap components and found the approximate physical, rather than angular, size of connected gap component. We conducted trials at 30 plots within six conifer stands of varying height and stocking densities in the Sierra National Forest, CA. in August 2008. The element clumping index measurements retrieved from EVI Pgap image series for the hinge angle region are highly consistent (R-2 = 0.866) with those of hemispherical photos. Furthermore, the information contained in connected gap component size profiles does account for the difference between our method and gap-size distribution theory based method, suggesting a new perspective to measure element clumping index with EVI Pgap image series and also a potential advantage of three dimensional Lidar data for element clumping index retrieval. Therefore further exploration is required for better characterization of clumped condition from EVI Pgap image series. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Using NO2 observations at three ground stations representing urban, suburban, and rural environments, and tropospheric vertical column densities measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) over each site, we show that the observations from space represent monthly averaged ground-level pollutant conditions well (R = 0.86) under relatively cloud-free conditions. However, by analyzing the ground-level data and applying the OMI cloud fraction as a filter, we show there is a significant bias in long-term averaged NO2 as a result of removing the data during cloudy conditions. For the ground-based sites considered in this study, excluding observations on days when OMI-derived cloud fractions were greater than 0.2 causes 12:00-14:00 mean summer mixing ratios to be underestimated by 12% +/- 6%, 20% +/- 7%, and 40% +/- 10% on average (+/- 1 standard deviation) at the urban, suburban, and rural sites respectively. This bias was investigated in particular at the rural site, a region where pollutant transport is the main source of NO2, and where long-term observations of NOy were also available. Evidence of changing photochemical conditions and a correlation between clear skies and the transport of cleaner air masses play key roles in explaining the bias. The magnitude of a bias is expected to vary from site to site depending on meteorology and proximity to NOx sources, and decreases when longer averaging times of ground station data (e.g. 24-h) are used for the comparison.

Employing a near real-time processing system, NOAA will generate a series of Environmental Data Records (EDRs) from VIIRS data. For example, the VIIRS Land Surface Temperature (LST) EDR will estimate the surface skin temperature over all global land areas and provide key information for monitoring Earth surface energy and water fluxes. Because both VIIRS and its processing algorithms are new, NOAA is conducting a rigorous calibration and validation program to understand and improve product quality. This paper presents a new validation methodology to estimate the quantitative uncertainty in the LST EDR, and contribute to improving the retrieval algorithm. It employs a physically-based approach to scaling up point LST measurements currently made operationally at many field and weather stations around the world. The scaling method consists of the merging information collected at different spatial resolutions within a land surface model to fully characterize large area (km x km scale) satellite products. The approach can be used to explore scaling issues over terrestrial surfaces spanning a large range of climate regimes and land cover types, including forests and mixed vegetated areas. The methodology was tested successfully with NASA/MODIS data, indicating an absolute error for MODIS LST products of 2.0 K at a mixed agricultural site (Bondville, IL) when accounting for scaling, and higher than 3 K without scaling. The VIIRS LST EDR requires a 1.5 K measurement accuracy and 2.5 K measurement precision. Ultimately, this validation approach should lead to an accurate and continuously-assessed VIIRS LST product suitable to support weather forecast, hydrological applications, or climate studies. It is readily adaptable to other moderate resolution satellite systems. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The ability to estimate foliar N distributions across arid and semi-arid environments could help answer process-driven questions related to topics such as controls on canopy photosynthesis, the influence of N on carbon cycling behavior, nutrient pulse dynamics, and post-fire recovery. Our study determined that further exploration into estimating sagebrush canopy N concentrations from an airborne platform is warranted, despite remote sensing challenges inherent to open canopy systems. Hyperspectral data transformed using standard derivative analysis were capable of quantifying sagebrush canopy N concentrations using partial least squares (PLS) regression with an R-2 value of 0.72 and an R-2 predicted value of 0.42 (n = 35). Subsetting the dataset to minimize the influence of bare ground (n = 19) increased R-2 to 0.95 (R-2 predicted = 0.56). Ground-based estimates of canopy N using leaf mass per unit area measurements (LMA) yielded consistently better model fits than ground-based estimates of canopy N using cover and height measurements. The LMA approach is likely a method that could be extended to other semiarid shrublands. Overall, the results of this study are encouraging for future landscape scale N estimates and represent an important step in addressing the confounding influence of bare ground, which we found to be a major influence on predictions of sagebrush canopy N from an airborne platform.

One-hundred-five parallel profiling flight lines systematically spaced three km apart, totaling 8309 km, were acquired to measure forest canopy height and density across the 27,390 km(2) County. Two sampling/estimation strategies were investigated; both use profiling lidar data to augment field data collected as part of a systematic network of Norwegian National Forest Inventory (NFI) ground plots. The two strategies include (1) a model-dependent (MD), two-phase approach which permits calculation of sampling and model error, and (2) a model-assisted (MA), probability-based, two-stage approach which utilizes asymptotically design-unbiased estimators. The lidar-augmented survey results from these two sampling strategies were compared to NFI ground estimates for the County. The MD estimate (38.88 +/- 1.07 Mg ha(-1), one a) differs from the NFI ground estimate (37.64 +/- 0.94 Mg ha(-1)) by +1.24 Mg ha(-1) (+3.3%) and the MA (36.09 +/- 1.56 Mg ha(-1)) versus NFI difference is -1.55 Mg ha(-1) (-4.1%). As expected, as smaller geographical areas are considered, lidar-NFI differences increase, and at the individual cover class level, MD lidar-ground absolute differences average 3.1 Mg ha(-1) for the eight individual classes (8.2% of the County mean). The comparable MA lidar-ground average absolute difference for the individual cover classes is 4.3 Mg ha(-1) (11.4% of the County mean). For all of Hedmark, in general, the MD approach agreed most closely with NFI estimates. The standard errors (SE) generated using the MA approach were, in general, 2-3 times larger than the MD SEs for productive forest classes at the County level, though neither lidar sample was consistently more precise than the NFI ground estimates alone. For Hedmark County, the results indicate that profiling lidar surveys can provide estimates comparable to ground surveys but, at this particular juncture, the MD and MA estimators did not improve the precision of adequately designed (in terms of sample size), probability-based ground samples. However when smaller political units are considered, i.e., as estimates are made on smaller and smaller subunits within Hedmark County, in general, MD-SE < NFI-SE << MA-SE. Of the two designs considered in this study, the MD approach is most amenable to satellite lidar surveys since it does not require that profiling lidar satellite pulses intercept ground plots already established for a regional or national forest inventory. Direct comparisons of lidar and ground SEs are complicated by two factors: (1) the influence of treating both lidar and ground surveys as random samples when, in fact, they\'re systematic, and (2) by the two stage/phase structure of the lidar surveys versus the single stage structure of the NFI. These results should be viewed as preliminary, subject to validation using a Monte Carlo simulator.

Four different forms of regression modeling were applied to derive the highest possible prediction accuracy (correlation coefficient of R-2 = 0.83). Pine sapling regeneration 19 years after large-scale wildfires showed a high level of variability in patch density (ranging from 14/100 ha to 57/100 ha), whereas sapling density measured previously from the first decade following wildfire was more uniform (10/100 ha to 21/100 ha). The ecosystem-level dumpiness index showed major shifts in aggregation of different sapling density classes, and was consistent with an overall decrease in estimated sapling density of nearly 50% between 1998 and 2007.

According to current planning, meteorological satellites will maintain some of these observations over the next decade. They will also add some measurements of tropospheric climate-relevant gases. As their measurements are motivated by meeting operational meteorology needs, they fall short in meeting requirements for atmospheric chemistry applications.   Reliable long-term space-based monitoring of atmospheric constituents with quality attributes sufficient to serve atmospheric chemistry applications still needs to be established. The general framework for this kind of measurements, in synergy with ground-based and airborne measurements and integration with atmospheric models and data assimilation schemes, has been outlined in the IGOS-IGACO Theme Report (Barrie & Langen, 2004). Several other efforts have been made to identify the needs of long-term atmospheric composition data, such as   the GMES-GATO report (2004),   Report of the GMES atmospheric service (GAS) Implementation Group (GACS, 2009),   Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Implementation Plan (GCOS, 2010),   Report of the Protocol Monitoring for the GMES Service Element, Atmosphere Service (PROMOTE, 2009),   studies commissioned by EUMETSAT to identify requirements for geostationary platforms in the context of Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) (Lelieveld, 2003), and   the position paper of the EUMETSAT post-EPS Application Expert Group on atmospheric chemistry (Kelder et al., 2006).   An ESA study on \'Operational Atmospheric Chemistry Monitoring Missions (CAPACITY)\' (Kelder et al., 2007) had established comprehensive observational requirements by environmental theme, by user group, and by observational system (ground/satellite). The study assessed the contributions of existing missions to the fulfilment of these requirements and identified priorities of future observational capabilities for atmospheric composition. The ESA study on \'Observation Techniques and Mission Concepts for Atmospheric Chemistry\' (CAMELOT, Levelt et al., 2009) contributed to the definition of the space based monitoring capabilities of GMES for air quality protocol monitoring, air-quality near-real-time applications, and climate protocol monitoring in the time frame 2012-2020: The key objective of the CAMELOT study was to consolidate requirements at radiance level, i.e. Level-1, for the Sentinel-4 and -5 missions.   The need for space based atmospheric composition monitoring will be addressed by a variety of instruments. A significant contribution will be provided by the GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) Sentinel-4 and -5 systems where Sentinel-4 provides a geosynchronous component with a European focus and Sentinel-5 a low Earth orbiting component with global coverage. Sentinel-5p will bridge the gap between existing missions, i.e. Sciamachy on Envisat and OMI on EOS-Aura, and Sentinel-5. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

To achieve this, a numerically efficient retrieval approach for operational data processing is needed to derive CO column densities from shortwave infrared measurements in the 2.3 mu m band of the Sentinel 5 missions and its Precursor mission. The expected performance of both spectrometers will allow for clear-sky CO column retrievals over land with a precision of <= 10% and an overall accuracy of <= 15% even for background CO abundance and low surface reflection in the shortwave infrared spectral range. In this context, we present a new algorithm approach of the retrieval of CO from shortwave infrared measurements in clear sky and partially cloudy atmospheres over land and ocean surfaces. The algorithm employs simplified radiative transfer, where the model atmosphere is separated in a clear sky part, and a part which is bounded below by an elevated Lambertian reflector to account for atmospheric scattering by clouds and aerosols. Within the inversion scheme, Tikhonov regularization is used to determine, for each individual measurement, not only the vertically integrated CO column density and its retrieval error, but also the column averaging kernel. For the retrieval, a prior estimate of methane abundance is used to characterize the light path by retrieving effective cloud parameters from the shortwave infrared band itself. A performance analysis shows that, for a single cloud layer in the middle and lower troposphere, the bias on the CO retrieval due to the Lambertian cloud model is less than 2-3%. The effect of boundary layer aerosols can also be treated with similar accuracy. In contrast, the presence of elevated dust plumes above bright surfaces or a single layer cirrus cloud causes significant errors and, in these cases, a reasonably low retrieval bias can only be achieved for an optical depth in the shortwave infrared spectral range lower than 0.4. Another relevant error source for the CO retrieval algorithm is given by the prior uncertainty of methane. It is found that a 5% uncertainty in the methane column density causes biases of 3-9% on the retrieved CO column, depending on cloud fraction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The traditional method of mapping snow cover is binary where a pixel is considered either snow-covered or snow-free. Fractional snow cover (FSC) mapping can achieve a more precise estimate of areal snow cover extent by estimating the fraction of a pixel that is snow-covered. The most common snow fraction methods applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images have been spectral unmixing and an empirical Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI). Machine learning is an alternative for estimating FSC as artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been successfully used for estimating the subpixel abundances of other surfaces. The advantages of ANNs are that they can easily incorporate auxiliary information such as land cover type and are capable of learning nonlinear relationships between surface reflectance and snow fraction. ANNs are especially applicable to mapping snow cover extent in forested areas where spatial mixing of surface components is nonlinear. This study developed a multilayer feed-forward ANN trained through backpropagation to estimate FSC using MODIS surface reflectance, NDSI, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and land cover as inputs. The ANN was trained and validated with higher spatial-resolution FSC maps derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) binary snow cover maps. Testing of the network was accomplished over training and independent test areas. The developed network performed adequately with RMSE of 12% over training areas and slightly less accurately over the independent test scenes with RMSE of 14%. The developed ANN also compared favorably to the standard MODIS FSC product. The study also presents a comprehensive validation of the standard MODIS snow fraction product whose performance was found to be similar to that of the ANN. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The spaceborne ocean color sensors provide synoptic and regular radiometric data and can be used for applying environmental policies if the data is converted into relevant biogeochemical properties. We adapted and developed semi-analytical and empirical algorithms to estimate the Secchi depth from satellite ocean color data in both coastal and oceanic waters. The development of the algorithms is based on the use of a comprehensive in situ bio-optical dataset The algorithms are validated using an extensive set of coincident satellite estimates and in situ measurements of the Secchi depth (so-called matchups). More than 400 matchups are compiled for the MERIS, MODIS and SeaWiFS sensors. The comparison between Secchi depth retrievals from remote sensing data and in situ measurements yields determination coefficients (R-2) between 0.50 and 0.73, depending on the sensor and algorithm. The type II linear regression slopes and intercepts vary between 0.95 and 1.46, and between -0.8 and 6.2 in, respectively. While semi-analytical algorithms provide the most promising results on in situ data, the empirical one proves to be more robust on remote sensing data because it is less sensitive to error due to erroneous atmospheric corrections. Using ocean color archives, one can derive maps of ocean transparency for different areas.

Several AVHRR-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data sets exist, each based on the AVHRR Global Area Coverage archive but differing in their processing to correct for sensor and atmospheric effects. This paper presents a global comparative analysis for the land surface involving four AVHRR-derived NDVI data sets: (1) Pathfinder AVHRR Land (PAL); (2) Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS); (3) Land Long Term Data Record (LTDR) version 3 (V3); and (4) Fourier-Adjustment, Solar zenith angle corrected, Interpolated Reconstructed (FASIR). Our aims are two-fold: (1) to assess the level of agreement of the medians, trends, and variances, as well as the correlation between the four AVEIRR-NDVI data sets from 1982 to 1999; and (2) to independently assess the performance of each AVHRR-NDVI data set, and that of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI, using 11,764 Landsat samples of 20 x 20 km(2) located globally covering every major land-cover type. For the AVHRR-NDVI intercomparison equal medians, variance, and trends, and no correlation between all the respective AVHRR-NDVI data sets were found for 9.9%, 45.5%,48.1% and 38.4% of the total land surface, respectively (p >= 0.05). For the four AVHRR-NDVI data sets we found: (1) consistent trends for the tundra and particularly Australia; (2) inconsistent trends for Europe. Africa, and the Sahel; and (3) moderately consistent trends for the rest of the terrestrial land surface including North America and China. The PAL and LTDR V3 data sets lack calibration, as evidenced by the presence of apparent trends in desert areas. In the Landsat-NDVI vs. AVFIRR-NDVI comparison of absolute values the LTDR V3 data set performed best, whereas in the comparison of temporal-change values the GIMMS data set performed best. In both analyses MODIS-NDVI performed better than any AVHRR-NDVI data set The simple average of the four AVHRR-NDVI data sets produced better results than either AVHRR-NDVI data set alone, indicating that the errors between the data sets are at least partially unrelated. This research emphasizes the implications of AVHRR-NDVI data set choice for studies assessing the vegetation response to climate change and modeling of the terrestrial carbon balance.

The anisotropic nature of snow shows more variability in snow metamorphic processes for wavelengths beyond 1.0 mu m than in the visible spectrum. This behavior poses challenges for the development of a model that can retrieve broadband albedo from reflectance measurements throughout the snow season. In this paper, a semi-empirical model is presented to estimate near infrared (0.8-2.5 mu m) albedo of snow. This model estimates spectral albedo at a wavelength of 1.240 mu m using only three variables: solar zenith angle, scattering angle and measured reflectance, which is used to retrieve near infrared albedo. To form a base for such a model, quantification of reflectance patterns and variability in varying snow condition, i.e. snow grain size, and sun-sensor geometry are prerequisite. In this study the DIScrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (DISORT) model is used to simulate bi-directional reflectance. The performance of the developed model is evaluated by using DISORT simulated spectral albedo for various snow grain sizes and solar zenith angles, as well as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and in-situ measurements. The developed model is shown to be capable of estimating spectral albedo at 1.240 mu m with acceptable accuracy. The mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE) in the estimates are found to be 0.053, 0.055 and 0.064, respectively, fora wide range of sun-sensor geometries and snow grain sizes. The model shows better accuracy for spectral albedo estimates than for those computed using the Lambertian reflectance assumption for snow, reducing the error in the range and standard deviation by 75% and 65%, respectively. Applying the model to MODIS, the retrieved albedo is found to be in good quantitative agreement (r = 0.82) with in-situ measurements. These improvements in albedo estimation should allow more accurate use of remote sensing measurements in climate and hydrological models. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Malik, M.

The method exploits VHR panchromatic and HR multispectral satellite images, and was tested in a 9.4 km(2) area in Sicily, Italy, where on 1 October 2009 a high intensity rainfall event caused shallow landslides, soil erosion, and inundation. Pre-event and post-event images of the study area taken by the QuickBird satellite, and information on the location and type of landslides obtained in the field and through the interpretation of post-event aerial photographs, were used to construct and validate a set of terrain classification models. The models classify each image element (pixel) based on the probability that the pixel contains (or does not contain) a new rainfall induced landslide. To construct and validate the models, a procedure in five steps was adopted. First, the pre-event and the post-event images were pan-sharpened, ortho-rectified, co-registered, and corrected for atmospheric disturbance. Next, variables describing changes between the pre-event and the post-event images attributed to landslide occurrence were selected. Next, three classification models were calibrated in a training area using different multivariate statistical techniques. The calibrated models were then applied in a validation area using the same set of independent variables, and the same statistical techniques. Lastly, combined terrain classification models were prepared for the training and the validation areas. The performances of the models were evaluated using four-fold plots and receiver operating characteristic curves. The method proved capable of detecting and mapping the new rainfall induced landslides in the study area. We expect the method to be capable of detecting analogous shallow landslides caused by similar (rainfall) or different (e.g. earthquake) triggers, provided that the event slope failures leave discernable features captured by the post-event satellite images, and that the terrain information and satellite images are of adequate quality. The proposed method can facilitate the rapid production of accurate landslide event-inventory maps, and we expect that it will improve our ability to map landslides consistently over large areas. Application of the method will advance our ability to evaluate landslide hazards, and will foster our understanding of the evolution of landscapes shaped by mass-wasting processes.

Especially in tropical forests which store huge amounts of carbon, a precise quantification of aboveground biomass is of high relevance for REDD activities. This study investigates the potential of X- and L-band SAR data to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) in intact and degraded tropical forests in Central Kalimantan, Borneo, Indonesia. Based on forest inventory data, aboveground biomass was first estimated using LiDAR data. These results were then used to calibrate SAR backscatter images and to upscale the biomass estimates across large areas and ecosystems. This upscaling approach not only provided aboveground biomass estimates over the whole biomass range from woody regrowth to mature pristine forest but also revealed a spatial variation due to varying growth condition within specific forest types. Single and combined frequencies, as well as mono- and multi-temporal TerraSAR-X and ALOS PALSAR biomass estimation models were analyzed for the development of accurate biomass estimations. Regarding the single frequency analysis overall ALOS PALSAR backscatter is more sensitive to AGB than TerraSAR-X, especially in the higher biomass range (>100 t/ha). However, ALOS PALSAR results were less accurate in low biomass ranges due to a higher variance. The multi-temporal L- and X-band combined model achieved the best result and was therefore tested for its temporal and spatial transferability. The achieved accuracy for this model using nearly 400 independent validation points was r(2) = 0.53 with an RMSE of 79 t/ha. The model is valid up to 307 t/ha with an accuracy requirement of 50 t/ha and up to 614 t/ha with an accuracy requirement of 100 t/ha in flat terrain. The results demonstrate that direct biomass measurements based on the synergistic use of L- and X-band SAR can provide large-scale AGB estimations for tropical forests. In the context of REDD monitoring the results can be used for the assessment of the spatial distribution of the biomass, also indicating trends in high biomass ranges and the characterization of the spatial patterns in different forest types.

This study presents an analysis of the decadal time-scale changes in the relationship between a proxy for vegetation productivity (Sigma NDVI) and annual rainfall in the Sahel-Sudanian zone of Africa. The aim is to test the quality of data input and the usefulness of both the RUE approach and an alternative method for separating the effects on vegetation productivity of rainfall change and human impact. The analyses are based on earth observation of both rainfall (GPCP (Global Precipitation Climatology Project), 1982-2007 and RFE (Rainfall Estimate) (1996-2007)) and Sigma NDVI (AVHRR GIMMS NDVI dataset, 1982-2007). It is shown that the increase in Sigma NDVI has been substantial in the Sahel-Sudanian zone over the 1982-2007 period, whereas for the period 1996-2007 the pattern of Sigma NDVI trends is more complex. Also, trend analysis of annual rainfall from GPCP data (2.5 degrees resolution) and RFE data (0.1 degrees resolution) suggests that rainfall has increased over both periods. Further it is shown that RUE values are highly correlated to rainfall, undermining the use of earth observation (EO)-based RUE (using Sigma NDVI) as a means of separating rainfall impacts from other factors. An alternative method identify temporal trends in residuals of Sigma NDVI, after regressing it against annual rainfall, is tested, yet is shown to be useful only where a high correlation between Sigma NDVI and annual rainfall exists. For the areas in the Sahel-Sudanian zone for which this condition is fulfilled, trend analyses suggest very limited anthropogenic land degradation in the Sahel-Sudanian zone. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

It is based on an empirical analysis of collocated matchups of satellite and in situ measurements. The results of this Empirical Approach is compared to those of a Bio-optical Technique - taken from the published literature - and the Operational Method currently implemented by the NOAA Harmful Algal Bloom Forecasting System for K. brevis blooms. These three algorithms are evaluated using a multi-year MODIS data set (from July, 2002 to October, 2006) and a long-term in situ database. Matchup pairs, consisting of remotely-sensed ocean color parameters and near-coincident field measurements of K. brevis concentration, are used to assess the accuracy of the algorithms. Fair evaluation of the algorithms was only possible in the central west Florida shelf (i.e. between 25.75 degrees N and 28.25 degrees N) during the boreal Summer and Fall months (i.e. July to December) due to the availability of valid cloud-free matchups. Even though the predictive values of the three algorithms are similar, the statistical measure of success in red tide identification (defined as cell counts in excess of 1.5 x 10(4) cells L-1) varied considerably (sensitivity - Empirical: 86%; Bio-optical: 77%; Operational: 26%), as did their effectiveness in identifying non-bloom cases (specificity Empirical: 53%; Bio-optical: 65%; Operational: 84%). As the Operational Method had an elevated frequency of false-negative cases (i.e. presented low accuracy in detecting known red tides), and because of the considerable overlap between the optical characteristics of the red tide and non-bloom population, only the other two algorithms underwent a procedure for further inspecting possible detection improvements. Both optimized versions of the Empirical and Bio-optical algorithms performed similarly, being equally specific and sensitive (similar to 70% for both) and showing low levels of uncertainties (i.e. few cases of false-negatives and false-positives: similar to 30%) improved positive predictive values (similar to 60%) were also observed along with good negative predictive values (similar to 80%).

Past satellite image analyses have had difficulty in differentiating between no-till (NT) and minimal tillage (MT) conservation classes due to similarities in surface residues, and may have been restricted by the availability of cloud-free satellite imagery. This study hypothesized that the inclusion of high temporal data into the classification process would increase conservation tillage accuracy due to the added likelihood of capturing spectral changes in MT fields following a tillage disturbance. Classification accuracies were evaluated for Random Forest models based on 250-m and 500-m MODIS, 30-m Landsat, and 30-m synthetic reflectance values. Synthetic (30-m) data derived from the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) were evaluated because high frequency Landsat image sets are often unavailable within a cropping season due to cloud issues. Classification results from a five-date Landsat model were substantially better than those reported by previous classification tillage studies, with 94% total and >= 88% class producer\'s accuracies. Landsat-derived models based on individual image scenes (May through August) yielded poor MT classifications, but a monthly increase in accuracy illustrated the importance of temporal sampling for capturing regional tillage disturbance signatures. MODIS-based model accuracies (90% total; >= 82% class) were lower than in the five-date Landsat model, but were higher than previous image-based and survey-based tillage classification results. Almost all the STARFM prediction-based models had classification accuracies higher than, or comparable to, the MODIS-based results (>90% total; >= 84% class) but the resulting model accuracies were dependent on the MODIS/Landsat base pairs used to generate the STARFM predictions. Also evident within the STARFM prediction-based models was the ability for high frequency data series to compensate for degraded synthetic spectral values when classifying field-based tillage. The decision to use MODIS or STARFM-based data within conservation tillage analysis is likely situation dependent. A MODIS-based approach requires little data processing and could be more efficient for large-area mapping; however a STARFM-based analysis might be more appropriate in mixed-pixel situations that could potentially compromise classification accuracy.

The global sea level variability is dominated by eleven statistically significant and geographically robust principal modes at seasonal-to-decadal timescales. The identified modes can be divided into four regimes, i.e., the seasonal regime with two principal components at 3 and 6 months, the annual regime with a single 12-month component of global dominance, the interannual regime with seven principal components at 1.55, 1.74, 1.94, 2.34, 3.07, 4.20, and 5.40 years, as well as the decadal regime with a 9.28-year subdecadal component. The frequency dispersion of the identified modes is found to be at similar to 0% level for the annual regime, at similar to 5% level for the seasonal and interannual regimes, and at similar to 10% level for the decadal regime. In the space domain, the locations of principal modes are found to be geographically correlated. The seasonal regime is characterized by a small number of localized amplitude highs in regional seas. The annual regime is associated with major western boundary currents of the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio. For the interannual regime, mode active zones are observed in the western Pacific warm pool (WPWP), El Nino, and western Indian Ocean regions, among which the WPWP has a well-defined two-core structure, and the northern core coincides with the most energetic zone of the decadal regime. Another interesting finding is that east-west (zonal) and equatorial-extratropical (meridional) teleconnections are evident for the major signals in a rather symmetric and systematic pattern. Joint spatiotemporal analysis reveals that multi-modality at a given location and multi-regionality for a given mode are fundamental features in global sea level variability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Interactions of energy and surface materials on atomic and molecular levels result in specific absorption features that are diagnostic of mineralogy. Hyperspectral airborne sensors such as HyMap have sufficient spectral resolution to identify subtle features over narrow wavelength ranges. An anomalous zone of jarosite cement within the Jurassic Navajo Sandstone in southern Utah was identified with airborne hyperspectral data. To date no other locations of sulfate-rich cements such as this have been documented in the Navajo Sandstone. Here, we use multiple spectral analysis techniques over a micro to macro spatial continuum in order to focus our evaluation on the distribution and relative abundance of jarosite in this area. In this study, imaging spectroscopy is used to help determine the extent of the distribution of jarosite [KFe3(SO4)(2)(OH)(6)], at \"Mollie\'s Nipple\" (MN), a significant geomorphic landmark located within the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, in the Jurassic Navajo Sandstone of south central Utah. The extent of the jarosite across the butte is identified in this study by mapping two diagnostic absorption features, referred to as the similar to 2.26 mu m and near-infrared ferric iron absorption features (similar to 0.70-1.15 mu m), independently. This analysis shows that there is a single circular zone of abundant jarosite similar to 1 km in diameter that includes both in-situ and weathered out accumulations. Jarosite formation requires acidic and sulfate-rich fluids, which are unusual for the Navajo Sandstone. Imaging and field spectroscopy provides the spectral resolution needed to map and analyze the mineralogic characteristics of this area; characteristics that may help constrain the conditions under which this atypical butte formed.

The data collected include spectral normalized water-leaving radiance L-wn(lambda) and concentrations of suspended particulate matter-(SPM) and chlorophyll a (Chl-a). A strict spatio-temporal match-up method was adopted in view of the complexity and variability of the turbid coastal area, resulting in 13, 48 and 18 match-ups for MERIS L-wn(lambda), SPM and Chl-a estimates, respectively. For MERIS L-wn(lambda), the match-ups showed mean absolute percentage differences (APD) of 17%-20% in the 412, 443, 620 and 665 nm bands, whereas L-wn(lambda) at bands from 490 and 560 nm had better APD of 15-16%. The band ratio of L-wn(490) to L-wn(560) of the satellite data was in good agreement with in situ observations with an APD of 4%. MERIS SPM and Chl-a products overestimated the in situ values, with the APD of approximately 50% and 60%, respectively. When match-up criteria were relaxed, the assessment results degraded systematically. Hence, in turbid coastal areas where temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity of bio-optical properties may be pronounced as the result of terrestrial influences and local dynamics, the strict spatio-temporal match-up is recommended.

We modeled live, aboveground tree biomass using Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) field data and applied the models to 20+ year time-series of Landsat satellite imagery to derive trajectories of aboveground forest biomass for study locations in Arizona and Minnesota. We compared three statistical techniques (Reduced Major Axis regression, Gradient Nearest Neighbor imputation, and Random Forests regression trees) for modeling biomass to better understand how the choice of model type affected predictions of biomass dynamics. Models from each technique were applied across the 20+ year Landsat time-series to derive biomass trajectories, to which a curve-fitting algorithm was applied to leverage the temporal information contained within the time-series itself and to minimize error associated with exogenous effects such as biomass measurements, phenology, sun angle, and other sources. The effect of curve-fitting was an improvement in predictions of biomass change when validated against observed biomass change from repeat FIA inventories. Maps of biomass dynamics were integrated with maps depicting the location and timing of forest disturbance and regrowth to assess the biomass consequences of these processes over large areas and long time frames. The application of these techniques to a large sample of Landsat scenes across North America will facilitate spatial and temporal estimation of biomass dynamics associated with forest disturbance and regrowth, and aid in national-level estimates of biomass change in support of the North American Carbon Program.

To obtain this new index, the Hotspot-Dark-spot index (HDS) (Lacaze et al., 2002) was introduced. HIDS is calculated by the difference between the strongest vector (hotspot) and the weakest vector (dark-spot) of bi-directional reflectance, a given tract of vegetation returns in the reflecting solar position, and the geometric structure of the vegetation canopy, which are poorly represented by NDVI alone. The validity of NHVI was statistically tested using two field data sets of multi-angular observations and LAI from the boreal forests of Canada; one set was our own observations, and the other was from the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). The range of linear correspondence of NHVI with LAI is much wider than that of NDVI alone, indicating significant representation of leaf biomass in the canopy geometry captured by HIDS. With the technical innovation of multi-angular remote-sensing and kernel-driven models in the future, this index has the potential to provide a more accurate evaluation of regional and global LAIs.

A comprehensive validation of the aerosol products obtained from the ocean color missions SeaWiFS and MODIS is presented; it relies on the field observations collected at 85 AERONET sites and is completed by preliminary results obtained with the data of the maritime AERONET component. A robust match-up selection protocol yields approximately 7000 match-ups for each sensor. The median absolute relative difference for the aerosol optical thickness tau(a) increases from 20-22% at 443 nm to 45-48% in the near-infrared. The validation statistics are comparable for both sensors but MODIS results appear degraded particularly for sites located on isolated islands. The median absolute difference is approximately 0.03 at all wavelengths. Results are further analyzed for specific geographic regions or groups of sites selected to represent oceanic, continental, or desert dust conditions. Importantly, the match-up sets appear generally representative of the regional natural variability in tau(a) amplitude and spectral shape, with the notable exception of high tau(a) conditions that are excluded. An important finding is the underestimate by the atmospheric correction of the Angstrom exponent alpha with a median bias of -0.52. This underestimate is apparent even at low alpha values and regularly increases with alpha. This discrepancy in tau(a) spectral shape might result from an inappropriate set of candidate aerosol models and/or uncertainties in the calibration at the near-infrared bands. As the validation data base is expanded and updated in relation to new versions of the processing chains, this work provides a benchmark for the assessment of the aerosol products derived from the SeaWiFS and MODIS ocean color missions.

We compared these extents with glacier cover for the mid-1980s from high-altitude, aerial photography for British Columbia and from Landsat TM imagery for Alberta. A 25 m digital elevation model (DEM) helped to identify debris-covered ice and to split the glaciers into their respective drainage basins. The estimated mapping errors are 3-4% and arise primarily from seasonal snow cover. Glaciers in British Columbia and Alberta respectively lost - 10.8 +/- 3.8% and - 25.4% +/- 4.1% of their area over the period 1985-2005. The region-wide annual shrinkage rate of - 0.55% a(-1) is comparable to rates reported for other mountain ranges in the late twentieth century. Least glacierized mountain ranges with smaller glaciers lost the largest fraction of ice cover: the highest relative ice loss in British Columbia (-24.0 +/- 4.6%) occurred in the northern Interior Ranges, while glaciers in the northern Coast Mountains declined least (- 7.7 +/- 3.4%).

A simple simulation approach is then proposed. It is based on the aggregation in any viewing direction of 6 directional temperatures (sunlit/shaded walls/streets/roofs) weighted by their corresponding surface ratios within the scene viewed. The city is described by 18 canyon streets oriented in all directions by 10 degrees steps and the 6 temperatures are determined by integrating simulations of the energy balance model SOLENE repeated for the 18 canyon streets. The surface ratios are computed from images of the studied area generated with the POV-Ray software (Persistence of Vison Raytracer, http://www.povray.org/). This method is described in detail. The modelled anisotropy compares favourably with the measurements on all dates, despite a systematic underestimation ranging between 15 and 30%. The possible sources of discrepancy including sensitivity to the aspect ratio and to the surface parameters and possible impact of microscale structures are briefly discussed and several improvements of the modelling system are suggested.

Satellite imaging of stable anthropogenic lights from DMSP-OLS provides an accurate, economical, and straightforward way to map the global distribution of urban areas. To address problems in the thresholding methods that use empirical strategies or manual trial-and-error procedures, we proposed a support vector machine (SVM)-based region-growing algorithm to semi-automatically extract urban areas from DMSP-OLS and SPOT NDVI data. Several simple criteria were used to select SVM training sets of urban and non-urban pixels, and an iterative classification and training procedure was adopted to identify the urban pixels through region growing. The new method was validated using the extents of 25 Chinese cities, as classified by Landsat ETM + images, and then compared with two common thresholding methods. The results showed that the SVM-based algorithm could not only achieve comparable results to the local-optimized threshold method, but also avoid its tedious trial-and-error procedure, suggesting that the new method is an easy and simple alternative for extracting urban extent from DMSP-OLS and SPOT NDVI data.

These sensors provide consistent, frequent, and high density data to potentially complement ongoing Bay monitoring activities. We used the in situ Water Quality Monitoring Data set of the Chesapeake Bay Program to evaluate decade-long time-series of SeaWiFS and MCDIS-Aqua C-a retrievals in the Bay. The accuracy of the retrievals generally degraded with increasing latitude as the optical complexity increases northward. C-a derived using empirical (\"band ratio\") algorithms overestimated in situ measurements by 10-50 and 40-100% for SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua, respectively, but with limited variability. C-a derived using spectral-matching algorithms showed less bias for both sensors, but with significant variability and sensitivity to radiometric errors. Regionally-tuned empirical algorithms performed best throughout the Bay, offering a combination of reasonable accuracy and high spatial coverage. The radiometric spectral resolution used as input to the algorithms strongly influenced the quality of C-a retrievals from both sensors. These results establish a baseline quantification of algorithm and sensor performance in a variable and stressed ecosystem against which novel approaches might be compared. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, a new physically-driven algorithm, in which the detectable liquid water content is assumed constant, is proposed and assessed. All algorithms are also evaluated by analyzing their results during collapses of ice shelves. Two algorithms are selected for deriving updated trends of melting index (MI, the number of melting days times the area subject to melting) between 1979 and 2008 over the whole Antarctica and at sub-continental scales. In the first algorithm wet snow is identified when brightness temperature exceeds the mean of winter brightness temperature plus 30 K and the second is the new model-based approach described here. Both negative and positive MI trends are obtained, depending on the algorithm used. A high number of melting days (up to 100 days) are detected over the Wilkins ice shelf, the Peninsula and the George VI ice shelf. Over East Antarctica, the West and Amery ice shelves are subject to melting for a maximum of approximately 50 days. Positive trends of number of melting days are detected over most of the West Antarctica, with peak values up to 1.2 days/year over the Larsen C ice shelf, 1.8 days/ year over the George VI ice shelf and 0.55 days/year over the Wilkins ice shelf area. The correlation between MI values and December-January (DJ) averaged air/surface temperature over selected locations show values ranging between similar to 0.8 and similar to 0.4. Results suggest that a 1 degrees C increase in the monthly averaged DJ air/surface temperature corresponds to an average MI increase of approximately 2.10(6) x km(2) x day. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The Strait was generally a case 2 water body, transitioning from chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) dominant in the central region to possibly particulate dominant in Fraser River plume regions. Results showed that the OC3M algorithm was somewhat effective (R-2=0.550) outside the most turbid areas of the Fraser River plume. However, a systematic overestimation of lower chl concentrations was found, which may have been related to the higher CDOM absorption observed throughout the Strait. The standard GSM01 algorithm had moderately good agreement with measured CDOM absorption (R-2=0.593) and total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations (R-2=0.888), but was ineffective at estimating chl concentrations. Localized characterization of the CDOM absorption, through a hyperbolic CDOM model, improved the modified GSM01 results with slightly better agreement with measure CDOM absorption (R-2=0.614) and TSS concentrations (R-2=0.933). When the modified GSM01 algorithm was limited to regions with lower combined CDOM and non-algal particulate absorption (a(dg) (443)< 0.7 m(-1)), it was more effective then the OC3M algorithm at estimating chl concentrations. This suggests that a threshold value on the a(dg) (443) or b(bp) (443) estimated by the GSM01 algorithm may be beneficial for limiting turbidity influence on the algorithm. The further reinterpretation of phytoplankton absorption from the modified GSM01 algorithm with a two-component phytoplankton model resulted in a chl relationship with an R-2=0.677 and a linear slope closer to one.

Therefore, an airborne campaign was carried out in March 2006 using laser altimetry and photo imagery to validate sea ice elevation measurements derived from the Envisat/RA-2 microwave altimeter.   We present a comparative analysis of Envisat/RA-2 sea ice elevation processing with collocated airborne measurements collected north of the Canadian Archipelago. Consistent overall relationships between block-averaged airborne laser and Envisat elevations are found, over both leads and floes, along the full 1300 km aircraft track. The fine resolution of the airborne laser altimeter data is exploited to evaluate elevation variability within the RA-2 ground footprint. Our analysis shows good agreement between RA-2 derived sea ice elevations and those measured by airborne laser altimetry, particularly over refrozen leads where the overall mean difference is about I cm. Notwithstanding this small 1 cm mean difference. we identify a larger elevation uncertainty (of order 10 cm) associated with the uncertain location of dominant radar targets within the particular RA-2 footprint. Sources of measurement uncertainty or ambiguity are identified, and include snow accumulation, tracking noise, and the limited coverage of airborne measurements.

Specifically, we first developed a suite of environmental descriptors (productivity, land cover, and elevation). These descriptors were based on readily available data, including the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites and terrain data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). We then assessed the capacity of the environmental descriptors, using a decision tree approach, to estimate species richness of all breeding birds, and of groups of bird species based on habitat and nesting groupings, using data summarized from the Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas. Results indicated that the variance in the distributions of total bird species richness, as well as richness of habitat and nesting groups, were well predicted by the environmental descriptors (with variance explained ranging between 47 and 75%) with the predictions clearly related to both habitat (as modeled by land cover and land cover diversity) and vegetation productivity. Modeling demonstrates that initial partitioning is most often based on land cover class, indicating that it may be the driving variable of bird species richness; however, information on vegetation productivity and energy were then critical in defining how many species occur in each habitat type. The results indicate that remotely sensed environmental descriptors can provide an effective tool for predicting breeding bird species richness at regional scales. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

These models estimate and accumulate actual crop evapotranspiration, evaluating environmental conditions based on crop water requirements. Unlike seasonal rainfall totals, these models take into account the phenology of the crop, emphasizing conditions during the peak grain filling phase of crop growth. In this paper we describe an analogous metric of crop performance based on time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) imagery. A special temporal filter is used to screen for cloud contamination. Regional NDVI time series are then composited for cultivated areas, and adjusted temporally according to the timing of the rainy season. This adjustment standardizes the NDVI response vis-A-vis the expected phenological response of maize. A national time series index is then created by taking the cropped-area weighted average of the regional series. This national time series provides an effective summary of vegetation response in agricultural areas, and allows for the identification of NDVI green-up during grain filling. Onset-adjusted NDVI values following the grain filling period are well correlated with U.S. Department of Agriculture production figures, possess desirable linear characteristics, and perform better than more common indices such as maximum seasonal NDVI or seasonally averaged NDVI. Thus, just as appropriately calibrated crop water balance models can provide more information than seasonal rainfall totals, the appropriate agro-phenological filtering of NDVI can improve the utility and accuracy of space-based agricultural monitoring.

Many previously developed models are scale-dependent that need to be fitted and then applied both at the same scale or pixel size. The objective of this paper is to develop methods for scale-invariant estimation of forest biomass using lidar data. We proposed two scale-invariant models for biomass: a linear functional model and an equivalent nonlinear model that use lidar-derived canopy height distributions (CHD) and canopy height quantile functions (CHQ) as predictors, respectively. The two models are called functional regression models because the predictors CHD and CHQ are themselves functions or functional data. The model formulation was justified mathematically under moderate assumptions. We also created a fine-resolution biomass map by mapping individual tree component biomass in a temperate forest of eastern Texas with a lidar tree-delineation approach. The map was used as reference data to synthesize training and test datasets at multiple scales for validating the two scale-invariant models. Results suggest that the models can accurately predict biomass and yield consistent predictive performances across a variety of scales with an R-2 ranging from 0.80 to 0.95 (RMSE: from 14.3 Mg/ha to 33.7 Mg/ha) among all the fitted models. Results also show that a training data size of around 50 plots or less was enough to guarantee a good fitting of the linear functional model. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of CHD and CHQ as lidar metrics for estimating biomass as well as the capability of lidar for mapping biomass at a range of scales. The functional regression models of this study are useful for lidar-based forest inventory tasks where the analysis units vary in size and shape. They also hold promise for estimating other forest characteristics such as below-ground biomass, timber volume, crown fuel weight, and Leaf Area Index. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

A red-to-NIR band Chla retrieval algorithm proved to be applicable to Green Bay, but gave mostly negative values for Keweenaw Bay. An alternative algorithm could be based on Chla fluorescence, which in Keweenaw Bay was indicated by enhanced reflectance near 680 rum. Bands 7, 8 and 9 of the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) have been specifically designed to detect phytoplankton fluorescence in coastal waters. A quite strong linear relationship was found between Chla concentration and fluorescence line height (FLH) computed with these MERIS bands. The same relationship held for observations on oligotrophic waters elsewhere, but not for Green Bay, where the FLH diminished to become negative as Chla increased. The remote sensing application of the algorithms could be tested because a MERIS scene was acquired coinciding with the day of the field observations in Keweenaw Bay and one day after those in Green Bay. For Green Bay the pixel values from the red-to-NIR band algorithm compared well to the steep Chla gradient in situ. This result is very positive from the perspective of satellite use in monitoring eutrophic inland and coastal waters in many parts of the world. Implementation of the FLH relationship in the scene of Keweenaw Bay produced highly variable pixel values. The FLH in oligotrophic inland waters like Lake Superior appears to be very close to or below the MERIS detection limit. An empirical algorithm incorporating three MERIS bands in the blue-to-green spectral region might be used as an alternative, but its applicability to other regions and seasons remains to be verified. Moreover, none of the algorithms will be Suitable for mesotrophic water bodies. The results indicate that Chla mapping in oligotrophic and mesotrophic areas of the Great Lakes remains problematic for the current generation of satellite sensors. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

For estimation of phycocyanin concentration, a specific absorption coefficient of 0.0070 m(2) mg PC-1 for phycocyanin at 620 nm, a(PC)* (620), was employed, yielding an r(2) value of 0.85 (n=48, p<0.0001), mean relative residual value of 0.51 (sigma=1.41) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 19.54 ppb. Results suggest this algorithm could be a robust model for estimating phycocyanin. Error is highest in water with phycocyanin concentrations of less than 10 ppb and where phycocyanin abundance is low relative to chlorophyll a. A strong correlation between measured phycocyanin concentrations and biovolume measurements of cyanobacteria was also observed (r=0.89), while a weaker relationship (r=0.66) resulted between chlorophyll a concentration and cyanobacterial biovolume.

We investigated the magnitude and reasons for the differences in the anisotropy patterns of deciduous and coniferous stands at three backward viewing angles. A forest reflectance model (FRT) was used as a tool to provide a theoretical basis to the discussion, and to estimate the directional contribution of scattering from crowns and ground to total stand reflectance for the two forest types. The FRT model simulated successfully the HDRF (hemispherical-directional reflectance factor) curves of the study stands to match those obtained from the CHRIS image, yet it produced a smaller and less wavelength-dependent angular reflectance effect than was observed in the satellite image. The main results of this study provide new information for separating the spectral contribution of the forest floor (or understory layer) from the tree canopy layer: (1) the red edge domain was identified to have the largest contribution from forest understory, and (2) the more oblique the viewing angle, the smaller the contribution from the understory. In addition, coniferous stands were observed to have a specific angular effect at the red and red edge domain, possibly as a result of the hierarchical structure and arrangement of coniferous canopies.

We focus oil the Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta (CGSM) in Colombia, the largest coastal lagoon-delta ecosystem in the Caribbean area with an extension of 1280 kin 2, where one of the largest mangrove rehabilitation projects in Latin America is currently underway. Extensive man-made hydrological modifications in the region caused hypersaline soil (>90 g kg(-1)) conditions since the 1960s triggering a large dieback of mangrove wetlands (similar to 247 km(2)). In this paper, we describe a new systematic methodology to measure mangrove height and aboveground biomass by remote sensing. The method is based on SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) elevation data, ICEsat/GLAS waveforms (Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite/Geoscience Laser Altimeter System) and field data. Since the locations of the ICEsat and field datasets do not coincide, they are used independently to calibrate SRTM elevation and produce a map of mangrove canopy height. We compared height estimation methods based on waveform centroids and the canopy height profile (CHP). Linear relationships between ICEsat height estimates and SRTM elevation were derived. We found the centroid of the canopy waveform contribution (CWC) to be the best height estimator. The field data was used to estimate a SRTM canopy height bias (-1.3 m) and estimation error (rms = 1.9 m). The relationship was applied to the SRTM elevation data to produce a mangrove canopy height map. Finally, we used field data and published allometric equations to derive an empirical relationship between canopy height and biomass. This relationship was used to scale the mangrove height map and estimate aboveground biomass distribution for the entire CGSM. The mean mangrove canopy height in CGSM is 7.7 m and most of the biomass is concentrated in forests around 9 m in height. Our biomass maps will enable estimation of regeneration rates of mangrove forests under hydrological rehabilitation at large spatial scales over the next decades. They will also be used to assess how highly disturbed mangrove forests respond to increasing sea level rise under current global climate change scenarios. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

This method uses the near infrared (NIR) band to estimate the spatial distribution of haze intensity in each visible band through a linear regression model established over deep water areas. As a first order approximation, the signal received at the sensor is assumed to be the arithmetic sum of radiance contributed by haze and the radiance leaving the water surface. Reduction of haze is then carried out by a simple subtraction procedure. Images acquired over the Southern Tip of Palawan, Philippines are used for the experiments. Results show that the method works well for compensating signals contaminated by optically thin haze. Overcorrection occurs when haze is optically thick and geometrically complex. When images are acquired under hazy conditions the method can be applied to drastically improve image interpretability and may also be considered as a necessary pre-processing step for subsequent analyses and information extraction.

A high fidelity, bi-temporal airborne image data set was generated through frame-based image acquisition, precise image-to-image registration, radiometric normalization, and selection of near-anniversary image acquisition dates with similar precipitation conditions prior to both image acquisitions. Image segmentation and classification processes were applied to the bi-temporal layer stack of very high spatial resolution visible and near infrared (V/NIR) image data, such that shrub change objects were delineated and identified directly.   Image segments derived from the bi-temporal V/NIR image data set having I in spatial resolution delineated most shrub change features in a qualitatively realistic manner. A Standard Nearest Neighbor classifier with segment mean and standard deviation measures of Red, NIR, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) image features yielded the shrub change map that agreed more closely with reference data than the classifier based on fuzzy membership functions. The overall accuracy and kappa statistics for the optimal shrub change map were 0.83 and 0.64, respectively, with the predominant error being associated with \"over-classification\" of no-change objects as some type of shrub change. No statistical difference in accuracies of three- and five-class maps was found, suggesting that changes in true shrubs and sub-shrubs within coastal sage scrub vegetation communities can be differentiated reliably. A net 5% loss of shrub cover was determined for the 1998-2005 period from the shrub change map of the study area. The greatest decrease and net loss of shrub cover occurred within the urban edge zone and within flat-lying areas. Patterns of shrub loss appear to be more related to anthropogenic disturbance than effects of the severe seven-year drought that occurred between image acquisition dates. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This model is valid for five or more sensors. The model should prove useful to those wishing to assess the area-averaged performance of a soil moisture network.

Planning systems under development use plot-survey data to represent forest stands in large forest holdings which enables new flexible methods to model the forest and optimize selection of silvicultural treatments. In Sweden today, only averages of forest stand variables are used, and the survey methods used do not provide plot-survey data for all stands in large forest holdings. This is a task possibly solved using airborne laser scanner data. Various measures can be derived from laser data, each describing different forest variables, such as tree height distribution, vegetation density and vertical tree crown structure. Here, imputation of field plot (10 m radius) data using measures derived from airborne laser scanner data (TopEye) and optical image data (SPOT 5 HRG satellite sensor) were evaluated as a method to provide data for new long-term management planning systems. In addition to commonly applied measures, the semivariogram of laser measurements was evaluated as a new measure to extract spatial characteristics of the forest. The study used data from 870, 10 in radius field plots (0 to 812 m(3) ha(-1)) surveyed for a 1200 ha large forest estate in the south of Sweden. At the best, combining measures derived from laser scanner data and SPOT 5 data, stand mean volume was estimated with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 20% of the sample mean and stem density with 22% RMSE. Bias of stein density estimates was 5%, and stand stem volume 4%.

Hyperion data were acquired on 22nd July 2003 and water quality was assessed (i) defining a bio-optical model, (ii) converting the Hyperion atsensor radiances into subsurface irradiance reflectances, and (iii) adopting a bio-optical model inversion technique. The bio-optical model was parameterised using specific inherent optical properties of the lake and light field variables derived from a radiative transfer numerical model. A MODTRAN-based atmospheric correction code, complemented with an air/water interface correction was used to convert Hyperion at-sensor radiances into subsurface irradiance reflectance values. These reflectance values were comparable to in situ reflectance spectra measured during the Hyperion overpass, except at longer wavelengths (beyond 700 nm), where reflectance values were contaminated by severe atmospheric adjacency effects. Chlorophyll-a and tripton concentrations were retrieved by inverting two Hyperion bands selected using a sensitivity analysis applied to the bio-optical model. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the assessment of coloured dissolved organic matter was not achievable in this study due to the limited coloured dissolved organic matter concentration range of the lake, resulting in reflectance differences below the environmental measurement noise of Hyperion. The chlorophyll-a and tripton image-products were compared to in situ data collected during the Hyperion overpass, both by traditional sampling techniques (8 points) and by continuous flow-through systems (32 km). For chlorophyll-a the correlation coefficient between in situ point stations and Hyperion-inferred concentrations was 0.77 (data range from 1.30 to 2.16 mg m(-3)). The Hyperion-derived chlorophyll-a concentrations also match most of the flow-through transect data. For tripton, the validation was constrained by variable re-suspension phenomena. The correlation coefficient between in situ point stations and Hyperion-derived concentrations increased from 0.48 to 0.75 (data range from 0.95 to 2.13 g m(-3)) if the sampling data from the re-suspension zone was avoided. The comparison of Hyperionderived tripton concentrations and flow-through transect data exhibited a similar mismatch. The results of this research suggest further studies to address compatibilities of validation methods for water body features with a high rate of change, and to reduce the contamination by atmospheric adjacency effects on Hyperion data at longer wavelengths in Alpine environment. The transferability of the presented method to other sensors and the ability to assess water quality independent from in situ water quality data, suggest that management relevant applications for Lake Garda (and other subalpine lakes) could be supported by remote sensing.

However, only a few extensive or comparative \'studies about image processing techniques for invasive plant detection have been reported, and even fewer studies have involved very high spatial and spectral resolution imagery. The primary goal of this study was to investigate the utility of very high spatial (0.5 m) and spectral (4 nm) resolution imagery and several classification approaches for detecting tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) infestations, the most problematic invasive plant species in the riparian habitats of southern California.   Hierarchical clustering was a particularly effective and efficient statistical method for identifying wavebands and spectral transforms having the greatest discriminatory power. Products resulting from the classification of airborne hyperspectral image data varied by scene, input data type, classifier, and minimum patch size. Overall accuracy of image classification accuracy of products co-varied with commission error rates, such that products having strong agreement with reference data also had a high number of false detections. Integrating the findings from qualitative map analysis, areal proportion statistics, and object-based accuracy assessment indicates that the parallelepiped classifier with several narrow wavebands selected through hierarchical clustering yielded the most accurate and reliable tamarisk classification products.

In this paper, this new LAI product is compared with the global MODIS Collection 4 LAI product over four validation sites in North America. The accuracy of both LAI products is assessed against seven high resolution ETM+ LAI maps derived from field measurements in 2000, 2001, and 2003. Both products were closely matched outside growing season. The MODIS product tended to be more variable than the VGT product during the summer period when the LAI was maximum. VGT and ETM+ LAI maps agreed well at three out of the four sites. The median relative absolute error of the VGT LAI product varied from 24% to 75% at I km scale and it ranged from 34% to 88% for the MODIS LAI product. The importance of correcting field measurements for the clumping effect is illustrated at the deciduous broadleaf forest site (HARV). Inclusion of the sub-pixel land cover information improved the quality of LAI estimates for the prairie grassland KONZ site. Further improvement of the global VGT LAI product is suggested by production and inclusion of pixel-specific global foliage clumping index and forest background reflectance maps that would serve as an input into the VGT LAI algorithms.

While forest fires in North America (NA) have been surveyed extensively by U.S. and Canadian forest services, most fire records are limited to seasonal statistics without information on temporal evolution and spatial expansion. Such dynamic information is crucial for modeling fire emissions. Using the daily Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data archived from 1989 to 2000, an extensive and consistent fire product was developed across the entire NA forest regions on a daily basis at 1-km resolution. The product was generated following data calibration, geo-referencing, and the application of an active fire detection algorithm and a burned area mapping algorithm. The spatial-temporal variation of forest fire in NA is analyzed in terms of (1) annual and monthly patterns of fire occurrences in different eco-domains, (2) the influence of topographic factors (elevation zones, aspect classes, and slope classes), and (3) major forest types and eco-regions in NA. It was found that 1) among the 12 years analyzed, 1989 and 1995 were the most severe fire years in NA; 2) the majority of burning occurred during June-July and in low elevation zones (<500 m) with gentle slopes (<10 degrees), except in the dry eco-domain where more fires occurred in higher elevation zones (>2000 m); 3) most fires occurred in the polar ecodomain, sub-arctic eco-division, and in the taiga ( boreal forests), forest-tundras and open woodlands eco-provinces in the boreal forests of Canada. The tendency for multiple bums to occur increases with elevation and slope until about 2500 m elevation and 24 degrees slope, and decreases therefore. In comparison with ground observations, the omission and commission errors are on the order of 20%. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The approach for estimating proportional forest cover change as a continuous variable is based on a regression model that relates multispectral, multitemporal MODIS data, transformed to optimize the spectral detection of vegetation changes, to reference change data sets derived from a Landsat data record for a study site in Central America. A number of issues involved in model development are addressed here by exploring the spatial, spectral and temporal patterns of forest cover change as manifested in a time-series of multi-scale satellite imagery.   The analyses highlighted the distinct spectral change patterns from year-to-year in response to the possible land cover trajectories of forest clearing, regeneration and changes in climatic and land cover conditions. Spectral response in the MODIS Calibrated Radiances Swath data set followed more closely with the expected patterns of forest cover change than did the spectral response in the Gridded Surface Reflectance product. With forest cover change patterns relatively invariant to the spatial grain size of the analysis, the model results indicate that the best spectral metrics for detecting tropical forest clearing and regeneration are those that incorporate shortwave infrared information from the MODIS calibrated radiances data set at 500-m resolution, with errors ranging from 7.4 to 10.9% across the time periods of analysis.

The leaf radiative transfer model PROSPECT was linked to SAILH, rowMCRM, and FLIM canopy reflectance models to generate synthetic spectra for a range of leaf and canopy parameters under closed, row-structured, and forest canopy architectures, respectively. Leaf water content (C-w) and leaf area index (LAI) were used to calculate canopy water content. Leaf and canopy parameters that affect the retrieval of EWT, estimated by the MODTRAN-based fitting technique, were used to investigate their influence on the water content estimates. Results showed a consistent relationship between retrieved EWT and canopy water content for the different simulated architectural scenarios. It was shown that EWT was negatively affected by leaf dry matter and soil background. Retrievals of EWT from hyperspectral Advanced risible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery at three study sites were then used for cross-validation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data, assessing the behavior of NDVI, EVI, NDWI, and SIWSI as potential indicators of vegetation water content. All four NIODIS indexes showed consistent agreement with retrievals of EWT from AVIRIS imagery at the agricultural site and the savanna-shrub site, with EVI having the highest correlation. However, at the conifer forest study site the two water indexes, NDWI and SIWSI, yielded better agreement with retrievals of EWT than NDVI and EVI. The performance of NDVI was inconsistent across sites. This manuscript demonstrates the importance of canopy architecture when estimating EWT by showing that large errors are obtained when EWT estimates derived from absorption feature curve-fitting are applied to different canopy types. These errors are propagated in simple indexes that produce inconsistent results when applied to divergent vegetation conditions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we developed a simple grid-based soil water balance model. In this model, remotely sensed vegetation data are used to estimate spatial distributions of daily SWC and ETa rates. The model was validated by comparing simulated SWC with the measured by gravimetric method and time domain reflectometry (TDR) at an experimental test site located in Northeastern Germany in the time period 1993-1998. The index of agreement IA and the root-mean-square error obtained from the comparison of the TDR measurements to the simulated values ranged from 0.45 to 0.80 and from 0.029 to 0.061 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. The comparison of simulated ETa rates to those measured by four large-scale lysimeters at another test site showed IA values above 0.87 and R-2 values higher than 0.59. For the regional application of the model, a method was developed to integrate the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) vegetation data into the model. The MODIS data used in our study consist of 16-day normalized difference vegetation index and 8-day leaf area index products. Regarding the spatial application of the model, our approach was tested in a catchment located in Northeastern Germany in 2001-2003. A sufficient correlation between daily discharge rates measured at two observation gauges in the catchment and the corresponding simulated discharge rates and also good correlations between the simulated ETa rates and the MODIS-leaf area index values indicate that the model is an appropriate simulation tool at regional scale if the corresponding additional spatial databases regarding surface and soil properties are available.

The objective of this study was to compare several products derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to field measurements of fraction photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) and plant area index (PAI) for a deciduous broadleaf forest in northern Wisconsin in 2002. MODIS products captured the general phenological development of the canopy although MODIS products overestimated the leaf area during the overstory leaf out period. Field data suggest that the period from budburst to canopy maturity, or maximum PAI, occurred in 10 to 12 days while MODIS products predicted onset of greenness and maturity from 1 to 21 days and 0 to 19 days earlier than that from field observations, respectively. Temporal compositing of MODI S data and understory development are likely key factors explaining differences with field data. Maximum PAI estimates differed only by 7% between field derived and MODIS-based estimates of LAI. Implications for ecosystem modeling of carbon and water exchange and future research needs are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The method to estimate spatial variability of radiation components utilized theoretical radiation modeling applied to a topographic model combined with spatial distribution of leaf area index derived from IKONOS imagery and empirical models derived from data collected on a single flux tower. Modeled PAR and Q* compared consistently well with observations from a single tower with differences typically less than 10%, although clear-sky conditions were simulated more accurately than cloudy conditions. Spatial variability of radiation was found to be very sensitive to topographic relief and could be scaled linearly by mean slope angle. Decreases in optical transmissivity and increases in cloudiness had a strong effect of reducing both the spatial average and standard deviation of radiation components. Spatial variability of APAR was 53% greater than PAR and the characteristic scale of variance was reduced due to finer scale and magnitude of variance of LAI. Clear seasonal patterns existed in both spatial average and standard deviation values with summer producing the largest mean values and weakest spatial variability due to smaller solar zenith angles and seasonality in both optical transmissivity (scaled linearly by specific humidity) and cloudiness. These findings of spatial variability illustrate the need to characterize the complex landscape patterns at flux tower sites, particularly where the goal is to relate flux tower data to satellite imagery.

The algorithm is based on sun-photometer measurements with emphasis on polarimetric observations. At present, these polarized sun-photometer observations are mainly provided by PHOTONS network included in AERONET worldwide network. With ground-based measurement of direct sun irradiance, as well as total and polarized sky radiance, most of key characteristics of atmospheric aerosols are retrieved, including spectral single-scattering albedo from UV to NIR wavelength, elements of scattering matrix F-11 and -F-12 (i.e. phase function and polarized phase function), complex refractive index, and size distribution. These parameters are fundamentally valuable in atmospheric physical and chemical studies. The theoretical accuracy is assessed based on three distinct bimodal log-nori-nal aerosol models. The sensitivity studies to measurement uncertainties and to observing geometrical conditions are implemented to estimate the retrieval accuracy. Examples of typical retrievals when applying to real measurements are illustrated and compared with AERONET operational inversions. The particle shape-independent advantage of the retrieved single-scattering albedo, phase function, and polarized phase function is validated by considering a non-spherical aerosol model, which consisted of spheroid particles.

In wet conditions, the contribution of the soil, mulch, and vegetation to the overall microwave emission is difficult to decouple, thus rendering the retrieval of surface soil moisture from a direct emission model difficult. This paper investigates the development and assesses the performances of statistical regressions linking passive microwave measurements to surface soil moisture in order to assess the potential of soil moisture retrievals over natural grass. First, statistical regressions were analytically derived from the L-Band Emission of the Biosphere model (L-MEB). Single configuration (I angle, I polarisation), and multi-configuration regressions (2 angles, or 2 polarisations) were developed. Second, the performance of statistical regressions was evaluated under different rainfall interception conditions. For that purpose, a modified polatisation ratio at L-band was used to build three data sets with different interception levels. In the presence of interception, a regression based on one observation angle (50 degrees) and two polarisations was able to reduce the effects of vegetation and soil roughness on the soil moisture retrievals. The methodology presented in this study is also able to provide estimates of the vegetation and soil roughness contribution to the brightness temperature. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Thirty-nine field campaigns, each of duration of 3 days, were conducted over the Course of 2 years at a sand duties and a loess environment of the northwestern Negev desert in Israel, in order to relate the CO2 fluxes and the spectral signals to the seasonal phenology. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was derived from ground measurements of the BSC\'s reflectance and correlated with their CO2 exchange data. A linear mixture model, incorporating the different contributions of the sites\' ground features, was calculated and compared with SPOT-HRV data. From the ground measurements, fairly good correlations were found between the NDVI and the CO, fluxes oil a seasonal scale. Hence, the NDVI successfully indicates the potential magnitude and capacity of the BSC\'s assimilation activity. The linear mixture model Successfully describes the phenological cycles of the BSC, annual, and perennial plants and corresponds well to the satellite data. Moreover, the model enables annual changes of the phenology cycle and the growing season length to be distinguished. Both the linear mixture model and the derived NDVI values recorded the recovery of the BSC at the beginning of the wet season before annuals had germinated. Finally, it is concluded that a combination of CO, exchange measurements, linear mixture model, and NDVI values is suitable for monitoring BSC\'s productivity in and regions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

To reach this objective a straightforward model (C-Fix) was applied which is based on the relationship between photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by plant canopies and relevant gross primary productivity (GPP). The original C-Fix methodology was improved by using more abundant ancillary information and more efficient techniques for NDVI data processing. In particular, two extraction methods were applied to NDVI data, derived from two sensors (NOAA-AVHRR and SPOT-VGT) to feed C-Fix. The accuracy of the model outputs was assessed through comparison with annual and monthly values of forest GPP derived from eight eddy covariance flux towers. The results obtained indicated the superiority of SPOT-VGT over NOAA-AVHRR data and a higher efficiency of the more advanced NDVI extraction method. Globally, the procedure was proved to be of easy and objective implementation and allowed the evaluation of mean productivity levels of existing forests on the national scale. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

This article details how field knowledge of the spectral properties of Sphagnum spp., airborne remote sensing data and a range of image analysis approaches, may be combined to provide a suitable proxy for near-surface wetness. Co-incident field and airborne remote sensing data were acquired in May and September 2002 over an important UK raised bog (Cors Fochno). A combination of laboratory-tested NIR and SWIR water-based and biophysical spectral reflectance indices were applied to field and airborne reflectance spectra of Sphagnum pulchrum to elucidate changes in near-surface moisture conditions. Field results showed significant correlations between water-based indices (moisture stress index (MSI) and floating water band indices (fWBI(980) and fWBI(1200)))) and measures of both near-surface volumetric moisture content (VMC) and water-table position. Spectral indices formulated from the NIR (fWBI(980) and fWBI(1200)) proved to be the most useful for indicating near-surface wetness across the widest range of moisture conditions because of their ability to penetrate deeper into the Sphagnum canopy. Correlations between a biophysical index based upon chlorophyll content and both hydrological measures were not significant, possibly due to relatively high levels of surface wetness at the field site in both May and September. S. pulchrum lawns were successfully located and mapped from airborne imagery using the mixed tuned match filtering (MTMF) algorithm. Importantly, MSI derived from airborne data was significantly correlated with both field moisture and the water-table position. Relationships between measures of near-surface wetness and the MSI for naturally heterogeneous canopies were, however, found to be weaker for airborne imagery than for associated field data. This is likely to be a result of the formulation of the MSI itself and the possible preferential detection of \"wetter\" pixels within the imagery. This effectively reduced the ability of MSI to detect subtle changes in near-surface wetness under high moisture conditions, but would not impede the use of the index under drier conditions. Results from the field data suggest that indices formulated from the NIR may be more suitable for detailed estimations of near-surface and surface wetness at the landscape-scale although reliable hyperspectral data are required to test fully the performance of such indices. The relative merits of using such an approach to determine near-surface hydrological conditions across entire peatland complexes are also discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The dynamics of these marshes can be quantified and mapped using the high vertical and horizontal point density of airborne laser scanners (lidar) if their data quality is adequate. We evaluated lidar\'s ability to characterize wetland topography and vegetation structure, with emphasis on measuring short-term changes associated with the invasive Spartina. Measurable errors between flight lines and between laser returns were observed. By comparing lidar datasets with ground measurements we found that lidar did not reach the ground underneath vegetation. Nonetheless, change detection using digital surface models showed that Spartina markedly affected the accretion - erosion patterns of the shoreline and the water drainage patterns on the mudflat. With some exceptions, Spartina patches showed evident expansion patterns with rates of up to 2.5 m/year. Our study indicates that lidar has a great potential to discriminate Spartina species and marsh components, and to quantify sediment dynamics associated with the Spartina invasion, and changes in Spartina structure and biomass.

Microphytobenthos is a microalgae forming a biofilm on the mudflat. Its spatial distribution is heterogeneous so it varies on a finer scale than that of airborne instrument spatial resolution, leading to a \"mixed pixel\" problem. Moreover, some microphytobenthic species form, at low tide, a biofilm deposited at the surface of the sediment substrate. The resulting signal is a highly non-linear combination of spectral endmembers due to microscale intimate mixtures. This prevents the use of classical linear unmixing models to retrieve biomass from reflectance spectra. A Modified Gaussian Model (MGM) is therefore used to remove the effects of surface roughness, shadowing and any other unknown processes that contribute to the overall shape (continuum) of the reflectance spectra. Then, relationships between microphytobenthos biomass and spectral shapes are derived from a spectral database compiled from laboratory reflectance spectra of microalgal monospecific cultures with different biomasses. Finally, microphytobenthos biomass and fractional cover are retrieved from the DAIS image by comparing the reflectance spectra of each pixel to a library of synthetic spectra corresponding to combinations of various biomasses and substrate percent cover.

The study was conducted in Iowa, USA as part of the Soil Moisture Experiments 2002 (SMEX02). Due to the moderate resolution of MODIS data, the removal of mixed pixels was important in order to meet accuracy estimation requirements of potential applications. MODIS-derived reflectance for the NIR and SWIR bands over corn and soybeans fields was validated using atmospherically corrected Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) data. All possible combinations of the 7 MODIS bands were used to construct VIs. The performance of each combination was evaluated by computing their correlations with corn VWC. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) were found to be the best candidates. In this study, it was observed that the MODIS SWIR-based VI for corn saturated at a later date than NDVI. A similar late saturation was observed for soybeans with a lag of about 10 days. Linear relationships between the SWIR-based VI and VWC were developed using the MODIS data and ground measured VWC. MODIS-derived Normalized Difference Water Indices (NDWI) using SWIR (1640 nm) or SWIR (2130 nm), namely NDWI1640 or NDW1(2130), all showed potential in estimating VWC. Additional testing of this approach could result in a robust technique for estimating VWC for specific crops. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore we developed a new method for remotely determining phenological stages of paddy rice. The method consists of three procedures: (i) prescription of multi-temporal MODIS/Terra data; (ii) filtering time-series Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data by time-frequency analysis; and (iii) specifying the phenological stages by detecting the maximum point, minimal point and inflection point from the smoothed EVI time profile. Applying this method to MODIS data, we determined the planting date, heading date, harvesting date, and growing period in 2002. And we validated the performance of the method against statistical data in 30 paddy fields. As for the filtering, we adopted wavelet and Fourier transforms. Three types of mother wavelet (Daubechies, Symlet and Coiflet) were used in Wavelet transform. As the results of validation, the wavelet transform performed better than the Fourier transform. Specifically, the case using Coiflet (order=4) gave remarkably good results in determining phenological stages and growing periods. The root mean square errors of the estimated phenological dates against the statistical data were: 12.1 days for planting date, 9.0 days for heading date, 10.6 days for harvesting date, and 11.0 days for growing period. The method using wavelet transform with Coiflet (order=4) allows the determination of regional characteristics of rice phenology.

Linear regression, where there are no non-linear combinations of regressors, is a common approach to this prediction problem in the remote sensing community. A review of recent remote sensing articles using univariate linear regression indicates that in the majority of cases, ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression has been applied, with approximately half the articles using the in situ observations as regressors and the other half using the inverse regression with remote measurements as regressors. OLS implicitly assume an underlying normal structural data model to arrive at unbiased estimates of the response. OLS regression can be a biased predictor in the presence of measurement errors when the regression problem is based on a functional rather than structural data model. Parametric (Modified Least Squares) and non-parametric (Theil-Sen) consistent predictors are given for linear regression in the presence of measurement errors together with analytical approximations of their prediction confidence intervals. Three case studies involving estimation of leaf area index from nadir reflectance estimates are used to compare these unbiased estimators with OLS linear regression. A comparison to Geometric Mean regression, a standardized version of Reduced Major Axis regression, is also performed. The Theil-Sen approach is suggested as a potential replacement of OLS for linear regression in remote sensing applications. It offers simplicity in computation, analytical estimates of confidence intervals, robustness to outliers, testable assumptions regarding residuals and requires limited a priori information regarding measurement errors.

These studies utilize the shift to longer wavelengths in the main spectral feature in minerals in this wavelength region (reststrahlen band) as the mineralogy changes from felsic to mafic. An approach is described for determining the amount of this shift and then using the shift with a reference curve, derived from laboratory data, to remotely determine the weight percent SiO2 of the surface. The approach has broad applicability to many study areas and can also be fine-tuned to give greater accuracy in a particular study area if field samples are available. The approach was assessed using airborne multispectral thermal infrared images from the Hiller Mountains, Nevada, USA and the Tres Virgenes-La Reforma, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Results indicate the general approach slightly overestimates the weight percent SiO2 of low silica rocks (e.g. basalt) and underestimates the weight percent SiO2 of high silica rocks (e.g. granite). Fine tuning the general approach with measurements from field samples provided good results for both areas with errors in the recovered weight percent SiO2 of a few percent. The map units identified by these techniques and traditional mapping at the Hiller Mountains demonstrate the continuity of the crystalline rocks from the Hiller Mountains southward to the White Hills supporting the idea that these ranges represent an essentially continuous footwall block below a regional detachment.

The budget also includes the typical calibration uncertainty and the natural variability in the ocean optical properties. Identification of blue-absorbing aerosols is then achieved when the error budget demonstrates a significant over-correction of the atmospheic signal when using non-absorbing maritime aerosols.

The bio-optical data were divided into two sub-sets: the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean (SwAO), comprising a variety of biogeochemical provinces, from the oligotrophic waters in the South Atlantic gyre to the coastal waters influenced by La Plata River and Palos Lagoon discharge, and the Southern Ocean (SO) data set, comprising sampling stations south of the mean position of the Polar Front, with most stations being located in the vicinity of the Antarctic Peninsula. We derived regional chlorophyll algorithms for both regions and comparisons were made with the NASA\'s OC4v4 (operational algorithm) and OC2v4. For the Southwestern Atlantic region, the NASA OC4v4 algorithm presented a reasonable performance (r(2)=0.87, rmse-L=0.475, N=136) as compared to the revised algorithm for SwAO data (r(2)=0.89, rmse-L=0.426, N=136). A few stations under strong river plume influence were not considered in the analyses. These were detected by a higher reflectance at 670 nm, at low in situ chlorophyll concentration (< 2 mg m(-3)). These results show that empirical algorithms applied to in-situ radiance data have a limited ability to extract accurate chlorophyll estimates below a 30% uncertainty level. For Southern Ocean stations, a 2-band linear-type model was generated (r(2)=0.64, rmse-L=0.347, N=77), which significantly improved the bias (6.4%) as compared to NASA\'s OC4v4 algorithm (bias=-21.7%). An evaluation of some published high-latitude algorithms on our data set has shown a better performance by taxon-specific models, even from distant regions. A validation experiment of the normalized spectral water-leaving radiances and chlorophyll-a SeaWiFS products was also conducted using the FURG-SwAO/SO data set, through a match-up exercise. Despite the relatively low number of pairs of radiometric measurements, SeaWiFS estimations compare well with in situ data (0.77 < r(2)< 0.98, N=21), although the satellite estimate show a marked bias (-35.6%) in the blue band nL(w) (412). Regarding the chlorophyll-a concentration, an overall agreement was observed (r(2)=0.77, rmse-L=0.66, N=28), with a mean absolute percentage difference of 66%, which is above the goal generally accepted of 35% for satellite ocean color chlorophyll estimates. For the studied Southern Ocean area (mainly the Bransfield Strait), NASA\'s OC4v4 algorithm systematically underestimates chlorophyll above 0.2 mg m(-3), as previously demonstrated by other researchers.

A detailed radiative transfer model was obtained by in situ measurement of optical parameters that then allowed calibration of the IKONOS image against in situ optical measurements and a series of ground-truthing points. Eight benthic classes were distinguished optically with an overall accuracy of 69% and a Tau index T of 65. The classification of the IKONOS image allowed discrimination of three different coral assemblages (dense live, dense dead, sparse), which were confirmed by ground-truthing. Data evaluation of the acoustic surveys involved culling of datapoints with < 90% confidence and < 30% probability, two QTC-provided statistics, and the deletion of data classes without clear spatial patterns (visualized by single-class trackplots). The deletion of these ubiquitous classes was necessary in order to obtain any clearly interpretable spatial pattern of echo classes after the surveys were resampled to a regular grid and areas between the lines interpolated using a nearest neighbor algorithm. The 50 kHz acoustic seafloor classification was able to determine two classes (unconsolidated sand versus hardground) but was not able to determine corals. The 200 kHz survey determined high rugosity (=corals and sand ripples) versus low rugosity (=flat areas) but was not able to determine consolidated and unconsolidated sediments. Classes were extrapolated to the entire grid and polygons obtained from the two surveys were combined to provide maps containing four classes (rugose hardground=coral, flat hardground=rock, rugose softground=ripples and algae, flat softground=bare sand). Compared with the classification map derived from the IKONOS image, they were 66% accurate (T=59) when the most highly processed data (only selected classes, > 90% accuracy and > 30% probability) were used, and 60% accurate (T=53) when less processed data (selected classes only, all data) were used. Accuracy against ground-truthing points of the most highly processed dataset was 56% (T=46). These results indicate that results from optical and acoustic surveys have some degree of commonality. Therefore, there is a potential to produce maps outlining coral areas from optical remote-sensing in shallow areas and acoustic methods in adjacent deeper areas beyond optical resolution with the limitation that acoustic maps will resolve fewer habitat classes and have lower accuracy.

CDOM is the only constituent that showed a linear, inverse relationship with surface salinity, although the slope of the relationship changed with location within the bay. The MODIS medium-resolution bands, although designed for land use, are 4-5 times more sensitive than Landsat-7/ ETM+ data and are comparable to or higher than those of CZCS. Several approaches were used to derive synoptic maps of water constituents from concurrent MODIS medium-resolution data. We found that application of various atmospheric-correction algorithms yielded no significant differences, due primarily to uncertainties in the sensor radiometric calibration and other sensor artifacts. However, where each scene could be aroundtruthed, simple regressions between in situ observations of Constituents and at-sensor radiances provided reasonable synoptic maps. We address the need for improvements of sensor calibration/characterization, atmospheric correction, and bio-optical algorithms to make operational and quantitative use of these medium-resolution bands.

The four major processes of atmospheric attenuation of solar radiation, Rayleigh scattering, absorption by ozone and water vapour, and aerosol scattering, are treated individually, using calibrated data from MODIS imagery. Comparing the calculations to field measurements made in Costa Rica in 2002, absolute errors in the order of 2-3% are obtained, which should be sufficiently accurate for application of the PARcalc method in models of vegetation growth as a source of incident PAR.

Consequent to the abrupt institutional changes surrounding the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Kazakhstan has reportedly undergone extensive land cover/land use change. Were the institutional changes sufficiently great to affect land surface phenology at spatial resolutions and extents relevant to mesoscale meteorological models? To explore this question, we used the NDVI time series (1985-1988 and 1995-1999) from the Pathfinder Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Land (PAL) dataset, which consists of 10 days maximum NDVI composites at a spatial resolution of 8 km. Daily minimum and maximum temperatures were extracted from the NCEP Reanalysis Project and 10 days composites of accumulated growing degree-days (AGDD) were produced. We selected for intensive study seven agricultural areas ranging from regions with rain-fed spring wheat cultivation in the north to regions of irrigated cotton and rice in the south. We applied three distinct but complementary statistical analyses: (1) nonparametric testing of sample distributions; (2) simple time series analysis to evaluate trends and seasonality; and (3) simple regression models describing NDVI as a quadratic function of AGDD.   The irrigated areas displayed different temporal developments of NDVI between 1985-1988 and 1995-1999. As the temperature regime between the two periods was not significantly different, we conclude that observed differences in the temporal development of NDVI resulted from changes in agricultural practices.   In the north, the temperature regime was also comparable for both periods. Based on extant socioeconomic studies and our model analyses, we conclude that the changes in the observed land surface phenology in the northern regions are caused by large increases in fallow land dominated by weedy species and by grasslands under reduced grazing pressure. Using multiple lines of evidence allowed us to build a case of whether differences in land surface phenology were mostly the result of anthropogenic influences or interannual climatic fluctuations.

Recently, a number of coarse-scale (1-km) LAI maps have been generated over large regions including the Canadian boreal forest. This study focuses on the production of fine-scale ( less than or equal to 30-m) LAI maps using the forest light interaction model-clustering (FLIM-CLUS) algorithm over selected boreal conifer stands and the subsequent comparison of the fine-scale maps to coarse-scale LAI maps synthesized from Landsat TM imagery. The fine-scale estimates are validated using surface LAI measurements to give relative root mean square errors of under 7% for jack pine sites and under 14% for black spruce sites. In contrast, finer scale site mean LAI ranges between 49% and 86% of the mean of surface estimates covering only part of the sites and 54% to 110% of coarse-scale site mean LAI. Correlations between fine-scale and coarse-scale estimates range from near 0.5 for 30-m coarse-scale images to under 0.3 to 1-km coarse-scale images but increase to near 0.90 after imposing fine-scale zero LAI areas in coarse-scale estimates. The increase suggests that coarse-scale image-based LAI estimates require consideration of sub-pixel open areas. Both FLIM-CLUS and coarse-scale site mean LAI are substantially lower than surface estimates over northern sites. The assumption of spatially random residuals in regression-based estimates of LAI may not be valid and may therefore add to local bias errors in estimating LAI remotely. Differences between fine-scale airborne LAI maps and 30-m-scale Landsat TM LAI maps suggests that, for sparse boreal conifer stands, LAI maps produced from Landsat TM alone may not always be sufficient for validation of coarser scale LAI maps. In addition, previous studies may have used biased LAI estimates over the study site. Fine-scale spatial LAI maps offer one means of assessing and correcting for effects of sub-pixel open area patches and for characterising the spatial pattern of residuals in coarse-scale LAI estimates in comparison to the true distribution of LAI on the surface.

But rigorous RTM processing is impractical for routine continental scale modeling because of long computational times. An alternative, simpler, and faster approach for correcting observations in the 10-12.5 mum band is developed from a previously published water vapor continuum absorption function. Using the RTM program MODTRAN as a reference, the function is calibrated against 159 radiosondes, and then validated against the TIGR radiosonde (1761 profiles) data set. Implementation of the calibrated absorption function usually produced larger temperature corrections than without calibration, an effect due to water vapor band type absorption and to non-water vapor constituents. The resulting surface temperature estimates, within 0.8 degreesC of MODTRAN estimates, were achieved at 15 x less processing time than MODTRAN. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Monthly precipitation and mean temperature data (1982-1990) were acquired from 19 meteorological stations throughout the grasslands of the eastern Mongolian steppes in China. Our results showed that while the taiga forest north of the Mongolian steppes (>50degreesN) experienced an earlier onset of green-up during the study period, a later onset was observed at the eastern and northern edges of the Gobi Desert (40degreesN-50degreesN). Responses of different vegetation types to climatic variability appeared to vary with vegetation characteristics and spring soil moisture availability of specific sites. Plant stress caused by drought was the most significant contributor to later vegetation green-up as observed from satellite imagery over the desert steppe. Areas with greater seasonal soil moisture greened up earlier in the growing season. Our results suggested that water budget limitations determine the pattern of vegetation responses to atmospheric warming. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Four-meter resolution Ikonos satellite images from 2000 and 2001 reveal a shrinkage of 22,096 +/- 46 m(2) in the Pasterze tongue. The nearby Kleines Fleisskees glacier lost 30% of its area between 1984 and 2001, and the area of exposed ice increased by 0.44 +/- 0.0023 km(2), according to Landsat satellite measurements. As more recent satellite images are utilized, especially data that are geocoded, the uncertainty associated with measuring glacier changes has decreased. It is not possible to assess the uncertainty when an old topographic map and a satellite image are coregistered. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The evaluation of fire risk is therefore of high practical importance, particularly during the summer and season, when fires are most frequent and harmful. Recent studies have demonstrated that the evaluation of dynamic fire risk can be carried out by the use of remotely sensed images, and specifically of NOAA-AVHRR Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. This use relies on the sensitivity of the index to vegetation dryness, which is a major predisposing factor for fire occurrence. Several problems, however, remain linked to the spatial variability of the risk in environmentally heterogeneous areas, which requires the application of suitable processing techniques to the low-resolution imagery.   The current work reports on the development and testing of different methodologies for estimating dynamic fire risk by the use of NOAA-AVHRR data. The investigation was conducted in Tuscany (Central Italy) using a large archive of fires that occurred in the region and NOAA-AVHRR NDVI data of 16 years (1985-2000). Relying on previous methodological achievements of our group and other research groups, several procedures were tested to extract information related to fire risk from the remotely sensed images. These trials led to define an optimum method which is based on the identification of pixels where the accordance between interyear variations in fire probabilities and NDVI values is maximum. The accuracy of the risk estimates from this optimum method was finally evaluated by a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. In this way, the performance of the methodology was assessed, together with its potential for operational fire risk monitoring and forecasting in Mediterranean areas. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Improved mapping techniques are constantly being sought in terms of speed, consistency, accuracy, level of detail, and overall effectiveness. Semi-automated analysis of high-resolution imagery at the individual tree crown level may offer such benefits. Methods, however, need to be developed and tested under a variety of forest conditions.   High-resolution (60 cm) multispectral airborne imagery was acquired over a predominantly young conifer forest and plantation test area on the west coast of Canada. Automated tree isolation algorithms were applied to the data in order to delineate tree crowns or clusters of crowns. An object-oriented single tree classification was conducted using a maximum likelihood classifier. Stands of similar species composition, closure, and stem density were defined through a sequence that first generated images of these parameters from the automated delineation and classification, used these as input to an unsupervised classification, and then filtered and smoothed the resulting classification clusters. Because of the dense nature of the stands and small crowns on the site, the isolation process often delineated clusters of several trees. Species classification accuracy was determined by comparing the average stand composition from the automated technique to that derived from ground transects or plots. Species classification was good, with average composition error (difference between field measured and automated composition) over all 16 test stands being 7.25%. Most errors for individual species in stands were below 20%, but a few were up to 30%. The automatically generated stand boundaries mimicked well those of known plantation and interpreted inventory boundaries. The automated technique created a few larger stands and some additional small stands in areas of complex forest structure. Overall, for the young fairly uniform stands of the site, both stand delineation and species composition estimation were of a quality suitable for operational use in inventory and forest management. Further development and testing is needed to extend results to situations covering large areas, multiple flight lines, varied topography, and different forest conditions.

In comparison to indices based on chlorophyll absorption features (such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)), indices based on the water absorption bands are expected to \"see\" more deeply into thick canopies and have a preferential sensitivity to thin as opposed to thick tissues. These predictions are based on the much lower absorption coefficients for water in the short wavelength water bands as compared to chlorophyll. Thus, the water bands may have advantages over NDVI for remote sensing of photosynthetic tissues. Previous studies have primarily related water band indices (WI) to leaf area index (LAI). Here we expand the definition of photosynthetic tissues to include thin green stems and fruits and measure a wide range of species to determine the influence of variable tissue morphologies and canopy structures on these relationships. As expected, indices based on reflectance in the water absorption bands in the near infrared were best correlated with the water content of thin tissues (less than 0.5-cm thickness). The choice of wavelength for a water index was much more important for thick than for thin canopies, and the best wavelengths were those where water absorptance was weak to moderate. We identified three wavelength regions (950-970, 1150-1260 and 1520-1540 nm) that produced the best overall correlations with water content. Comparison of these wavelength regions with the atmospheric \"windows\" where water vapor absorption is minimal suggests that the 11501260 and 1520-1540 nm regions would be the best wavelengths for satellite remote sensing of water content. We also developed and tested a new Canopy Structure Index (CSI) that combines the low absorptance water bands with the simple ratio vegetation index (SR) to produce an index with a wider range of sensitivity to photosynthetic tissue area at all canopy thicknesses. CSI was better than either WI or SR alone for prediction of total area of photosynthetic. tissues. However, SR was best for prediction of leaf area when other green tissues were excluded. All of these relationships showed good generality across a wide range of species and functional types. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Therefore, it must be determined with sufficient accuracy. In this paper, a statistical inversion method is presented in support of the application of kernel-based Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) models for the calculation of the surface albedo. The method provides the best linear unbiased estimations (BLUE) of the BRDF model coefficients for an arbitrary number of available angular measurements. When the number of measurements exceeds the number of the estimated coefficients, the QR decomposition method is proposed to improve the ill-conditional features of the inversion matrix. In other cases, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method is suggested. The proposed inversion method is innovative in that it provides confidence intervals for each of the BRDF model coefficients with a prescribed significance expressed by a probability level. Five candidate kernel-driven BRDF models were used in the present simulation study: Li-Sparse, Roujean, Li-Sparse-Wanner, Li-Dense and Walthall. A ground-based reflectance measurement data set including 11 surface types forms the background for the inversion experiments. The results show a strong dependence on the solar zenith angle (SZA) and on the land cover type (LCT) for all candidate models. Owing to this, none model could be recommend in a general manner. The Li-Sparse and the Li-Sparse-Wanner models performed the best for the grass and wheat LCT, while the Roujean model appeared as a favorite for the pine and deciduous forests. The implementation of the confidence interval technique shows that the BRDF model coefficients can be retrieved with an uncertainty of 20-30%, and somewhat greater in the case of forest. The measured angular reflectance curves lie, as a rule, within the uncertainty bands related to the 5% significance level (95% probability). The corresponding albedo estimates can be characterized by an absolute uncertainty of 1-2% in the visible band and 5-10% in the near infrared band, or by 10-30% in relative terms. The reflectance measurements at low SZA values are preferable for BRDF model inversion for the grassland and crop, while medium range of SZA seems to provide more information on forest features. For the majority of LCT, the results of BRDF model inversion seem to be less reliable when considering multi-angular measurements for various SZA than for a single SZA. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

This study presents a remote sensing-aided method for that purpose. The method is based on the integration of joint sequential co-simulation with Landsat TM image for mapping and polynomial regression for spatial uncertainty analysis. The method was applied to a case study in which ground cover (GC), canopy cover (CC), and vegetation height (VH) were jointly mapped to derive a map of the vegetation cover factor for predicting soil loss. The variance contributions from the variables, their interactions, and the spatial information from neighbors leading to uncertainty of predicted vegetation cover factor were assessed. The results showed that in addition to unbiased maps, this method reproduced the spatial variability of the variables and the spatial correlation among them, and successfully quantified the effect of variation from all the components on the prediction of the vegetation cover factor.

This paper presents the results of the application of the C-Fix model within the frame of part of the objectives of the LTEEF-II project, as defined for the European continental scale.   A description of the C-Fix model is presented in the first part of this paper. C-Fix is a Monteith type parametric model driven by temperature, radiation and fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (WAR), the last variable derived by processing NOAA/AVHRR data of 1997 acquired over Europe as well as VEGETATION (VGT) data for the same region for the period 1998-1999. In a second part of the paper, the main results obtained are described, e.g. net ecosystem fluxes for forest, calculated locally for the Euroflux CO2 measurement sites as well as for the whole continent. The model simulations were evaluated with eddy covariance measurements of NEP performed during 1997 at the Euroflux sites. Moreover, a comparison between NEP determined with NOAA/AVHRR data, opposed to NEP simulations based on VGT data is performed. A difference up to 20% is obtained between both data sets. Finally A C-Fix estimate of total European vegetation NEP obtained with NOAA/AVHRR data for 1997 is 2.70 +/- 32% Pg C, (P = 10(15) g, % is 95% confidence limit). This estimate decreases to 2.15 +/- 43% Pg C when VGT data for the period April 1998-March 1999 are used. The total forest NEP for Europe, however, is estimated at 0.735 Pg C for 1997. Along a North-South transect at 13degrees east, through Europe a clear increase in NEP and the other basic carbon mass fluxes GPP and NPP is modelled from northern to southern latitudes. Moreover, along this transect the values simulated with C-Fix for NEP corresponds well with the eddy covariance NEP estimates for the Euroflux sites.

Optical sensors on operational satellites provide self-consistent time series of urban reflectance variations, but quantitative analyses are complicated by spectral heterogeneity at sensor instantaneous field of view (IFOV) scales and by temporal changes in illumination and atmospheric conditions. These complications can be minimized by combining a multitemporal radiometric rectification with a physically based reflectance analysis. Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) provides a physically based approach to quantifying spatial and temporal changes in spectrally heterogeneous urban reflectance. Multitemporal analysis of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery of the New York metropolitan area suggests that urban reflectance can be described with a three-component linear mixture model spanned by high albedo, low albedo, and vegetation endmembers. The topology of the spectral mixing space indicates that mixing fractions are well constrained for the vegetation endmember and that nonlinear mixing occurs primarily between the high and low albedo endmembers. Selection of pseudoinvariant (PIV) image endmembers allows radiometric rectification of multitemporal imagery to a common set of endmembers, thereby minimizing variations in radiance that are unrelated to changes in surface reflectance. Inversion of the three-component linear mixture model for the New York metro area produces robust, consistent fraction estimates for different combinations of rectifications and inversion constraints. Temporal variation of the presumed invariant endmember sites provides a measure of uncertainty for the endmember fraction estimates. The resulting vegetation fraction estimates agree with high-resolution reference measurements to within 10% for a 1996 midsummer validation and PIV endmember fraction estimates vary by less than 7% over the course of the 1996 growing season. In contrast, intraurban spatial variations in vegetation fraction span several tens of percent, suggesting that the measured changes significantly exceed the uncertainty of the estimates. These results suggest that Landsat TM imagery may be used to monitor seasonal to interannual variations in urban reflectance and vegetation abundance.

However, comparisons of SSM/I, Landsat, AVHRR, and ERS-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) have shown substantial seasonal and regional differences in their estimates of sea ice concentration. To evaluate these differences, we compared SSM/I estimates of sea ice coverage derived with the NASA Team and Bootstrap algorithms to estimates made using RADARSAT, and OKEAN-01 satellite sensor data. The study area included the Barents Sea, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, and adjacent parts of the Arctic Ocean, during October 1995 through October 1999. Ice concentration estimates from spatially and temporally near-coincident imagery were calculated using independent algorithms for each sensor type. The OKEAN algorithm implemented the satellite\'s two-channel active (radar) and passive microwave data in a linear mixture model based on the measured values of brightness temperature and radar backscatter. The RADARSAT algorithm utilized a segmentation approach of the measured radar backscatter, and the SSM/I ice concentrations were derived at National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) using the NASA Team and Bootstrap algorithms. Seasonal and monthly differences between SSM/I, OKEAN, and RADARSAT ice concentrations were calculated and compared. Overall, total sea ice concentration estimates derived independently from near-coincident RADARSAT, OKEAN-01, and SSM/I satellite imagery demonstrated mean differences of less than 5.5% (S.D. < 9.5%) during the winter period. Differences between the SSM/I NASA Team and the SSM/I Bootstrap concentrations were no more than 3.1% (S.D. < 5.4%) during this period. RADARSAT and OKEAN-01 data both yielded higher total ice concentrations than the NASA Team and the Bootstrap algorithms. The Bootstrap algorithm yielded higher total ice concentrations than the NASA Team algorithm. Total ice concentrations derived from OKEAN-01 and SSM/I satellite imagery were highly correlated during winter, spring, and fall, with mean differences of less than 8.1% (S.D. < 15%) for the NASA Team algorithm, and less than 2.8% (S.D. < 13.8%) for the Bootstrap algorithm. Respective differences between SSM/I NASA Team and SSM/I Bootstrap total concentrations were less than 5.3% (S.D. < 6.9%). Monthly mean differences between SSM/I and OKEAN differed annually by less than 6%, with smaller differences primarily in winter. The NASA Team and Bootstrap algorithms underestimated the total sea ice concentrations relative to the RADARSAT ScanSAR no more than 3.0% (S.D. < 9%) and 1.2% (S.D. < 7.5%) during cold months, and no more than 12% and 7% during summer, respectively. ScanSAR tended to estimate higher ice concentrations for ice concentrations greater than 50%, when compared to SSM/I during all months. ScanSAR underestimated total sea ice concentration by 2% compared to the OKEAN-01 algorithm during cold months, and gave an overestimation by 2% during spring and summer months. Total NASA Team and Bootstrap sea ice concentration estimates derived from coincident SSM/I and OKEAN-01 data demonstrated mean differences of no more than 5.3% (S.D. < 7%), 3.1% (S.D. < 5.5%), 2.0% (S.D. < 5.5%), and 7.3% (S.D. < 10%) for fall, winter, spring, and summer periods, respectively. Large disagreements were observed between the OKEAN and NASA Team results in spring and summer for estimates of the first-year (FY) and multiyear (MY) age classes. The OKEAN-01 algorithm and data tended to estimate, on average, lower concentrations of young or FY ice and h   Our results contribute to the growing body of documentation about the levels of disparity obtained when seasonal sea ice concentrations are estimated using various types of satellite data and algorithms.

For boreal forests, we have investigated a stem volume retrieval method based on inversion of ERS-1/2 coherence measurements by means of a semiempirical model. A multitemporal combination of several stem volume estimates has been used in order to reduce errors in the estimation. The retrieval procedure was first applied in a forest estate located in Kattbole, Sweden, where accurate in situ measurements were taken. Stem volume was determined both at the stand level (between 2 and 14 ha) and at the pixel level (25 x 25 m). A multitemporal combination of coherence data acquired in stable winter-type conditions gave the most accurate results. Based on the results obtained in Kattbole, the retrieval procedure was extended to a large area of 4235 km(2) around Kattbole. Retrieval was performed in all forested areas on a pixel basis (25 x 25 m), generating stem volume maps. In Kattbole, at the stand level, stem volume up to 350 m(3)/ha was estimated with an error comparable to the ground truth, i.e. 10 m(3)/ha. At the pixel level, the error reached the value of 55 and 71 m(3)/ha in the forest estate and in the large area, respectively. Compared to the results from the stand analysis, the higher error is believed to be mainly due to the higher uncertainty of coherence estimation at high stem volume and to geometric mismatch between field data and coherence data. Moreover, over large areas, spatial variation of the parameters in the model should be considered. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

On the basis of published work and empirical data, this paper demonstrates that reflectance and other optical parameters, such as the beam attenuation coefficient, are in reality, dependent on the projected surface area (PSA) of the suspended matter. The PSA is shown to be dependent on TSM, the volume concentration (VC), the particle size spectrum, and the mean effective density (Deltap) of the suspended matter. The PSA is calculated for three different particle size spectra and it is shown that PSA can vary by up to three orders of magnitude at a constant value of TSM (if Deltap and the particle size spectrum change). Because reflectance and beam attenuation are de facto related to the PSA, determination of TSM from a reflectance or transmission measurement may potentially have an error of up to a factor of 10 due to variations in Deltap common in coastal and estuarine waters. If Deltap and the size spectrum of the suspended matter are known or can be estimated, it is possible to determine TSM from both types of measurement with better accuracy.

Methods of monitoring volcanic activity include searching for variations in the thermal signal from active fumaroles, lava domes, lava lakes, flows, and other features. Over many active volcanoes in the Western Hemisphere, low spatial resolution (4 km/pixel) weather satellite data acquired every 15 min are used to identify changes in eruptive activity, but are of insufficient spatial resolution to map active volcanic features. The Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) on Landsat 7 can be used to monitor active volcanoes at a higher spatial resolution (15- to 60-m pixels). ETM+ also offers improvements over its predecessor, the Thematic Mapper of Landsats 4 and 5, by way of a 15-m panchromatic band and higher spatial resolution (60 m/pixel) thermal infrared (IR) band. With higher spatial resolution panchromatic data, we are able to map lava flow fields, trace very high temperature lava channels, and, at Lascar volcano, identify an arcuate feature associated with a collapsed crater floor, a phenomenon that may precede explosive activity. With improved spatial resolution in the thermal IR, we are able to map the bifurcation and braiding of underground lava tubes at Kilauea. Identifying tube locations and tracking their extension are important because, for a given volumetric lava production (effusion) rate, tube-fed flows can extend a much greater distance than surface flows. At both Kilauea and Etna, we are able to use the thermal data to estimate effusion rates, an important parameter for assessing how far a flow is likely to extend and therefore the hazard it poses. An improved ETM+ data collection and distribution system includes a well-formulated and -executed Long-Term Acquisition Plan and less expensive data that is available much faster than previously possible.

To take advantage of this opportunity it is necessary to move beyond the traditional image-by-image approach to data analysis. A new approach to monitoring large areas is to extend the application of a trained image classifier to data beyond its original temporal, spatial, and sensor domains. A map of forest change in the Cascade Range of Oregon developed with methods based on such generalization shows accuracies comparable to a map produced with current state-of-the-art methods. A test of generalization across sensors to monitor forest change in the Rocky Mountains indicates that Landsat 7 ETM+ data can be combined with earlier Landsat 5 TM data without retraining the classifier. Methods based on generalization require less time and effort than conventional methods and as a result may allow monitoring of larger areas or more frequent monitoring at reduced cost. One key component to achieving this goal is the improved availability and affordability of Landsat 7 imagery. These results highlight the value of the existing Landsat archive and the importance for continuity in the Landsat Program. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

All features derived from single-date imagery gave only low correlations with measured cover (\\R \\ < .47), although the spring image had greater utility, Reflectance simulations were used to help understand how a number of scene factors modulated cover estimates. The spring image data were found to give better separation of cover in multispectral plots, greater dynamic ranges, and were less adversely affected by differences in stand structure. The utility of using both images in combination was dependent on how the reflectance information was used, Using TM bands from both dates in model inversions did not improve the results compared to using the spring image only. However, the band differences, taken between dates in TM3 and TM5, respectively. gave the strongest correlations with cover (\\R \\ =.56 and .64). Experiments using simulated reflectances indicated that the TM5 band difference was less adversely affected than TM5 to between-stand differences in structure and crown reflectances. Temporal reflectance information may thus have some applicability in boreal environments, where the availability of ancillary information, required for accurate inversions using reflectance data, can be very limited. However, further work needs to be undertaken to identify optimal image acquisition dates and to better understand the biophysical aspects of the temporal changes in forest reflectance in boreal conditions.

It then documents the physical basis supporting the use of remote sensing to directly detect vegetation water content in terms of Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT) at leaf level. Using laboratory measurements, the radiative transfer model PROSPECT and a sensitivity analysis, it shows that shortwave infrared (SWIR) is sensitive to EWT but cannot be used alone to retrieve EWT because two other leaf parameters (internal structure and dry matter) also influence leaf reflectance in the SWIR, A combination of SWIR and NIR (only influenced by these two parameters) is necessary to retrieve EWT at leaf level. These results set the basis towards establishing operational techniques for the retrieval of EWT at top-of-canopy and top-of-atmospheric levels. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

The wavelength positions of these absorptions coincide with the absorption characteristics of the nitrogen-containing amide bonds in proteins. The observed presence of these absorption features in the reflectance spectra of dried foilage is suggested to form a physical basis for high correlations established by stepwise multiple linear regression techniques between the reflectance of dry plant samples and their nitrogen concentration. The consistent change in the 2.1-mum absorption feature as nitrogen increases and the offset position of protein absorptions compared to those of other plant components together indicate that a generally applicable algorithm may be developed for spectroscopic estimates of nitrogen concentration from the reflectance spectra of dried plant foilage samples.

Using this imagery, differences in the spectral properties and timing of phenologic events between tree species made it possible to discriminate four deciduous tree species, namely Liriodendron tulipifera, Acer rubrum, Quercus rubra, and Quercus alba, which made up nearly 99% of the trees at this study site. Optimally timed photography acquired during peak autumn colors provided the best single date of imagery, while photography from spring leaf-out was the second best.

This study suggests that although multispectral data appear to be more valuable than multitemporal data, it may be possible to compensate for the limited spectral resolution of planned high-resolution sensors by combining multiple dates of low spectral resolution images.

In this paper the precision and accuracy of two techniques, Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) applied to Landsat TM data, are assessed quantitatively using high-precision in situ data. In Owens Valley, California we have 6 years of continuous field data (1991-1996) for 33 sites acquired concurrently with six cloudless Landsat TM images. The multitemporal remotely sensed data were coregistered to within 1 pixel, radiometrically intercalibrated using temporally invariant surface features, and geolocated to within 30 m. These procedures facilitated the accurate location of field-monitoring sites within the remotely sensed data. Formal uncertainties in the registration, radiometric alignment, and modeling were determined. Results show that SMA absolute percent live cover (%LC) estimates are accurate to within +/-4.0%LC and estimates of change in live cover have a precision of +/-3.8%LC. Furthermore, even when applied to areas of low vegetation cover the SMA approach correctly determined the sense of change (i.e., positive or negative) in 87% of the samples. SMA results are superior to NDVI, which, although correlated with live cover, is not a quantitative measure and showed the correct sense of change in only 67% of the samples.

Remote sensing offers a potential way of monitoring public lands for the production of marijuana. However, very little information on the spectral properties of marijuana is available in the scientific literature. Our objectives were to 1) characterize the spectral properties of the leaves of marijuana and various other plants that occur where marijuana is grown in the eastern United States, 2) simulate canopy reflectance, and 3) identify wavebands for discriminating marijuana from other plants. In a series of replicated field experiments, the basic factors affecting marijuana growth and reflectance, including planting data, plant density, and N-fertilization were varied. Leaf optical properties were measured periodically during the growing season with a spectroradiometer and integrating sphere. As N-fertilization rate decreased, the marijuana plants produced leaves with lower chlorophyll concentrations and higher reflectance values in the visible wavelength region, particularly at 550 nm. The reflectance spectra of the herbaceous dicot species examined were very similar to the spectrum of marijuana. The reflectance spectra of the monocots and the trees differed significantly from the spectrum of marijuana, particularly in the green and near-infrared wavelength regions. Canopy reflectance spectra of marijuana and several representative species were simulated for a wide range of LAI and background reflectances. Major differences in canopy reflectance of marijuana and other plants were observed near 550 nm, 720 nm, and 800 nm. Dense canopies of marijuana were more spectrally discriminable from other vegetation than sparse canopies. Thus, based on measured leaf spectra and simulated canopy reflectance spectra, we would choose several relatively narrow (i.e., 30 nm or less) spectral bands in the green (550 nm), red (670 nm), \"red edge\" (720 nm), and the near-infrared (800 nm) to discriminate marijuana leaves and canopies from other species. Much of the leaf spectral information is also available in the canopy reflectance data.

Within the study area, during the 21 years, it was determined that the northern glaciers advanced and the southern glaciers retreated, the average rate of change was 50 m a(-1) to 105 m a(-1). The results show that Landsat data provide an important source of information for studies of glacier variation.

A method of removing the view-angle effect was sought that would not alter the radiometric integrity of the image, and which would require minimal ancillary information. Four methods were tested and evaluated in terms of remaining brightness gradient and in terms of retention of spectral characteristics. All methods used a quadratic fitting equation to model the changes in brightness across view angles. Other descriptive coefficients were calculated to aid in interpretation. The observed view-angle effect varied with wavelength in a manner consistent with predictions of bidirectional reflectance distribution function characteristics of vegetation. View-angle effects were determined to contain both additive and multiplicative components, with multiplicative components being strong in the chlorophyll absorption region. The view-angle effect in a given pixel was a function of both an underlying view-angle response determined by surface structure and the inherent brightness of that pixel. The most successful compensation method was the one that best accounted for broad differences between pixels in these two components. Despite the simplifying assumptions necessary for empirical view-angle correction techniques, they can still be useful for hyperspectral remote-sensing data in situations where the view-angle brightness variations would mask variance useful for extracting scene information.

Standard meteorological observations generally provide reasonable descriptions of temporal variations in air temperature for the site sampled but may not describe the spatial heterogeneity typically encountered in this variable over larger land areas. If a reasonable estimate of spatial patterns of air temperature can be derived from satellite remote sensing, this pattern, in combination with the temporal precision of ground measurements, should significantly improve our knowledge of terrestrial environmental conditions.   In this study, we explore a methodology for estimating air temperature directly from remotely sensed observations using the (observed) correlation between a spectral vegetation index and surface temperature (temperature-vegetation index). Inference of air temperature is based on the hypothesis that the bulk temperature of an infinitely thick vegetation canopy is close to ambient air temperature.   Advanced very high resolution radiometer observations for five sites in northeastern Kansas were used to estimate air temperatures on 31 days during the 1987 growing season. These air temperature estimates were compared with coincident ground-measured air temperatures recorded at standard meteorological stations.   A strong correlation (r=0.93) was found between the satellite estimates and measured air temperatures with a mean error of 2.92 C degrees. However, there was a consistent positive bias in the satellite estimates. It is not clear at this time whether the bias is due to an actual difference between air temperature and the temperature of an infinitely thick canopy or whether it is an artifact of the measurements themselves. Within the errors of the methods used, estimation of standard meteorological shelter height air temperatures recorded at the time of satellite overpass appears possible. Further refinements of the remote sensing methods used here are possible and can be expected in the era of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\'s Earth Observing System.

These fluorescence measurements were compared with extracted chl a concentrations from water samples. The results showed that lidar can produce accurate synoptic estimates of surface chl a concentrations. The lidar instrument measured a variable fluorescence intensity F, which lies between the ground (F-0) and maximum (F-m) fluorescence intensity of chl a. The slope of the linear regression of lidar F against extracted chl a was steeper and less variable during the night than during the day. Monitoring of all variables over a 24-h period showed that photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) np to 100 W m(-2) did not significantly reduce lidar fluorescence-that is, up to 90 min after sunrise under cloud-free conditions. In the context of lidar remote sensing from an aircraft, dawn flights will allow measurements of F that lie close to dark-adapted values and that are little affected by PAR.

To ascertain the likelihood that these patches represent surface blooms of the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi, their distribution pattern was mapped and their spectral signature evaluated by classifying CZCS imagery with a supervised, multispectral classification scheme that had been developed to detect this phytoplankton species. On the basis of the similarity of these characteristics to those of documented cases, we conclude that the high-reflectance patches observed in surface waters of the shelf and beyond are E. huxleyi blooms. The blooms seasonally occupied an area as large as 550,000 km(2). Standing stock estimates indicate that the detected blooms produce an average of 1.5-4.9X10(5) metric tons of calcite carbon and 4.0X10(3) t of dimethyl sulfide sulfur. The bloom\'s production of these climatically relevant compounds and their alteration of optical properties in the surface layer suggest that the blooms significantly affect the biogeochemistry and ecology of this region.

While humans possess the same ability in their eyes, man-made space-borne sensors that sense evolution of global vegetation, have so far used a combination of the red and near infrared channels instead. In this article we challenge this approach, using measurements of reflectance spectra from 400 nm to 750 nm with spectral resolution of 2 nm, with simultaneous determination of pigment concentrations of mature and autumn senescing leaves. We show that, for a wide range of leaf greenness, the maximum sensitivity of reflectance coincides with the red absorption maximum of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) at 670 nm. However for yellow-green to green leaves (with Chl-a more than 3-5 mu g/cm(2)), the reflectance near 670 nm is not sensitive to chlorophyll concentration because of saturation of the relationship of absorptions versus chlorophyll concentration. Maximum sensitivity of Chl-a concentration for a wide range of its variation (0.3-45 mu g/cm(2)) was found, not surprisingly so, around the green band from 520 nm to 630 nm and also near 700 nm. We found that the inverse of the reflectance in the green band was proportional to Chl-a concentration with correlation r(2) > 0.95. This band will be present on several future satellite sensors with a global view of vegetation (SeaWiFS to be launched in. 1996, Polder on ADEOS-1 also in 1996, and MODIS on EOS in 1998 and 2000). New indexes that use the green channel and are resistant to atmospheric effects are developed. A green NDVI = (rho(nir) - rho(green)/(rho(nir) + rho(green) was tested for a range of Chl-a from 0.3 mu g/cm(2) to 45 mu g/cm(2), and found to have an error in the chlorophyll a derivation at leaf level of less than 3 mu g/cm(2). The new index has wider dynamic range than the NDVI and is, on average, at least five times more sensitive to Chl-a concentration. A green atmospherically resistant vegetation index (GARI), tailored on the concept of ARVI (Kaufman and Tanre, 1992), is developed and is expected to be as resistant to atmospheric effects as ARVI but more sensitive to a wide range of Chl-a concentrations. While NDVI and ARVI are sensitive to vegetation fraction and to rate of absorption of photosynthetic solar radiation, a green vegetation index like GARI should be added to sense the concentration of chlorophyll, to measure the rate of photosynthesis and to monitor plant stress.

For a plane wave exciting the canopy, the average Mueller matrix is formulated, and then used to determine the linearly polarized backscattering coefficients including both the copolarized and cross-polarized power returns.

A simple four-endmember model consisting of reflectance spectra of green vegetation, nonphotosynthetic vegetation, soil, and shade was applied to all four images. Fractions of endmembers were used to define seven categories, each of which consisted of one or more classes of ground cover, where class names were based on field observations. Endmember fractions varied over time for many pixels, reflecting processes operating on the ground such as felling of forest, or regrowth of vegetation in previously cleared areas. Changes in classes over time were used to establish superclasses which grouped pixels having common histories. sources of classification error were evaluated, including system noise, endmember variability, and low spectral contrast. Field work during each of the four years showed consistently high accuracy in per-image classification. Classification accuracy in any one year was improved by considering the multiyear context.

Three Spectron Engineering SE590 units were independently evaluated under varying temperatures at three separate institutions. A procedure for correcting calibration coefficients (radiance/count) as a function of temperature and wavelength teas developed and applied. The Evaluation showed that at wavelengths between 390 nm and 940 nm the calibration coefficients differed from each other by less than 5% among all ambient temperatures. At 1000 nm, the calibration coefficient decreases about 5% going from 25 degrees C to 35 degrees C and increases about 25% going from 25 degrees C to 0 degrees C. Wavebands below 390 nm responded chaotically to temperature. At ant! given wavelength above 940 nm the change in calibration coefficient value was a nearly linear function of temperature, an indication that a simple temperature correction can be applied. Calibration coefficients were linearly interpolated for each waveband greater than 940 nm at temperatures between temperature extremes imposed upon the instruments during the experiments. Linearly interpolated calibration coefficients were found to be within 4% of actual values.

The goal was to assess the progress of the East decade in the areas of modeling, satellite data algorithm development, and field experiments. This article includes:   1. A review of the state and direction of biosphere-atmosphere model development and an assessment of the data needs of the models. Models covering a large range of timescales were considered: energy-water-carbon (seconds to seasons); carbon cycles and biogeochemistry (days to years); and ecological structure and function (years to millennia).   2. A reference to current satellite data algorithms and other global data sources. The areas covered in the workshop were: near-surface meteorology, surface radiation budget, precipitation, runoff; snow and ice, soils and soil moisture, and land cover type and land cover attributes. These are discussed in detail in other articles in this issue.   3. A review of completed and planned major field experiments. The major experiments of the last decade are summarized and the lessons noted, The participating scientists agreed on the need to rapidly assemble and circulate global data sets of variables and parameters required to initialize, force, and validate the global biosphere-atmosphere models. A prioritized list of data sets required to meet this need is set out and discussed. Lastly, initiatives taken by ISLSCP to satisfy these requirements are reviewed:   Initiative I: Immediate Generation of High Priority Global Data Sets   Some essential global data sets are to be put together within 2 years and released to the community by mid-1994. These data sets will be mapped to a common spatial resolution (1 degrees x 1 degrees) and will cover the period 1987-1988.   1. Vegetation: Global sets of vegetation-related parameters are to be generated with a monthly time resolution. Available AVHRR data sets are to be I used as the basis for this effort, and algorithms will be applied to calculate fields of cover type, phenology, FPAR, and leaf area index. These fields can then in turn be used to infer other surface pa rameters such as roughness, albedo, biomass, etc.   2. Hydrometeorology: Global meteorological fields retrieved from numerical reanalysis will be manipulated to provide near-surface forcing data sets for temperature, humidity, windspeed, etc. Observations of precipitation, runoff, and snow cover are to be worked up into easily accessible forms.   3. Radiation Budget: A closer interface with the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) and related projects will be pursued to obtain surface radiation budget components at higher spatial resolutions, as well as fields of incident PAR.   4. Soils: A small project was set in place with the goal of providing a useful soil type and properties data set for use by global modelers.   Initiative II: Improved, Follow-on Data Sets   The data sets specified in Initiative I are to be generated within a e-year period. However, it is clear that great improvements could be made over this first data release which must rely on pre-existing data sets and robust, available algorithms. Work was started to scope out what needs to be done to produce improved versions of all the Initiative I data sets within 5 years, by mid-1997.   Initiative III: Improved Communications within the Land Science Community   Future discussions within ISLSCP and between ISLSCP and other bodies will focus on the need to coordinate different research thrusts within the land science community, particularly the modeling, algorithm and field experiment work.', 'NASA,WASHINGTON,DC 20546.

Since leaf intrinsic scattering properties show very little spectral variation, leaf optical properties are related to their absorption properties. Spectral analogies are thus observed between two wavelengths for which the optical properties (absorption, reflectance, or transmittance) of the elements are similar. The red edge for green plants shows the full range of variation of leaf optical properties. The relationship between canopy reflectance and leaf reflectance measured concurrently at the red edge over sugar beet canopies was thus used to simulate canopy reflectance over the whole spectral domain from leaf reflectance spectra measured over the whole spectral domain. The results show that the spectral analogies found allows accurate reconstruction of canopy reflectance spectra. Explicit assumptions about the very low spectral variation of leaf intrinsic scattering properties are thus indirectly justified. The sensitivity of canopy reflectance (rho(c)) to leaf optical properties is then investigated from concurrent spectral variations Of canopy (partial derivative rho(c)/partial derivative lambda) and leaf reflectance (partial derivative rho1/partial derivative lambda): partial derivative rho(c)/partial derivative rho1 = (partial derivative rho(c)/partial derivative lambda) (partial derivative rho(l)/partial derivative lambda)-1. This expression is strictly valid only when the optical properties of the soil background or of the other vegetation elements such as bark are either spectrally flat or do not contribute significantly to canopy reflectance.  Simulations using the SAIL and PROSPECT models demonstrate that the sensitivity of canopy reflectance to leaf reflectance is significant for large vegetation cover fractions in spectral domains where absorption is low. In these conditions, multiple scattering enhances the leaf absorption features by a factor that can be greater than 2.0. To override the limitations of the SAIL model for the description of the canopy architecture, we tested the previous simulation results on experimental data. Concurrent canopy and leaf reflectance spectra were measured for a range of sugar beet canopies. The results show good agreement with the theoretical findings. Conclusions are drawn about the applicability of these findings, with particular attention to the potential detectability of leaf biochemical composition from canopy reflectance sensed from space.', 'JRC,IRSA AT,ISPRA,ITALY.

Interpolation of the peak correlation values allows the displacements to be measured to subpixel accuracy, resulting in very precise velocity measurements. Cross-correlation is also applied to provide image coregistration in areas devoid of bedrock exposures. In such areas, subtle large-scale topographic undulations in the ice surface, related to underlying bedrock structure, may be correlated by using large image areas and low-pass filtered images.

The relationship between interception efficiency (measured from hemispherical photographs) and the vegetation index results from coupling reflectance and PAR interception models based on the Beer-Lambert extinction law.  This relationship does not depend explicitly on the canopy structure parameters but it assumes that the background reflectance is known.  Although the background reflectance depends on the water state and depth variation in a way which cannot be explicitly quantified, it has been empirically described by its observed evolution fitted with time.  After anthesis, this reflectance takes into account the reflectance of the senescent vegetation.  Given the spectral profile of a crop (temporal evolution of its reflectance), its PAR absorption profile can be estimated.  The PAR use efficiency (conversion of the absorbed energy into biomass) is then determined for every phenological period as the ratio of total absorbed PAR to total synthetized biomass during the period.  For flooded rice, root extraction and therefore root biomass evaluation are rather easy, so that more realistic PAR use efficiencies can be estimated than for most crops.

Initial qualitative studies demonstrated this potential but the move to quantitative assessments is hindered by limited understanding of the performance characteristics of the AVHRR observations relative to surface vegetation conditions.  Factors related to instrument precision and calibration, atmospheric attenuation and off-nadir viewing create deviations of the NDVI observations unrelated to vegetation dynamics.  Deviations in excess of 50% between the satellite and equivalent ground observations are possible if no effort is made to account for these effects.  In addition, off-nadir viewing causes spatio-temporal variations in the measurements and cloud occurrence reduces temporal resolution below the AVHRR\'s daily repeat cycle.  It appears possible to reduce these errors to approximately +/- 10% (+/- 0.1 NDVI) with at least a monthly time resolution if all of the observation attributes are addressed adequately.  Much of the remaining error resides in atmospheric variability, uncertainties in off-nadir views and loss of sensor precision of large solar zenith angles.  A global measure of vegetation green foliage dynamics with a measurement precision of +/- 10% and a monthly time resolution may not yet meet the exacting needs of some biospheric modelers, but it is, in fact, remarkable, considering that this possibility was not even conceived when the AVHRR was designed.

The TM and SPOT scenes were registered to map projection with subpixel accuracy, but the mountainous character of the study region required the use of digital elevation data for the compensation of relief induced distortions.  Our radiometric comparison of the TM and SPOT sensors involved an analysis of the calibration accuracy and a comparison of spectral greenness and brightness features which can be obtained from the two systems.  The calibration assessments were primarily based upon the apparent reflectances of bare soil reference targets, and the in-flight calibration of both sensor systems was found in accordance with the respective specifications.  For the comparative analysis of spectral features we used an extended set of targets, representing a wide range of vegetated and nonvegetated cover types.  In order to directly relate the image-based relations to those obtained from field radiometry data, we had to correct the TM and SPOT data for atmospheric absorption, scattering and pixel adjacency effects.

This study was conducted using the Systeme Probatoire d\'Observation de le Terre (SPOT) satellite images and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data to separate five major soils in a tallgrass prairie near Manhattan, Kansas.  The high resolution SPOT satellite images were integrated with DEM data.  The soils were sampled and classified using conventional soil survey procedures.  A canonical transformation technique was used to extract the important soil features from SPOT and DEM data.  A pairwise transformed divergence analysis was also conducted to evaluate the several canonical variables in order to sufficiently separate the soils.  Consequently, two canonical variables derived from training samples were selected.  Our results suggest that canonically transformed data were superior to combined SPOT and DEM data.  High resolution SPOT images and DEM data can be used to aid second-order soil surveys in grasslands.', 'UNIV GEORGIA,DEPT AGRON,ATHENS,GA 30602.

While existing studies have explored methods for large-scale monitoring of urban sprawl, most of them rely on the collection of manually labeled training samples for supervised classification. Additionally, previous studies generally focused on inland urban sprawl, neglecting the process of urban sprawl towards sea areas, known as seaward urban sprawl, which has profound ecological implications for coastal ecosystems. Here we develop a fully automatic algorithm for detecting urban sprawl, named Fully Automatic Detection of Urban Sprawl (FADUS), using the time-series Landsat imagery without manually collecting training samples or existing urban maps for reference. FADUS automatically generates initial samples through a sequential binary unsupervised clustering technique and then updates them by removing the spectral outliers to obtain a high-quality training set for subsequent supervised classification. A tidal module is included in FADUS to avoid pseudo-urban changes caused by tidal fluctuations so that both inland and seaward urban sprawl can be detected. By applying the algorithm to 75 coastal cities in China, the most rapidly urbanizing region in the world, we uncovered a neglected but dramatic seaward urban sprawl process that has converted sea areas to urban space since 1985. Our results indicate that 9904.36 km2 of coastal wetlands and nearshore seawater areas have been converted to land area, of which 44.83% is currently covered by built-up area. With our method, the fully automatic detection of urban dynamics is now possible for both coastal and inland cities worldwide.

However, complex human-environment interactions make it difficult to accurately isolate urban effects in UHII evolutions due to unstable non-urban references. This study provided the first test on the sensitivity of surface UHII (SUHII) trend estimate to seven methods of non-urban reference delineation across 281 Chinese cities. The corresponding seven non-urban references include administrative non-urban areas, administrative non-urban areas excluding extreme elevations, administrative low plant areas, suburb, outer suburb, outer suburbs progressively excluding unstable areas interfered by evident greening/desertification trends and the SUHI footprint of neighboring cities, respectively. Results revealed that the selection of different non-urban references significantly altered SUHII and the nature of observed surface thermal island (heat or cold) in 74% and 8% of cities, respectively. Besides, due to diverse and inconsistent land use and land cover changes across and nearby non-urban areas, the way of nonurban reference delineation also affected the amplitude and even direction of statistically significant SUHII trends in 41% and 21% of cities, respectively. Among the seven methods, the use of suburb which was collectively interfered by urban and non-urban changing factors, produced a large number of misestimated significant downtrends (2.7-4.5 times more cities than other methods) and was therefore in general not recommended. Administrative non-urban areas were not suitable to cities with evident greening/desertification trends, yet the applicability can be largely enhanced by removing areas with extreme elevations. Low plant areas were in general feasible, except for the cities with suburban low plants additionally warmed up by urban areas. Outer suburb was relatively the optimal, particularly the areas with all concerned interferences excluded. Overall, this study provided empirical evidence supporting the need to use stable non-urban references for reliable trend estimate of urban-induced SUHII variations.

Peatland fire likelihood is crucial as these ecosystems serve as natural fire breaks under normal hydrological conditions but can easily turn into fuel sources under drought conditions. Furthermore, peatland fires have significant implications for atmospheric pollution, releasing fine particulates, carbon, and mercury emissions. Current frameworks for estimating wildfire likelihood predominantly rely on fuel-moisture indices developed for upland environments, which cannot adequately capture the hydrological and fuel-moisture conditions specific to peatlands. Additionally, common fuel-moisture indices are reliant on station-derived meteorological data, which are scarce in remote areas and therefore imprecise over large portions of sub-Arctic Canada and the boreal forest.Remote sensing data represents a proxy for near real-time surface conditions for remote locations, such as moisture and vegetation, where a time series of remotely-sensed metrics provides information about patterns and trends in local conditions over longer periods. With this in mind, we used SAR (Sentinel-1), multispectral (Sentinel-2) and human infrastructure data as a predictor of wildfire probability in treed peatlands of Canada. We developed a fire probability model based on metrics drawn from a seasonally decomposed time series of SAR backscatter and common multispectral indices of greenness, soil moisture and vegetation moisture. Sample sites were derived from an existing treed peatland map, then the Canadian Forest Service National Burned Area Composite dataset was used to identify fire events within those areas. This study presents a robust and versatile framework for training fire probability models that leverage remote sensing data and temporally-invariant ancillary predictors. Fire probability in peatland locations, given current conditions, was predicted through a model algorithm called extreme gradient boosting. To obtain fire probabilities over a four-week timeframe, the output of the binary classifier was calibrated, transforming its raw scores into more accurate probabilities.This approach showcases the effectiveness of machine learning methods in harnessing seasonally-decomposed remotely sensed time-series to improve fire prediction. The most important predictors of fire likelihood in treed peatlands were found to be multispectral moisturerelated indices (Tasseled cap Wetness and Normalized Difference Moisture Index) and the distance to human infrastructure, which may indicate an overrepresentation of human-caused fires in the predictions. Using subsets of predictors, different iterations of the model demonstrate that incorporating SAR backscatter data can enhance the accuracy of fire likelihood predictions. However, models relying solely on SAR data exhibited lower performance, indicating limited applicability of SAR backscatter in treed peatlands without more advanced filtering and a correction method.The fire likelihood model presented here adds seasonally-detrended time series metrics from remote sensing observations to inform fire risk, independent from meteorological data. Such models could be implemented for a near-real time assessment of fire conditions that could complement the existing framework for fire risk predictions in Canada.', '[Pelletier, N.; Millard, K.; Darling, S.] Carleton Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, 1125 Colonel Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.', 'Carleton UniversityRP Pelletier, N (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, 1125 Colonel Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.', 'nicolaspelletier@cmail.carleton.ca', NULL, 'Natural Resources Canada\'s (Canadian Forest Service) Emergency   Management Strategy Wildfire Component Ramp;D grants [FIRENFC-24];   National Sciences and Engineering Research Council [RGPIN-2022-04874];   Carleton University [186207]', 'This work was supported by Natural Resources Canada\'s (Canadian Forest   Service) Emergency Management Strategy Wildfire Component R & amp;D   grants [grant number FIRENFC-24], National Sciences and Engineering   Research Council [grant number RGPIN-2022-04874] and Carleton University   [grant number 186207].', 104, 0, 0, 12, 12, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Even for experienced farmers, estimating this relationship is difficult because external factors such as weather can affect the growth rate of plants. Satellite remote sensing techniques have good potential for the modelling of fodder biomass and quality. However, more accurate grassland cut dates are needed. Unfortunately, current cut detection methods vary in both form, function and accuracy and a common framework for cut detection does not yet exist, especially for in-season cut estimation. The aim of this study is to develop an improved methodology for Austrian fodder production systems that can be used for both post-season and in-season cut detection. In the first case, cuts are detected at the end of the vegetation period and used for post-season assessment at national and regional levels. In the second case, cuts are detected in near-real-time during the season, and they can be used to model yield and quality. The approach is tested across the Austrian landscape on mown grasslands using freely available Copernicus Sentinel-2 imagery on the Google Earth Engine (GEE). The method uses a fitted NDVI curve obtained by iteratively smoothing the upper envelope of the actual observations using the Whittaker smoother. Cuts are detected by meeting a threshold in the difference between the fitted NDVI curve and the actual observed NDVI values. Additional innovative steps were developed to reduce the impact of cloud cover on the results for timely and accurate cut detection, including a gradient boosting algorithm to detect false positive cuts due to missed clouds. A set of rules for the method was trained on 97 plots and validated on a further 502 plots over three years (2020, 2021 and 2022). The method performed well in plots with two to four cuts per season, but occasionally struggled in more intensively managed systems, most likely due to a rule preventing two cuts within 27 days. A pooled post-season cut date detection f-score of 0.79 suggests that the method can accurately detect cuts, with absolute detection errors of <5 days. The main misclassifications were the results of (thin and semi-transparent) clouds being erroneously detected as cuts. With an f-score of 0.80 and total absolute delayed detection of approximately 6 days, the inseason cut date detection performs similarly to the post-season configuration. This indicates a high potential for near-real-time applications. Our results moreover indicate a general improvement of existing methodologies despite performing the cut detection across the fragmented, mountainous and diverse Austrian landscape.

Halo formation is likely to be the indirectly result of interactions between relatively healthy predator and herbivore populations. To reduce the risk of predation, herbivores preferentially graze close to the safety of the reef, potentially affecting the presence and size of the halo. Reef halos are readily visible in remotely sensed imagery, and monitoring their presence and changes in size may therefore offer clues as to how predator and herbivore populations are faring. However, manually identifying and measuring halos is slow and limits the spatial and temporal scope of studies. There are currently no existing tools to automatically identify single reef halos and measure their size to speed up their identification and improve our ability to quantify their variability over space and time. Here we present a set of convolutional neural networks aimed at identifying and measuring reef halos from very high-resolution satellite imagery (i.e., similar to 0.6 m spatial resolution). We show that deep learning algorithms can successfully detect and measure reef halos with a high degree of accuracy (F1 = 0.824), thereby enabling faster, more accurate spatio-temporal monitoring of halo size. This tool will aid in the global study of reef halos, and potentially coral reef ecosystem monitoring, by facilitating our discovery of the ecological dynamics underlying reef halo presence and variability.', '[Franceschini, Simone; Meier, Amelia C.; Suan, Aviv; Stokes, Kaci; Roy, Samapriya; Madin, Elizabeth M.

We further show that the earlier GUD with climate change was offset roughly by 24.4 & PLUSMN; 3.7% due to the increase of wind. Higher winds potentially caused delayed GUD by changes in soil conditions and differences between daytime and night-time temperatures.

A physical surface energy balance (SEB)-based LST downscaling method (DTsEB) is developed to downscale coarse remotely sensed thermal infrared LST products with fine-resolution visible and near-infrared data. The DTsEB method is advantageous for its ability to mechanically interrelate surface variables contributing to the spatial variation of LST, to quantitatively weigh the contributions of each related variable within a physical framework, and to efficaciously avoid the subjective selection of scaling factors and the establishment of statistical regression relationships. The applicability of the DTsEB method was tested by downscaling 12 scenes of 990 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and aggregated Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) LST products to 90 m resolution at six overpass times between 2005 and 2015 over three 9.9 km by 9.9 km cropland (mixed by grass, tree, and built-up land) study areas. Three typical LST downscaling methods, namely the widely applied TsHARP, the later developed least median square regression downscaling (LMS) and the geographically weighted regression (GWR), were introduced for inter comparison. The results showed that the DTsEB method could more effectively reconstruct the subpixel spatial variations in LST within the coarse-resolution pixels and achieve a better downscaling accuracy than the TsHARP, LMS and GWR methods. The DTsEB method yielded, on average, root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 2.01 K and 1.42 K when applied to the MODIS datasets and aggregated ASTER datasets, respectively, which were lower than those obtained with the TsHARP method, with average RMSEs of 2.41 K and 1.71 K, the LMS method, with average RMSEs of 2.35 K and 1.63 K, and the GWR method, with average RMSEs of 2.38 K and 1.64 K, respectively. The contributions of the related surface variables to the subpixel spatial variation in the LST varied both spatially and temporally and were different from each other. In summary, the DTsEB method was demonstrated to outperform the TsHARP, LMS, and GWR methods and could be used as a good alternative for downscaling LST products from coarse to fine resolution with high robustness and accuracy.', '[Hu, Yongxin; Tang, Ronglin; Jiang, Xiaoguang; Li, Zhao-Liang; Jiang, Yazhen] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China.

Substantial efforts have been made to measure SIF with ground-based sensing systems, but field observation data for various plant functional types are still sparse. This is partly due to the limited availability of commercial SIF measurement systems, the relatively high cost of hyperspectral spectroradiometers, and the difficulties of sensor calibration and maintenance in the field. We developed a filter-based smart near-surface remote sensing system for SIF (4S-SIF) to overcome the technical challenges of monitoring SIF in the field, which also decreased the sensor cost, thus enabling more compre-hensive spatial sampling. To retrieve SIF, we combined ultra-narrow bandpass filters (full width half maximum <1.3 nm) and photodiode detectors to observe electromagnetic radiation at specific wavelengths (757, 761, and 770 nm). We confirmed that the spectral and radiometric performance of the bandpass filters was satisfactory to retrieve SIF by comparing them to a high-spectral-resolution spectroradiometer that served as a reference. In particular, we confirmed that the digital numbers (DNs) from 4S-SIF exhibited linear relationships with the DN from the reference spectroradiometer in each band (R2 > 0.99). In addition, we developed equations to correct for temperature-induced changes in filter transmittance, such that SIF can be reliably extracted in outdoor en-vironments without the need to actively stabilize the temperature. Furthermore, we confirmed that the SIF signal from 4S-SIF had a strong linear relationship with the reference spectroradiometer-based SIF. Importantly, this relationship held even when the physiological mechanisms of the plant were altered by a herbicide treatment that induced substantial changes in the SIF signal (R2 = 0.85, relative RMSE = 0.22), which indicated that 4S-SIF could be used to retrieve SIF. We believe that 4S-SIF will be a useful tool for collecting in-situ SIF data across multiple spatial and temporal scales.', '[Kim, Jongmin; Ryu, Youngryel] Seoul Natl Univ, Interdisciplinary Program Landscape Architecture, Seoul, South Korea.

To improve chla estimation in oligo-and mesotrophic lakes, we developed Bayesian probabilistic neural networks (BNNs) for the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Cover Instrument (OLCI) and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Imager (MSI). The BNNs were built using an in situ dataset of oligo-and mesotrophic water bodies (1755 observations from 178 systems; median chla: 5.11 mg m- 3, standard deviation: 10.76 mg m-3) and provide a per-pixel uncertainty percentage associated with retrieved chla. Shifts of oligo-and meso-trophic systems into the eutrophic regime, characterised by higher biomass levels, are widespread. To account for phytoplankton biomass fluctuation, a set of eutrophic lakes (167 observations from 31 systems) were included in this study (maximum chla 68 mg m-3). The BNNs were evaluated through five assessments including single day and time series match-ups with OLCI and MSI. OLCI BNN accuracy gains of >25% and MSI BNN accuracy gains of >15% were achieved in the assessments when compared to chla reference algorithms for oligotrophic waters (chla <= 8 mg m-3). In comparison to the reference algorithms, the accuracy gains of the BNNs decreased as chla and trophic levels increased. To measure the quality of the provided BNN uncertainty estimate, we calculated the prediction interval coverage probability (PICP), Sharpness and mean absolute calibration difference (MACD) metrics. The associated BNN chla uncertainty estimate included the reference in situ chla values for most ob-servations (PICP >= 75%) across the different performance assessments. Further analysis showed that the BNN chla uncertainty estimate was not constantly well-calibrated across different evaluation strategies (Sharpness 1.7-6, MACD 0.04-0.25). BNN uncertainties were used to test two chla improvement strategies: 1) identifying and filtering uncertain chla estimates using scene-specific thresholds, and 2) selecting the most accurate prior atmospheric correction algorithm per individual satellite observation to retain chla with the lowest BNN un-certainty. Both strategies increased the quality of the chla result and demonstrated the significance of uncertainty estimation. This study serves as research on Bayesian machine learning for the estimation and visualisation of chla and associated retrieval uncertainty to develop harmonised products across OLCI and MSI for small and large oligo-and mesotrophic lakes.', '[Werther, Mortimer; Varley, Adam; Hunter, Peter D.; Tyler, Andrew N.; Spyrakos, Evangelos] Univ Stirling, Fac Nat Sci, Earth & Planetary Observat Sci EPOS, Biol & Environm Sci, Stirling, Scotland.

Remotely sensed data and spatial modeling enable mapping of tree species presence and distribution. Following an assessment of tree species identified in the sample-based National Forest Inventory (NFI), we mapped 37 tree species over the 650-Mha, forest-dominated ecosystems of Canada representing 2019 conditions. Landsat imagery and related spectral indices, geographic and climate data, elevation derivatives, and remote sensing-derived phenology are used as predictor variables trained with cali-bration samples from Canada\'s NFI using the Random Forests machine learning algorithm. Based upon prior knowledge of tree species distributions, classification models were implemented on a regional basis, meaning only the tree species that are expected in a given mapping region were modeled using local calibration samples. Modeling resulted in class membership probabilities values for each regionally eligible tree species for all treed pixels as well as an indicator of attribution confidence derived from the distance in feature space between the two leading classes. Accuracy assessment was conducted using independent validation data also drawn from the NFI following the same selection rules and indicated an overall accuracy of 93.1% +/- 0.1% (95%-confidence interval). Predictor variables informing on geographic, climatic and topographic conditions had the largest importance on the classification models. Nationally, the most common leading tree species were black spruce (Picea mariana; 203 Mha or 57.3% of the treed area), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides; 34.7 Mha, 9.8%), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta; 21.1 Mha, 5.9%). Regionally, there was ecozone-level dominance of other tree species, including subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa; Montane Cordillera), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla; Pacific Maritime), and balsam fir (Abies balsamea; Atlantic Maritime). Based upon the per-pixel class membership probabilities, species assemblages akin to those in forest inventories can also be produced. Further, given the calibrated reflectance of Landsat imagery, the methods presented herein can be implemented over a time series of images.

This has multiple causes, including the presence of impurities (such as mineral dust, carbonaceous particles, algae and cryoconite), and debris. Also glacier melt can induce an albedo decrease by initiating a melt-albedo feedback cycle. The extent of this albedo decrease and its spatial variability in different mountain ranges however are poorly known. In this study, we assess albedo changes on a selection of Alpine glaciers (542 glaciers > 0.1 km(2)) by deriving eight albedo metrics from MODIS MOD10A1 satellite observations over a time period of 20 years (2000-2019). Albedo metrics include the start and end of the ablation season and its length, calculated through the selection of a threshold (albedo = 0.4) to separate melting ice from snow. We further calculated the number of ice melt days, integral of the length of the ablation season, minimum annual albedo, mean summer albedo and mean annual albedo. We identified significant trends in all metrics for a large percentage of glacier cells. A negative trend in minimum albedo (-0.06 decade(-1) on average) was identified for 56% of glacier cells, and 70% of glaciers; a positive trend in the length of season (+18 days decade(-1) on average) was identified for 11% of glacier cells and 19% of glaciers. Changes in minimum albedo occur mostly around the glacier median elevation, while for other metrics (e.g. start and length of season) changes are more frequent at the glacier termini (i.e. below 25th elevation percentile). We further investigated the relationship between the metrics and climate (downscaled ERA5 reanalysis data) and topographic (ALOS AW3D30 DEM) variability; we found that average summer temperature and elevation are the most significant proxies for all metrics (maximum correlation = 0.40 between elevation and minimum albedo) compared to spring temperature and other topographic variables. Finally, we looked at the ability of the albedo metrics to represent annual and summertime glacier mass balance of 31 selected Alpine glaciers in the World Glacier Monitoring Service database, finding significant correlations between minimum and summertime albedo and annual mass balance (R-2 = 0.44 for minimum albedo and 0.40 for summertime albedo using all observations). Considering individual glaciers, all showed significant correlations with minimum albedo, and some of them are strongly correlated (e.g. Argentiere: R-2 = 0.84, Saint Sorlin R-2 = 0.88).

Previous studies demonstrated the potential of using multispectral satellite imagery for classifying tree species. However, methods that can map tree species in mixed forest stands on a large scale are lacking. We propose an innovative method for mapping the proportions of tree species using Sentinel-2 imagery. A convolutional neural network was used to quantify the per-pixel basal area proportions of tree species considering the neighbouring environment (spectral-spatial deep learning). A nested U-shaped neural network (UNet++) architecture was implemented. We produced a map of the entire Wallonia Region (southern Belgium). Nine species or groups of species were considered: Spruce genus, Oak genus, Beech, Douglas fir, Pine genus, Poplar genus, Larch genus, Birch genus, and remaining species. The training dataset for the convolutional neural network model was prepared using a map of forest parcels extracted from the public forest administration\'s geodatabase of Wallonia. The accuracy of the predicted map covering the region was independently assessed using data from the regional forest inventory of Wallonia. A robust assessment method for tree species proportions maps was proposed for assessing the (1) majority species, (2) species composition (presence or absence), and (3) species proportions (proportion values). The achieved value of indicator OA(maj )(0.73) shows that our approach can map the majority tree species in mixed and pure forest stands. Indicators MS (0.89), MPS (0.72) and MUS (0.83) support that the model can predict the species composition in most cases in the study area. Spruce genus, Oak genus, Beech, and Douglas fir achieved the best results, with PAs and UAs close to or higher than 0.70. Particularly, high performance was achieved for detecting Oak genus and Beech in low area proportions: PAs and UAs higher than 0.70 from the 0.4 proportion. Predicted proportions had a R-adj (2)of 0.50. The proposed method, which uses spectral-spatial deep learning to map the proportions of tree species, is innovative because it was adapted to the complexity of mixed forests and spatial resolution of current satellite imagery. Additionally, it optimises the use of available forest data in the model conception by considering all pixels from pure stands to highly mixed forest stands. When forest inventories are available in a broad sense, that is, georeferenced areas with the proportions of tree species, this method is highly reproducible and applicable at a large scale, offering potential for use in forest management.', '[Bolyn, Corentin; Lejeune, Philippe; Michez, Adrien; Latte, Nicolas] Uliege Gembloux Agrobio Tech, TERRA Teaching & Res Ctr Forest Is Life, Passage Deportes 2, BE-5030 Gembloux, Belgium.

Deriving temporally resolved and spatially explicit maps of parameters of interest has been the subject of intense research. However, deriving products from optical sensors is typically hampered by cloud contamination and the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. In this work we rely on the HIghly Scalable Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (HISTARFM) algorithm to generate long gap-free time series of Landsat surface reflectance data by fusing MODIS and Landsat reflectances. An artificial neural network is trained on PROSAIL inversion to predict monthly biophysical variables at 30 m spatial resolution with asso-ciated, realistic uncertainty bars. We emphasize the need for a more thorough analysis of uncertainty, and propose a general and scalable approach to combine both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties by exploiting Monte Carlo (MC) dropout techniques from the trained artificial network and the propagation of HISTARFM uncertainties through the model, respectively. A model recalibration was performed in order to provide reliable uncertainties. We provide new high resolution products of several key variables to quantify the terrestrial biosphere: Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR), Canopy Water Content (CWC) and Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) are at 30 m Landsat spatial resolution and over large continental areas. Two study areas are considered: the large heterogeneous but moderately cloud covered contiguous United States, and the homogeneous but largely cloud covered Amazonia. The produced vegetation products largely agree with the test dataset (R = 0.90, RMSE = 0.80 m2/m2 and ME = 0.12 m2/m2 for LAI, and R = 0.98, RMSE = 0.07 and ME = 0.01 for FAPAR) providing low error and high accuracy. Additionally, the validation considers a thorough comparison with operational and largely validated medium resolution products, such as the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Copernicus Global Land Service. Our products presented a good agreement and consistency with both MODIS (R = 0.84 and R = 0.85 for LAI and FAPAR, respectively) and Copernicus (R = 0.92 and R = 0.91 for LAI and FAPAR, respectively).

Field data required to derive these relationships are not readily available in many cases. We developed a model to estimate plot-level aboveground biomass density (AGBD) directly from large-footprint lidar waveform measurements. An individual tree-based aboveground biomass (AGB)-height allometric relationship was scaled up to the plot level using lidar-waveform sensed tree height and crown size distribution characteristics. The AGBD was estimated based on a waveform/foliage profile-weighted height-based allometric equation. The AGBD-height scaling exponent was then built on the allometric relationships of tree height with stem diameter and crown volume with tree height. Global vegetation structure data analysis demonstrated that one general model (scaling exponent similar to 1.6-1.8) works reasonably well across all global forest biomes except boreal forests (scaling exponent similar to 0.9). We applied the model to estimate above-ground biomass in two distinct geographic regions: temperate deciduous/conifer forests in the northeastern USA and a montane conifer forest in Sierra National Forest in California. Local vegetation structural data analysis leads to a consistent height scaling exponent for these two distinct biomes, slightly different from the global data analysis results. This model produced optimal AGBD estimates using the local height scaling exponent value. Adequate AGBD estimates with the general height scaling exponent value were also provided by our model. Our analysis suggests one general allometric relationship between plot-level AGBD and large-footprint lidar wave-forms. Integrating local structure allometric relationships improve the predictive accuracy of the model. Our model outperformed the lidar height metrics-based approach for AGBD estimates and overcame the biomass underestimation problem using height metrics for high biomass regions. This model could potentially serve as a general and robust model for monitoring forest carbon stocks using large-footprint lidar waveform measurements such as the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission at the continental and global scales. The model could be a framework for integrating a demography-based terrestrial ecosystem model and GEDI global mission measurements to improve global carbon stock and flux estimates.', '[Ni-Meister, Wenge; Rojas, Alejandro] Hunter Coll CUNY, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, New York, NY 10065 USA.

However, the temporal dependence of the spectral diversity - biodiversity relationship is poorly understood, in part due to the diffi-culties of obtaining consistent measurements across space and time. Using leaf pigments and leaf and canopy reflectance throughout a growing season in the Cedar Creek prairie biodiversity experiment, we explored phenological effects on the scale dependence of the spectral biodiversity - biodiversity relationship. Leaf reflectance spectra displayed larger among-species variation than leaf pigments, indicating that leaf reflectance contained more information for distinguishing species than some leaf trait measurements. At the canopy scale, spectral variation derived using reflectance was mainly driven by among-species variation. The canopy scale spectral diversity was also influenced by changing vegetation percent cover, key phenological events (e.g., flowering), and disturbance (drought). Our results revealed that contrasting phenological patterns of spectral diversity metrics emerged at leaf and canopy scales. Because a misunderstanding of these contrasting temporal effects across spatial scales can lead to possible misinterpretations of the spectral diversity - biodiversity rela-tionship or of their underlying causes, more research effort is needed to understand these cross-scale temporal effects.', '[Wang, Ran; Gamon, John A.] Univ Nebraska Lincoln, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.

Recently, deep learning algorithms have shown promising results in land-cover mapping with high spatial resolution (HSR) imagery. However, the limitation of the annotation and the divergence of the multi-sensor images always challenge the transferability of deep learning, thus hindering city-level or national-level mapping. In this paper, we propose a scheme to leverage small-scale airborne images with labels (source) for unlabeled large-scale spaceborne image (target) classification. Considering the sensor characteristics, a Cross-Sensor Land-cOVEr framework, called LoveCS, is introduced to address the difficulties of the spatial resolution inconsistency and spectral differences. As for the structural design, cross-sensor normalization is proposed to automatically learn sensor-specific normalization weights, thereby narrowing the spectral differences hierarchically. Furthermore, a dense multi-scale decoder is proposed to effectively fuse the multi-scale features from different sensors. As for the model optimization, self-training domain adaptation is adopted, and multi-scale pseudo-labeling is proposed to reduce the scale divergence brought by the spatial resolution inconsistency. The effectiveness of LoveCS was tested on data from the three cities of Nanjing, Changzhou, and Wuhan in China. The comprehensive results all show that LoveCS is superior to the existing domain adaptation methods in cross-sensor tasks, and has good generalizability.

Remote sensing provides an effective tool for quantifying the trophic state of inland waters by associating the trophic state index (TSI) with optically active water quality parameters. However, limited by the satellite coverage range and operation time, the long-term changes in the trophic state of the EPL region have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to fill this gap by generating a 35-year (1986-2020) TSI dataset of lakes in the eastern plain based on Landsat images. The TSI inversion algorithm based on the algal biomass index (ABI) was designed for Landsat series after consistency analysis. The seasonal variations of the TSI showed the highest TSI (62.0 +/- 11.4) in summer and the lowest TSI (51.6 +/- 8.0) in winter, with uncertainties caused by the limitation of ABI for extremely turbid waters and the number of Landsat seasonal images. The TSI of the EPLs increased over the past 35 years by about 8.2%. Four change patterns were defined for the long-term interannual TSI variations: increasing trend less than 50% (Mode 1) or more than 50% (Mode 2), breaking points that show a surge trend (Mode 3), and decreasing trend (Mode 4). The contribution of meteorological and anthropogenic factors was calculated using a generalized linear model, which revealed that the eutrophication of inland lakes in the EPL region is mainly affected by industrial wastewater discharge and urban expansion. The influence of these explanatory variables becomes more complex with an increase in lake area. Our research provides an estimation of the TSI for the first 35-year basin-scale in the EPL region and a comprehensive evaluation of the driving factors of inland water eutrophication. The results can be used for the effective management and restoration of lakes.', '[Hu, Minqi; Ma, Ronghua; Xiong, Junfeng; Cao, Zhigang; Xue, Kun] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.

However, it is challenging to utilize the other factors related to the GNSS-R process, such as the geometry and sea state, as the input in GMF given their complicated effects. The use of a fully connected network (FCN) has been recently proposed, but the overfitting occurs at high wind speed due to the non-uniform wind distribution, and some information is undesirably forfeited due to artificially extracting features from DDMs. To this end, we propose a deep learning-based end-to-end modified convolutional neural network (CNN) model, which applies the cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching. A multimodal approach is utilized where the convolutional layers extract effective DDM features at first. Then, they are fused with the auxiliary information, including the geolocation of the specular point, incidence angle, range corrected gain (RCG), uncertainty of bistatic radar cross section (BRCS), and significant wave height (SWH). Further, multiple fully connected layers compose the remainder of the network\'s layers. At the last step, CDF matching is applied to correct the system deviation of CNN winds. We found that the root mean square error (RMSE) and bias of wind speed retrievals are 1.53 m/s and - 0.097 m/s, respectively, within 0-25 m/s when the proposed method is used. Notably, the bias is reduced by 51%, compared with the FCN architecture, while the RMSE of the retrievals at 12-25 m/s is improved by 12%. Moreover, the RMSE and bias against the incidence angle differ no more than 0.35 m/s and 0.078 m/s, while those against RCG differ less than 0.24 m/s and 0.061 m/s, respectively. Time-series analyses indicated that the wind speed retrievals of the proposed model are in line with the referenced wind speeds. We identified a temporal increase of the retrieval bias, driven by the downward trend of DDM observation in the cyclone global navigation satellite system (CYGNSS) Version 2.1 inadequately calibrated products.', '[Guo, Wenfei; Du, Hao; Guo, Chi] Wuhan Univ, GNSS Res Ctr, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP)-based 3-D dust detection and routine sampling capability, with the accurate dust mass extinction efficiency from Dust Constraints from joint Observational Modelling-experimental analysis (DustCOMM) dataset, has made it possible to estimate the climatology of Asian dust mass loading (DML) and its transport flux. This study draws on this to provide new insights into the Asian dust cycle, especially the variability of its mass-weighted dust transport central axis (TCA), the contribution of different desert sources to its downstream effects, and the resulting dust budgets in terrestrial and oceanic regions. Dust aerosols emitted from the East Asian and Central Asian deserts together form a heavy dust transport belt stretching from the Taklimakan Desert (TD) and Gobi Desert (GD) to the Pacific Ocean. South Asian dust from the Thar Desert (ThD) can also affect southern China by crossing the Hengduan Mountains and the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. The dust TCA is controlled by the terrain of northwest inland China, but shifts in remote regions in the range of 35-50 degrees N due to the western Pacific subtropical high and Aleutian low, and it trend towards a zonal straight line as the altitude increases. The dust transport contribution of the East Asian deserts to the mainland of China and adjacent sea is about 7 times than that of South Asia, with the annual transport fluxes being 214.28 and 30.43 Tg, respectively. The GD dominates the contribution of Asian deserts to the downstream effects and accounts for about 60% of the dust. This can be attributed to its maximum transport flux being near the surface, while the dust transport of the TD and ThD is above 3 km because of the blocking effect of the surrounding terrain. The deposition of Asian dust in the adjacent seas decreases significantly along the dust TCA, with the annual deposition rates being about 40.12, 20.41, and 4.01 g m(-2) in the Yellow Sea, Japan Sea and the Northwest Pacific Ocean, respectively. These new findings and quantification of the Asian dust cycle will help with validation of the simulations provided by global and regional climate models and enable further evaluation of the impact of Asian dust on various related Earth systems.', '[Han, Ying; Wang, Tianhe; Tang, Jingyi; Wang, Chengyun; Jian, Bida; Huang, Zhongwei; Huang, Jianping] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Atmospher Sci, Key Lab Semiarid Climate Change, Minist Educ, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.

The lack of global near-real-time satellite-based products restricts the application of FVC in ecosystem modeling, climate change, and vegetation phenology studies. Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) onboard Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) spacecraft provides daily spectral reflectance of the entire sunlit Earth in the near Hotspot directions. Hotspot observations (i.e., observation in Hotspot direction which has the peak backscattering reflected radiation) with only sunlit vegetation and sunlit soil components are more suitable for FVC estimation with a two-endmember mixture model as such observations exclude contributions from shaded vegetation and soil components. In this study, an algorithm for retrieving quasi-daily FVC from EPIC based on two-endmember mixture and gap fraction models is developed. Analyses of its performance predict that the average Root-Mean-Square Deviations (RMSDs) of retrievals in FVC units is below 0.050 when compared with reference values. The RMSD is 0.043 when compared to field-based Landsat reference FVC, which confirms lower retrieval uncertainty than FVC retrieved from Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellite products such as MODIS, VIIRS, and GEOV2 with RMSDs 0.049- 0.087. The comparison analyses suggest a good consistency between EPIC FVC and FVC products from LEO and geostationary (GEO) satellites sensor, SEVIRI, with RMSD values less than 0.129.

However, current methods only use single data or just simply fuse the features extracted from these two data, which may not fully exploit their complementary strength. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a unified deep learning framework containing two modules to jointly use RSI and POIs for UFZ extraction. In the first module, the complementary feature learning and fusing module, two coupled convolu-tional neural networks (CNNs) are used to learn the visual feature from RSI and social feature from POIs, respectively. Specifically, to apply CNN on discrete POIs, we convert them into a hierarchical distance heatmap, and employ CNN with the attention mechanism to extract the co-occurrence relationship of POIs in a specific UFZ for social feature representation. Afterward, we ensemble these two coupled CNNs by a feature attention based fusion strategy, to fuse the complementary features learned from RSI and POIs with adaptively learned weights in an end-to-end manner. In the second module, the UFZ spatial relationship modeling module, different from previous methods that only consider features in single UFZ, we design a spatial relation learning network, which can aggregate both local and long-range between-UFZ spatial relationship for UFZ classification. Experiments on three urban regions demonstrate that the proposed framework can take full advantage of visual, social, and spatial features learned from both RSI and POIs, and thus achieve more satisfactory result than the methods using single data or simple fusion strategy. Furthermore, we analyze the impacts of several factors on UFZ extraction, including the contributions of different category of POIs on UFZ extraction improvement, the synergy mechanism of RSI and POIs for the classification of UFZs, and the influence of using different mapping unit for UFZ mapping. The insights distilled from this study can potentially help researchers use heterogeneous data for UFZ extraction.

However, in previous studies the relationship has been found to be unstable. We hypothesise that the diversity of phenological stages is also a driver of spectral variance and could act to confound the species signal. To test this concept, intra-annual repeat spectral and botanical sampling was performed at the quadrat scale at two grassland sites, one displaying high species diversity and the other low species diversity. Six botanical metrics were used, three taxonomy based and three phenology based. Using uni-temporal linear permutation models, we found that the SVH only held at the high diversity site and only for certain metrics and at particular time points. We also tested the seasonal influence of phenological stage dominance, alongside the taxonomic and phenological diversity metrics on spectral variance using linear mixed models. A term of percentage mature leaves, alongside an interaction term of percentage mature leaves and species diversity, explained 15-25% of the model variances, depending on the spectral region used. These results indicate that the dominant canopy phenology stage is a confounding variable when examining the spectral variance-species diversity relationship. We emphasise the challenges that exist in tracking species or phenology-based metrics in grasslands using spectral variance but encourage further research that contextualises spectral variance data within seasonal plant development alongside other canopy structural and leaf traits.', '[Thornley, Rachael; White, Kevin; Verhoef, Anne] Univ Reading, Reading RG6 6AH, Berks, England.

The two approaches were used to estimate stem volume (VOL), Lorey\'s mean height (HL), Lorey\'s stem diameter (DL), and VOL per tree species in a study area in Sweden. The estimates were compared at the stand level with the harvested reference values obtained using a forest harvester. In the first phase, a helicopter acquired airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with >500 points/m2 along 50-m wide strips across the stands. These strips intersected systematic plots in phase two, where terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) was used to model DL for individual trees. In total, phase two included 99 plots across 10 boreal forest stands in Sweden (lat 62.9 degrees N, long 16.9 degrees E). The single trees were segmented in both the ALS and TLS data and linked to each other. The very-high-resolution ALS data enabled us to directly measure tree heights and also classify tree species using a convolutional neural network. Stem volume was predicted from the predicted DBH and the estimated height, using national models, and aggregated at the stand level. The study demonstrates a workflow to derive forest variables and stand-level statistics that has potential to replace many manual field inventories thanks to its time efficiency and improved accuracy. To evaluate the inventories, we estimated bias, RMSE, and precision, expressed as standard error. The laser-scanning-based inventory provided estimates with an accuracy considerably higher than the field inventory. The RMSE was 17 m3/ha (7.24%), 0.9 m (5.63%), and 16 mm (5.99%) for VOL, HL, and DL respectively. The tree species classification was generally successful and improved the three species-specific VOL estimates by 9% to 74%, compared to field estimates.

Regional mass loss during the ablation season is influenced by air temperature, but the importance of other factors such as changes in surface albedo remains uncertain. We examine changes in surface albedo for 17 glaciated regions of western North America as documented in a 20-year record (2000 to 2019) of MODIS daily snow albedo (MOD10A1). Trend analysis reveals that albedo declined for 4% to 81% of the albedo grid cells, and the largest negative trends were situated south of 60 degrees N and in the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta. Sen\'s slope estimates indicate that 15 of 17 regions showed a decline of which the majority of the largest declines occurred within 100 m of glacier median elevation, suggesting that these declines are driven by a rise of the transient snowline. For most regions, albedo correlates strongly to temperature, and albedo trend in the Chugach region of Alaska, the South Coast, Southern Interior and Central and Southern Rockies of Canada show a significant relationship to aerosols optical depth. Temperature is approximately 2-6 times more predictive of the variation in albedo than AOD for the majority of regions, except the Southern Interior and Southern Rockies where albedo shows a greater dependence on AOD. Investigation of broadband albedo (MCD43A3) for snow grid cells above glacier median elevation in the Central and Southern Rockies shows that declines in the visible and near infrared portions of the spectrum are linked to the presence of forest fire generated aerosols. The results of this study indicate that glacier surface mass balance experiences a regional dependence on forest fire generated light absorbing particles.', '[Williamson, Scott N.; Menounos, Brian] Univ Northern British Columbia, Geog Earth & Environm Sci & Nat Resources & Envir, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada.

In this study, we first assess the ability of IS2 to estimate thermodynamic ice growth and dynamic thickening during the ice-growing season in the central Arctic Ocean. As an indicator of the thermodynamic ice growth, we use 10 thermistor string-based sea ice mass balance array (SIMBA) buoys deployed at a scale of -50 km from the Icebreaker Polarstern during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition. We collect IS2 data within 20 km buffer distance from the individual buoys, and calculate the mode, median, and mean of the IS2-derived ice thickness. The IS2 modal thickness shows the least bias (-0.169 m) with the buoy ice thickness, representing level ice thickness. In addition, the increasing rate of the IS2 modal thickness is close to the thermodynamic ice growth with a small bias of -0.054 cm/day. However, the increasing rates of the IS2 median and mean thickness are greater than the thermodynamic ice growth by about 0.114 cm/day and 0.198 cm/day, respectively, because they also include ice growth caused by thickness redistribution during dynamic deformation. The dynamic contributions may account for 26.1 +/- 10.3% and 34.4 +/- 10.1% of the total increase of the IS2 median and mean thickness, respectively. Within a - 50 km radius area from the MOSAiC Central Observatory, IS2 measurements exhibit that the ridge fraction increased from <2% in November to -4% in March (-0.029%/day of average increasing rate) and ridge height increased about 0.047 cm/day during the same period. However, lead formation does not show significant contributions to the dynamic ice thickening because leads are temporary features lasting only 2-3 days. Although there are considerable uncertainties in IS2 ice thickness estimation and IS2-buoy thickness comparison, this study emphasizes the importance of combining measurements by IS2 and SIMBA buoys to explain the regional sea ice mass balance with separating the thermodynamic and dynamic contributions.', '[Koo, YoungHyun; Xie, Hongjie; Ackley, Stephen F.; Mestas-Nunez, Alberto M.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.

We developed an algorithm to retrieve the aerosol optical central height (AOCH) of absorbing aerosols by using, for the first time, the oxygen (O-2) A and B absorption band measurements from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) over dark targets. For the retrieval, narrow band radiance at seven channels ranging from ultraviolet (UV) to shortwave infrared (SWIR) are convolved from TROPOMI hyperspectral measurements. Subsequently, cloudy pixels are screened out by using the slope of spectral reflectance, while aerosol types (dust and smoke) are classified by the wavelength dependence of aerosol path radiance in conjunction with UV aerosol index. Surface reflectance over land is derived from the MODIS surface bi-directional reflectance climatology, and over water from the GOME-2 surface Lambert-equivalent reflectivity (LER) database. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) and AOCH are retrieved through an approach of look-up-table accounting for AERONET-based dust and smoke optical properties. For multiple smoke and dust plume events around the world, our retrieved AOCH values agree with space-borne lidar CALIOP counterparts, with a mean bias of <0.15 km and a correlation coefficient of 0.85-0.87. Due in part to adding the O-2 B band, our retrieval represents an aerosol extinction peak height better than the TROPOMI operational Level 2 aerosol layer height retrieved from only the O-2 A band. The latter shows 0.5-2 km low bias, especially over land. Finally, the high potential of AOCH for improving surface PM2.5 estimates is also illustrated with a case study in which the high bias of surface PM2.5 in MERRA-2 data is corrected after being scaled by the retrieved AOCH.', '[Chen, Xi; Wang, Jun; Zhang, Huanxin; Garcia, Lorena Castro] Univ Iowa, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.

A key processing step of airborne hyperspectral data is the atmospheric correction that compensates for path radiance, aerosol effects and gas absorption to derive an accurate surface reflectance that can be compared across time and space. In practice, routine correction procedures are often customized for various platforms without fully reporting or checking the errors systematically in the atmospheric correction. Such errors can have significant effects on downstream analyses such as vegetation indices or trait retrievals, and not all subsequent analyses are equally affected by the accuracy of reflectance retrievals. In this study, we examined the errors in three types of atmospheric correction methods including a radiative transfer model (RTM), empirical line correction (ELC) and a hybrid method that combines elements of the two via Bayesian inference. Our results revealed that the individual correction methods had different effects on the reflectance retrievals that impacted downstream measurements. Including spectral measurements from ground vegetation targets in addition to painted calibration targets improved the performance of the ELC method. The hybrid method yielded reflectance spectra that most closely matched the spectra of the ground validation data. The errors in vegetation indices differed with the methods, and certain indices (such as PRI) were more affected than indices that rely on stable, broader spectral features (e.g., NDVI). Plant pigment retrievals via partial least squares regression were less sensitive to errors in atmospheric correction. These findings demonstrate that obtaining high-quality, field spectral measurements over well-characterized calibration targets and representative land cover types within the scene is critical for accurate surface reflectance and subsequent downstream products, such as vegetation indices or plant traits.', '[Wang, Ran; Gamon, John A.; Moore, Ryan; Zygielbaum, Arthur, I; Perk, Rick; Leavitt, Bryan; Wardlow, Brian; Qi, Yi] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.

These approaches efficiently and automatically transform remote sensing time series into highdimensional feature representations to identify crop types. The lack of interpretation, however, is regarded as a major drawback of these high-performance approaches. Interpreting deep learning approaches in multitemporal crop mapping is critical for verifying their reliability. This study aims to quantify the impact of multi-temporal information in input time series on classification performance and develop a multi-perspective interpretation pipeline for deep learning models. The pipeline involves three interpretation approaches: evaluating input feature importance, analyzing hidden features, and monitoring temporal changes in model\'s soft output. An experiment is conducted to classify corn and soybean in the U.S corn belt in 2018. The study area consists of three sites each encompassing millions of pixel-level samples at 30 m resolution. The Landsat Analysis Ready Data are used as the input remote sensing time series and Cropland Data Layer is used as the ground reference. Attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (AtLSTM) and Transformer models are built as multitemporal deep learning models, and compared to Random Forest (RF). Complete time series input in the correct order achieves a higher overall accuracy of 97.8% than using single-window or out-of-order inputs, indicating multi-temporal information facilitates crop classification. An assessment of the input feature importance demonstrates that the AtLSTM, Transformer, and RF models all consider the period from weeks 11 to 20 (earlyJuly to late-August) as a key growth period and the shortwave infrared band as the critical band for corn and soybean discrimination. Hidden feature analysis suggests that the AtLSTM model accumulates the useful information over the growth period, while the Transformer model extracts the temporal dependencies that contribute important information to high-level feature learning. The learned features contain more effective and refined information than the raw input features and thus are better suited for crop classification. The soft output analysis in the in-season classification scenario demonstrates that increased length of input time series improves the model\'s confidence in the classification results. The further comparison of input feature importance in different sites and years demonstrates the applicability of the interpretation approach at larger spatiotemporal extents with heterogeneous landscapes and interannual variability. This study provides a multi-perspective evaluation to identify key features in multi-spectral and multi-temporal remote sensing data, and yields a practical approach to integrate agronomy knowledge in deep learning-based crop mapping.', '[Xu, Jinfan; Yang, Jie; Xiong, Xingguo; Ying, Yibin; Lin, Tao] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Biosyst Engn & Food Sci, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

However, to our knowledge, there is a lack of studies exploring the performance difference of various satellite soil moisture products for such an application. Therefore, this study aims to compare several state-of-the-art satellite soil moisture products on their potentials in landslide applications. The selected products include the ESA CCI soil moisture dataset, the SMAP Level-3 (L3), enhanced Level-3 (L3), Level-4 (L4) surface, and Level-4 (L4) root zone soil moisture datasets. Specifically, the completeness of different datasets is calculated to assess their applicability in practical applications. To investigate the relationship between the soil moisture and the commonly used rainfall information in landslide predictions, the correlation study of the satellite soil moisture with the antecedent cumulated rainfall is also carried out. In addition, to explore whether the satellite soil moisture can provide valuable information for landslide hazard assessment, infiltration events are identified based on the time series of satellite soil moisture, and the significance of event characteristics (such as event duration, soil moisture change, etc.) in landslide occurrence is then investigated with Bayesian analysis. This study is carried out in a landslide-prone area, the Emilia-Romagna region in northern Italy. Results show that the SMAP L4 product does not have any missing values, beneficial to the continuous monitoring of landslides. As for the correlation relationship between soil moisture and antecedent cumulated rainfall, the SMAP L4 product also has more rational spatial distribution of the Pearson correlation coefficients compared with other datasets, which can be better explained by the distribution of slope and TWI (topographic wetness index). Bayesian analysis on the infiltration events shows that our prior knowledge of the probability of landslide occurrence is better improved by using the \'SMAP L4 root zone soil moisture\'-derived infiltration events, indicating its greater potential to be used for landslide hazard assessment in the study region.', '[Zhao, Binru; Dai, Qiang; Shen, Qi] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Nanjing, Peoples R China.

Consistent comparisons of the accuracy of terrain and canopy height retrievals for these two missions are essential for continued improvement and further application. Because the time interval between the spaceborne products and validation data may introduce additional errors, we validate the newly released GEDI L2A product (version 2) and the ICESat-2 ATL08 product (version 4) using high-resolution, locally calibrated airborne lidar products acquired in the same year (2019) as the reference datasets. In addition, our study area contains 40 sites located in the U.S. mainland, Alaska, and Hawaii that encompass a variety of eco-climatic zones and vegetation cover types; thus, it avoids the uncertainties associated with small sample sizes and restricted spatial coverage. The results show that ICESat-2 and GEDI yield reasonable estimates of terrain height, with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of 2.24 and 4.03 m for mid and low latitudes, respectively, and 0.98 m for high latitudes (ICESat-2 only). ICESat-2 outperforms GEDI across the board for terrain height retrieval, although they both have better accuracy than existing SRTM and GMTED DEM products. Analyses of the error factors suggest that steep slopes (>30 degrees) present the greatest challenge for both GEDI and ICESat-2; in addition, tall (>20 m) and dense canopies (>90%) forest ecosystems also reduce the accuracy of the terrain height estimates. When ICESat2 and GEDI data are used for canopy height retrieval, the use of only strong/power beam data acquired at night is recommended, as the overall RMSEs decrease from 7.21 and 5.02 m to 3.93 and 3.56 m, respectively, compared to using all data regardless of daytime and beam strength. GEDI outperforms ICESat-2 across the board for canopy height retrieval, as ICESat-2 has a larger potential bias for almost all forest types and cover conditions. ICESat-2 tends to overestimate the canopy height of dwarf shrublands and underestimate the canopy height of forest, and there is a gradual downward shift in the distribution of residuals with increasing canopy height. Overall, ICESat-2 with photon counting technology and GEDI with full waveform technology each represent the state of the art in spaceborne laser altimeters for terrain and canopy height retrieval. Combined, these two missions can take advantage of the unique strengths of each instrument.', '[Liu, Aobo] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

The product consists of an estimate of surface soil volumetric water content Theta [m(3)/m(3)] and its uncertainty [m(3)/m(3)], both at 1 km. The retrieval algorithm relies on a time series based Short Term Change Detection (STCD) approach, taking advantage of the frequent revisit of the S-1 constellation that performs C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging. The performance of the S-1 Theta product is estimated through a direct comparison between 1068 S-1 Theta images against in situ Theta measurements acquired by 167 ground stations located in Europe, America and Australia, over 4 years between January 2015 and December 2020, depending on the site. The paper develops a method to estimate the spatial representativeness error (SRE) that arises from the mismatch between the S-1 Theta retrieved at 1 km resolution and the in situ point-scale Theta observations. The impact of SRE on standard validation metrics, i.e., root mean square error (RMSE), Pearson correlation (R) and linear regression, is quantified and experimentally assessed using S-1 and ground Theta data collected over a dense hydrologic network (4-5 stations/km(2)) located in the Apulian Tavoliere (Southern Italy). Results show that for the dense hydrological network the RMSE and correlation are similar to 0.06 m(3)/m(3) and 0.71, respectively, whereas for the sparse hydrological networks, i.e., 1 station/km(2), the SRE increases the RMSE by similar to 0.02 m(3)/m(3) (70% Confidence Level). Globally, the S-1 Theta product is characterized by an intrinsic (i.e., with SRE removed) RMSE of similar to 0.07 m(3)/m(3) over the Theta range [0.03, 0.60] m(3)/m(3) and R of 0.54. A breakdown of the RMSE per dry, medium and wet Theta ranges is also derived and its implications for setting realistic requirements for SAR-based Theta retrieval are discussed together with recommendations for the density of in situ Theta observations.', '[Balenzano, Anna; Mattia, Francesco; Satalino, Giuseppe; Lovergine, Francesco P.; Palmisano, Davide] CNR, Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Electromagnet Sensing Environm IREA, Uos Bari, Italy.

Yet development of such remote sensing methodology is challenged by the spectral and structural similarities among many invasive and native plant species. We developed a multi-temporal classification approach that uses unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAV) imagery to map two invasive annual grasses to the species level, and to distinguish these from key functional types of native vegetation, based upon differences in plant phenology. For a case study area in the western Great Basin, USA, we intentionally over-sampled with frequent (n = 8) UAV flights over the growing season. Using this information we compared the importance of spectral variation at a given point in time (i.e., with and without near-infrared wavelengths), with spectral variation across multiple time periods. We found that differences in species phenology allowed for accurate classification of nine cover types, including the two annual grass species of interest, using just three dates of imagery that captured species-specific differences in the timing of active growth, seed head production, and senescence. Availability of near-infrared imagery proved less important than true-color RGB imagery collected at appropriate time periods. Thus, multi-temporal information provides a substitute for more extensive spectral information obtained from a single point in time. The substitution of temporal for spectral information is particularly well suited to UAV remote sensing, where the timing of image collection can be flexible. The datasets arising from our multi-temporal classification approach provide high-resolution information for modeling patterns of invasive plant spread, for quantifying plant invasion risk, and for early detection of novel plant invasions when patch sizes are still small. Widespread application and up-scaling of our approach requires advances in our ability to model the variability in phenology that occurs across years and over fine spatial scales, even within a single species.', '[Weisberg, Peter J.; Dilts, Thomas E.; Greenberg, Jonathan A.; Ready, Alice] Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, 1664 N Virginia St,Mail Stop 0186, Reno, NV 89557 USA.

Deriving highly accurate and spatially continuous PAR from remote sensing data can fill in the gaps of insufficient ground-based measurements. In this study, we provide an efficient approach for estimating PAR by employing look-up table (LUT) method using observations from both MODIS and GOES-16. The GOES-16 is the first satellite of the new-generation US Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-series (GOES-R), which can capture dynamic changes in the atmosphere every 5 min. First, the diurnal variation of surface bidirectional reflectance is characterized assuming that the surface characteristics and solar zenith angles in tropical and middle latitudes at a given time of day do not change dramatically within a month. Next, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and cloud optical depth (COD) are retrieved from the GOES-16 visible observations under both clear-sky and cloudy conditions. Finally, PAR is estimated via the retrieved AOD and COD using the LUT method and a MODIS-based surface albedo product. The estimated PAR was compared against ground-based measurements collected from seven SURFace RADiation budget network (SURFRAD) sites and 23 National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites at instantaneous, hourly and daily scales. The instantaneous PAR validation results achieved R-2 values of 0.97 and 0.82, and root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 18.1 and 51.1 W m(-2), for clear and cloudy skies, respectively. The RMSEs of the hourly averaged PAR were reduced to 16.8 W m(-2) and 40.4 W m(-2), respectively, for clear-sky and cloudy conditions. The daily mean PAR evaluation for all sky conditions shows an overall mean bias error (MBE) of 0.97 W m(-2) and an RMSE of 10.5 W m(-2). Compared with other global PAR datasets, the estimated PAR values in this study have lower RMSEs and higher spatial-temporal resolution. Uncertainties in the retrieved PAR caused by topography and solar-cloud-geometry effects (SCGE) can be reduced by spatial and temporal averaging. Based on an evaluation of retrievals at different spatial-temporal scales, we recommend that a 20 x 20 km(2) domainaveraged PAR be utilized for instantaneous PAR validation, whereas hourly and daily averaged PAR values are nearly independent of spatial scale.', '[Zhang, Hailong; Xin, Xiaozhou; Liu, Qinhuo; Li, Li; Yu, Shanshan] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Datun Rd 20 North, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

To date, key questions such as the following have not been addressed adequately: To what extent can the various forms of marine debris be remotely detected and differentiated through satellite observations in the visible and near infrared (NIR) spectral range, and how? Here, using published reflectance spectra of various types of floating matters, I address these questions through sensitivity analyses, simulations, and spectral analyses of satellite images. While the study is by no means comprehensive, several observations can still be made. First, it appears impossible to remotely detect marine microplastics from all existing and planned optical sensors. This is simply because the contribution of these particles to the sensor signal, even when they are aggregated on the water surface at the reported maximum particle density, is at least 60 times lower than the required signal (similar to 0.2% subpixel coverage) and 20 times lower than the sensor noise for a sensor with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 200. In contrast, detecting macroplastics and other debris is possible when they form large patches along ocean fronts or windrows. Second, assuming a SNR of 200, discriminating large patches of marine debris from floating algae is only possible with a subpixel coverage of 0.3%. These threshold values are based on the sensor SNRs only, and they represent the lower bounds of detection and discrimination, respectively. The real threshold values above which a detection or discrimination is possible also depend on the observing conditions, and therefore higher. Third, currently, Sentinel-2 MSI (Multi Spectral Instrument) sensors provide an optimal trade between resolution and coverage, yet MSI sensors have SNRs <200, and interpretation of the MSI spectra requires extra caution due to variable spatial resolutions in different bands, among other factors. From the perspective of pure spectroscopy, it is possible to discriminate floating algae from non-algae floating matters but difficult to differentiate the type of the latter (either plastic or non-plastic debris, foam, etc) because different non-algae floating matters all show relatively flat reflectance spectral shapes in the vis-NIR spectral range. Finally, based on these results, recommendations are made on algorithm designs and sensor designs, for example spectral analysis should be performed over the difference spectra to minimize the impact of variable subpixel coverage, and certain spectral bands are more important than others for the remote detection of marine debris.', '[Hu, Chuanmin] Univ S Florida, 140 Seventh Ave South, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.', 'State University System of Florida; University of South FloridaRP Hu, CM (通讯作者)，Univ S Florida, 140 Seventh Ave South, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.', 'huc@usf.edu', NULL, 'U.S. NASA through Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry program [NNX16AR74G,   80NSSC20M0264]; U.S. NASA through Ecological Forecast program   [NNX17AF57G, 80NSSC21K0422]; NASA [NNX16AR74G, 894870] Funding Source:   Federal RePORTER', 'This work was supported by the U.S. NASA through its Ocean Biology and   Biogeochemistry program (NNX16AR74G, 80NSSC20M0264) and Ecological   Forecast program (NNX17AF57G, 80NSSC21K0422) .

While remote sensing-based detection of wholesale coastal ecosystem shifts (i.e., from forest to marsh) are relatively straightforward, assessments of chronic, low-level SWI into CFS using remote sensing have yet to be developed and can provide a critical early-warning signal of ecosystem deterioration. In this study, we developed nine ecologically-based hypotheses to test whether remote sensing data could be used to reliably detect the presence of CFS experiencing SWI. Hypotheses were motivated by field- and literature-based understanding of the phenological and vegetative dynamics of CFS experiencing SWI relative to unimpacted, control systems. Hypotheses were organized into two primary groups: those that analyzed differences in summary measures (e.g., median and distribution) between SWI-impacted and unimpacted control sites and those that examined timeseries trends (e.g., sign and magnitude of slope). The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was used as a proxy for production/biomass and was generated using MODIS surface reflectance data spanning 2000 to 2018. Experimental sites (n = 8) were selected from an existing network of long-term monitoring sites and included 4 pairs of impacted/non-impacted CFS across the northern Gulf of Mexico from Texas to Florida. The four best-supported hypotheses (81% across all sties) all used summary statistics, indicating that there were significant differences in the EVI of CFS experiencing chronic, low-level SWI compared to controls. These hypotheses were tested using data across a large and diverse region, supporting their implementation by researchers and managers seeking to identify CFS undergoing the first phases of SWI. In contrast, hypotheses that assessed CFS change over time were poorly supported, likely due to the slow and variable pace of ecological change, relatively short remote sensing data record, and/or specific site histories. Overall, these results show that remote sensing data can be used to identify differences in CFS vegetation associated with long-term, low-level SWI, but further methodological advancements are needed to reliably detect the temporal transition process.', '[White, Elliott, Jr.] Univ Virginia, Environm Sci Dept, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.

The advent of modern remote sensors, such as OLCI (Ocean Land Colour Instrument), on board the Sentinel-3A satellite, has made it possible to obtain oceanic biogeochemical products at higher spatial (300 m) and temporal (daily) resolutions than previously possible. However, validating the Sentinel-3A retrievals for coastal waters is an ongoing effort. Using a regional in situ dataset from British Columbia (BC) and Southeast Alaska (SEA) coastal waters, we evaluated the performance of OLCI Sentinel-3A in retrieving remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) and biophysical products, including total suspended matter (TSM), chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The OLCI data were processed through a spectral optimization-based algorithm (POLYMER) and a neural net-based (NN) algorithm (C2RCC), including the original (C2RCC v1) and the alternative version (altNN or v2), in which the neural network was trained with extended ranges to cope with larger dynamic range for high backscatter waters. The processors? performance was evaluated through match-up analysis using data from southern BC, as well as expected ranges and seasonal trends for northern BC and SEA. Multimetric statistical analyses demonstrated that POLYMER provided the best overall performance for TSM and Chl-a retrievals, with the Chl-a product improved by the use of the so-called ?Case-2? flag. Despite the relative outperformance of POLYMER-derived products, with low systematic biases, the relative percent differences are still high (80?100%) and should be acknowledged in future analyses when using these data. CDOM, only retrieved here from NN approaches, was better estimated using the alternative version of C2RCC. The best performing approaches were used to evaluate Level-3 composites for northern BC and SEA waters. The observed spatial and seasonal trends compared favourably with those reported in the literature, including highlighting more productive areas (e.g. west coast of Vancouver Island), and the important interactions between riverine systems and adjacent coastal waters (e.g., high TSM and CDOM loads near the Skeena and Nass rivers). This study demonstrated the benefits of OLCI Sentinel-3A to investigate complex coastal ecosystems and provides a robust evaluation of OLCI performance and a framework for future observational and process-oriented studies.', '[Giannini, Fernanda; Costa, Maycira] Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, POB 1700 STN CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada.

NASA\'s current GEDI and ICESat-2 missions as well as the upcoming NISAR mission will collect synergistic data with different coverage and sensitivity to AGB. In this study, we present a multi-sensor data fusion approach leveraging the strength of each mission to produce wall-to-wall AGB maps that are more accurate and spatially comprehensive than what is achievable with any one sensor alone. Specifically, we calibrate a regional L-band radar AGB model using the sparse, simulated spaceborne lidar AGB estimates. We assess our data fusion framework using simulations of GEDI, ICESat-2 and NISAR data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) and UAVSAR data acquired over the temperate high AGB forest and complex terrain in Sonoma County, California, USA. For ICESat-2 and GEDI missions, we simulate two years of data coverage and AGB at footprint level are estimated using realistic AGB models. We compare the performance of our fusion framework when different combinations of the sparse simulated GEDI and ICEsat-2 AGB estimates are used to calibrate our regional L-band AGB models. In addition, we test our framework at Sonoma using (a) 1-ha square grid cells and (b) similarly sized irregularly shaped objects. We demonstrate that the estimated mean AGB across Sonoma is more accurately estimated using our fusion framework than using GEDI or ICESat-2 mission data alone, either with a regular grid or with irregular segments as mapping units.

The resilience of ecosystems can be reduced by livestock grazing and by environmental conditions. Most studies quantifying resilience are based on model simulations. However, natural time series from satellite data offer the possibility to infer aspects of resilience from real systems. The objective of this study was to investigate two aspects of ecological resilience, namely resistance to climate variability and recovery from drought, by applying a change detection method (Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend; BFAST) spatially on a 28-year Landsat NDVI time series in a dry rangeland in southern Cyprus. First, we used the number of breakpoints fitted by the BFAST model as an inverted proxy for long-term vegetation resistance to climate variability (the ability to withstand change during a disturbance reduces the likelihood to trigger a breakpoint in the time series). Second, we used the linear slope of the BFAST model after a known drought as a proxy of the recovery rate of the vegetation. This information was then used to analyse the spatial distribution of the total number of breakpoints and of the NDVI recovery trend in relation to grazing and environmental properties. Our results show that high NDVI and a northern orientation (i.e. favourable environmental conditions) were associated with a highly resilient system, due to high resistance to climate variability and fast recovery after drought. Intermediate conditions were associated with low resistance. Unfavourable conditions and high grazing intensities were associated with an unresponsive ecosystem state characterised by high resistance and slow recovery after a drought event. Low grazing intensities positively affected the NDVI recovery trend, but did not improve resistance. On northern slopes, terrain slope had a positive effect on the NDVI recovery trend, while on southern slopes it had a negative effect. Our satellite-driven approach has a strong potential for resilience monitoring, because it can be applied on broad spatial and temporal scales in areas with low availability of field data. Moreover, it allows to jointly extract two important components of resilience: resistance and recovery rate.', '[von Keyserlingk, J.] Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Karl Liebknecht Str 24-25, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.

Tackling the hierarchical structure of complex temporal patterns is a necessary step towards a more complete description of the fundamental nature of temporal dynamics in ecosystems. In pursuance of this task, remote sensing data provide valuable information to classify and describe functional features of ecosystems across scales. To approach the temporal complexity of ecosystems, we proposed a stepwise procedure based on combinations of big data techniques and time series analyses applied to data series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The aim was to classify the temporal patterns and identify the differences in temporal dynamics of vegetation, by means of the frequency-domain and time-frequency domain components of a 20-year period of NDVI time series, respectively. In addition, we analysed the influence of climate in the temporal dynamics of vegetation. In particular, we applied archetype analysis to fast Fourier transform coefficients, using pixels as analytical units and frequencies as variables, of a large study area from North Patagonia, Argentina. Then, the most representative pixels for each archetype were used to analyse the explained variance by climatic predictor variables (temperature and precipitation) using a multiplicative model, whereas NDVI temporal dynamics was also described by means of time-frequency domain components with wavelet analysis, respectively. Six archetypes of temporal dynamics of arid and semi-arid rangelands were identified, as well as the main patterns of their distinctive frequencies through time and spatial location, respectively. The differences in temporal dynamics among archetypes were partly associated with climate and spatial features such as topography. The procedure was sensitive to capturing these temporal patterns, even those with a low data representation or noisy series while synthesizing information for an easy interpretation. Results are discussed in the light of future opportunities to combine this kind of information with other sources of information, aiming at the development of reliable land degradation and desertification assessment and monitoring tools.', '[Bruzzone, O.; Easdale, M.

Lightweight thermal infrared (TIR) sensors onboard unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are rapidly becoming key instruments for extracting high-resolution LSTs given the flexibility they offer in capturing different scales. With this expansion, there has been increasing concern regarding the growing demand to obtain a mapping of normalized LST given the directional anisotropy (DA) of surface fine-scale emissions. To date, this topic suffers from a lack of deep analysis and practical solutions for characterizing the DA of fine-scale TIR data from UAV measurements over tree and crop canopies. In this paper, the first objective was to understand the pattern of brightness temperatures (BTs) DAs at a high spatial resolution by using UAV-based multiangle observations and three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer model simulations. This study highlighted the need for first performing an angular normalization of the BTs of fine-scale pixels prior to any application, as these were easily affected by adjacent pixels and displayed broad spatial variability from 0.5 degrees C to 5.0 degrees C due to 3D occlusion. The second objective of the present study was to appraise the reliability of a modified kernel-driven model, in comparison to the model from which it was derived, with an additional kernel designed to mimic the adjacency effect, plus, a quadratic function used to simplify the estimate of the directional emissivity kernel. The root mean square error of the best fit between the measured UAV dataset and the modified kernel-driven model was approximately 0.65 degrees C, which proves its efficiency since the DA indexes of the BTs were about 1.40 degrees C. This outlined the role of the model to normalize from directional effects the camera image pixels and thereby deliver fine-scale BTs. In addition, results from LESS simulations also demonstrated the good performance of the modified kernel-driven model for simulating the DAs of thermal emissions for both tree and row-planted scenes.', '[Bian, Zunjian; Cao, Biao; Du, Yongming; Li, Hua; Fang, Junyong; Xiao, Qing; Liu, Qinhuo] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

ATL08 terrain heights had positive bias (33 cm) when permanent snow cover was present compared to the airborne lidar. Canopy heights derived from ICESat-2 varied significantly by the beam selection (i.e. strong versus weak). Use of the weak beams increased the underestimation of canopy height by 1.06 m and increased RMSE% by 8.08%. The lowest canopy height errors were associated with strong beam/night/summer ATL08 acquisitions, which underestimated canopy height by 0.56 m (Bias% = 3.18; RMSE% of 13.75%), followed by strong beam/day/summer acquisitions (Bias% = 2.85%; RMSE% = 14.77%). For this study area with managed, coniferous dominated boreal forests, we found that ATL08 canopy height errors were lowest for canopy cover ranging from 40 to 85% and within this range, we found that on average, ICESat-2 missed the top 11-13% of canopy heights. At low canopy cover (< 40%), photons are more likely to be reflected from the terrain surface rather than the canopy due to the lower amount of vegetation present. Although not designed for canopy height retrievals, herein we have demonstrated that ICESat-2 can provide a useful source of canopy height information in boreal forests. By quantifying the accuracy with which terrain and canopy heights are characterized by ATL08, we provide insights on the capabilities and limitations of these data for these applications. Our results indicate that end users interested in canopy height retrievals in particular should avoid the use of weak beam data in boreal forest conditions.', '[Neuenschwander, Amy; Guenther, Eric] Univ Texas Austin, Appl Res Labs, Austin, TX 78712 USA.

The existing radiative transfer approaches implement the within-crown het-erogeneity either using complicated three-dimensional (3D) scenes with excessive amounts of parameters, or simplifying the scenes to homogeneous cases by averaging canopy optical properties. In order to ascertain the optical response to within-crown heterogeneity both efficiently and accurately, we proposed a method for simulating bi-directional reflectance factor (BRF) of forests infected by pests based on the stochastic radiative transfer (SRT) theory. Each damaged tree crown was classified into one of the three types: top-only damage, bottom-only damage and random damage. The statistical properties of such canopy structures were described with extended definitions of the stochastic moments of the SRT model, including the probabilities of finding different foliage classes and the conditional pair-correlation functions between healthy and damaged foliage. Field measurements and remote sensing data from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) over infected Yunnan Pine (Pinus yunnanensis) forests, and simulations of two 3D models were utilized to evaluate the performance. Results showed that the extended SRT agreed well with 3D models and field measurements, which means it has the capability to model BRF over forests with heterogeneous foliage within crowns based on one-dimensional (1D) theory. The extended SRT provides a framework to analyze the sensitivity of canopy reflectance to the distribution of damaged foliage with the variation of other key scene factors. For the three types of damaged tree crowns, the thresholds of detectable optical changes were quite different, in which 20% for top-only damage, 80% for bottom-only damage and 50% for random damage. The uncertainties caused by other scene factors were also considered. The extended SRT is promising for crown vertical profile specification, forest damage quantitative inversion, and other applications with coupling models.', '[Li, Xiaoyao; Huang, Huaguo; Chen, Ling] Beijing Forestry Univ, State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Res Ctr Forest Management Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.

However, the validation of high-resolution IST data using in situ measurements in polar sea ice regions is lacking. This study assesses the accuracy of three split-window (SW) and two single-channel (SC) methods, based on Landsat 8 thermal infrared imagery at 100 m resolution over Arctic sea ice regions. The SW methods are proposed by Jin et al. (2015) (SW-Jin), Jimenez-Munoz et al. (2014) (SW-JM), and Du et al. (2015) (SW-Du). The SC methods are proposed by Jimenez-Munoz et al. (2014) (SC-JM) and Barsi et al. (2003, 2005) (SC-Barsi). IST data derived from 58 scenes of the Landsat 8 images were compared with coincident in situ ice skin temperatures and near-surface air temperatures, as measured by a combination of Ice Mass Balance (IMB) buoys, Snow and Ice Mass Balance Array (SIMBA) buoys, and automatic weather stations. SW-Du offers the best accuracy when compared with the skin temperature (bias: -1.06 K; root mean square error (RMSE): 2.08 K) and near-surface air temperature (bias:-0.98 K; RMSE: 2.17 K). SC-Barsi ranks second, with a bias of -1.55 K and RMSE of 2.40 K for the skin temperature. As for precision, IST from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) has best performance (standard deviation (STD): 1.69 K), followed by SW-Du, SW-JM, and SC-Barsi (STD: 1.80 K, 1.82 K, and 1.85 K, respectively). The Landsat IST outperforms the MODIS IST in narrow lead areas, owing to its better spatial resolution, and SW-JM and SC-Barsi methods agree best with the MODIS IST in leads and marginal ice zone scenes, respectively. As all three SW methods are constrained by banding effects with different degrees in a lead scene, they are not recommended to be applied on an image scene with severe banding artifacts. The small bias (1.26 K) and high correlation (0.99) between skin temperature and near-surface air temperature prove the capability of using near-surface air temperature as a substitute for validating a satellite IST data if skin temperature data are not available.', '[Fan, Pei; Pang, Xiaoping; Zhao, Xi; Qu, Meng; Ji, Qing] Wuhan Univ, Chinese Antarctic Ctr Surveying & Mapping, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

The mask was compared with the existing operational Bayesian and Empirical cloud masks by eye and also statistically using CALIOP data. It was found to perform exceptionally well in the polar regions. The Kuiper skill score improved from 0.28, for the operational Bayesian and 0.17 for the Empirical masks to 0.77 for the NN. The NN algorithm also has a much more homogeneous performance over all surface types. The key improvement came from better identification of clear scenes; for the NN mask, the same performance in terms of contamination of cloudy pixels in the sample of identified clear pixels can be achieved while retaining 40% of the clear pixels compared with 10% for the operational cloud identification.

In this study, we developed a new framework based on the spatial variation of NTL gradient (SVNG) to map urban dynamics in Southeast Asia using the consistent NTL data (1992-2018). First, we identified the potential urban clusters in the region using the cluster-based segmentation approach in 2018. Second, we applied the SVNG framework in each potential urban cluster to extract the initial annual urban extent from corresponding time-series NTL images (1992-2018). Finally, we performed a temporal consistency check on the initial urban extent to obtain the final urban sequence in Southeast Asia. The evaluation on the spatiotemporal patterns and consistency of urban dynamics using other urban products indicates that the SVNG framework can effectively capture the urban dynamics in areas with different development levels and patterns. Moreover, we investigated urban dynamics in Southeast Asia at the local, national, and regional scales.

Multispectral imagery from optical passive sensors is commonly used to estimate fire damage, yet this type of data is only sensitive to the effects in the upper canopy. This paper evaluates the sensitivity of full waveform LiDAR data to estimate the severity of wildfires using a 3D radiative transfer model approach. The approach represents the first attempt to evaluate the effect of different fire impacts, i.e. changes in vegetation structure as well as soil and leaf color, on the LiDAR signal. The FLIGHT 3D radiative transfer model was employed to simulate full waveform data for 10 plots representative of Mediterranean ecosystems along with a wide range of post-fire scenarios characterized by different severity levels, as defined by the composite burn index (CBI). A new metric is proposed, the waveform area relative change (WARC), which provides a comprehensive severity assessment considering all strata and accounting for changes in structure and leaf and soil color. It showed a strong correlation with CBI values (Spearman\'s Rho = 0.9 +/- 0.02), outperforming the relative change of LiDAR metrics commonly applied for vegetation modeling, such as the relative height of energy quantiles (Spearman\'s Rho = 0.56 +/- 0.07, for the relative change of RH60, the second strongest correlation). Logarithmic models fitted for each plot based on the WARC yielded very good performance with R-2 (+/- standard deviation) and RMSE (+/- standard deviation) of 0.8 (+/- 0.05) and 0.22 (+/- 0.03), respectively. LiDAR metrics were evaluated over the King Fire, California, U.S., for which pre- and post-fire discrete return airborne LiDAR data were available. Pseudo-waveforms were computed after radiometric normalization of the intensity data. The WARC showed again the strongest correlation with field measures of GeoCBI values (Spearman\'s Rho = 0.91), closely followed by the relative change of RH40 (Spearman\'s Rho = 0.89). The logarithmic model fitted using WARC offered an R-2 of 0.78 and a RMSE of 0.37. The accurate results obtained for the King Fire, with very different vegetation characteristics compared to our simulated data, demonstrate the robustness of the new metric proposed and its generalization capabilities to estimate the severity of fires.', '[Garcia, Mariano; Viana-Soto, Alba; Franques, Magi] Univ Alcala, Dept Geol Geog & Environm, Environm Remote Sensing Res Grp, Calle Colegios 2, Alcala De Henares 28801, Spain.

Whilst remote sensing (RS) has showed great potential in monitoring hydrological changes over space and time, the existing RS-based methods extract river networks based on local morphologies and seldom take into account the overall hydrological connectivity of the rivers. The existing methods also commonly neglect the effect of seasonal variation of water surfaces and the existence of temporary water bodies, which deteriorate the precision of positioning river networks. To address these challenges, a new two-stage method is developed to Extract spatiotemporal variation of water surfaces based on Multi-temporal remote sensing Imagery and Delineate connected river networks with improved accuracy (EMID method for short) using a path tracking technique. The EMID method delineates connected river networks using (a) multi-temporal imagery and a Random Forest model to synoptically map the location and extent of water surfaces under different hydrological conditions, and (b) an optimization algorithm to find the best river paths based on water-occurrence frequency. Four drainage basins with various river morphologies are considered to validate EMID. Comparing with alternative methods, the EMID method consistently produces river network results with improved accuracy in terms of stream location, river coverage and network connectivity.', '[Chen, Huili; Liang, Zhongyao; Liu, Yong; Ren, Tingyu] Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, State Environm Protect Key Lab All Mat Flux River, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.

Currently, Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) has been well established as an effective tool to delineate and characterize the structure of canopies across a range of forested biomes. However, the use of ALS to provide information on sub-canopy structure is less well developed. Sub-canopy structure consists of suppressed mature trees, regenerating tree saplings, shrubs, herbs, snags and coarse-woody-debris. With the increasing density of ALS point clouds, new opportunities exist to describe these sub-canopy structural components in forests that were previously difficult to detect using passive remote sensing technologies. In this research we use discrete return ALS data acquired at a density of 23 points x m(2) to estimate sub-canopy forest structure for 48,000 ha of conifer dominated forest in central British Columbia, Canada. We first segmented the forest vertical structure into canopy and sub-canopy based on Lorey\'s mean height (HL). HL, which favours larger trees as a baseline for canopy height, provides separation between the taller trees that dominate the canopy and smaller trees that represent the sub-canopy. We defined sub-canopy trees as those < 70% of HL. Both ground-truthed forest inventory data and the ALS point cloud were then segmented into canopy and sub-canopy components. A mixture of standard height-based and density-based ALS metrics were then computed to develop predictive models of sub-canopy component of the stands. Models were calibrated with 28 ground plots and developed using stepwise regression with the strongest predictors being a combination of height, structure and cover-based metrics. Two model sets were developed, one for the entire point cloud, and another for an isolated sub-canopy point cloud defined by HL. The isolated sub-canopy set of models resulted in stronger cross-validated R-squared values of 0.88, 0.68, and 0.55 for tree volume, basal area and number of sub-canopy trees, respectively. We then applied these models over the entire study area to characterize the sub-canopy structure, resulting inventory can be used by land managers for a number of purposes including selecting candidate locations for selective logging to preserve mid-term timber opportunities, fire susceptibility and carbon sequestration modelling, and wildlife habitat values.', '[Jarron, Lukas R.; Coops, Nicholas C.; Tompalski, Piotr] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Resources Management, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.

Due to the complex nature of land cover, however, mixed pixels exist widely in remote sensing images. Sub-pixel mapping (SPM) is a technique for predicting the spatial distribution of land cover classes within mixed pixels. As an ill-posed inverse problem, the uncertainty of prediction cannot be eliminated and hinders the production of accurate sub-pixel maps. In contrast to conventional methods that use continuous geospatial information (e.g., images) to enhance SPM, in this paper, a SPM method with point constraints into SPM is proposed. The method of fusing point constraints is implemented based on the pixel swapping algorithm (PSA) and utilizes the auxiliary point information to reduce the uncertainty in the SPM process and increase map accuracy. The point data are incorporated into both the initialization and optimization processes of PSA. Experiments were performed on three images to validate the proposed method. The influences of the performances were also investigated under different numbers of point data, different spatial characters of land cover and different zoom factors. The results show that by using the point data, the proposed SPM method can separate more small-sized targets from aggregated artifacts and the accuracies are increased obviously. The proposed method is also more accurate than the advanced radial basis function interpolation-based method. The advantage of using point data is more evident when the point data size and scale factor are large and the spatial autocorrelation of the land cover is small. As the amount of point data increases, however, the increase in accuracy becomes less noticeable. Furthermore, the SPM accuracy can still be increased even if the point data and coarse proportions contain errors.', '[Wang, Qunming; Zhang, Chengyuan] Tongji Univ, Coll Surveying & Geoinformat, 1239 Siping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.

The method combines traditional Fast Fourier Transform techniques for retrieving peak frequency maps by evaluating the spectral peaks in the time domain, and a localized 2D Continuous Wavelet Transform for retrieving the corresponding peak wavenumbers. The main improvements of the new method compared to conventional FFT-based methods are as follows: a) the wavelet-based approach is localized - naturally fitting the inhomogeneous conditions typically found in the nearshore environment; b) it is continuous and uses wave phase information providing smooth bathymetry maps with good accuracy (RMSE in the range 2.6-6.6% of the maximum water depth); c) it requires relatively small number of successive images without the limitation of requiring a uniform time step.   In order to verify the proposed method, 2D simulations of wave shoaling and refraction were performed for different sea conditions and over several bottom topographies. A radar image model including tilt and shadowing modulations together with speckle noise was applied to the simulated surface elevations to provide synthetic radar images. The method\'s ability to reconstruct the original bathymetry is shown to be robust in intermediate to shallow water depths (k(p)h < 1) for all cases. The method was also applied to real data acquired in Sylt island (Germany). A comparison between a bathymetric survey held prior to a storm and a radar reconstructed one during the storm shows very good agreement.

Such changes in boreal forest ecosystems can persist over decadal time scales or longer. In the ecotone between boreal forest and steppe in the region southeast of Lake Baikal in southern Siberia, shifts between the two vegetation types may be precipitated by variations in site specific conditions, as well as disturbance characteristics such as fire frequency and severity. Warmer, drier conditions in the region have been associated with a decrease in fire return intervals and greater burn severity that may, in turn, drive conversion of forests to steppe vegetation at a greater rate than has occurred prior to the onset of warming and drying. Stand-replacing fires in Pinus sylvestris stands in southern Siberia may lead to recruitment failure postfire, particularly on southwest to west-facing slopes, which are more often dominated by grasses. This study uses a combination of field data and remotely sensed indices of vegetation and moisture to distinguish between recruitment pathways in southern Siberia, and to study the influence of factors related to soils, topography, fire severity and winter snow cover on these.   We expected that recruitment success would be associated with lower burn severity (higher NBR), higher greenness (NDVI) and moisture (NDMI), and winter snow (NDSI) postfire. We also expected phenological characteristics to differ among recruitment paths. Prior to burning, our sites are broadly similar in terms of remotely sensed indices of moisture (NDMI), vegetation (NDVI), and winter fractional snow cover (NDSI), but recruitment failure sites are generally drier and less green postfire. Initial differences in greenness and moisture among sites characterized by abundant recruitment (AR), intermediate recruitment (IR) and recruitment failure (RF) become more pronounced over the initial decades postfire. The earliest separability of AR and RF sites using remotely sensed indices occurs in the winter months 3-4 years postfire, during which time NDSI is highest for AR sites and lowest for RF. Although seasonality was important with regard to distinguishing among AR, IR and RF index values, the timing of phenological events such as start and end of season did not differ significantly among the sites.', '[Barrett, Kirsten; Balzter, Heiko] Univ Leicester, Sch Geog Geol & Environm, Ctr Landscape & Climate Res, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.

This paper presents the first spatially-continuous view of terrestrial leaf chlorophyll content (Chl(Leaf)) at the global scale. Weekly maps of Chl(Leaf) were produced from ENVISAT MERIS full resolution (300 m) satellite data using a two-stage physically-based radiative transfer modelling approach. Firstly, leaf-level reflectance was derived from top-of-canopy satellite reflectance observations using 4-Scale and SAIL canopy radiative transfer models for woody and non-woody vegetation, respectively. Secondly, the modelled leaf-level reflectance was input into the PROSPECT leaf-level radiative transfer model to derive Chl(Leaf). The Chl(Leaf) retrieval algorithm was validated using measured Chi(Leaf) data from 248 sample measurements at 28 field locations, and covering six plant functional types (PFTs). Modelled results show strong relationships with field measurements, particularly for deciduous broadleaf forests (R-2 = 0.67; RMSE = 9.25 mu g cm(-2); p < 0.001), croplands (R-2 = 0.41; RMSE = 13.18 mu g cm(-2); p < 0.001) and evergreen needleleaf forests (R-2 = 0.47; RMSE = 10.63 mu g cm(-2); p < 0.001). When the modelled results from all PFTs were considered together, the overall relationship with measured Chl(Leaf )remained good (R-2 = 0.47, RMSE = 10.79 mu g cm(-2); p < 0.001). This result is an improvement on the relationship between measured Chl(Leaf) and a commonly used chlorophyll-sensitive spectral vegetation index; the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI; R-2 = 0.27, p < 0.001). The global maps show large temporal and spatial variability in Chl(Leaf), with evergreen broadleaf forests presenting the highest leaf chlorophyll values, with global annual median values of 54.4 mu g cm(-2). Distinct seasonal Chl(Leaf) phenologies are also visible, particularly in deciduous plant forms, associated with budburst and crop growth, and leaf senescence. It is anticipated that this global Chl(Leaf) product will make an important step towards the explicit consideration of leaf-level biochemistry in terrestrial water, energy and carbon cycle modelling.', '[Croft, H.; Chen, J.

Satellite SAR has primarily been used to detect the presence/absence of oil, yet its ability to discriminate oil emulsions within a detected oil slick has not been fully exploited. Additionally, one of the challenges in the past has been the ability to deliver strategic information derived from satellite remote sensing in a timely fashion to responders in the field. This study presents methods for the rapid classification of oil types and estimated thicknesses, from which information about thick oil and oil emulsions (i.e., \"actionable\" oil) can be delivered in an operational timeframe to responders in the field. Experiments carried out at the OHMSETT test facility in New Jersey demonstrate that under specific viewing conditions, a single polarization satellite SAR image can record a signal variance between thick stable emulsions and non-emulsified oil. During a series of field campaigns in the Gulf of Mexico with in situ measurements of oil thickness, multiple satellite data were obtained including fully polarimetric C-band SAR imagery from RADARSAT-2 and multispectral imagery from ASTER and WorldView-2. One campaign included the airborne polarimetric UAVSAR L-band sensor. An oil/emulsion thickness classification product was generated based on RADARSAT-2 polarimetric imagery using entropy and the damping ratio derivations. Herein, we present the classification methods to generate oil thickness products from SAR, validated by sea-truth observations, the multispectral imagery, and the UAVSAR data. We tested the ability to deliver these products with minimum latency to responding vessels via NOAA. During field operations in the Gulf of Mexico, a satellite SAR-based product of oil delineation by relative thickness was delivered to a responding vessel 42 min after the RADARSAT-2 data acquisition.

The full-waveform pattern of a large footprint is changeable due to complicated interaction of canopy elements and terrain relief, consequently a noticeable bias may be introduced to the estimation. This paper begins with the approach of area-based growing stock volume calculation, developing harmonized metrics to integrate versatile signals in a denoised multimodal waveform of ICESat-1 data. These novel metrics were applied to derive a harmonized canopy height model for estimating the canopy height at footprint level and the distribution of canopy height at stand level. The performance of this model was evaluated with respect to the prototypical metrics derived canopy height model based on airborne LiDAR data determined canopy heights of a secondary evergreen mixed forest in a steep rugged terrain in central Taiwan. Footprint-level canopy height was evaluated via accuracy measures using a cross-validation method. Appropriateness of canopy height structure was examined via a post hoc test of the shape similarity for both ICESat-1 data-derived and airborne LiDAR-derived canopy height distribution models at stand level. Results showed that the harmonized canopy height model was able to achieve an accuracy of RMSE = 3.13 +/- 0.08 m and RMSE% = 22.40 +/- 0.55% as well as a significant reduction of bias. The canopy height distribution of the forest stand derived by harmonized metrics of ICESat-1 full-waveform data is statistically the same as that determined by airborne LiDAR data. Harmonized metrics provide compensatory information of trailing-edge extent and terrain index for describing canopy height. In contrast to the canopy height model using only prototypical waveform metrics, the harmonized metrics based canopy height model can mitigate the potential influence of terrain effects and dense canopy coverage on waveform pattern. Because a priori knowledge of terrain relief data is not required for modeling, the harmonized algorithm is useful for retrieving the trend of canopy height growth over the terrestrial forest ecosystem.', '[Lin, Chinsu] Natl Chiayi Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, Chiayi 60004, Taiwan.', 'National Chiayi UniversityRP Lin, CS (通讯作者)，Natl Chiayi Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, Chiayi 60004, Taiwan.', 'chinsu@mail.ncyu.edu.tw', 'Lin, Chinsu/0000-0002-4513-8674', 'Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 103-2119-M-415-002,   MOST 104-2119-M-415-001]', 'The authors would like to acknowledge the support provided by projects   MOST 103-2119-M-415-002 and MOST 104-2119-M-415-001 funded by the   Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.

Efforts to improve accuracy include physics-based methods (similar to radiative transfer models e.g. for atmospheric/vegetation studies) or detailed in-situ sampling of the seabed and water column, but the spatial component of SDB measurements is often under-utilised in SDB workflows despite promising results suggesting potential to improve accuracy significantly. In this study, a selection of satellite datasets (Landsat 8, RapidEye and Pleiades) at different spatial and spectral resolutions were tested using a log ratio transform to derive bathymetry in an Atlantic coastal embayment. A series of non-spatial and spatial linear analyses were then conducted and their influence on SDB prediction accuracy was assessed in addition to the significance of each model\'s parameters. Landsat 8 (30 m pixel size) performed relatively weak with the non-spatial model, but showed the best results with the spatial model. However, the highest spatial resolution imagery used Pleiades (2 m pixel size) showed good results across both non-spatial and spatial models which suggests a suitability for SDB prediction at a higher spatial resolution than the others.

Slope deformation processes such as permafrost creep can make it challenging to acquire a snow-free DEM that matches the sub-snow topography at the time of the associated snow-covered DEM, which can cause errors in the computed snow depths. In this study, we illustrate how modelling changes in the sub-snow topography can reduce errors in snow depths derived from DEM differencing in an area of permafrost creep. To model the sub-snow topography, a surface deformation model was constructed by performing non-rigid registration based on B-splines of two snow-free DEMs. Seasonal variations in creep were accounted for by using an optimization approach to find a suitable value to scale the deformation model based on in-situ snow depth measurements or the presence of snow-free areas corresponding to the date of the snow-covered DEM. This scaled deformation model was used to transform one of the snow-free DEMs to estimate the sub-snow topography corresponding to the date of the snow-covered DEM. The performance of this method was tested on an active rock glacier in the southern French Alps for two surveys dates, which were conducted in the winter and spring of 2017.   By accounting for surface displacements caused by permafrost creep, we found that our method was able to reduce the errors in the estimated snow depths by up to 33% (an interquartile range reduction of 11 cm) compared to using the untransformed snow-free DEM. The accuracy of the snow depths only slightly improved (root-mean-square error decrease of up to 3 cm). Greater reductions in error were observed for the snow depths calculated for the date that was furthest (i.e., the winter survey) in time from the snow-free DEM. Additionally, we found that our approach to scaling the deformation model has promising potential to be adapted for monitoring seasonal variations in permafrost creep by combining in-situ snow depth measurements with high-resolution surface deformation models.', '[Goetz, Jason; Brenning, Alexander] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Dept Geog, Jena, Germany.

Although remote sensing of SIF especially from space is seen as a contemporary new specialty for terrestrial plants, it is founded upon a multi-decadal history of research, applications, and sensor developments in active and passive sensing of chlorophyll fluorescence. Current technical capabilities allow SIF to be measured across a range of biological, spatial, and temporal scales. As an optical signal, SIF may be assessed remotely using high-resolution spectral sensors in tandem with state-of-the-art algorithms to distinguish the emission from reflected and/or scattered ambient light. Because the red to far-red SIF emission is detectable non-invasively, it may be sampled repeatedly to acquire spatio-temporally explicit information about photosynthetic light responses and steady-state behaviour in vegetation. Progress in this field is accelerating with innovative sensor developments, retrieval methods, and modelling advances. This review distills the historical and current developments spanning the last several decades. It highlights SIF heritage and complementarity within the broader field of fluorescence science, the maturation of physiological and radiative transfer modelling, SIF signal retrieval strategies, techniques for field and airborne sensing, advances in satellite-based systems, and applications of these capabilities in evaluation of photosynthesis and stress effects. Progress, challenges, and future directions are considered for this unique avenue of remote sensing.', '[Mohammed, Gina H.] P&M Technol, Sault Ste Marie, ON, Canada.

Many algorithms have been developed to retrieve LST from satellite thermal infrared (TIR) measurements; of these, the most widely used are the split window (SW) and temperature emissivity separation (TES) methods. However, the performance of the SW and TES methods can be limited by the difficulty in obtaining sufficiently accurate prior knowledge-specifically, input land surface emissivity (LSE) for the SW method and atmospheric parameters for the TES method. In this study, a procedure was proposed for selecting specific channel pairs in the TIR spectral region to accurately retrieve ground brightness temperatures without prior atmospheric knowledge, using a method similar to the SW method. Subsequently, the TES method is applied to the retrieved ground brightness temperatures to separate the LST and LSE. In numerical simulations, the three ground brightness temperatures corresponding to 8.6 mu m, 9.0 mu m, and 10.4 mu m are acquired with an accuracy of about 0.65 K by using five channels centered at 8.6 mu m, 9.0 mu m, 10.4 mu m, 11.3 mu m, and 12.5 mu m, each with a width of 0.1 mu m. When inputting the three retrieved ground brightness temperatures into TES method, LST could be recovered with an accuracy of 0.87 K. Sensitivity analysis shows that LST retrieval accuracy is less affected by channel width and atmospheric downwelling radiance than by the channel center locations and channel noise. Finally, the proposed method is preliminarily applied to actual satellite data from the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) and the retrieved results are compared with the pixel-aggregated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product. For the study area of Australia, discrepancies between our result and the MODIS LST product appear to be about 1.6 K during the day and 1.0 K at night, indicating that the new channel configuration can be used to retrieve accurate LST from satellite measurements.', '[Zheng, Xiaopo; Li, Zhao-Liang; Nerry, Francoise] Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, UMR 7357, ICube Lab, 300 Bd Sebastien Brant,CS 10413, F-67412 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France.

Here we developed an ensemble mean surface energy balance (EnSEB) modeling framework that is independent of any ground calibration and applied it in India to understand the magnitude and variability of ET in this agriculturally important region. EnSEB uses daily land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation biophysical inputs from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and climatic information from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Modem-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (Merra-2) products and runs seven surface energy balance (SEB) algorithms to estimate ensemble mean ET or latent heat (LE) fluxes at a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km. Due to limited access to observed flux data, we conducted three different types of model evaluation: i) instantaneous LE validation using observed SEB fluxes from Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) measurements in four agroecosystems, ii) annual and seasonal ET comparison with six global products at the regional scale, and iii) by closing the basin-scale monthly water budget (WB) for five large river basins (87,900-312,812 km(2)) in India. Validation with the BREB measurements revealed hourly EnSEB LE estimates to be within 2% of the observed LE (R-2 = 0.57 and RMSE = 59 W m(-2)) and EnSEB was more accurate than any of the individual SEB models. Annual ET from EnSEB was positively correlated with six widely-used global ET products (r = 0.52-0.83, p-value < 0.001), but EnSEB captured the magnitude of ET in intensively irrigated regions much better. Basin-scale monthly WB miscloures were found to be between -1 and 9 mm month(-1) from EnSEB ET estimates, which were better than those from the six global ET products. The gap filling method based on the constant ETrF (ET/reference ET) approach introduced some uncertainties in EnSEB, which presents room for future improvements. Overall, our results suggest that the automated and calibration free multi-model EnSEB framework, which uses only remote sensing and readily available reanalysis data, has the ability to estimate ET with reliable accuracy in Indian agroecosystems. Such a framework could help us better understand and monitor the water cycle in regions where ground data are limited or non-existent.', '[Bhattarai, Nishan; Stuart, Julia; Jain, Meha] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil SEAS, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.

Data on smallholder maize systems are currently sparse, but satellite remote sensing offers promise for accelerating learning about these systems. Here we document the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) to build \"wall-to-wall\" 10 m resolution maps of (i) cropland presence, (ii) maize presence, and (iii) maize yields for the main 2017 maize season in Kenya and Tanzania. Mapping these outcomes at this scale is extremely challenging because of very heterogeneous landscapes, lack of cloud-free satellite imagery, and the low quantity of quality ground-based data in these regions.   First, we computed seasonal median composites of Sentinel-1 radar backscatter and Sentinel-2 optical reflectance measures for each pixel in the region, and used them to build both crop/non-crop and maize/nonmaize Random Forest (RF) classifiers. Several thousand crop/non-crop labels were collected through an in-house GEE labeler, and thousands of crop type labels from the 2015-2017 growing seasons were obtained from various sources. Results show that the crop/non-crop classifier successfully identified cropland with over 85% out-of sample accuracy in both countries, with Sentinel-1 being particularly useful for prediction. Among the cropped pixels, the maize/non-maize classier had an accuracy of 79% in Tanzania and 63% in Kenya.   To map maize yields, we build on past work using a scalable crop yield mapper (SCYM) that utilizes simulations from a crop model to train a regression that predicts yields from observations. Here we advance past approaches by (i) grouping simulations by Global Agro-Environmental Stratification (GAES) zones across the two countries, in order to account for landscape heterogeneity, (ii) utilizing gridded datasets on soil and sowing and harvest dates to setup model simulations in a scalable way; and (iii) utilizing all available satellite observations during the growing season in a parsimonious way by using harmonic regression fits implemented in GEE. SCYM estimates were able to capture about 50% of the variation in the yields at the district level in Western Kenya as measured by objective ground-based crop cuts.   Finally, we illustrated the utility of our yield maps with two case studies. First, we document the magnitude and interannual variability of spatial heterogeneity of yields in each district, and how it varies for different parts of the region. Second, we combine our estimates with recently released soil databases in the region to investigate the most important soil constraints in the region. Soil factors explain a high fraction (72%) of variation in predicted yields, with the predominant factor being soil nitrogen levels.

The misclassification of ML clouds as SL clouds is primarily caused by thin ice clouds that are practically undetectable using LWIR tests.

Comparisons with surface drifter data and near-surface Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) observations, as well as radar site-to-site baseline analyses, provide quantitative assessments of HFR velocities accuracy. Twenty-two drifters were deployed within the HFR domain of coverage between December 2012 and October 2013. Additionally, six ADCP vertical current profiles were collected at selected positions during a dedicated field survey. External radio-frequency interferences lead to significant gaps in the HFR coverage, which were minimized by an interpolation technique applied to the surface current fields. The validation of HFR velocities was first performed for each individual station in the network, using data generated with both the ideal and the measured antenna patterns. The validation was then repeated with pairs of HFR stations using the site-to-site baseline error analysis. The analysis confirms that the baseline error estimations and the full validation metrics for this HFR frequency band are consistent, and in some aspects superior, when compared to results from similar studies in other regions. The validation with drifter tracks suggests that the adopted interpolation procedure does not in general impact on the comparison metrics, but may introduce biases when used to extrapolate currents in regions where radar geometrical constraints are suboptimal.

SAAs generally follow two approaches: 1) simultaneous retrieval of all IOPs, resulting in pre-defined bio-optical models and spectral dependence between IOPs and 2) retrieval of bulk IOPs (absorption and backscattering) first followed by decomposition into separate components, allowing for independent retrievals of some components. Current algorithms used to decompose hyperspectral remotely-sensed reflectance into IOPs follow the first strategy. Here, a spectral deconvolution algorithm for incorporation into the second strategy is presented that decomposes a(t-w)(lambda) from in situ measurements and estimates absorption due to phytoplankton (a(ph)(lambda)) and colored detrital material (a(dg)(lambda)) free of explicit assumptions. The algorithm described here, Derivative Analysis and Iterative Spectral Evaluation of Absorption (DAISEA), provides estimates of a(ph)(lambda) and a(dg)(lambda) over a spectral range from 350 to 700 nm. Estimated a(ph)(lambda) and a(dg)(lambda) showed an average normalized root mean square difference of < 30% and < 20%, respectively, from 350 to 650 nm for the majority of optically distinct environments considered. Estimated S-dg median difference was < 20% for all environments considered, while distribution of S-dg uncertainty suggests that biogeochemical variability represented by S-dg can be estimated free of bias. DAISEA results suggest that hyperspectral satellite ocean color data will improve our ability to track biogeochemical processes affiliated with variability in a(dg)(lambda) and S-dg free of explicit assumptions.', '[Grunert, Brice K.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Geol & Min Engn & Sci, 1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.

The vegetation parameters are the slope and curvature of a second order Taylor polynomial used to describe the incidence angle dependence of backscatter sigma degrees. A recent development allows the vegetation parameters to be determined dynamically using the local slope values within a prescribed temporal window. Seasonal, interannual and diurnal variations in the vegetation parameters were found to vary across grassland cover types, reflecting variations in soil moisture availability and growing season length. While the slope has always been considered a measure of vegetation density, our results show that curvature also contains information about vegetation. Drought events in 2011 and 2012 resulted in extensive negative sigma(40)degrees and soil moisture anomalies during the maximum biomass period. Contiguous anomalies in slope and curvature were observed where the severity and persistence of the drought were enough to impact vegetation. Observed diurnal differences in slope and curvature suggest that daily moisture transport within the vegetation influences the relative dominance of scattering from the vegetation and soil surface.', '[Steele-Dunne, Susan C.] Delft Univ Technol TU Delft, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands.

However the drivers of bush encroachment are not yet fully revealed which can partly be attributed to the problem that large-scale data of woody vegetation cover are missing. Using a multi-scale and a multi-sensor approach, this study aimed at providing the status of woody vegetation cover for the Molopo Area in South Africa. Training data for woody vegetation was derived from unsupervised classification of high-resolution aerial image tiles. To derive spatially continuous estimates of fractional woody cover for the entire Molopo Area, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data were applied in a machine learning based modelling approach. Therefore, a database of training samples was generated by aggregating the classified aerial image tiles to the geometry of the Sentinel data. A Random Forest algorithm with a forward feature variable selection was then trained to relate the spectral and radar information to fractional woody cover. The model was applied to make spatial predictions of fractional woody cover at 10 m resolution for the entire Molopo Area for the year 2016. Spatial cross-validation revealed a prediction error in fractional cover of 12%.

Various change detection algorithms have been proposed, each employing different techniques to characterise abrupt disturbance events and longer term trends. However, results can vary significantly, depending on the algorithm, parameters and the spectral index (or indices) chosen. This mismatch in results has led to researchers hypothesizing that an ensemble based approach may increase accuracy. In this study we assess two change detection algorithms (LandTrendr and the R package strucchange), each with three indices (the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index or NDVI, the Normalized Burn Ratio or NBR, and Tasseled Cap Wetness or TCW). We test their ability to detect abrupt disturbances in sclerophyll forests over a 29 year time period, and subsequently evaluate a number of ensembles, using simple fusion rules and Random Forests models. A total of 4087 manually interpreted reference pixels, sampled from 9 million ha of forest, were used for training and validation. In addition, we assess the effects of priming the Random Forests classifier with confusing cases (commission errors from the time series algorithms). Our results clearly show that ensembles combining multiple change detection techniques out-perform any one method. Our most accurate Random Forests model, using an ensemble of all 6 algorithm outputs, along with 3 bi-temporal change rasters (change in NBR, NDVI and TCW), had an overall error rate of 7%, compared with the most accurate single algorithm/index approach (LandTrendr with NBR), which had an overall error of 21%. Our findings also indicate that acceptable results (14% error) can be achieved without the use of traditional change detection algorithms, by using robust reference data and Random Forests classification. However, by priming the classifier with confusing cases informed by the change detection algorithms, commission errors decreased substantially, at the expense of slight increases in omission errors. In fact, a Random Forests ensemble, using the primed training data and only 3 bi-temporal change rasters, was more accurate than any one individual algorithm, with an overall error of 11%. By including some additional metrics derived from Landsat time series (e.g. 2 year changes and overall means) this error was further reduced to 8%. Given that most change detection algorithms have large processing requirements, this suggests that algorithms can be applied to a sample of pixels only, for the sole purpose of training a machine learning classifier. We demonstrate the feasibility of this previously unexplored approach, by creating annual disturbance maps over a large area of forest (9 million ha) and long time period (29 years).', '[Hislop, Samuel; Jones, Simon; Soto-Berelov, Mariela; Nguyen, Trung H.] RMIT Univ, Sch Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.

The satellite observations are also valuable in validating model currents.

Different types of NDVI anomalies are typically employed to assess the current state of crops and rangelands as compared to previous years. Timeliness and accuracy of such anomalies are critical factors to an effective monitoring. Temporal smoothing can efficiently reduce noise and cloud contamination in the time series of historical observations, where data points are available before and after each observation to be smoothed. With NRT data, smoothing methods are adapted to cope with the unbalanced availability of data before and after the most recent data points. These NRT approaches provide successive updates of the estimation of the same data point as more observations become available. Anomalies compare the current NDVI value with some statistics (e.g. indicators of central tendency and dispersion) extracted from the historical archive of observations. With multiple updates of the same datasets being available, two options can be selected to compute anomalies, i.e. using the same update level for the NRT data and the statistics or using the most reliable update for the latter. In this study we assess the accuracy of three commonly employed 1 km MODIS NDVI anomalies (standard scores, non-exceedance probability and vegetation condition index) with respect to (1) delay with which they become available and (2) option selected for their computation. We show that a large estimation error affects the earlier estimates and that this error is efficiently reduced in subsequent updates. In addition, with regards to the preferable option to compute anomalies, we empirically observe that it depends on the type of application (e.g. averaging anomalies value over an area of interest vs. detecting \"drought\" conditions by setting a threshold on the anomaly value) and the employed anomaly type. Finally, we map the spatial pattern in the magnitude of NRT anomaly estimation errors over the globe and relate it to average cloudiness.', '[Meroni, Michele; Fasbender, Dominique; Rembold, Felix] European Commiss, JRC, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy.

The VDA approaches estimate turbulent heat fluxes by minimizing the difference between LST observations and estimations from the heat diffusion equation. The VDA methods have been tested only with high temporal resolution LST observations (e.g., from geostationary satellites) when applied at regional scales. Geostationary satellites can capture the diurnal cycle of LST, but they have a relatively low spatial resolution and mainly focus on low latitudes. To overcome these shortcomings, this study assimilates high spatial resolution LST data from polar orbiting satellites (e.g., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS) into the combined-source (CS) and dual-source (DS) VDA schemes. An expression is developed to obtain an a priori evaporative fraction (EF) estimate from leaf area index (LAI) or apparent thermal inertia (ATI). The a priori EF estimate is used as an initial guess in the VDA approach. The results indicate that the VDA method is able to find the optimal value of EF by assimilating the low-temporal resolution MODIS LST data. The predicted turbulent heat fluxes from VDA are compared with the measurements from the large-aperture scintillometer at three sites (Arou, Daman, and Sidaoqiao) in the Heihe River Basin (located in northwest China). The findings indicate that the CS and DS VDA models perform well in various hydrological and vegetative conditions. The three-site-average root mean square errors (RMSEs) of sensible and latent heat fluxes estimates from the CS scheme are 37.44 W m(-2) and 94.30 W m(-2), respectively. The DS model reduces the above mentioned RMSEs by 19.82% and 21.37%, respectively. Overall, the results show that using the a priori EF estimate from the proposed expression in the VDA approach eliminates the need for the high resolution LST data from geostationary satellites, and allows the VDA method to estimate turbulent heat fluxes by assimilating LST data from polar orbiting satellites. Finally, several numerical tests are conducted to assess the effect of LST temporal sampling on the turbulent heat fluxes estimates. The results show that the LST measurement at 1400 Local Time (LT) has the most amount of information for partitioning the available energy into sensible and latent heat fluxes.', '[Xu, Tongren; He, Xinlei; Liu, Shaomin; Xu, Ziwei] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Nat Resources, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Processes & Resource, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

Climate projections show that drought frequency and intensity may increase in different parts of the globe. These increases are particularly hazardous for developing countries. Early season forecasts on drought occurrence and severity could help to better mitigate the negative consequences of drought. The objective of this study was to assess if interannual variability in agricultural productivity in Chile can be accurately predicted from freely-available, near real-time data sources. As the response variable, we used the standard score of seasonal cumulative NDVI (zcNDVI), based on 2000-2017 data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), as a proxy for anomalies of seasonal primary productivity. The predictions were performed with forecast lead times from one- to six-month before the end of the growing season, which varied between census units in Chile. Predictor variables included the zcNDVI obtained by cumulating NDVI from season start up to prediction time; standardised precipitation indices derived from satellite rainfall estimates, for time-scales of 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months; the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Multivariate ENSO oscillation indices; the length of the growing season, and latitude and longitude. For each of the 758 census units considered, the time series of the response and the predictor variables were averaged for agricultural areas resulting in a 17-season time series per unit for each variable. We used two prediction approaches: (i) optimal linear regression (OLR) whereby for each census unit the single predictor was selected that best explained the interannual zcNDVI variability, and (ii) a multi-layer feedforward neural network architecture, often called deep learning (DL), where all predictors for all units were combined in a single spatio-temporal model. Both approaches were evaluated with a leave-one-year-out cross-validation procedure. Both methods showed good prediction accuracies for small lead times and similar values for all lead times.

In recent decades, increasing population, together with growing food demands, have put great pressure on the world\'s food production. Long-term, up-to-date, annual cropland mapping at high resolution (i.e., at tens-of-metre levels) is in urgent demand for tracking spatial and temporal patterns of cropland change. However, because of the difficulty of capturing seasonality and flexible cropping systems, few studies have focused on understanding the dynamics of cropland using Landsat data in Africa. Here, we propose a new method of updating annual cropland mapping using a change-detection approach and post-classification to improve on traditional bi-temporal change vector analysis. Three Landsat footprints in Africa were selected (Egypt, Ethiopia and South Africa) as our study areas based on their different cropping systems and field sizes. The potential annual change areas were detected by employing multiple indices and thresholds in reference and long-term annual composite Landsat images. Next, map updates were conducted in the potential change pixels using random forest-based classification. Different training sample metrics were used (seasonal and annual samples) and compared in the classification step. The long-term cropland mapping accuracies for these three sites ranged from 88.04% to 94.30% (Egypt), 76.28% to 82.88% (Ethiopia) and 56.52% to 67.53% (South Africa). The results showed improvements in the accuracy and consistency of updating the annual cropland information using change-detection approaches, accounting for accuracy increases of 2.40%, 10.62% and 0.55% compared with a yearly cropland mapping approach in our previous research. The best results using annual samples extracted from the same season with the classified images supported the use of annual and growing samples in long-term annual mapping. Overall, a common trend of cropland expansion in all three sites was revealed, with an increase rate of 10.06, 3.73 and 1.35 kha/year in Egypt, Ethiopia and South Africa, respectively. The results indicated a rapid increasing pattern from bare land (desert) to irrigated systems (Egyptian site) but smaller and stable cropland changes in smallholder and farming-pastoral ecotones (Ethiopian and South African site), where limited land was still available for an expansion of agricultural area. This study highlights the potential application of time-series Landsat data in documenting and contributing missing cropland distribution information required for assessing and solving food security in Africa.', '[Xu, Yidi; Yu, Le; Zhao, Jiyao; Lu, Hui; Gong, Peng] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.

However, ALS is subject to some limitations in forested environments. One of these is that height growth measured between two times can be due to vertical crown growth of trees or to lateral growth of branches. The latter process gives canopy height change values unrelated to actual stem elongation.   Lateral growth is a source of uncertainties in height change analyses because canopy height models do not contain information on the source of the growth. Lateral infilling of open space in the canopy and vertical crown growth are important processes in the gap dynamics of temperate deciduous forests. Small gaps are expected to close more often by lateral growth of branches while larger gaps can sometimes close by the vertical crown growth of seedling and saplings. Yet, few studies have examined growth patterns in and out of gaps in temperate deciduous forests.   We studied both unmanaged and managed temperate deciduous forests in southern Quebec, Canada using a multi-temporal ALS dataset. A Bayesian stochastic model of three-dimensional dynamics was developed to classify whether measured height growth was due to lateral growth or vertical crown growth. A generalized additive model was also constructed to relate vertical crown growth to the height of trees.   Between 10.6% and 13.7% of the canopy height model\'s pixels changed value due to lateral growth. There was no clear temporal trend for the frequencies of lateral growth in the managed forests chronosequence. Frequencies of lateral growth were also comparable between unmanaged and managed sites. Treetops of dominant trees grew slowly while crown edges of those trees grew both vertically and laterally. Our results show that canopy structure recovery in managed forests occurs through faster vertical crown growth of trees < 10 m tall and lower tree mortality compared to unmanaged forests.', '[Senecal, Jean-Francois] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Ctr Etude Foret, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.

Previous models that attempted to utilize this information usually required the user to input empirical values for critical model parameters, leading to less optimal performance. Multi-view image information is useful for improving classification accuracy, but the methods to assimilate multi-view information to make it usable for context driven models have not been explored in the literature. Here we propose a novel method to exploit the multi-view information for generating class membership probability. Moreover, we develop a new conditional random field model to integrate multi-view information and context information to further improve landcover classification accuracy. This model does not require the user to manually input parameters because all parameters in the Conditional Random Field (CRF) model are fully learned from the training dataset using the gradient descent approach. Using multi-view data extracted from small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs), we experimented with Gaussian Mixed Model (GMM), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) classifiers to test model performance. The results showed that our model improved average overall accuracies from 58.3% to 74.7% for the GMM classifier, 75.8% to 87.3% for the RF classifier, 75.0% to 84.4% for the SVM classifier and 80.3% to 86.3% for the DCNN classifier.

Leaf area index (LAI) maps for floating and emergent macrophyte growth forms were derived from a semiempirical regression model based on the best-performing spectral index, with an error level of 0.11 m(2) m(-2).

The sensor design of PROBA-V with oriented cameras offers a wide field of view (FOV) for sampling the BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function).

The method classically operates a selection of cloudless scenes, performs atmospheric corrections, and finally applies a correction of directional effects on a pixel per pixel basis. The synthesis period is the decade and the composite period is 20 days. Such choice is a pointwise sampling as being a trade-off between the availability of clear scenes and the timescale for phenology. Regarding the albedo catalogue, a narrow-band to broadband conversion is stipulated. A recurrent technique serves for gap-filling based on the spread of weighed a priori data.

Redistribution processes control the spatial variability of snow accumulation, which not only controls meltwater supply, but also regulates snowmelt timing, duration, and rates, as well as snow-covered area depletion and the variable contributing area for meltwater runoff generation. However, most hydrological models and land surface schemes do not consider snow redistribution processes, and those that do are difficult to verify without spatially distributed snow depth measurements. These are rarely available in both high resolution and covering large scales. As an increased number of hydrological models include snow redistribution processes there is a need for additional snowcover metrics to verify snow redistribution schemes over large areas using readily available data.   This study develops novel high-resolution (20 m), snowcover indices from remotely sensed imagery (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) to evaluate snow redistribution models over alpine areas without in-situ or airborne snow observations. A snowcover absence (SA) index, calculated from snow-free areas during the winter, identifies areas of wind erosion or avalanche source areas. A snowcover persistence (SP) index, calculated from snow-covered areas during the summer, identifies snow deposition in drifts and avalanche deposits.   The snowcover indices captured the relative differences in surface observations of snow presence and absence between exposed and sheltered sites on an intensely instrumented ridge in the Canadian Rockies Hydrological Observatory. Within the Tuolumne River Basin in central California (1100 km(2)), the SP index captured roughly half of the spatial variability (R-2 = 0.49 to 0.56) in peak SWE as estimated from airborne LiDAR-derived snow depths. At the individual mountain ridge scale (similar to 800 m), variability in both ablation and snow redistribution controlled the SP patterns over 7979 ridges. Differences in shortwave irradiance explained 76% of the SP variance across ridges, but could not explain smaller-scale (similar to 100 m) SP peaks that are associated with snowdrifts and avalanche deposits. The snowcover indices can be used to evaluate snow redistribution models of the finer scale impacts of snow redistribution by wind and gravity as long as the larger scale influences of spatially variable solar irradiance effects are also simulated.', '[Wayand, Nicholas E.; Marsh, Christopher B.; Shea, Joseph M.; Pomeroy, John W.] Univ Saskatchewan, Ctr Hydrol, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.

The orbital positions of the GEOs provided a large difference (similar to 46.5 degrees) in the viewing zenith angle (VZA) in the study region (122-132 degrees E, 32.5-42.5 degrees N) and high contrast observations at dawn. Numerical simulations were carried out to derive the optical properties of the LSF and the radiative differences between the GEOs due to both the VZA and spectral response function (SRF). The conventional threshold method, which used the visible reflectance at 0.67 mu m (120.67) and the brightness temperature difference between 3.7 mu m and 11 mu m (BTD3.7-11), had limitations in detecting LSF at dawn due to weak visible light and fast night-to-day transition. We utilized the observed stereo differences (Delta R-0.67, Delta BTD3.7-11) between the two GEOs to improve LSF detection. The dual-satellite observations were verified with ground-based data from 45 stations in South Korea co-located with each GEO pixel. The Delta R-0.67 threshold value showed better accuracy (78% vs. 67%) than the conventional R-0.67 threshold method. In addition, the Delta BTD3.7-11 threshold was better (55% vs. 38%) than the Delta BTD3.7-11 threshold. The dual-satellite method allowed more reliable LSF detection using the combination of Delta R-0.67 and R-0.67, particularly for LSF without cumuliform or high clouds. Our method is applicable to multiple geostationary satellites for continuous LSF monitoring.', '[Yoo, Jung-Moon; Yoo, Jung-Min] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Sci Educ, Seoul 120750, South Korea.

The determination of soil attributes to achieve the best decision making on land use planning is crucial. The use of remote sensing (satellite images) can improve understanding of the surface, since it collects a spectral reflectance fingerprint related to soil properties. However, methodologies still gather spatially fragmented information on bare soil in a single image; thus, there is still room to improve information as a continuous surface. This work has the purpose of developing a procedure using multi-temporal satellite image information, aiming to construct a single synthetic image which would represent soils. The work was carried out in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, on a site covering 14,614 km(2). The procedure, designated as Geospatial Soil Sensing System (GEOS3), is based on the following steps: a) creation of a database with Landsat 5 legacy data.; b) filtering of the database to provide images only from the dry season in the region; c) insertion of a set of rules into the system to filter other objects besides soils; d) Each bare soil occurrence for each location along the time-series was used to calculate a Temporal Synthetic Spectral Reflectance (TESS) of the soil surface; e) aggregation of all TESS composes the Synthetic Soil Image (SYSI); f) quantitative and qualitative validation of the SYSI through the correlation between laboratory and TESS, soil line assessment and the principal component analysis (PCA). GEOS3 was able to provide the best representative reflectance of soils for each band during the historical period. Thus, TESS is not the \'true\' but a synthetic spectral reflectance. The canonical correlation between laboratory and satellite data reached 0.93. A value of up to 0.88 in the Pearson\'s correlation between laboratory and TESS was also achieved. In a single scene, only 0.5% of area was available as isolated bare soil for spatial analysis. However, SYSI reached 68%. Considering only the sugarcane agricultural areas, a value of 92% was achieved. Our study indicates that a multi-temporal data mining procedure can retrieve soil surface representation. The key to the results was calculating the median spectral reflectance from the bare soil pixels along the period of the time series. GEOS3 products can aid soil evaluation by assisting in digital soil mapping, soil security, precision agriculture, soil attribute quantification, soil conservation, environment monitoring and soil sample allocation, among others.', '[Melo Dematte, Jose Alexandre; Fongaro, Caio Troula; Safanelli, Jose Lucas] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Soil Sci, Luiz de Queiroz Coll Agr, Ave Padua Dias 11,Postal Code 09, BR-13416900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil.

We combined existing Landsat time series algorithms to quantify both harmonic and phenological metrics in a new set of spectral-temporal features that can be produced seamlessly across many Landsat scenes. Harmonic metrics characterize mean annual reflectance and seasonal variability, while phenological metrics quantify the timing of seasonal events. We assessed the performance of spectral-temporal features derived from time series of all available observations (1985-2015) relative to more conventional single date and multi-date inputs. Performance was determined based on agreement with a reference dataset for eight New England forest types at both the pixel and polygon scale. We found that spectral-temporal features consistently and significantly (paired t-test, p << 0.01) outperformed all feature sets derived from individual images and multi-date combinations in all measures of agreement considered. Harmonic features, such as annual amplitude and model fit error, aid in distinguishing deciduous hardwoods from conifer species, while phenology features, like the timing of autumn onset and growing season length, were useful in separating hardwood classes. This study represents an important step toward large-scale forest type mapping using spectral-temporal Landsat features by providing a quantitative assessment of the advantages of harmonic and phenology features derived from time series of Landsat data as compared with more conventional single-date and multi-date classification inputs.', '[Pasquarella, Valerie J.; Holden, Christopher E.; Woodcock, Curtis E.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, 675 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.

In both episodes, dense beds of turtle grass (Thalassia testudinum) were decimated. Elevated water temperature and hypersalinity have been implicated as contributing factors in both mortality events. During both die-off events seagrass beds on shallow (Z approximate to 0.3 m) mudbanks in western Florida Bay were disproportionately affected when compared to neighboring seagrass in deeper basins (Z approximate to 1.5 m). A network of in situ monitoring stations has measured sea surface temperature and salinity at hourly intervals in 16 basins in Florida Bay from August 2009 to the present day and these data aided in diagnosing the 2015-2016 die-off event. However, very few in situ observations of sea surface temperature have been collected on Florida Bay\'s shallow mudbanks as most are inaccessible by boat. As a result, our understanding of the role of elevated SST in shaping the spatial patterns of seagrass mortality is hindered by the spatial distribution of the in situ monitoring data and its record length. Therefore, we turn to remotely sensed SST data to expand our spatial coverage to include the entire Florida Bay ecosystem and to extend the record length to include the 1987-1991 die-off event. 1 km MODIS SST shows that shallow mudbanks were consistently warmer (by up to 6 degrees C) than nearby deeper basins. While water depth is likely the primary driver of spatial variability in SST, Landsat-8 surface reflectance data suggest that shallow seagrass beds could have suffered from the added influence of low surface reflectance, which might have further contributed to their thermal stress. Daily 0.25 degrees AVHRR SST shows that the August maximum SST has increased by 1 degrees C from 1981 to 2016, which is a cause for concern for the future of seagrass in Florida Bay. Correlation of monthly AVHRR SST anomalies with the multivariate ENSO index shows that ENSO can only partially explain the anomalous temperatures. When viewed together, the in situ and remotely sensed SST suggests that both extended exposure to anomalously warm temperatures and large, rapid changes in temperature could have contributed to seagrass mortality during both events.', '[Carlson, Daniel F.] Florida State Univ, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.

The term is most often used with reference to foods and medicines, but herein it is used to characterize the elapsed time beyond which airborne laser scanning (ALS) data are no longer useful for enhancing inferences for forest inventory population parameters. National forest inventories (NFI) have a long history of using remotely sensed auxiliary information to enhance inferences. Although the combination of model-assisted estimators and ALS auxiliary data has been demonstrated to be particularly useful for this purpose, the expense associated with the acquisition of the ALS data has been an argument against their operational use. However, the longer the shelf-life of ALS data, the less the continuing acquisition costs and the greater the utility of the data.   The objective of the study was to assess the shelf-life of ALS data for enhancing inferences in the form of confidence intervals for mean aboveground, live tree, stem biomass per unit area. Confidence intervals were constructed using both model-assisted estimators and post-stratified estimators, four measurements of mostly the same forest inventory plots at 5-year intervals over a 17-year period, and a single set of ALS data acquired near the end of the 17-year period. The study area in north central Minnesota in the USA was characterized by naturally regenerated, uneven-aged, mixed species stands on both lowland and upland sites. The primary conclusions were twofold. First, the shelf-life of ALS data when used with model-assisted estimators exceeded 10 years, and second, even for 12 years elapsed time between plot measurement and ALS data acquisition, the variance of the model-assisted estimator of the mean was smaller by a factor of at least 1.75 than the variance of the stratified estimator used by the national forest inventory.', '[McRoberts, Ronald E.; Gormanson, Dale D.; Walters, Brian F.] US Forest Serv, Northern Res Stn, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.

SEVIRI data at 15 min temporal resolution were used to derive the Temperature and Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) that served as SM proxy within the disaggregation process. West Africa (3 degrees N 26 degrees W; 28 degrees N 26 degrees E) was selected as a case study as it presents both an important North-South climate gradient and a diverse range of ecosystem types. The main challenge was to set up a methodology applicable over a large area that overcomes the constraints of SMOS (low spatial resolution) and TVDI (requires similar atmospheric forcing and triangular shape formed when plotting morning rise temperature versus fraction of vegetation cover) in order to produce a 0.05 degrees resolution disaggregated SMOS SM product at the sub-continental scale. Consistent cloud cover appeared as one of the main constraints for deriving TVDI, especially during the rainy season and in the southern parts of the region and a large adjustment window (105 x 105 SEVIRI pixels) was therefore deemed necessary. Both the original and the disaggregated SMOS SM products described well the seasonal dynamics observed at six locations of in situ observations. However, there was an overestimation in both products for sites in the humid southern regions; most likely caused by the presence of forest. Both TVDI and the associated disaggregated SM product were found to be highly sensitive to algorithm input parameters; especially for conditions of high fraction of vegetation cover. Additionally, seasonal dynamics in TVDI did not follow the seasonal patterns of SM. Still, its spatial heterogeneity was found to be a good proxy for disaggregating SMOS SM data; main river networks and spatial patterns of SM extremes (i.e. droughts and floods) not seen in the original SMOS SM product were revealed in the disaggregated SM product for a test case of July September 2012. The disaggregation methodology thereby successfully increased the spatial resolution of SMOS SM, with potential application for local drought/flood monitoring of importance for the livelihood of the population of West Africa.', '[Tagesson, T.; Horion, S.; Fornies, V.

The method was tested and validated using in-situ passive microwave measurements at incidence angles from 0 to 60 degrees of sub-arctic\'frozen organic soils in Northeastern Canada. The retrieved permittivity values give an overall RMSE between the measured and simulated brightness temperatures of 4.6 K for all frequencies combined.

This analysis suggests that the accuracy of the retrieved parameters, using the method given here, is of +/- 1.00 for the permittivity and +/- 0.12 cm for surface roughness. Also, a comparison was conducted between the parameterization used in this study and the one of Weginfiller and Matzler (1999) to estimate the soil contribution to the emitted brightness temperature of snowpacks.

Considering the importance of this biome and climate change projections, the monitoring of vegetation status of these rainforests becomes of significant importance. In this context vegetation temperature is presented as a key variable linked with plant physiology. In particular some studies showed the relationship between this variable and the CO2 absorption capacity and biomass loss of these tropical forests proving the potential use of vegetation temperature in the monitoring of the vegetation status. Nevertheless, the use of thermal remote sensing data over tropical forests still has some limitations being of special importance the atmospheric correction under very humid conditions and the possible high occurrence of cloudy pixels. In order to mitigate these limitations over the Amazon region, we present in this paper a new processing methodology to derive a LST product from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The LST product was generated using a tuned split window equation and cloud information derived from the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm. This LST product was validated using simulated and in situ data, and inter compared to the MODIS LST standard product (MOD11). Validation analysis shows that the new LST product reduces the RMSE by 0.6 to 1 K when compared to the MODIS standard LST product, mainly because of a reduction of the bias.

Our goal was to quantify and understand the time-lagged land use effects of WWII in Romania, by applying Structure from Motion technology to 1960s Corona spy satellite photography. We quantified forest cutting across Romania from 1955 to 1965. This was a period when Romania\'s economy recovered from the war and when Romania established close economic ties to the Soviet Union, and when the Romanian government made reparation payments to the Soviet Union. To understand the effects of war, we developed an accurate and fast method to orthorectify high-resolution Corona photography in mountain areas, and rectified scanned Corona photography based on Structure from. Motion technology. Our study area of 212,000 km(2) was covered by 208 Corona film strips, which we rectified with an overall average accuracy of 14.3 m. We identified 530,000 ha of forest cuts over this time period, the rate of which is three times higher than contemporary cutting rates. Our results highlight that the environmental and land use effects of WWII were substantial in Romania, due to reparation payments, post-war policies regarding resource exploitation, and technological and infrastructural development. Our research provides quantitative evidence of how wars can cause time-lagged and long-term effects on the environment. Methodologically, we advance remote sensing science by pioneering a new approach to orthorectify Corona photography for large areas effectively. Corona data are available globally.

Many remote sensing applications utilizing coarse spatial resolution time series methods are not suitable for Landsat due to observation sparsity. In this research we develop an imputation based approach to constrain the harmonic modeling method of Zhu et al. (2012, 2015) and Zhu and Woodcock (2014b) to reconstruct Landsat time series at a regular temporal interval. The approach was assessed for a boreal forest region in central Canada for different sparsity conditions. The imputed Landsat estimates for a specific pixel were predicted from climate or AVHRR data. These estimates were given a small weight relative to available Landsat observations in fitting the final harmonic model essentially constraining it to a more plausible range. In addition we implemented the model in a piecewise manner to handle non-linear temporal drift related to factors such as climate change, drought, or the allometric nature of vegetation regrowth. Results show that the inclusion of imputed estimates improved model predictions in the presence of observation sparsity. Where there were less than 3 observations within +/- 20 days the imputation approach performed better, with a reduction in average reflectance error of 0.001 to 2.5.

The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) agreement is based on the evidence for, and likely causes of, climate change synthesised by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and is supported, for climate, by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). GCOS has defined a set of Essential Climate Variables (ECV), established the requirements for their systematic observation, and the development of data archives, needed to support the study the climate system. The Climate Change Initiative (CCI), represents the contribution by the European Space Agency (ESA) to GCOS. CCI is a programme designed to bring together European expertise in Earth Observation with that from the climate research community to address those ECV that can be generated using satellite observations. Specifically the objective is \'to realise the full potential of the long-term global Earth Observation archives that ESA together with its Member States have established over the last thirty years, as a significant and timely contribution to the ECV databases required by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)\'. In doing so the intended legacy of the programme is to put in place mechanisms capable of providing long term, fully traceable, and transparent access to its records.

The past three decades have been witness to the emergence of DLST methods in large numbers, the accuracies of which were often assessed by comparing the disaggregated with fine spatial resolution LSTs using error indexes such as the root mean square error (RMSE). However, the majority of previous error indexes are, by their nature, insufficient for assessing the performances of DLST methods. This insufficiency is due in part to their lower competence at distinguishing the DLST error from LST retrieval errors and in part to their inability to remove the process controls resulting from different thermal contrasts, temperature units, and resolution ratios among different scenarios in which DLST is conducted. This is also because they are unable to denote the sharpening statuses of the DLST results (e.g., under- or over-sharpening). This status quo has made the evaluation of method performances challenging and sometimes unreliable.   To better assess DLST method performances under diversified scenarios, we formulated five protocols, through which a simple yet flexible index (SIFI) was subsequently designed. The establishment of an SIFI includes the following four steps: (1) a detail-based evaluation, which is designed primarily to exclude the impacts of systematic deviations on estimated LSTs; (2) a Gaussian normalization, which is primarily intended to remove the differences in temperature units and thermal contrasts; (3) a triple comparison, with the aim of attenuating the influence of the difference in the resolution ratio in comparisons of method performances; and (4) a piecewise comparison, which is primarily scheduled to distinguish among the three sharpening statuses, under sharpening, acceptable over-sharpening, and unacceptable over-sharpening. The evaluation ability of SIFI was compared with those of the RMSE, Erreur Relative Globale Adimensionnelle de Synthese (ERGAS), and image quality index (Q) using simulation tests and actual thermal data. The results illustrate that SIFI generally outperforms the other indexes; it is able to mitigate the impacts from process errors and controls during evaluation and is able to indicate the sharpening statuses accurately. We believe this new index will likely promote the design of future DLST algorithms and procedures.', '[Gao, Lun; Zhan, Wenfeng; Huang, Fan] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Geog Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

Satellite remote sensing provides an effective means for regional and global cropland monitoring, particularly in data-sparse regions that lack reliable ground observations and reporting. The conventional approach of using visible and near-infrared based vegetation index (VI) observations has prevailed for decades since the onset of the global satellite era. However, other satellite data encompass diverse spectral ranges that may contain complementary information on crop growth and yield, but have been largely understudied and underused. Here we conducted one of the first attempts at synergizing multiple satellite data spanning a diverse spectral range, including visible, near-infrared, thermal and microwave, into one framework to estimate crop yield for the U.S. Corn Belt, one of the world\'s most important food baskets. Specifically, we included MODIS Enhanced VI (EVI), estimated Gross Primary Production based on GOME-2 solar-induced fluorescence (SIF-GPP), thermal-based ALEXI Evapotranspiration (ET), QuikSCAT Ku-band radar backscatter, and AMSR-E X-band passive microwave Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) in this study, benchmarked on USDA county-level crop yield statistics. We used Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), an effective statistical model for dimension reduction, to distinguish commonly shared and unique individual information from the various satellite data and other ancillary climate information for crop yield estimation. In the PLSR model that includes all of the satellite data and climate variables from 2007 to 2009, we assessed the first two major PLSR components and found that the first component (an integrated proxy of crop aboveground biomass) explained 82% variability of modelled crop yield, and the second component (dominated by environmental stresses) explained 15% variability of modelled crop yield. We found that most of the satellite derived metrics (e.g. SIF-GPP, radar back scatter, EVI, VOD, ALEXI-ET) share common information related to aboveground crop biomass (i.e. the first component). For this shared information, the SIF-GPP and backscatter data contain almost the same amount of information as EVI at the county scale. When removing the above shared component from all of the satellite data, we found that EVI and SIF-GPP do not provide much extra information; instead, Ku-band backscatter, thermal-based ALEXI-ET, and X-band VOD provide unique information on environmental stresses that improves overall crop yield predictive skill. In particular, Ku-band backscatter and associated differences between morning and afternoon overpasses contribute unique information on crop growth and environmental stress. Overall, using satellite data from various spectral bands significantly improves regional crop yield predictions. The additional use of ancillary climate data (e.g. precipitation and temperature) further improves model skill, in part because the crop reproductive stage related to harvest index is highly sensitive to environmental stresses but they are not fully captured by the satellite data used in our study. We conclude that using satellite data across various spectral ranges can improve monitoring of large-scale crop growth and yield beyond what can be achieved from individual sensors. These results also inform the synergistic use and development of current and next generation satellite missions, including NASA ECOSTRESS, SMAP, and 000-2, for agricultural applications.

Previous efforts have focused on constructing a soft classification error matrix and producing summary measures to describe overall and per-class map accuracy. However, these summary assessments do not provide information on the spatial distribution of the soft classification error as distributed at the individual pixel level. This is important because the map error of a given class may vary considerably over different regions. Spatial interpolation has been previously used for predicting soft classification error at the pixel level. Here, we propose two alternative domains for soft classification error interpolation, the spectral and mapped class proportion domains. In the spectral domain we interpolate errors in the classification feature space, whereas in the mapped class proportion domain interpolation takes place in a space with dimensions defined by the mapped class proportions (i.e., the output of the soft classification). The two newly proposed prediction methods (spectral domain and mapped class proportion domain), spatial interpolation, and a summary measure method were evaluated using 23 test regions, each 10 km x 10 km, distributed throughout the United States. These 10 km x 10 km blocks had complete coverage reference data (where the reference classification was determined by manual interpretation) and the predicted error maps were then evaluated by comparing them to these complete coverage reference error maps. Mean absolute error was used to quantify the agreement of the predicted error maps to the reference error maps. The spectral and mapped class proportion methods generally outperformed the spatial interpolation and the summary measure methods both in terms of smaller mean absolute error and visual similarity of predicted error maps to the reference error maps. The superiority of the new methods over spatial interpolation is an important result because spatial interpolation is a familiar method analysts would commonly consider for modeling spatial variation of classification error. The predicted soft classification error maps provide a straightforward visual assessment of the spatial patterns of error that can accompany the original classification products to enhance their value in subsequent analysis and modeling tasks. Furthermore, from the standpoint of implementation, our methods do not require additional datasets; the same test dataset currently used for confusion/error matrix construction can be used for our error interpolation methods.', '[Khatami, Reza; Mountrakis, Giorgos] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm Resources Engn, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.

Observations depict a two fold increase in surface and tropospheric ozone during the event as compared to normal days in both AIRS and TES ozone measurements. COSMIC temperature perturbations show generation of shorter vertical wavelengths efficient for the sub-tropical tropopause folding due to orography induced gravity waves. Moreover, the intense tropopause folding as evidenced by upward-downward vertical velocities couplet could trigger the intrusion of stratospheric ozone rich air into upper tropospheric ozone poor air as also confirmed by high values of potential vorticity during the observational period.

So far, the most commonly used techniques for reducing the impact of noise in the retrieved satellite soil moisture observations have been based on moving average filters and Fourier based methods. This paper introduces a new alternative wavelet based approach called Wiener-Wavelet-Based Filter (WiW), which uses an entropy based de-noising method to design a causal version of the filter. WiW is used as a post-retrieval processing tool to enhance the quality of observations derived from one active (the Advanced Scatterometer, ASCAT) and one passive (the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System, AMSRE) satellite sensors. The filter is then compared with two candidate de-noising techniques, namely: i) a Wiener causal filter introduced by Su et al. (2013) and ii) a conventional moving average filter. The validation is carried out globally at 173 (for AMSRE) and 243 (for ASCAT) soil moisture stations. Results show that all the three de-noising techniques can increase the agreement between satellite and in situ measurements in terms of correlation and signal-to-noise ratio. The Wiener-based methods show least signal distortion and demonstrate to be conservative in retaining the signal information in de-noised data. Importantly, the Wiener filters can be calibrated with the data at hand, without the need for auxiliary data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

These biomes are currently under immense pressure, particularly for conversion to agriculture, and already experience high global deforestation rates. Miombo forests in Southern Angola are affected by deforestation, fragmentation and degradation, caused mainly by an increasing rural population who follows a traditional farming system of shifting cultivation with slash-and-burn agriculture. After the termination of the civil war in 2002, population growth and resettlements have accelerated the use of woody resources, selective logging and clearing for cultivation purposes and led to an exceedance of sustainability thresholds. Large scale projects are expected to put further pressure on the forests and increase the potential of conflicts regarding land resources and competition with local subsistence farming.   We use an existing time series segmentation tool (LandTrendr) with a time series of Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) data in combination with adapted temporal metrics to provide information about the dynamics of different cultivation patterns, to gain insight into historical developments and to assess temporal cultivation characteristics. We define cleared areas and cultivation time on a pixel-by-pixel basis providing temporal and spatial information on current and past changes from 1989 to 2013 using data from Landsat 5-8. Overall accuracy for the disturbance detection is 72%. We can follow the effect of armed conflicts on agricultural expansion with a drop in deforestation rate of more than 70% from 12,000 to 4000 ha per year (1994-1998) and subsequently tripling to 12,000 ha per year again after 2002. Deforestation patterns are in accordance with previous multi-temporal studies, although time series segmentation reveals more detailefi information on deforestation and cultivation dynamics.   We successfully separate areas of different historic backgrounds and agricultural dynamics, e.g. areas that were severely affected during the civil war, which transition from shifting to semi-permanent and permanent systems. We provide recommendations for the assessment of agricultural dynamics in similar areas where ground data and basic information is missing. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Airborne LiDAR has established its role in providing observations of canopy geometry and topography. These data are input for estimation of important forest properties to support forestry-related decision-making. A major deficiency in forest remote sensing is tree species identification. This study examines the option of using multi-footprint airborne LiDAR data. Features of such sensor design exist in recently introduced multispectral laser scanners. The first objective was to acquire radiometrically normalized, multi-footprint (11, 22, 44 and 59 cm) waveform (WF) data that characterize 1064nm backscatter reflectance on the interval scale. The second objective was to analyze and validate the data quality in order to draw the correct conclusions about the effect of footprint size on WFs from natural and man-made targets. The experiment was carried out in Finland. Footprint variation was generated by acquiring data at different flying heights and by adjusting the transmitted power. The LiDAR campaign was successful and the data were of sufficient quality, except for a 1 dB trend due to the atmosphere. Significant findings were made conceming the magnitude of atmospheric losses, the linearity of the amplitude scale and the bandwidth characteristics of the receiver, the stability of the transmitter, the precision of the amplitude data and the transmission losses in canopies and power lines, as well as the response of WF attributes to footprint size in forest canopies. Multi-footprint data are a promising approach although the tree species-specific signatures were weak. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Small-footprint airborne laser scanning (ALS) data proved valuable for characterising the three-dimensional structure of forest canopies and the retrieval of biophysical parameters such as plant and leaf area index (PAI and LAI), fractional cover or canopy layering. Nevertheless, few studies analysed combined occluded and observed canopy elements in dense vegetation as a result of airborne laser scanning geometries. The occluded space contains a substantial amount of vegetation elements (i.e. leaf, needle and wood material), which are missing in the analysis of the three-dimensional canopy structure. Consequently, this will lead to erroneous retrieval of biophysical parameters. In this study, we introduce a voxel traversal algorithm to characterise ALS observation patterns inside a voxel grid. We analyse the dependence of occluded and unobserved canopy volume on pulse density, flight strip overlap and season of overflight in a temperate mixed forest. ALS measurements under leaf-on and leaf-off conditions were used. For cross-comparison purposes, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) measurements on a 50x50 m(2) subplot under leaf-on conditions were used. TLS acquisitions were able to depict the three-dimensional structure of the forest plot in high detail, ranging up to the top-most canopy layer.   Our results at 1 m voxel size show that even with the highest average pulse density of 11 pulses/m(2), at least 25% of the forest canopy volume remains occluded in the ALS acquisition under leaf-on conditions. Comparison with TLS acquisitions further showed that roughly 28% of the vegetation elements detected by the TLS acquisitions were not detected by the ALS system due to occlusion effects. By combining leaf-on and leaf-off acquisitions, we were able to recover roughly 7% of the occluded vegetation elements from the leaf-on acquisition. We find that larger flight strip overlap can significantly increase the amount of observed canopy volume due to the added observation angles and increased pulse density. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The seasonal and interannual variability of its turbid plume is investigated using ocean color composites from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor aboard the Aqua and Terra satellites (2000-2014) and long-term records of river discharge, wind and precipitation rate. Regional climate indices, namely the Eastern Atlantic (EA) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), were analyzed to identify the influence of atmospheric variability on the generation of anomalous turbid river plume patterns. The connection between the monthly time series of normalized water leaving radiance at 555 nm (nLw(555)) and river discharge is high (r = 0.81), which indicates a strong link between river outflow and turbidity levels in the river plume. The equivalent result is found between precipitation and nLw(555) time series, but the peak correlation was found with a 1-month lag, revealing the importance of the river dams on the outflow regulation (r = 0.65). Lag correlations between nLw(555) and EA index show a peak at 1-month lag (r = 0.51). The relation between NAO index and Douro river discharge is considerable (-0.50), for a time lag of 1-month as well. However, the correlation coefficient between nLw(555) and NAO index presents a maximum peak for a longer period (r = -0.42 at 3-month). Anomalous turbid plume patterns, not related with estuarine outflow, are found during autumn 2004. Acoccolithophore bloom is proposed as a plausible explanation for these unexpected turbid patches.

We observed that, while Lcv> 0.5 may represent forests with large tree size inequality, Lskew>0 can be an indicator for areas lacking a closed dominant canopy. Lcv = 0.5 discriminated forests with trees of approximately equal sizes (even tree size classes) from those with large tree size inequality (uneven tree size classes) with kappa K = 0.48 and overall accuracy OA = 92.4%, while Lskew= 0 segregated oligophotic and euphotic zones with K = 0.56 and OA = 84.6%. We showed that a supervised classification could only marginally improve some of these accuracy results. The rule-based approach presents a simple method for detecting structural properties key to tree competition and potential for natural regeneration. The study was carried out with low-density datasets from the national program on ALS surveying of Finland, which shows potential for replication with the ALS datasets typically acquired at nation-wide scales. Since the presented method was based on deductive mathematical rules for describing distributions, it stands out from inductive supervised and unsupervised classification methods which are more commonly used in remote sensing. Therefore, it presents an opportunity for deducing physical relations which could partly eliminate the need for supporting ALS applications with field plot data for training and modelling, at least in Boreal forest ecosystems.

In this study, we investigated region wide glacier thickness change in the Central Tien Shan (CTS) during 2000-2012 by differencing the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) with a newly constructed DEM from 27 TanDEM-X images. For a total glacier area of 7239.8 +/- 527.2 km(2), an average glacier thickness change rate of -0.24 +/- 0.22 m/a was derived. This result agrees well with the result based on satellite laser altimetry measurements reported earlier (-0.31 +/- 0.41 m/a). With temporal synchronization, a fine spatial resolution and wide coverage, our measurements are able to reveal abundant glacier change features and dependencies in the CTS. Firstly, the lower mountains have seen a more severe glacier decline, and the glaciers facing the prevailing wind (westerlies) have experienced a greater decline because of the stronger evaporation. Furthermore, those glaciers lying along the extremely high Meridian mountain range have obviously gained mass in their upper reaches, because the air current from the west is blocked and lifted by the Meridian mountain range. Secondly, for the entire glacier body, the theoretical hyperbolic dependence between debris thickness and ice decline was very difficult to establish. Some huge glaciers covered by heavy debris have still experienced a severe decline. However, even though the heavy debris did not prevent the ablation, its attenuating effects were considerable. Thirdly, for the glaciers that surged before 2000, the mass gain in the restoring zones has not been enough to cover the mass loss in ablation zones. Some large glaciers surged again during 2000-2012; however, with much lower magnitudes than in previous surges. In general, the surge glaciers have experienced a greater decline than the non-surge glaciers. Fourthly, due to the ice front calving and subglacial thermal erosion, glaciers connected to proglacial lakes have receded and thinned much more rapidly than the land-terminated glaciers. Overall, the glaciers in the CTS are more stable than those in other parts of the Tien Shan. However, the glacier state there is still alarming. A moderate average thinning rate was derived because the drastic thinning in the ablation zones was balanced by the slight thinning in the broad accumulation zones. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

A field experiment was conducted on Sabine Peninsula (76 degrees 27\' N, 108 degrees 33\' W), Melville Island, Nunavut, Canada to collect field spectra and PVC for five vegetation types, i.e., polar semi-desert (PD), dry mesic tundra (DMT), mesic tundra (MT), wet mesic tundra (WMT) and wet sedge/moss (WSM). Based on field spectra, two types of 2-band hyperspectral (i.e., Hyperion) and multi spectral (i.e., WorldView-3) vegetation indices (VIs) were derived using all possible band combinations. Optimal spectral bands were identified based on their correlations with green PVC. In addition, VIs designed for other landscapes were examined for their ability to estimate green PVC in an Arctic environment. The results indicate that PVC and spectral features for Arctic vegetation types were related to moisture content: (1) vegetation types with dry to intermediate soil moisture (e.g., PD, DMT and MT) possessed large amounts of bare soil and exhibited spectral properties similar to bare soil; and (2) vegetation types with high moisture content (e.g., WMT and WSM) exhibited spectra similar to senescent vegetation given the substantial proportion of senescent vegetation in these vegetation types. The optimal Hyperion spectral bands for estimating green PVC were located at the absorption features observed in Arctic vegetation spectra, including 681.20 nm (leaf pigment absorption); 721.90 nm and 732.07 nm (along the red-edge slope); 1174.77 nm and 1184.87 nm (leaf water absorption); and 1447.14 nm, 1457.23 nm, 2072.65 nm and 2102.94 nm (leaf cellulose and lignin absorption). Narrowband Vls exhibited a stronger correlation with green PVC than broadband Vls due to the finer spectral features sampled by hyperspectral data. Further, VIs designed to estimate leaf pigment and dry matter content (e.g., lignin and cellulose) showed strong correlations with green PVC. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Sensor networks are innovative in their ability to capture the spatio-temporal heterogeneity and dynamics of soil moisture; however, they cannot be used to directly derive spatially continuous soil moisture distributions. A Bayesian-based upscaling algorithm that utilizes MODIS-derived apparent thermal inertia is used to map daily soil moisture spatial patterns with a resolution of 1 km in the Babao River Basin, China. The 2-4 cm soil moisture observations from seven automatic meteorological stations located in different elevation zones from 3000 m to 3500 m are employed to validate the mapping algorithm. The correlation coefficient and unbiased root-mean-square error (RMSE) averaged 0.880 and 0.031 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively, which indicate satisfactory estimation accuracy. The 1 km resolution soil moisture products are re-sampled to a resolution of 25 km and then compared to the level 3 Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity Mission (SMOS) soil moisture product. The results show that both products exhibit strong temporal consistency; however, due to complex topography, the SMOS soil moisture is generally lower than that of the upscaling results. Semivariograms and an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis are used to analyze the space-time heterogeneities of soil moisture at the 1 km scale. In the summer, rainfall results in soil moisture with low spatial variability and a complex spatial structure. After the rainy season, the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture is affected by other factors, such as soil texture, evapotranspiration and topography. From the perspective of temporal variation, the upscaled soil moisture shows a well-defined seasonal cycle, which represents the effects of decreased rainfall from August to October. Because more rain falls in the summer due to the mountain microclimate, the oscillation in soil moisture is more pronounced over 20% of the area compared to that in other regions. Based on a validation analysis of the mapping results, the upscaling method is proven feasible, and the upscaled soil moisture can be used to analyze eco-hydrological processes and validate remote sensing products.

Freely available medium-resolution satellite data (e.g. Landsat, Sentinel) offer the possibility of improved global agriculture monitoring. Here we develop and test a method for estimating in-season crop acreage using a probability sample of field visits and producing wall-to-wall crop type maps at national scales. The method is illustrated for soybean cultivated area in the US for 2015. A stratified, two-stage cluster sampling design was used to collect field data to estimate national soybean area. The field-based estimate employed historical soybean extent maps from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Cropland Data Layer to delineate and stratify U.S. soybean growing regions. The estimated 2015 U.S. soybean cultivated area based on the field sample was 341,000 km(2) with a standard error of 23,000 km2. This result is 1.0% lower than USDA\'s 2015 June survey estimate and 1.9% higher than USDA\'s 2016 January estimate. Our area estimate was derived in early September, about 2 months ahead of harvest. To map soybean cover, the Landsat image archive for the year 2015 growing season was processed using an active learning approach. Overall accuracy of the soybean map was 84%. The field-based sample estimated area was then used to calibrate the map such that the soybean acreage of the map derived through pixel counting matched the sample -based area estimate. The strength of the sample -based area estimation lies in the stratified design that takes advantage of the spatially explicit cropland layers to construct the strata. The success of the mapping was built upon an automated system which transforms Landsat images into standardized time-series metrics. The developed method produces reliable and timely information on soybean area in a cost-effective way and could be applied to other regions and potentially other crops in an operational mode.

However, time series of red cedar maps are still not available to document the continuously spatio-temporal dynamics of red cedar encroachment across landscape, watershed and regional scales. In this study, we developed a pixel and phenology-based mapping algorithm, and used it to analyze PALSAR mosaic data in 2010 and all the available Landsat 5/7 data during 1984-2010 with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This pilot study analyzed 4233 images covering >10 counties in the central region of Oklahoma, and generated red cedar forest maps for 2010 and five historical time periods: the late 1980s (1984-1989), early 1990s (1990-1994), late 1990s (1995-1999), early 2000s (2000-2004), and late 2000s (2005-2010). The resultant maps for 2010, the late 2000s, early 2000s, and late 1990s were evaluated using validation samples collected from Google Earth\'s high-resolution images and geo-referenced field photos. The overall (producer and user) accuracy of these maps ranged from 88% to 96% (88%-93%, and 96%-99%). The resultant maps clearly illustrated an increase in red cedar encroachment within the study area at an annual rate of similar to 8% during 1984-2010. These maps can be used to support additional studies on the driving factors and consequences of red cedar encroachment. This study also demonstrated the potential to trace the historical encroachment of red cedar into grasslands using time series Landsat images and PALSAR data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The automatic identification is based on brightness and spatial parameters of the ASAR images at five scale levels, and was verified with manual classification in four areas chosen to represent varying environmental conditions. The presented algorithm works comparatively well with images of the ocean in freezing temperatures and strong wind conditions, common in the Amundsen Sea. The detection rate was 96.2% which corresponds to 93.2% of the icebergs area, for all seasons. The algorithm generated 3.8% errors in the form of \'misses\' and 7.0% of \'false alarms\', mainly caused by the presence of ice floes.   The method was applied on 432 radar images acquired in 2011 under different meteorological, oceanographic and sea ice conditions. As an output a map showing the probability of finding icebergs has been created. It shows that high probability coincides with depth contours and indicates a westward drift of the bergs throughout the whole region. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.', '[Mazur, A.

Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) in this region have resulted in catastrophic damages and fatalities in the past decades. The recent warming has caused dramatic glacial lake changes and increased potential GLOF risk in the Himalaya. However, our knowledge on the current state and change of glacial lakes in the entire Himalaya is limited. This study maps the current (2015) distribution of glacial lakes across the entire Himalaya and monitors the spatially-explicit evolution of glacial lakes over five time periods from 1990 to 2015 using a total of 348 Landsat images at 30 m resolution. The results show that 4950 glacial lakes in 2015 cover a total area of 455.3 +/- 72.7 km(2), mainly located between 4000 m and 5700 m above sea level. Himalayan glacial lakes expanded by approximately 14.1% from 1990 to 2015. The changing patterns of supraglacial lakes and proglacial lakes are rather complex, involving both lake disappearance and emergence. Many emergent glacial lakes are found at higher elevations, especially the new proglacial lakes, which have formed as a result of glacier retreat. Spatially heterogeneous changes of Himalayan glacial lakes are observed, with the most significant expansion occurring in the southern slopes of the central Himalaya. Increasing glacier meltwater induced by the Himalayan atmospheric warming is a primary cause for the observed lake expansion. This study provides primary data for future GLOF risk assessments. A total of 118 rapidly expanded glacial lakes are identified as potential vulnerable lakes for the priority of risk assessment.

Process-based approaches have the advantage of representing the atmosphere-vegetation-soil system and associated fluxes as an organic integration, but their sophistication results in a lack of high spatiotemporal resolution continuous products. Targeting this gap, we reported a new set of global 8-day composite 1-km resolution GPP and ET products from 2000 to 2015, using a simplified process-based model, the Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS). BESS couples atmosphere and canopy radiative transfer, photosynthesis and evapotranspiration, and uses MODIS atmosphere and land data and other satellite data sources as inputs. We evaluated BESS products against FLUXNET observations at site scale (total of 113 sites, 742 site years), and against MPI-BGC products at global scale. At site scale, BESS 8-day Products agreed with FLUXNET observations with R-2 = 0.67 and RMSE = 2.58 gCm(-2) d(-1) for GPP, and R-2 = 0.62 and RMSE = 0.78 mm d(-1) for ET, respectively, and they captured a majority of seasonal variability, about half of spatial variability, and a minority of interannual variability in FLUXNET observations. At global scale, BESS mean annual sum GPP and ET maps agreed with MPI-BGC products with R-2 = 0.93 and RMSE = 229 gC m(-2) y(-1) for GPP, and R-2 = 0.90 and RMSE = 118 mm y(-1) for ET, respectively. Over the period of 2001-2011, BESS quantified the mean global GPP and ET as 122 +/- 25 PgC y(-1) and 65 x 10(3) +/- 11 x 10(3) km(3) y(-1), respectively, with a significant ascending GPP trend by 0.27 PgC y(-2) (p < 0.05), similar to MPI-BGC products as well. Overall, BESS GPP and ET estimates were comparable with FLUXNET observations and MPI-BGC products. The process-based BESS can serve as a set of independent GPP and ET products from official MODIS GPP and ET products. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

To evaluate the variation of water clarity of the Bohai Sea (BHS) in the past decade (2003-2014), Z(sd) is derived from MODIS-Aqua ocean color data with an innovative mechanistic model. The resulted Z(sd) product from MODIS is found within 23% differences of match-up in situ measurements that span a range of 2-12 m. Based on this validated MODIS Zsd product of the BHS, valuable findings regarding water clarity of the BHS over the period of 2003-2014 are obtained for the first time. For the central BHS, the climatological mean Z(sd) in August of 2003-2014 (3.9 m) is found strikingly lower than that observed in situ in August of 1982-1983 (8.7 m), 1959-1979 (8-12 m) and 1972-1987 (8-14 m). This implies substantial deterioration of water clarity in the central BHS after the late 1980s, an unpleasant byproduct of rapid economic development in the BHS surrounding regions initiated in the mid-1980s. On the other hand, no significant variations in Z(sd) in the central BHS is detected for the period of 2003-2014, suggesting deterioration of water clarity of this water body is not continued. Results from this effort highlight the value of both the analytically-derived Z(sd) product and satellite ocean color remote sensing in monitoring water quality of coastal seas.

We propose here a strategy of calibration and spatialization independent as much as possible of in situ measurements and reliable over large areas and under various climatic conditions. For this purpose, we combine the Simple Algorithm For Yield estimates (SAFY) model with high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing data from several sensors: Formosat-2, SPOT4-Take5, Landsat-8 and Deimos-1. SPOT4-Take5 experiment conducted in 2013 was designed to simulate the temporal sampling of ESA\'s Sentinel-2 mission. This study led to a new version of the SAFY model that takes into account the seasonal variation of specific leaf area (SLA) and effective light use efficiency (ELUE). The study takes place in a temperate agrosystem located in the south west of France. The SAFY outputs were validated with local measurements of biomass and yield estimates at both local and regional scales using a multiannual dataset. Good results were obtained for both local biomass (R = 0.98; RRMSE = 14%) and yield (R = 0.81; RRMSE = 8.9%), and for yield estimations at regional scale (R = 0.96; RRMSE = 4.6%). Results also showed that the use of a double logistic function to interpolate Green Area Index (GAI) time series permits to improve the estimations of biomass and yield when remote sensing data are missing. This work demonstrates the potential of high resolution remote sensing data to calibrate a simple crop model without resorting to in situ data and thus foreshadows the future applications using Sentinel-2 data.

Such approaches cannot capture dynamic changes of photosynthesis rates as caused by environmental stress. Further, applied vegetation indices are often affected by background reflectance or saturation effects. Sun. induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F) provides the most direct measure of photosynthesis and has been recently proposed as a new RS approach to improve estimates of GPP and tracing plant stress reactions. This work aims to provide further evidence on the complementary information content of F and its relation to changes in photosynthetic activity compared to traditional RS approaches. We use the airborne imaging spectrometer HyPlant to obtain several F products including red fluorescence (F-687), far-red fluorescence (F-760), F-760 yield (F-760yield) and the ration between F-687 and F-760 (F-ratio). We calculate several vegetation indices indicative for vegetation greenness. We apply a recently proposed F-based semi-mechanistic approach to improve the forward modeling of GPP using F-760 and compare this approach with a traditional one based on vegetation greenness and ground measurements of GPP derived from chamber measurements. In addition, we assess the sensitivity of F-760yield and Fratio for environmental stress. Our results show an improved predictive capability of GPP when using F-760 compared to greenness-based vegetation indices. F-760yield and F-ratio show a strong variability in time and between different crop types suffering from different levels of water shortage, indicating a strong sensitivity of F products for plant stress reactions. We conclude that the new RS approach of F provides complements to the set of commonly applies RS: The use of F-760 improves constraining estimates of GPP while the ratio of red and far-red F shows large potential for tracking spatio-temporal plant adaptation in response to environmental stress conditions.

We have validated four months (January to April 2010) of the version 3 Australian Bureau of Meteorology reprocessed Multifunction Transport SATellite-1R (v3 MTSAT-1R) SST data over the Tropical Warm Pool (TWP) region (90 degrees E to 170 degrees E, 25 degrees S to 15 degrees N) against both drifting buoy and Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) SST data. Validation against collocated point measurements from drifting buoys, under conditions where the surface ocean is well-mixed, shows that overall the v3 MTSAT-1R SSTs perform well with an average bias of 0.00 degrees C and a 0.73 degrees C standard deviation (STD). The average daytime and night-time mean bias is 0.06 degrees C and 0.08 degrees C, respectively. For all hours of the diurnal cycle, the mean biases are within +/- 0.25 degrees C, indicating the consistency between day and night v3 MTSAT-1R data. However, on average, the v3 MTSAT-1R SSTs are overestimated at cold SSTs and underestimated at warm SSTs. Similar results are obtained from validation against the AATSR satellite SSTs but with smaller STD (0.48 degrees C) and smaller average daytime and night-time mean biases (-0.04 degrees C and 0.06 degrees C, respectively). These results indicate that the v3 MTSAT-1R data set is suitable for SST DV investigations and validation of DV models. Using the validated v3 MSTAT-1R data, together with surface wind speed and solar short-wave insolation (SSI) outputs from the Australian Community Climate and Earth-System Simulator - Regional (ACCESS-R) numerical prediction model, we investigate SST DV events over the TWP region. Good correlation is found between DV events and low wind and high SSI conditions. The dominant role of wind speed in SST DV events over the SSI is also revealed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We here introduce the first phenology index (PI) based vegetation dynamics product, comprising start (SOS), end (EOS), length of growing season (LOS), and growing season integrated annual normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), specifically designed for the entire circumpolar north (>45 degrees N) using SPOT VGT data starting from 1999. PI combines the merits of NDVI and normalized difference infrared index (NDII) by taking the difference of squared greenness (from NDVI) and wetness (from NDII) to remove the soil and snow cover dynamics from key vegetation LSP cycles. The results show that the circumpolar vegetation dynamics and their spatial distributions are realistically detected. Further validation based on North American and European deciduous broadleaf, evergreen needleleaf and mixed forests, and wetland flux tower sites shows good agreements between the LSP dates from the circumpolar vegetation dynamics and ground phenology estimates from CO2 flux measurements. The validation also proves that the circumpolar vegetation dynamics product is an improvement over the operational global MODIS Combined Land Cover Dynamics (MCD12Q2) product for the circumpolar region. The results are further compared with the interannual variability of sea ice extent and leading teleconnection patterns in the region. The circumpolar averaged results show that, the growing season integrated annual NDVI is significantly increasing (0.68% year(-1), p = 0.006) and well correlated with the growing season sea ice extent trend (p = 0.007). The circumpolar vegetation dynamics is more related to Polar/Eurasia pattern (i.e., indicator of circumpolar vortex) than to Scandinavian Pattern (SCA) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). In view of the considerable scientific and policy importance of the circumpolar region, particularly the arctic ecosystems, the presented circumpolar vegetation dynamics product will greatly contribute to study changes in plant growth, phenology, photosynthetic capacity, and associated feedbacks under climate change.

Sea ice trajectory tracking with satellite scatterometer data in 2008 shows that ice around Antarctica is pushed offshore by katabatic winds influenced by the continental topography. The ice trajectories reveal that sea ice, grown earlier in the ice season, drifts northward away from the Antarctic continent forming a circumpolar frontal ice zone (FIZ) behind the ice edge. The FIZ thereby consists of sea ice that becomes rougher due to a longer exposure to wind and wave actions, and thicker over time by more ice growth and greater snow accumulation.   In the Antarctic circumpolar sea ice zone adjacent to the sea ice edge, satellite data in 1999-2009 exhibit a band of strong radar backscatter, which is consistent with the signature of older, thicker, and rougher sea ice with more snow in the FIZ. This sea ice band, as wide as 1000 km, serves as a \'Great Shield,\' encapsulating and protecting younger and thinner ice in the internal ice pack. In the young and thin ice region behind the FIZ, ice can grow rapidly as winds continue opening interior areas thereby creating effective \"ice factories.\" In addition, ridging can enhance ice thickness by convergence toward the circumpolar FIZ that is recirculated by westerly winds and currents. During the ice growth season, the FIZ advances until reaching lower-latitude warm waters at a boundary determined by the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front that is constrained by seafloor features. These persistent topographical and bathymetric geological factors help sustain the Antarctic sea ice cover. As such, the behavior of Antarctic sea ice is not a paradox as some have suggested, but instead is consistent with the geophysical characteristics in the southern polar region that starkly contrast to those in the Arctic.

The algorithm is based on the temporal evolution of the SAR backscatter coefficient (sigma(o)), using an ice type specific threshold approach that also corrects for incidence angle variation. Using 4457 RADARSAT images, the algorithm was applied over sea ice in the northern Canadian Arctic Archipelago that low spatial resolution microwave sensors have difficulty resolving, thus generating a new time series of melt onset from 1997 to 2014. Over the 1997-2014 period, the mean annual average melt onset date in the northern CM was on year day 164 (mid-June) with a standard deviation of 4 days. No significant trend for melt onset date was found over the 18-year period. An earlier (later) melt onset was associated with increased (decreased) solar energy absorption (r = 0.64, significant at 95% confidence) and subsequently associated in lighter (heavier) September sea ice coverage in the northern CAA (r = 0.62, significant at 95% confidence). RADARSAT estimates of melt onset were found to be in good agreement but more robust compared to passive microwave and scatterometer estimates over the northern CAA.

However, as we show in this study, naive application of TC to categorical target variables results in biased error estimates. The bias occurs because the categorical variable is usually bounded, introducing correlations between the errors and the truth, violating TC\'s assumptions. We introduce Categorical Triple Collocation (CTC), a variant of TC that relaxes these assumptions and may be applied to categorical target variables. The method estimates the rankings of the three measurement systems for each category with respect to their balanced accuracies (a binary-variable performance metric). As an example application, we estimate performance rankings of landscape freeze/thaw (FT) observations derived from model soil temperatures, in situ station air temperatures and satellite-observed microwave brightness temperatures in Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada. While rankings vary spatially, in most locations the model-based FT product is ranked the highest, followed by the satellite product and the in-situ air temperature product. These rankings are likely due to a combination of differences in measurement errors between FT products, and differences in scale. They illustrate the value in using a suite of different measurements as part of satellite FT validation, rather than simply treating in-situ measurements as an error-free \'truth\'.

The next European Space Agency Earth Explorer Core Mission BIOMASS will collect synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data globally from employing a multiple baseline orbit during the initial phase of its lifetime. These data will be used for tomographic SAR (TomoSAR) processing, with a vertical resolution of about 20 m, a resolution sufficient to decompose the backscatter signal into two to three layers for most closed-canopy tropical forests. A recent study, conducted in the Paracou site, French Guiana, has already shown that TomoSAR significantly improves the retrieval of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) in a high biomass forest, with an error of only 10% at 1.5-ha resolution. However, the degree to which this TomoSAR approach can be transferred from one site to another has not been assessed. We test this approach at the Nouragues site in central French Guiana (ca 100 km away from Paracou), and develop a method to retrieve the top-of-canopy height from TomoSAR. We found a high correlation between the backscatter signal and AGB in the upper canopy layer (i.e. 20-40 m), while lower layers only showed poor correlations. The relationship between AGB and TomoSAR data was found to be highly similar for forests at Nouragues and Paracou. Cross validation using training plots from Nouragues and validation plots from Paracou, and vice versa, gave an error of 16-18% of AGB using 1-ha plots. Finally, using a high-resolution LiDAR canopy model as a reference, we showed that TomoSAR has the potential to retrieve the top-of-canopy height with an error to within 2.5 m. Our analyses show that the TomoSAR-AGB retrieval method is accurate even in hilly and high-biomass forest areas and suggest that our approach may be generalizable to other study sites, having a canopy taller than 30 m. These results have strong implications for the tomographic phase of the BIOMASS spaceborne mission.

First, we introduced point normalization based on penetration depth below the outer canopy layer to avoid biases introduced by ground normalization and canopy surface heterogeneity during metric computation. Second, we proposed computation of area and volume metrics from canopy surface models computed from both first and last returns to better characterize the 3D plot heterogeneity. The set of proposed metrics were combined with traditional ones, based on point height above ground level, to measure their contribution to models of basal area (BA) and aboveground volume (AGV). The modeling framework included a wide range of forest types, canopy structures and Lidar characteristics. Models were developed for all sites grouped together or separately. In each case, the set of metrics was submitted to a hierarchical clustering process to select the best variables to be included in the models that were further established using a best subset method. Overall, the introduction of the proposed metrics allowed a reduction in models root mean squared error from -0.06% to 19.58% according to forest types and target forest parameters. Best improvements were achieved for broadleaved forests, showing the potential of the proposed metrics to efficiently characterize the structure of such porous forest canopies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The objective is to identify the information provided by each sensor and to analyze preprocessing methods - such as the day/night average, diurnal difference and microwave polarization difference index for AMSR-E and the incidence angle normalization and backscatter temporal index for ASCAT to maximize the amount of soil moisture information extracted. Additionally, the data fusion and a posteriori synergy methodologies are compared to determine how to optimally exploit this combined information. This study is performed using a neural network (NN) to estimate soil moisture from a set of AMSR-E and ASCAT observations. ERA-interim/Land surface soil moisture fields are used to train the NN as well as to evaluate the performance of the different retrieval input datasets. It is shown that using the AMSR-E 7 GHz, 11 GHz, 19 GHz and 37 GHz channels with the three preprocessing methods highlights various surface contributions in the signal, in particular the soil moisture and surface temperature information, and greatly helps the retrieval in disentangling them. For ASCAT, the synergy effect is less significant and data preprocessed with the two methods analyzed yields very similar information. The information provided by the active and passive microwave sensors is found to be very complementary, such that a soil moisture retrieval using the combined active and passive information shows a significant improvement between 5% and 19% in the temporal correlation and a reduction of the retrieval uncertainty by 7%. The improvement in the spatial structure is smaller with a correlation increase of 2%. It is demonstrated that the choice of synergy method strongly impacts the retrieval improvement that can be achieved. Data fusion methods are shown to be better suited than a posteriori combination methods, due to their ability to exploit information complementarity. These results could help improve future active/passive soil moisture retrievals, such as from the Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission, through the application of similar preprocessing and synergy methods in order to better extract the soil moisture information provided.

In this study, the variation of the thermal environment during the urbanization process from 2001 to 2009 in the Beijing metropolitan region was evaluated using the spatial Lorenz curve and distribution index. In addition, the effects of landscape composition and spatial configuration on the thermal environment were investigated using correlation analysis and piecewise linear regression. The urban heat island (UHI) was found to be much more significant in summer than in spring, autumn and winter. Furthermore, the magnitude of the urban thermal environment in Beijing has increased during the process of urbanization. The suburban areas of Beijing, including the new urban development zone and ecological conservation zone, have increased the magnitude of the thermal environment. However, the opposite effect has occurred in the center of Beijing, including the core functional zone and urban function extended zone. Landscape types such as built-up areas and barren land make the most significant contribution to the thermal environment, whereas ecological land plays a significant role in mitigating the UHI. When the coverage of ecological land exceeded 70% (25 km(2)) of the total land area, the cooling efficiency of this landscape type was relatively obvious, and the shape index and fragmentation index of landscape configuration both had a significantly positive correlation (0.594 and 0.510 Pearson\'s coefficients, respectively) with average land surface temperature. The Pearson\'s coefficient between the ecological land proportion and the average land surface temperature was 0.614 (P < 0.01); this value was higher than that for the effects of the spatial configuration, indicating that landscape composition affects the thermal environment more than does spatial configuration.

In particular, information at the sub-field level is critical for detecting and combating within-field yield-limiting factors for implementation of precision agriculture. High-resolution optical satellite sensors are useful tools to acquire the necessary information in this regard. This study used multi-temporal RapidEye data to estimate the green effective plant area index (PAH and leaf chlorophyll content of two field crops, spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and canola (Brassica napus L.). The objective was to evaluate the capability of RapidEye imagery for detecting within-field variability of crop growth conditions. Field experiments were carried out in northern Ontario over two consecutive years, 2012 and 2013. Several vegetation indices were selected and derived from the RapidEye data to correlate with crop PAI measured using digital hemispherical photography and leaf chlorophyll content index (CCI) measured using a CCM-200 chlorophyll meter. Results showed that the effective PAI and CCI of the two crops were best correlated with different indices. For effective PAI, the modified triangular vegetation index 2 (MTVI2) was the best for spring wheat (R-2 = 0.74, RMSE = 0.72 and n = 200) whereas the red-edge normalized difference vegetation index (NDVIRE) was the best for canola (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.49 and n = 147). For CCI, the chlorophyll vegetation index (CVI) was the best for spring wheat (R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 4.1 and n = 128) whereas the red-edge chlorophyll index (CIRE) was the best for canola (R-2 = 0.33, RMSE = 6.4 and n = 88). The study also confirmed that the combined transformed chlorophyll absorption reflectance index/optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (TCARI/OSAVI) was satisfactory for spring wheat leaf chlorophyll content estimation when the crop canopy is not sparse. Using selected vegetation indices, RapidEye data can be used to map the within-field variability of crop growth conditions, which is useful for applications in precision agriculture. The reflectance in the red-edge or the green bands is useful in mapping crop leaf chlorophyll variability.

In this study, an enhanced two-source evapotranspiration model for land (ETEML) is proposed based on a trapezoid framework of the vegetation fractional cover and land surface temperature (VFC/LST) space. In ETEML, a VFC/LST trapezoid space is theoretically defined for each pixel, and a pixel-wise mixed surface temperature decomposition method is proposed. ETEML is based on a two-source scheme, and the crop water stress index (CWSI) concept is applied to parameterize the soil evaporation and the vegetation transpiration separately. The proposed model was applied to the Soil Moisture-Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (SIVIACEX) site in central Iowa, USA. Evaluation with a remotely sensed dataset from Landsat was carried out to assess the performance of ETEML. Compared with the tower observations, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) and the root mean square deviation (RMSD) for the ETEML estimated latent heat flux (LE) are, respectively, 49 W/m(2) and 59 W/m(2), comparable to retrieval accuracies published in other studies. Comparison between ETEML and variations on a simpler trapezoid interpolation model (TIM1 and TIM2) indicates that ETEML reduces the subjectivity and uncertainties involved in TIM1 and TIM2. Overall, the results suggest that ETEML is promising and can expand the application of the trapezoid framework-based ET modeling approaches to heterogeneous surfaces. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study presents a new method for estimating and monitoring snags using neighborhood attribute filtered airborne discrete-return lidar data. The method first develops and then applies an automated filtering algorithm that utilizes three dimensional neighborhood lidar point-based intensity and density statistics to remove lidar points associated with live trees and retain lidar points associated with snags. A traditional airborne lidar individual-tree detection procedure is then applied to the snag-filtered lidar point cloud, resulting in stem map of identified snags with height estimates. The filtering algorithm was developed using training datasets comprised of four different forest types in wide range of stand conditions, and then applied to independent data to determine successful snag detection rates. Detection rates ranged from 43 to 100%, increasing as the size of snags increased. The overall detection rate for snags with DBH >= 25 cm was 56% (+/- 2.9%) with low commission error rates. The method provides the ability to estimate snag density and stem map a large proportion of snags across the landscape. The resulting information can be used to analyze the spatial distribution of snags, provide a better understanding of wildlife snag use dynamics, assess achievement of stocking standard requirements, and bring more clarity to snag stocking standards.

This paper proposes a radiative transfer approach for homogeneous aquatic vegetation canopy, based on the theories for terrestrial vegetation and Case II water. The effects of rough water surface and bottom reflection are also taken into consideration. Validations against an independent Monte Carlo model and field experiment data exhibit well consistencies on the bidirectional reflectance of homogeneous aquatic vegetation canopy. As expected, the results for sparse canopy degenerate. This model can be used for canopy modeling of emergent, floating or submerged aquatic vegetation. Potential applications include retrieval of biophysical or biochemical parameters based on hyperspectral data and physical process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Complex waters of this lake are challenging due to the coexistence of optically-deep turbid waters and of optically-shallow waters, mostly characterised by dense submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds. Airborne data acquired on 12 May 2009 by Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer (MIVIS) were converted into remote sensing reflectance R-rs(lambda) with the atmospheric correction code ATCOR. A spectral inversion procedure implementing a bio-optical model (namely BOMBER), parameterised with in-situ-data; was-firstly run-to-retrieve concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM), chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and coloured dissolved organic matter (i.e. a(CDOM)(440)) in the optically-deep waters. The areas where the retrieved optimisation error was higher than 10% were instead assumed as optically-shallow. In these areas two maps depicting the linear unmixing of three substrate types (i.e., siltyclay, Chara ssp. and other hydrophyte) and the water column heights were produced. The MIVIS-derived products were validated with field data providing a reliable estimation of SPM, chl-a, a(CDOM)(440) and cH (determination coefficients always R-2 > 0.7). SPM concentrations were also similar to a 5.4-km long transect of flow-through turbidity data, and the SAV map was comparable to in situ observations. Generally, the colonisation patterns of SAV were reflecting the spatial distribution of SPM concentrations. In particular, the positive role of Chara on keeping SPM concentrations low was observed. Future research should extend this application to remote sensing data acquired in other seasons to trace the dynamics of SAV and its effect on spatial water clarity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, instruments for measuring inherent optical properties (IOPs) of water bodies were evaluated for the first time in floodplain lakes in the lower Amazon River during the falling limb of the hydrograph. Water column profiles of total attenuation and absorption were measured using the Spectral Absorption and Attenuation Meter (AC-S-WETLabs), and of backscattering using Hydroscat. These measurements, however, are subject to uncertainties and require corrections for turbid waters. In this paper, we assessed the implications of scattering correction methods for the absorption tube, proposed by the AC-S manufacturer, in the simulation of the Remote Sensing Reflectance (R-rs). The closure experiment comparing Hydrolight (Mobley & Sundman, 2001) simulated R-rs and in situ R-rs demonstrated that neither of the corrections was able to thoroughly account for the scattering errors which were propagated to the absorption measurements with AC-S and backscattering with Hydroscat. The three scattering correction methods (Flat, Proportional and \"Kirk\") either under or overestimated the absorption coefficient that resulted in either under or overestimation of the simulated R-rs. Flat and Proportional Methods resulted in an underestimation of R-rs from 400 to 550 nm and overestimation from 600 to 700 nm, indicating that the assumption of zero (0) absorption in the near infrared does not apply to inland turbid water. The R-rs errors varied also according to water OAC composition. Overall, \"Kirk\" correction method provided the best results regarding the spectral shape of the R-rs however, failed to account for magnitude. Based on the tuning tests, the errors in spectra magnitude seem to be sensitive to the constant fraction of scattering (CFS) used in the Kirk method. Tests carried out with CFS values varying from 0.18 to 038 indicated that magnitude error can be partially overcomed by tuning CFS according to water composition. Improvements in the scattering correction methods are required in order to obtain reliable IOPs in turbid inland Amazon lakes.

The high importance of the lake\'s watershed for human life demands a comprehensive monitoring of the watershed\'s behavior. Spaceborne sensors provide a number of novel ways to monitor the hydrological cycle and its interannual changes. The use of GRACE gravity data makes it possible to determine continental water storage changes and to assess the water budget on monthly to multi-annual time scales. We use satellite altimetry data from ENVISAT and CryoSat-2 to monitor the lake water level. Moreover, we employ optical satellite imagery to determine the surface water extent of the lake repeatedly and at an appropriate time interval.   Our altimetry results indicate that, on average, the lake has lost 34 +/- 1 cm of its water level every year from 2002 to 2014. The results from satellite imagery reveal a loss of water extent at an average rate of 220 +/- 6 km(2)/yr, which indicates that the lake has lost about 70% of its surface area over the last 14 years. By combining water level from altimetry, surface water extent from satellite imagery and local bathymetry, we ascertain the changes in lake volume. Results indicate that the lake volume has been decreasing at an alarming rate of 1.03 +/- 0.02 km(3)/yr. The water volume of the lake behaves differently from the water storage of the whole basin captured by GRACE Our results show that the onset of a drought in 2007 over this region together with an increase in the rate of groundwater depletion caused a new equilibrium level for water storage of the whole basin. Comparing the results from GRACE and the obtained water volume in the lake with in situ groundwater level data reveals the anthropogenic influences on an accelerated lake desiccation. In fact our monitoring approach raises critical issues regarding water use in the basin and highlights the important role of spaceborne sensors for any urgent or long-term treatment plan.

The comparison was carried out in simulated and real populations where the value of response variable was known for each pixel of the study region. Sampling was simulated through a tessellation stratified design. Universal kriging and cokriging were considered among parametric methods based on the spatial autocorrelation of the forest response variable. Locally weighted regression and k-nearest neighbor predictors were considered among semiparametric and nonparametric methods based on the information from neighboring sites in the auxiliary variable space. The study was performed from a design-based perspective, taking the populations as fixed and replicating the sampling procedure with 1000 Monte Carlo simulation runs. On the basis of the empirical values of relative bias and relative root mean squared error it was concluded that universal kriging and cokriging were more suitable in the presence of strong spatial autocorrelation of the forest variable, while locally weighted regression and k-nearest neighbors were more suitable when the auxiliary variables were well correlated with the response variable. Results of the study advise that attention should be paid when mapping forest variables characterized by highly heterogeneous structures. The guidelines of this study can be adopted even for mapping environmental attributes beside forestry. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

To date, the record of ocean-colour observations is a rich one, including data from a number of sensors spanning more than three decades. The ESA Ocean-Colour Climate Change Initiative has advanced seamless merging of ocean-colour observations from missions during the period 1990s to 2010s. However, comparison of these more recent observations with records from 1970s to 1980s remains a complex undertaking, particularly for absolute values of chlorophyll concentration, primarily due to differences in the sensors. A further impediment to the analysis of the past records is the non-uniform distribution of gaps in the observations, in both time and space dimensions, when data from two or more sensors are compared. Here, we use the CZCS gap distribution from the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS, 1978-1986) as a mask to evaluate the impact that missing data may have on the estimation of six ecological indicators, when using the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) data set. Specifically, we evaluate the precision and accuracy of indicators by computing the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) and the bias arising purely from missing data. We develop an original resampling method allowing comparison of indicator estimates between SeaWiFS reference time-series and SeaWiFS time-series with CZCS-like gaps. We reduce some of the sampling gaps by applying a linear interpolation procedure, and compute multi-year averages of the indicators for every one-by-one degree pixel where sufficient data are available. Indicators from SeaWiFS reference and SeaWiFS with CZCS-like gaps are compared. Lowest uncertainty arising from missing data is observed in the indicators of annual mean and median chlorophyll concentration (global mean RMSE of 8% and vertical bar bias vertical bar >= 1%), whilst higher uncertainty is recorded for the peak chlorophyll values and the duration of the phytoplankton growing period (global mean RMSE of 33 and 47% respectively and vertical bar bias vertical bar >= 20%). Timing of initiation of the increasing phase of chlorophyll concentration in the seasonal cycle and timing of peak chlorophyll are subject to a global mean RMSE of nearly two months and a bias of two weeks or less. The present quantitative evaluation of uncertainty due to missing data demonstrates that, when pooled to create a nine-year climatology at 8-day temporal resolution, the coverage of CZCS is adequate for many climate-related studies on the marine ecosystem. Phytoplankton annual mean biomass can be estimated with low error in approximately 95% of the global oceans (i.e. regions where the indicators can be estimated with RMSE values of less than 30% and bias within 10%), and the phenological patterns can be estimated with low error in approximately 25% of the global oceans.

Direct field observations of SWE, SCA and atmospheric forcing inputs for models of snow accumulation and ablation are typically sparsely sampled in space. Satellite imagery is, therefore, a critical tool for verification and confirmation of snow model estimates of SCA. The Landsat system provides snow-covered area estimates at a spatial resolution of 30 m with a 16-day return interval, while daily estimates of SCA and fractional SCA (f(SCA)) are available at 500 m from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). This study describes and tests a linear model to downscale MODIS MOD10A1 f(SCA) (500 m) data to higher-resolution (30 m) spatially explicit binary SCA estimates. The algorithm operates on the assumption that two variables, potential insolation and elevation, control differential ablation of snow cover throughout spring melt at 30 m to 500 m scales. The model downscales daily 500 f(SCA) estimates from MODIS to provide daily SCA estimates at a spatial resolution of 30 m, using limited Landsat SCA for calibration and independent Landsat SCA estimates for validation. Downscaled SCA estimates demonstrate statistically significant improvement from randomly generated model ensembles, indicating that insolation and elevation are dominant factors controlling the snow cover distribution in the semi-arid, mountainous region in southwestern Idaho, USA where this study is performed. Validation is performed with Landsat data not used for calibration, and is also performed using Landsat 500 m aggregate f(SCA) instead of MODIS f(SCA) as an ideal case. Downscaled estimates show reasonable accuracy (test metric outperforms random ensembles at p = 0.01 significance level for multiple ranges of snow cover) with only one calibrated parameter.

Several methodological choices regarding spatial scale, mostly related to spatial resolution or grain, can profoundly influence forest maps developed from plot and imagery data. Yet often the consequences of scaling choices are not explicitly addressed. Our objective was to quantify the effects of several scale-related methods on map accuracy for multiple forest attributes, using a variety of diagnostics that address different map characteristics, to help guide map developers and users. We conducted nearest-neighbor imputation over a large region in the Pacific Northwest, USA, to investigate effects of imputation grain (single pixel or kernel); inclusion of heterogeneous plots; accuracy assessment grain and extent; and value of k (k = 1 and k = 5), where k is the number of nearest-neighbor plots. Spatial predictors were from rasters describing climate and topography and a time-series of Landsat imagery. Reference data were from regional forest inventory plots measured over two decades. All analyses were conducted at a spatial resolution of 30 m x 30 m. Effects of imputation grain and heterogeneous plots on map accuracy were small. Excluding heterogeneous plots slightly improved map accuracy and did not lessen the systematic agreement (AC(sys)) between our maps and observed plot data. Accuracy assessment grain strongly influenced map accuracy: maps assessed with a multi-pixel block were much more accurate than when assessed with a single pixel for almost all map diagnostics, but this was an artifact of methods rather than reflecting real differences among maps. Unsystematic agreement (AC(UNS)) between our maps and plots, or random error, improved notably with increasing accuracy assessment extent for all scaling methods, indicating that reliability of most map applications can be improved through coarsening the map grain. Value of k strongly influenced map diagnostics. The k = 5 maps were better than k = 1 maps for local-scale accuracy, but at the cost of reduced AC(sys), and loss of variability and poor areal representation of forest conditions over the study region. The k = 1 maps produced notably better predictions of the least abundant forest conditions (early-successional, late-successional, and broadleaf). None of the scaling methods were optimal for all map diagnostics. Nevertheless, given a variety of diagnostics associated with a range of scaling options, map developers and map users can make informed choices about methods and resulting maps that best meet their particular objectives, and we present some general guidelines in this regard. Most of our findings are applicable to mapping with Landsat data in other forested regions with similar forest inventory data, and to other methods for spatial prediction.

Multiple anthropogenic stressors increasingly affect the floodplains of this region, and baseline information on floodplain inundation dynamics is necessary to manage these threats and develop adaption strategies for sea level rise. This study uses classification tree modeling to combine microwave (ALOS L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) and optical (Landsat Thematic Mapper, TM 5) satellite data with field-sampled aquatic vegetation and depth logger data to predict the seasonal and inter-annual dynamics of aquatic plant cover and extent of inundation in the region. The USGS Landsat TM 5 image archive was sampled between 1985 and 2011 using three seasonal samples per year to create a comprehensive long-term time series of seasonal and inter-annual floodplain inundation extents. Classification accuracy for the inundation mapping was estimated at 86% based on seasonal depth logger data. The mean extent of inundation at the end of the wet season (March/April) was 1784 km(2) (range 2283-1309 km(2)), receding on average to approximately 25% of its extent by August/September. Seasonal inundation patterns exhibit an exponential recession of inundation into \'backswamp\' areas on the fringes of the floodplains with hydro-periods on the order of 5 months. The findings of this work significantly improve our understanding of dynamics in this environmentally and culturally unique area and provide a basis for application in other seasonally flooded environments.

Algorithms to estimate primary production are well established and have been used in many studies with success. One of the key parameters in these algorithms is the chlorophyll-normalised production rate under light saturation (referred to as the light saturation parameter or the assimilation number). It is known to depend on temperature, light history and nutrient conditions, but assigning a magnitude to it at particular space-time points is difficult. In this paper, we explore two models to estimate the assimilation number at the global scale from remotely-sensed data that combine methods to estimate the carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio and the maximum growth rate of phytoplankton. The inputs to the algorithms are the surface concentration of chlorophyll, seasurface temperature, photosynthetically-active radiation af the surface of the sea, sea surface nutrient concentration and mixed-layer depth. A large database of in situ estimates of the assimilation number is used to develop the models and provide elements of validation. The comparisons with in situ observations are promising and global maps of assimilation number are produced. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Picart, S.

New data is now becoming available from optical remote sensors on geostationary satellites and provides a much higher temporal resolution, typically an image once or more per hour during daylight compared to once per day. This higher temporal resolution opens up obvious opportunities for dramatically improving the data availability in periods of scattered clouds and for resolving fast processes such as tidal or diurnal variability of phytoplankton or suspended particulate matter. As the science community starts to explore this new data source, further new applications are likely to emerge. However, the geostationary orbit presents also new algorithmic challenges. The coverage of high latitudes is limited by the difficulties of atmospheric correction at very high sensor zenith angle and ultimately by the earth\'s curvature. Exploitation of the new possibilities of viewing the earth for a range of sun zenith angles over the day also stimulates a need to perform accurate atmospheric correction at high sun zenith angle. Traditional pixel-by-pixel data processing algorithms could be supplemented by information on the temporal coherency of data over the day thus potentially improving data quality, by adding constraints to the inversion problem, or data quality control, by a posteriori analysis of time series. This review assesses the challenges and opportunities of geostationary ocean colour, with emphasis on the data processing algorithms that will need to be improved or developed to fully exploit the potential of this data source. Examples are drawn from recent results using data from the GOCI and SEVIRI sensors. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Inc.

The spectral emissivity was consistent within +/- 0.007 at bands 13 (10.60 mu m) and 14 (11.30 mu m), although the emissivity at bands 10 to 12 (8.30, 8.65, and 9.10 mu m) varied temporally, probably due to surface condition changes and errors in atmospheric correction. The atmospheric correction based on the climatology data resulted in poor accuracy in TES-retrieved emissivity for nighttime data because the contribution of the atmospheric effect on the at-sensor radiance increases due to decreased surface radiance in nighttime. For the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) data, the agreement, which is comparable to the nominal accuracy (= 0.015), between the emissivity based on the day and night ASTER data acquired on the same day suggested that NCEP data is sufficiently accurate to correct for the atmospheric effect on the ASTER data under nominally dry atmospheric condition. Although the spatial scales differ between ASTER data and laboratory data, the satellite and ground emissivity agreed within +/- 0.013. Despite the similarity of the spectral emissivity patterns, the ASTER emissivity was as much as 0.066 lower than the field emissivity at 8.30 mu m due perhaps to the roughness effect on the field emissivity.

Nevertheless, coastal data have been flagged as unreliable due to land and calm water interference in the altimeter and radiometer footprint and uncertainty in the modelling of high-frequency tidal and atmospheric forcing. Our study addresses the first issue, i.e. altimeter footprint contamination, via retracicing, presenting ALES, the Adaptive Leading Edge Subwaveform retracker. ALES is potentially applicable to all the pulse-limited altimetry missions and its aim is to retradc both open ocean and coastal data with the same accuracy using just one algorithm. ALES selects part of each returned echo and models it with a classic \"open ocean\" Brown functional form, by means of least square estimation whose convergence is found through the Nelder-Mead nonlinear optimisation technique. By avoiding echoes from bright targets along the trailing edge, it is capable of retrieving more coastal waveforms than the standard processing. By adapting the width of the estimation window according to the significant wave height, it aims at maintaining the accuracy of the standard processing in both the open ocean and the coastal strip. This innovative retracker is validated against tide gauges in the Adriatic Sea and in the Greater Agulhas System for three different missions: Envisat, Jason-1 and Jason-2. Considerations of noise and biases provide a further verification of the strategy. The results show that ALES is able to provide more reliable 20-Hz data for all three missions in areas where even 1-Hz averages are flagged as unreliable in standard products. Application of the ALES retracker led to roughly a half of the analysed tracks showing a marked improvement in correlation with the tide gauge records, with the rms difference being reduced by a factor of 1.5 for Jason-1 and Jason-2 and over 4 for Envisat in the Adriatic Sea (at the closest point to the tide gauge).

The SMOS core algorithm was used to evaluate two-parameter retrieval scenarios including soil moisture and one of either i) vegetation water content, ii) surface roughness, iii) vegetation temperature, or iv) surface soil temperature. For all pairs a range of parameter value combinations were compiled to run the model in forward mode. Subsequently, the resulting angular brightness temperature simulations with two unknown parameters were compared against the brightness temperature response derived from reference simulations using data from the National Airborne Field Experiment 2005 (NAFE\'05) in Australia. This paper showed that the two-parameter retrieval accuracy of soil moisture is strongly affected by the surface moisture conditions, the polarization of the brightness temperature data, and the choice of the secondary ancillary parameter to be retrieved. The synthetic analysis demonstrated a tendency for better retrievals from dual-polarized data at large incidence angles (40-50 degrees). Validation with airborne brightness temperature observations at L-band did not demonstrate such a strong angular dependency, although it confirmed that the simultaneous retrieval of soil moisture and vegetation properties is not preferable as opposed to i) soil moisture and surface roughness or ii) soil moisture and surface soil temperature, especially under dry moisture conditions.

We focus on the Ivancich area, Assisi, Central Italy, which is affected by a deep-seated landslide investigated through in-situ surveys. For this area, large data sets of SAR acquisitions were collected by the C-band ERS-1/2 and ENVISAT sensors (from April 1992 to November 2010), and by the X-band radars of the COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) constellation (from December 2009 to February 2012). We concentrate on the advanced DInSAR technique referred to as Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) approach, benefiting of its capability to generate deformation time series at full spatial resolution and from multi-sensor SAR data. This allows us to present one of the first examples for a landslide area of ERS-1/2 - ENVISAT deformation time series exceeding 18 years. The results allowed characterizing the long-term behaviour of the landslide, and identifying sectors of the unstable slope affected by different deformation dynamics. Analysis of the CSK data set, characterized by a reduced revisit time and improved spatial resolution, resulted in a 15-time larger point density with respect to the ERS-ENVISAT measurements, allowing to investigate nearly all the buildings (and, in many cases, portions of buildings) in the landslide area. Lastly, we present an innovative modelling approach based on the effective integration of the DInSAR measurements with traditional geological and geotechnical information, providing deeper insights on the kinematical evolution of the landslide. We consider our analysis a prototype example that can be extended to different geological and geotechnical conditions, providing significant advances in the understanding of ground deformations induced by active landslides.

The two largest error sources in aerosol retrieval have been aerosol type selection and surface reflectance. In selecting the aerosol type from a single visible channel, the season-dependent aerosol optical properties were adopted from long-term measurements of Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sun-photometers. With the aerosol optical properties obtained from the AERONET inversion data, look-up tables were calculated by using a radiative transfer code: the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S). Surface reflectance was estimated using the clear sky composite method, a widely used technique for geostationary retrievals. Over East Asia, the AOD retrieved from the Meteorological Imager showed good agreement, although the values were affected by cloud contamination errors. However, the conventional retrieval of the AOD over Hong Kong was largely underestimated due to the lack of information on the aerosol type and surface properties. To detect spatial and temporal variation of aerosol type over the area, the critical reflectance method, a technique to retrieve single scattering albedo (SSA), was applied. Additionally, the background aerosol effect was corrected to improve the accuracy of the surface reflectance over Hong Kong. The AOD retrieved from a modified algorithm was compared to the collocated data measured by AERONET in Hong Kong. The comparison showed that the new aerosol type selection using the critical reflectance and the corrected surface reflectance significantly improved the accuracy of AODs in Hong Kong areas, with a correlation coefficient increase from 0.65 to 0.76 and a regression line change from T-MI [basic algorithm] = 0.41 tau (AERONET) + 0.16 to tau(MI [new algorithm]) = 0.70 tau(AERONET) + 0.01.

In doing so, most 3D canopy reflectance models simplify the structural representation of individual tree crowns, for example, by using a single ellipsoidal envelope or a series of cubic volumes (known as voxels) to approximate the actual crown shape and the 3D distribution of scatterers therein. Often these tree abstractions ignore or simplify the woody architecture as well. Focusing on broad-leaved Savanna trees, this study investigates the impact that architectural simplifications may have on the fidelity of simulated satellite observations at the bottom of the atmosphere for a variety of spatial resolutions, spectral bands, as well as viewing and illumination geometries. The typical uncertainty associated with vicarious calibration efforts, i.e., 5%, is used as the quality objective for the simulated bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs). Our results indicate that the size of the voxel as well as the spectral, viewing, and illumination conditions drive the BRF bias at a given spatial resolution. The simulation of remote sensing data at medium spatial resolution is not affected by canopy abstractions except in the near-infrared (NIR) for cases where woody structures are omitted. Here, the BRF simulations of the abstract tree crowns exceeded the 5% tolerance limit even at spatial resolutions coarser than 125 m. For high-resolution satellite imagery, i.e., for nominal pixel sizes of 1 x 1 m(2) or finer, local BRF biases can be 10 times greater than the 5% tolerance criterion. Both positive and negative local biases are possible depending on the relative weights of the single-collided, single-uncollided, and multiple-collided BRF components. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The approach related multi-temporal WELD metrics and expert-derived training data for forest cover loss and bare ground gain through a decision tree classification algorithm. Forest cover loss was reported at state and ecoregional scales, and the identification of core forests\' absent of change was made and verified using LiDAR data from the GLAS (Geoscience Laser Altimetry System) instrument. Bare ground gain correlated with population change for large metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) outside of desert or semi-desert environments. GoogleEarth (TM) time-series images were used to validate the products. Mapped forest cover loss totaled 53,084 km(2) and was found to be depicted conservatively, with a user\'s accuracy of 78% and a producer\'s accuracy of 68%. Excluding errors of adjacency, user\'s and producer\'s accuracies rose to 93% and 89%, respectively. Mapped bare ground gain equaled 5974 km(2) and nearly matched the estimated area from the reference (GoogleEarth (TM)) classification; however, user\'s (42%) and producer\'s (49%) accuracies were much less than those of the forest cover loss product. Excluding errors of adjacency, user\'s and producer\'s accuracies rose to 62% and 75%, respectively. Compared to recent 2001-2006 USGS National land Cover Database validation data for forest loss (82% and 30% for respective user\'s and producer\'s accuracies) and urban gain (72% and 18% for respective user\'s and producer\'s accuracies), results using a single CONUS-scale model with WELD data are promising and point to the potential for national-scale operational mapping of key land cover transitions. However, validation results highlighted limitations, some of which can be addressed by improving training data, creating a more robust image feature space, adding contemporaneous Landsat 5 data to the inputs, and modifying definition sets to account for differences in temporal and spatial observational scales.

Unlike traditional mapping efforts mainly based on multi-spectral image data, the classifier employed by this method takes phenological metrics as the major input. Phenological metrics represent crop characteristics related to crop calendar and progress such as the timing of emergence, maturity, harvest, etc. While considerable inter-annual variability exists among remotely sensed images from different years, phenological characteristics of each crop type are relatively consistent for a long period of time. Therefore, it is assumed that phenological metrics can be used to classify crop types in multiple years with the same rules, which is a valuable feature not possessed by traditional classification inputs.   The classification method was tested in mapping corn and soybean, which are two dominant summer crop types in the central United States, and the experiment was carried out for Doniphan County, Kansas during years 2006-2010. Over 100 Landsat TM and ETM + images in this period were utilized and phenological metrics were calculated froth Enhanced Vegetation Index time series using techniques including image segmentation and curve-fitting. Several sets of input variables, ranging from multi-spectral features of selected dates, which are widely used in traditional mapping efforts, to phenological metrics and derived measurements such as accumulated temperature, were tested using a random forest classifier. When the classifier was trained by reference data collected in the same year as that of remotely sensed data, most sets of input variables yielded accuracies higher than 88%. However, when the training data used by the classifier were obtained in a year different from the mapping years, only input sets containing phenological metrics were able to achieve acceptable accuracies greater than 80%. The use of phenological metrics as classification inputs avoids the restrictive requirements of a large ground reference dataset enabling frequent and routine crop mapping without repeated collection of reference data.

Classification tree and regression models using monthly values of 17 multispectral indices and 4 bands, as well as their seasonal variations, were used for predicting the presence and levels of water, independently of vegetation type and density in shallow marshes. Accuracy of the classification model was estimated by cross-validation and by calculating the percentage of correctly classified pixels on the resulting maps using an independent sampling. Goodness-of-fit of the regression model was assessed by calculating the coefficient of correlation between predicted and observed values. Predictive accuracy of both models was estimated by calculating NRMSE for the independent validation sample. Regression model robustness was also tested using Scheffe post-hoc analyses on the residuals. Biophysical parameters of Camargue marsh vegetation were used to interpret misclassifications and model deficiency. Both models were composed of a single variable consisting of a multispectral index using the mid-infrared band. The resulting classification tree provided a cross-validation accuracy of 76% and a map validation accuracy of 83%. With an R = 0.5, the regression model predicted water level with a 6-cm precision up to 20 cm of water depth. For both approaches, the predictive power of model was most affected by close canopy. This study highlights the usefulness of data mining for long-term monitoring of wetland hydrology based on multispectral indices using the mid-infrared band. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

However, as these organizations have transitioned to human-rights monitoring campaigns conducted over large regions and extended periods of time, current methods of using high-resolution sensors and manpower-intensive analyses have become prohibitive. We present an algorithmic approach that uses Landsat ETM+, coupled with high-resolution sensors, as a system for the detection of the destruction of villages in arid environments. This algorithm capitalizes on Landsafs historical archive and systematic observations by constructing a historic spectral baseline for each village in the study area. This allows for the automated detection of a potentially destroyed village with each new overpass of the sensor. The algorithm is based on Landsat\'s near-infrared band, which is a persistent indicator of the destruction of plant cell structure, and is less affected by atmospheric scattering than Landsat\'s visible bands. Comparison of this product with a U.S. government database documenting destroyed villages shows high levels of accuracy among villages in the study area. We evaluated algorithm performance in Darfur, Sudan for the 2004 calendar year. In the study area, the Landsat estimates were within 16% of the U.S. government database, demonstrating a functioning system to alert human rights practitioners to a potential destruction of villages.

These include photo- and biogeochemical cycling of organic material, release of sulfur and carbon-containing gases to the atmosphere, and the photoprotection of marine microorganisms. Synoptic CDOM absorption data in the UV is highly desired yet difficult to estimate by satellite methods as the atmosphere interferes with direct detection of water-leaving UV radiance. The absorption spectrum of CDOM is typically modeled as an exponential function in which a spectral slope parameter, S. describes the rate of decrease in absorption with increase in wavelength. Significant functional relationships are observed in aquatic environments between S and the CDOM absorption coefficient at 443 nm, a(CDOM)(443). In this paper, we use a large, systematic dataset of spectroscopic CDOM measurements from the U.S. CO2/CLIVAR Repeat Hydrography Survey to examine the relationship between S and a(CDOM)(443) as a means to model a(CDOM)(lambda) in the UV from ocean color. Our resultant model predicts a(CDOM)(lambda) at wavelengths from 325 to 412 nm from the absorption coefficient of colored dissolved and detrital materials (CDM) at 443 nm, a(CDM)(443), retrieved by an existing semi-analytical ocean color algorithm. Expected agreement (near 1:1) with the training dataset was achieved (r(2) = 0.71-0.85, p = 0, n = 127). Considering inherent satellite data uncertainties as well as the model\'s limitations in regions with potential terrestrial influence, good correspondence between modeled and in situ values was observed during independent validation with open ocean CDOM data, such as from BIOSOPE (r(2) p < 0.05, n = 29). The model has immediate application in global scale assessments of photochemical rate processes and CDOM cycling in the open ocean due to its simplicity and optimization using a large base of field data (>7500 samples) from diverse Case I waters.

For 13 years, the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) mission provided the first consistent, synoptic observations of global ocean ecosystems. Changes in the surface chlorophyll concentration, the primary biological property retrieved from SeaWiFS, have traditionally been used as a metric for phytoplankton abundance and its distribution largely reflects patterns in vertical nutrient transport. On regional to global scales, chlorophyll concentrations covary with sea surface temperature (SST) because SST changes reflect light and nutrient conditions. However, the ocean may be too complex to be well characterized using a single index such as the chlorophyll concentration. A semi-analytical bio-optical algorithm is used to help interpret regional to global SeaWiFS chlorophyll observations from using three independent, well-validated ocean color data products; the chlorophyll a concentration, absorption by CDM and particulate backscattering. First, we show that observed long-term, global-scale trends in standard chlorophyll retrievals are likely compromised by coincident changes in CDM. Second, we partition the chlorophyll signal into a component due to phytoplankton biomass changes and a component caused by physiological adjustments in intracellular chlorophyll concentrations to changes in mixed layer light levels. We show that biomass changes dominate chlorophyll signals for the high latitude seas and where persistent vertical upwelling is known to occur, while physiological processes dominate chlorophyll variability over much of the tropical and subtropical oceans. The SeaWiFS data set demonstrates complexity in the interpretation of changes in regional to global phytoplankton distributions and illustrates limitations for the assessment of phytoplankton dynamics using chlorophyll retrievals alone.

In this study we explored the forest biomass prediction and dynamic monitoring from Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) waveform metrics at different key map scales. NASA\'s Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) data were acquired in Penobscot County, Maine, USA, during August 2003 and 2009 airborne campaigns in the New England region. Field data were collected in 2003, and 2009 to 2011. Regression models developed at the scale of footprint were applied to all LVIS waveforms within the two study sites: Howland Forest (HF) and Penobscot Experiment Forest (PEF). The effect of forest disturbances on LVIS biomass prediction models was investigated. Two types of models, i. e. combined model without consideration of disturbances and disturbance-specific models were developed and compared. Field data from nested field plots of 0.25 ha, 0.5 ha and 1.0 ha were used to evaluate the averaged, footprint-level (similar to 0.03 ha, 20 m diameter) estimates in these plots. The results demonstrate that: 1) prediction model at the scale of individual LVIS footprints is reliable when the geolocations of the measured footprints were determined by DGPS with a best accuracy of 0.5-1.0 m. 2) The differences between biomass prediction models for disturbed and undisturbed forests were statistically significant (p < 0.001) at the scale of footprint, and the disturbance-specific models performed slightly better (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 27.9 Mg.ha(-1), and relative error of 22.6%) than the combined model (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 31.0 Mg.ha(-1), 25.1%). 3) The evaluation using field plot data showed that the predictions of biomass were improved markedly with the increase of plot sizes from 0.25 ha to 1.0 ha and that the effect of disturbance was not strong. At 1.0 ha plot-level, both disturbance-specific and combined models agreed well with field estimates (R-2 = 0.91, 23.1 Mg.ha(-1), 16.1%; and R-2 = 0.91, 22.4 Mg.ha(-1), 15.6%). 4) Sensitivity analysis on levels of variation and error to footprint density suggests that a certain density of LVIS footprints is required for biomass mapping. The errors were minimized when footprint coverage approached about 50% of the area of 1.0 ha plots (16 footprints). 5) By applying the footprint-level models developed from 2009 LVIS data to both 2009 and 2003 LVIS data, the change of biomass from 2003 to 2009 could be assessed. The average annual biomass reduction rate from forest disturbance at two sites is -7.0 Mg.ha(-1) and -6.2 Mg.ha(-1), the average annual biomass accumulation from regrowth is +4.4 Mg.ha(-1) and +5.2 Mg.ha(-1), respectively.

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an inversion algorithm for the extraction of riverine and estuarine CDOM properties at global scales. Our CDOM evaluation focused on five aspects: I) the range of worldwide CDOM levels, 2) spatial distribution patterns, (3) climatic influences, (4) influences of land cover change, and (5) seasonal effects. The study locations consisted of the estuarine and coastal regions of 10 major rivers spread across five continents. Our approach was to examine the QAA-CDOM algorithm by extracting CDOM properties from hundreds of EO-1 Hyperion images acquired during the last decade (2001-2011). Preliminary results showed that CDOM absorption coefficients at 440 nm within the 10 selected rivers exhibited a broad range (0.02-72 m(-1)). Spatial CDOM distribution patterns showed many plumes dispersing from source areas (e.g. adjacent terrestrial vegetated areas) along the direction of flow. Seasonal variations in CDOM levels are also evident (i.e. 0.5-4.0 m(-1)) as illustrated by the January, April, August and October images of the Volga River. CDOM levels also appeared to trend upward with the increase in forest coverage (i.e. terrestrial influence) within the watersheds studied over the last decade. Our results strongly suggest that the algorithm is effective in distinguishing riverine and estuarine CDOM levels affected by factors such as global biogeography, climate conditions and regional land surface processes.

We have used a multi-band quasi analytical algorithm that determines phytoplankton absorption coefficients, a(phi)(lambda), from above surface remote sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda). In situ data including remote sensing reflectance, phytoplankton pigment concentration, and absorption coefficients of optically active constituents in the water were collected from highly turbid and productive aquaculture ponds. These shallow (<1.5 m) ponds in northwestern Mississippi, USA, were used for channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus aquaculture and had high nitrogen and phosphorus loading rates from manufactured feeds added to ponds to promote rapid fish growth. These practices resulted in high phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll-a concentrations = 59.4-1376.6 mg m(-3)) with communities dominated by filamentous, gas-vacuolate cyanobacteria. A novel technique was developed to further decompose the a(phi) to obtain phycocyanin absorption coefficient, a(PC), at 620 nm, a primary peak of phycocyanin absorption spectrum. Validation of the model produced mean and median absolute relative errors of 36.2% and 22.0%. Overall, the model performance was higher in the higher range of PC concentration (>150 mu g l(-1)).

Two distinct, but complementary, methodologies for retrieving turbidity were employed, one for the lakes and the other for the coastal zone. After comparing the turbidity satellite-derived turbidity products with in-situ measurements, the inter-comparability of the products was independently verified. Then, through an integrative analysis, the initial hypothesis of turbidity control by the Danube River inputs was tested in both areas (Delta plain and coastal zone). Seasonal turbidity patterns were identified together with the mechanisms responsible for its important temporal and spatial variability.

In the field of remote sensing of vegetation phenology, phenological metrics are derived from time series of optical data. For that purpose, considerable effort has been specifically focused on developing noise reduction and cloud-contaminated data removal techniques to improve the quality of remotely-sensed time series. Comparative studies between time series composed of satellite data acquired under clear and cloudy conditions and from radiometric data obtained with high accuracy from ground-based measurements constitute a direct and effective way to assess the operational use and limitations of remote sensing for predicting the main plant phenological events. In the present paper, we sought to explicitly evaluate the potential use of MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data for monitoring the seasonal dynamics of different types of vegetation cover that are representative of the major terrestrial biomes, including temperate deciduous forests, evergreen forests, African savannah, and crops. After cloud screening and filtering, we compared the temporal patterns and phenological metrics derived from in situ NDVI time series and from MODIS daily and 16-composite products. We also evaluated the effects of residual noise and the influence of data gaps in MODIS NDVI time series on the identification of the most relevant metrics for vegetation phenology monitoring. The results show that the inflexion points of a model fitted to a MODIS NDVI time series allow accurate estimates of the onset of greenness in the spring and the onset of yellowing in the autumn in deciduous forests (RMSE <= one week). Phenological metrics identical to those provided with the MODIS Global Vegetation Phenology product (MDC12Q2) are less robust to data gaps, and they can be subject to large biases of approximately two weeks or more during the autumn phenological transitions. In the evergreen forests, in situ NDVI time series describe the phenology with high fidelity despite small temporal changes in the canopy foliage. However, MODIS is unable to provide consistent phenological patterns. In crops and savannah, MODIS NDVI time series reproduce the general temporal patterns of phenology, but significant discrepancies appear between MODIS and ground-based NDVI time series during very localized periods of time depending on the weather conditions and spatial heterogeneity within the MODIS pixel. In the rainforest, the temporal pattern exhibited by a MODIS 16-day composite NDVI time series is more likely due to a pattern of noise in the NDVI data structure according to both rainy and dry seasons rather than to phenological changes. More investigations are needed, but in all cases, this result leads us to conclude that MODIS time series in tropical rainforests should be interpreted with great caution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The values in the visible bands depend on the aerosol scattering ratios (the epsilon spectrum). The epsilon value in the Near-infrared (NIR) band is estimated on the dark pixel assumption of the water-leaving reflectance in the two NIR bands and then the epsilon spectrum is determined from the aerosol models. This assumption usually becomes invalid for turbid coastal waters, leading to lost regions in the satellite imagery masked by the failure of the atmospheric correction. A new approach was developed to accurately estimate epsilon from turbid coastal waters. This method is based on the idea that the aerosol scattering reflectance and the epsilon values can be obtained from the known water-leaving reflectance of in situ measurements. The water-leaving reflectance is determined from the choice of a look-up table of the water-leaving reflectance based on the Angstrom law of the candidate aerosol scattering reflectance using the best non-linear least squares fit function. In this approach, the entire epsilon spectra can be obtained and used to determine the two closest aerosol models which are used to interpolate the actual epsilon values. It is demonstrated that the results from matching the entire spectra are more robust than that obtained from using only one epsilon value. The performance of the approach was evaluated using the simulated reflectance at the top of the atmosphere, the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) imagery, and in situ measured aerosol optical thickness. This approach is based on the assumption of the aerosol scattering reflectance following the Angstrom law instead of the standard dark pixel assumption, named as the ENLF model. This new assumption is valid for both Case I and Case 2 waters, even over terrestrial regions. Therefore, the ENLF model provides a potential approach for a universal algorithm of the atmospheric correction of satellite remote sensing data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Computerized segmentation of a diverse range of remote sensing material has been studied for delineating stands in various forest types, but is relatively rare under tropical conditions. In line with REDD+, which advocates sustainable forest management in tropical developing countries, we report here on the delineation of forest stands in Laos using data from Airborne Laser Scanning, Airborne CIR and ALOS AVNIR-2. Rather than using the spectral layers alone, the segmentation was applied to wall-to-wall maps of predicted values from empirical models that retrieve forest stem volume and basal area. The homogeneity of 96 sets of segmentation categorized according to the hierarchical mean sizes of the segments was evaluated quantitatively in terms of the AIC(var) index and qualitatively by eye. The results show that the quality and performance of the empirical models are duly reflected in the quality and performance of the segmentation, and that the most competitive delineations are provided by models that involve ALS. Finally, the future prospects for using this empirical model-based segmentation approach to detect and quantify deforestation, or even forest degradation, and thereby to provide further support for the development of REDD methodology, are discussed.

As a result, this study, the first in a two-part series, develops a new sub-pixel-based calculation of fire radiative power (FRPf) for fire pixels detected at 1 km(2) nominal spatial resolution by the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire detection algorithm (collection 5), which is subsequently applied to several large wildfire events in California. The methodology stems from the heritage of earlier bi-spectral retrievals of sub-pixel fire area and temperature. However, in the current investigation, a radiative transfer model is incorporated to remove solar effects and account for atmospheric effects as a function of Earth-satellite geometry at 3.96 and 11 mu m (MODIS fire detection channels). The retrieved sub-pixel fire (flaming) area is assessed via the multispectral, high-resolution data (3-50 m) obtained from the Autonomous Modular Sensor (AMS), flown aboard the NASA Ikhana unmanned aircraft. With fire sizes ranging from 0.001 to 0.02 km(2), pixel-level fire area comparisons between MODIS and AMS are highly variable, regardless of the viewing zenith angle, and show a low bias with a modest correlation (R=0.59). However, when lower confidence fire pixels and point-spread-function effects (fire hot spots on the pixel edge) are removed, the correlation becomes much stronger (R=0.84) and the variability between MODIS and AMS is reduced. To account for these random errors via averaging, two clustering techniques are employed and the resulting AMS and MODIS comparisons of fire area, after correcting for overlapping MODIS pixels, are even more encouraging (R=0.91). Drawing from the retrieved fire area and temperature, the FRPf is calculated and compared to the current MODIS pixel area-based FRP. While the two methods are strongly correlated (R=0.93), the FRPf, in combination with retrieved fire cluster area, allows a large fire burning at a low intensity to be separated from a small fire burning at a high intensity. Similarly, the flux of FRPf over the retrieved fire area can be calculated, allowing for improved estimates of smoke plume injection heights in modeling studies and creating potential applications for the future VIIRS and GOES-R fire detection algorithms.

These lakes experience phytoplankton blooms of the cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa every year due to eutrophication. It was found that after local tuning of the algorithm parameterizations, most algorithms yielded acceptable results for Chla retrievals while accurate PC retrievals were more challenging due to changing species composition (PC:Chla ratios) and low PC concentrations. For the data ranges in the study region, the best Chla algorithm yielded RMSErel (Relative Root Mean Square Error) of similar to 46% (R-2=0.92, n=75) and the best PC algorithm yielded RMSErel of similar to 83% (R-2=0.88, n=75). Based on these observations, it is recommended that local tuning of algorithm parameters should be performed for remote sensing applications, and future efforts should emphasize on application of the algorithms to satellite data.

Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors on Aqua/Terra platforms compensate for these shortcomings, although at the expense of spatial resolution. We developed and evaluated a remote monitoring protocol for water clarity of large lakes using MODIS 500 m data and compared MODIS utility to Landsat-based methods. MODIS images captured during May-September 2001, 2004 and 2010 were analyzed with linear regression to identify the relationship between lake water clarity and satellite-measured surface reflectance. Correlations were strong (R-2 = 0.72-0.94) throughout the study period; however, they were the most consistent in August, reflecting seasonally unstable lake conditions and inter-annual differences in algal productivity during the other months. The utility of MODIS data in remote water quality estimation lies in intra-annual monitoring of lake water clarity in inaccessible, large lakes, whereas Landsat is more appropriate for inter-annual, regional trend analyses of lakes >= 8 ha. Model accuracy is improved when ancillary variables are included to reflect seasonal lake dynamics and weather patterns that influence lake clarity. The identification of landscape-scale drivers of regional water quality is a useful way to supplement satellite-based remote monitoring programs relying on spectral data alone. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Remote sensing has emerged as a powerful tool to monitor rates and patterns of urban expansion, but many early challenges - such as distinguishing new urban land from bare ground - remain unsolved. To deal with the high temporal and spatial variability as well as complex, multi-signature classes within settlements, this paper presents a new approach that exploits multi-seasonal information in dense time stacks of Landsat imagery using a multi-date composite change detection technique. The central premise of the approach is that lands within/near urban areas have distinct temporal trajectories both before and after change occurs, and that these lead to characteristic temporal signatures in several spectral regions. The method relies on a supervised classification that exploits training data of stable/changed areas interpreted from Google Earth images, and a \'brute force\' approach of providing all available Landsat data as input, including scenes with data gaps due to the Scan Line Corrector (SLC) problem. Three classification algorithms (maximum likelihood, boosted decision trees, and support vector machines) were tested for their ability to monitor expansion across five time periods (1988-1995,1996-2000,2001-2003,2004-2006,2007-2009) in three study areas that differ in size, eco-climatic conditions, and rates/patterns of development. Both the decision trees and support vector machines outperformed the maximum likelihood classifier (overall accuracy of 90-93%, compared to 65%), but the decision trees were superior at handling missing data. Adding transformed features such as band metrics to the Landsat data stack increased accuracy 1-4%, while experiments with a reduced number of features (designed to mimic noisy or missing data) led to a drop in accuracy of 1-9%. The methodology also proved particularly effective for monitoring pen-urbanization outside the urban core, capturing >98% of village settlements. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We have developed an air-relative-humidity-based two-source (ARTS) E model that simulates the surface energy balance, soil water balance, and environmental constraints on E. It uses remotely sensed leaf area index (L-ai) and surface meteorological data to estimate E by: 1) introducing a simple biophysical model for canopy conductance (G(c)), defined as a constant maximum stomatal conductance g(smax) of 12.2 mm s(-1) multiplied by air relative humidity (R-h) and L-ai (G(c) = g(srnax) x R-h X L-ai); 2) calculating canopy transpiration with the G(c)-based Penman-Monteith (PM) E model; 3) calculating soil evaporation from an air-relative-humidity-based model of evapotranspiration (Yan & Shugart, 2010); 4) calculating total E (E-0) as the sum of the canopy transpiration and soil evaporation, assuming the absence of soil water stress; and 5) correcting E-0 for soil water stress using a soil water balance model.   This physiological ARTS E model requires no calibration. Evaluation against eddy covariance measurements at 19 flux sites, representing a wide variety of climate and vegetation types, indicates that daily estimated E had a root mean square error = 0.77 mm d(-1). bias = -0.14 mm d(-1), and coefficient of determination, R-2 = 0.69. Global, monthly, 0.5 degrees-gridded ARTS E simulations from 1984 to 1998, which were forced using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer Lai data, Climate Research Unit climate data, and surface radiation budget data, predicted a mean annual land E of 58.4 x 10(3) km(3). This falls within the range (58 x 10(3)-85 x 10(3) km(3)) estimated by the Second Global Soil Wetness Project (GSWP-2: Dirmeyer et al., 2006). The ARTS E spatial pattern agrees well with that of the global E estimated by GSWP-2. The global annual ARTS E increased by 15.5 mm per decade from 1984 to 1998, comparable to an increase of 9.9 mm per decade from the model tree ensemble approach (Jung et al., 2010). These comparisons confirm the effectivity of the ARTS E model to simulate the spatial. pattern and climate response of global E. This model is the first of its kind among remote-sensing-based PM E models to provide global land E estimation with consideration of the soil water balance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

These biological events are genetically pre-determined but also strongly modulated by climatic conditions, particularly temperature, daylength and water availability. Therefore, the timing of these events is considered as a good indicator of climate change impacts and as a key parameter for understanding and modelling vegetation climate interactions. In situ observations, empirical or bioclimatic models and remotely sensed time-series data constitute the three possible ways for monitoring the timing of plant phenological events. Remote sensing has the advantage of being the only way of surface sampling at high temporal frequency and, in the case of satellite-based remote sensing, over large regions. Nevertheless, exogenous factors, particularly atmospheric conditions, lead to some uncertainties on the seasonal course of surface reflectance and cause bias in the identification of vegetation phenological events. Since 2005, a network of forest and herbaceous sites has been equipped with laboratory made NDVI sensors to monitor the temporal dynamics of canopy structure and phenology at an intra-daily time step. In this study, we present recent results obtained in several contrasting biomes in France, French Guiana, Belgium and Congo. These sites represent a gradient of vegetation ecosystems: the main evergreen and deciduous forest ecosystems in temperate climate region, an evergreen tropical rain forest in French Guiana, an herbaceous savanna ecosystem in Congo, and a succession of three annual crops in Belgium. In this paper, (1) we provide an accurate description of the seasonal dynamics of vegetation cover in these different ecosystems (2) we identify the most relevant remotely sensed markers from NDVI time-series for determining the dates of the main phenological events that characterize these ecosystems and (3) we discuss the relationships between temporal canopy dynamics and climate factors. In addition to its importance for phenological studies, this ground-based Network of NDVI measurement provides data needed for the calibration and direct validation of satellite observations and products.

Nearly global repeat coverage of the Earth\'s surface by optical satellite sensors now opens the possibility for global-scale mapping and monitoring of glacier flow with a number of applications in, for example, glacier physics, glacier-related climate change and impact assessment, and glacier hazard management. The purpose of this study is to compare and evaluate different existing image matching methods for glacier flow determination over large scales. The study compares six different matching methods: normalized cross-correlation (NCC), the phase correlation algorithm used in the COSI-Corr software, and four other Fourier methods with different normalizations. We compare the methods over five regions of the world with different representative glacier characteristics: Karakoram, the European Alps, Alaska, Pine Island (Antarctica) and southwest Greenland. Landsat images are chosen for matching because they expand back to 1972, they cover large areas, and at the same time their spatial resolution is as good as 15 m for images after 1999 (ETM + pan). Cross-correlation on orientation images (CCF-O) outperforms the three similar Fourier methods, both in areas with high and low visual contrast. NCC experiences problems in areas with low visual contrast, areas with thin clouds or changing snow conditions between the images. CCF-O has problems on narrow outlet glaciers where small window sizes (about 16 pixels by 16 pixels or smaller) are needed, and it also obtains fewer correct matches than COSI-Corr in areas with low visual contrast. COSI-Corr has problems on narrow outlet glaciers and it obtains fewer correct matches compared to CCF-O when thin clouds cover the surface, or if one of the images contains snow dunes. In total, we consider CCF-O and COSI-Corr to be the two most robust matching methods for global-scale mapping and monitoring of glacier velocities. If combining CCF-O with locally adaptive template sizes and by filtering the matching results automatically by comparing the displacement matrix to its low pass filtered version, the matching process can be automated to a large degree. This allows the derivation of glacier velocities with minimal (but not without!) user interaction and hence also opens up the possibility of global-scale mapping and monitoring of glacier flow.

This choice creates significant limitations for time-dependent epidemiological studies, since it is often essential to have datasets with high spatial and temporal resolution. Effectively synthesizing high temporal resolution imagery with high spatial resolution imagery can potentially ease this limitation. To this end, we conducted an experiment by creating a series of simulated ASTER datasets by fusing ASTER and MODIS data with the STARFM image fusion model. These simulated datasets are then used to derive the following urban environmental variables: normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference water index, and land surface temperature. These variables are used to quantitatively examine the effects of urban environmental characteristics on West Nile Virus dissemination in Los Angeles County, California, where the epidemic was most prevalent in the United States in 2007. Mosquito surveillance data were collected from the weekly summary reports published in the California West Nile Virus website. A spatial-temporal analysis of WNV dissemination was conducted by synthesizing remote sensing variables and mosquito surveillance records. We focused on assessment of WNV risk areas in July through September due to data sufficiency of tested-positive mosquito pools. Moderate- and high-risk areas of WNV infections in mosquitoes were identified for five selected time windows, i.e., epidemiological weeks 30-31, 32-33, 34-35, 36-37, and 38-39. The results show that elevation and urban built-up conditions were negatively associated with the WNV propagation, while LST positively correlated with viral transmission. NDVI was not significantly associated with WNV transmission during the studied time intervals. San Fernando Valley was found to be the most vulnerable to mosquito infections of WNV within the City of Los Angeles. With the complementation of high-spatial resolution ASTER and high-temporal resolution MODIS images, the fused image datasets allow for estimating environmental parameters at desired epidemiological weeks. This paper provides important insights into how high temporal resolution remote sensing imagery might be used to study time-dependant events in public health, especially in the operational surveillance and control of vector-borne or other epidemic diseases.

In this study, we applied a recently developed model, which relates crop GPP to a product of total crop chlorophyll content and incoming photosynthetically active radiation, for the remote estimation of GPP in two crop types (maize and soybean) with contrasting canopy architectures and leaf structures. The objective of this study was to evaluate performances of twelve vegetation indices used for detecting different vegetation biophysical characteristics, in estimating GPP of rainfed and irrigated crops over a period from 2001 through 2008. Indices tested in the model exhibited strong and significant relationships with widely variable GPP in each crop (GPP ranged from 0 to 19 gC/m(2)/d for soybean and 0 to 35 gC/m(2)/d for maize), however, they were species-specific. Only three indices, which use MERIS red edge and NIR spectral bands (i.e. red edge chlorophyll index, MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index and red edge NDVI), were found to be able to estimate GPP accurately in both crops combined, with root mean square errors (RMSE) below 3.2 gC/m(2)/d. It was also shown that two indices, red edge chlorophyll index and red edge NDVI with a red edge band around 720 nm, were non-species-specific and yielded a very accurate estimation of GPP in maize and soybean combined, with RMSEs below 2.9 gC/m(2)/d and coefficients of variation below 21%.

These products generally agree with ground-based albedo measurements during the snow cover period when the Solar Zenith Angle (SZA) is less than 70 degrees. An integrated validation strategy, including analysis of the representativeness of the surface heterogeneity, is performed to decide whether direct comparisons between field measurements and 500-m satellite products were appropriate or if the scaling of finer spatial resolution airborne or spaceborne data was necessary. Results indicate that the Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) are less than 0.047 during the snow covered periods for all MCD43 albedo products at several Alaskan tundra areas. The MCD43 1-day daily albedo product is particularly well suited to capture the rapidly changing surface conditions during the spring snow melt. Results also show that a full expression of the blue sky albedo is necessary at these large SZA snow covered areas because of the effects of anisotropic diffuse illumination and multiple scattering. In tundra locations with dark residue as a result of fire, the MODIS albedo values are lower than those at the unburned site from the start of snowmelt. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Recent studies have established linkages between rainfall and vegetation cover at local to regional scales, but no study related yet remote sensing derived rainfall and vegetation cover to the available surface water. A new dataset based on SPOT VEGETATION (VGT) represents surface water bodies (SWB) in the arid and semi-arid regions of sub-Saharan Western Africa. Water bodies represent the integrated hydrological response of a catchment, and changes in their spatial extent involve complex interactions at the catchment scale. We analyzed time series of remotely sensed vegetation cover, rainfall and surface water extent for the period 1999-2008, and could detect and statistically demonstrate the links between these biophysical variables. Our findings for two regions in Mali and Burkina Faso suggest that vegetation cover is positively related to the amount of available surface water for those catchments that are mainly covered by annual plants. The observed relationships between remotely sensed variables allow developing ecological indicators that can indicate short-term changes in arid and semi-arid ecosystems at local to regional scales.

However, the hydrological dynamics of seasonally flooded wetlands and floodplains remains poorly quantified. Here, we separate the Congo wetland into four 3 degrees x 3 degrees regions, and use remote sensing measurements (i.e., GRACE, satellite radar altimeter, GPCP, JERS-1, SRTM, and MODIS) to estimate the amounts of water filling and draining from the Congo wetland, and to determine the source of the water. We find that the amount of water annually filling and draining the Congo wetlands is 111 km(3), which is about one-third the size of the water volumes found on the mainstem Amazon floodplain. Based on amplitude comparisons among the water volume changes and timing comparisons among their fluxes, we conclude that the local upland runoff is the main source of the Congo wetland water, not the fluvial process of river-floodplain water exchange as in the Amazon. Our hydraulic analysis using altimeter measurements also supports our conclusion by demonstrating that water surface elevations in the wetlands are consistently higher than the adjacent river water levels. Our research highlights differences in the hydrology and hydrodynamics between the Congo wetland and the mainstem Amazon floodplain. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Uncertainty in the retrieval of soil moisture over large heterogeneous areas such as SMOS pixels is expected, due to the non-linearity of the relationship between soil moisture and the microwave emission. The current baseline soil moisture retrieval algorithm adopted by SMOS and implemented in the SMOS Level 2 (SMOS L2) processor partially accounts for the sub-pixel heterogeneity of the land surface, by modelling the individual contributions of different pixel fractions to the overall pixel emission. This retrieval approach is tested in this study using airborne L-band data over an area the size of a SMOS pixel characterised by a mix Eucalypt forest and moderate vegetation types (grassland and crops), with the objective of assessing its ability to correct for the soil moisture retrieval error induced by the land surface heterogeneity. A preliminary analysis using a traditional uniform pixel retrieval approach shows that the sub-pixel heterogeneity of land cover type causes significant errors in soil moisture retrieval (7.7%v/v RMSE, 2%v/v bias) in pixels characterised by a significant amount of forest (40-60%). Although the retrieval approach adopted by SMOS partially reduces this error, it is affected by errors beyond the SMOS target accuracy, presenting in particular a strong dry bias when a fraction of the pixel is occupied by forest (4.1%v/v RMSE, -3.1%v/v bias). An extension to the SMOS approach is proposed that accounts for the heterogeneity of vegetation optical depth within the SMOS pixel. The proposed approach is shown to significantly reduce the error in retrieved soil moisture (2.8%v/v RMSE, -03%v/v bias) in pixels characterised by a critical amount of forest (40-60%), at the limited cost of only a crude estimate of the optical depth of the forested area (better than 35% uncertainty). This study makes use of an unprecedented data set of airborne L-band observations and ground supporting data from the National Airborne Field Experiment 2005 (NAFE\'05), which allowed accurate characterisation of the land surface heterogeneity over an area equivalent in size to a SMOS pixel.

Empirical methods based on normalising individual images to a common standard are used widely to create visually acceptable mosaics. However, the effect of these methods on quantitative estimation of land surface properties is unknown. An existing method for atmospherically correcting an aerial image mosaic involves fitting a regression model using pixels from the overlapping edges of adjacent flightlines. Here, we demonstrate a new method of atmospherically correcting an aerial image mosaic, based on use of an additional orthogonal flightline. The two methods were compared by using the two image mosaics to calculate vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, ARVI), which were then used to predict leaf area index, which was known in detail from ground survey. The second method was found to have lower uncertainty for all three vegetation indices tested. ARVI was found to be the most robust of the three when applied across multiple flightlines, regardless of the method of atmospheric correction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The two subsiding sectors are bordered by sharp velocity gradients, and the subsidence pattern appears partially delimited by mapped geologic faults. Surface geology and urbanization alone are unable to explain the phenomena. In the Vialonga area, the historical record of water pore pressure shows a clear decline of the levels (up to 65 m in 27 years), providing evidence of over-exploitation of groundwater resources. Limited information from wells drilled inside and outside the subsidence area points to a spatial correlation between the subsidence and the water pressure levels, and suggests that faults could be acting as hydraulic barriers in the aquifer system. The surface subsidence detected is probably caused by compaction of a clay-rich Oligocene-aged aquitard, led by over-exploitation of adjacent aquifers. The same Oligocene aquitard layer is present in the Laranjeiras area, immediately bellow a multi-layered sand-clay-limestone Miocene aquifer, but further work is needed to diagnose the possibility of over-exploitation of groundwater here. In this work we were able to independently confirm the PSI results, by comparing autonomous PSI results processed for the same geographical areas, and by comparing PSI with leveling and continuous GPS derived subsidence velocities, whose close match provided further ground validation of the space-borne PSI technique.

Images from two regions in Spain and Alaska were used to analyze SAR metrics (cross-polarized backscatter and co-polarized interferometric coherence) from regrowing forests previously affected by fire. TerraSAR-X X-band backscatter showed the lowest sensitivity to forest regrowth, with the average backscatter increasing by 1-2 dB between the most recent fire scar and the unburned forest. Increased sensitivity (around 3-4 dB) was observed for C-band Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture (ASAR) backscatter.

The interferometric coherence showed low sensitivity to forest regrowth at all SAR frequencies. For Mediterranean forests, five phases of forest regrowth were discerned whereas for boreal forest, up to four different regrowth phases could be discerned with L-band SAR data.

The vast spatial coverage of remote sensing data, coupled with the tough conditions in areas of interest has made remote sensing a particularly useful tool in the field of glaciology. Compared to optical images, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are hardly influenced by clouds. This is important because glacial areas are usually under cloud cover. The Dongkemadi glacier in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau was selected as the study area for this paper. We use polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) image for classification on and around the glacier. The contrast between ice and wet snow is remarkable, but it is difficult to distinguish the ice from the ground on SAR images due to similar backscatter characteristics in former research. In our study, we found that this distinction can be achieved by target decomposition. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are performed to classify the glacier areas using the selected features. The glacial areas are classified into six parts: wet snow, ice, river outwash, soil land, rocky land and others. The PolSAR-Target decomposition-SVMs (PTS) method is proven to be efficient, with an overall classification accuracy of 91.1% and a kappa coefficient of 0.875. Moreover, 86.63% of the bare ice and 96.76% of the wet snow are correctly classified. The classification map acquired using the PTS method also helps to determine the snow line, which is an important concept in glaciology. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Initially a submarine eruption it quickly evolved into a subaerial event upon the formation of an ephemeral island.   Remote sensing data from different sensors including MODIS, ASTER. EO-1 ALI and Landsat-7 ETM+ were used to analyze the event, focusing on the plumes of discolored water, ocean chlorophyll-a concentration (OCC) and sea surface temperature.   An early classification system for the plumes was devised based on spectral properties and point of origin. Plumes originated at the volcano were named Type-I and those associated to the pumice rafts Type-II.   Anomalies in ocean chlorophyll-a concentration, measured using MODIS data, were analyzed and a large bloom, presumably dominated by Trichodesmium sp. was identified. The bloom, which contributed to OCC values 17 times higher than the background, was spatially and temporally coincident with a Type-I plume of discolored water. The OCC increase appears to have been caused by a combined effect of both ocean fertilizations by the subsurface volcanic plume and rising sea surface temperatures.   The Home Reef event offers a good candidate for a case of ocean enrichment by a submarine volcano and highlights the need for continuous monitoring of the eruptions even after the end of the explosive, more spectacular stages.

Corrections for atmospheric, adjacency, topography, and surface directional effects are applied sequentially and independently, accumulating errors into the TOC reflectance data, which are then further used in the inversion process. This paper presents a proof of concept for demonstrating the direct use of measured top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance data to estimate forest biophysical and biochemical variables, by using a coupled canopy-atmosphere radiative transfer model. Advantages of this approach are that no atmospheric correction is needed and that atmospheric, adjacency, topography, and surface directional effects can be directly and more accurately included in the forward modelling.   In the case study, we applied both TOC and TOA approaches to three Norway spruce stands in Eastern Czech Republic. We used the SLC soil-leaf-canopy model and the MODTRAN4 atmosphere model. For the TOA approach, the physical coupling between canopy and atmosphere was performed using a generic method based on the 4-stream radiative transfer theory which enables full use of the directional reflectance components provided by SLC. The method uses three runs of the atmosphere model for Lambertian surfaces, and thus avoids running the atmosphere model for each new simulation. We used local sensitivity analysis and singular value decomposition to determine which variables could be estimated, namely: canopy cover, fraction of bark, needle chlorophyll, and dry matter content. TOC and TOA approaches resulted in different sets of estimates, but had comparable performance. The TOC approach, however, was at its best potential because of the flatness and homogeneity of the area. On the contrary, the capacities of the TOA approach would be better exploited in heterogeneous rugged areas. We conclude that, having similar performance, the TOA approach should be preferred in situations where minimizing the pre-processing is important, such as in data assimilation and multi-sensor studies.

These tree islands constitute important nutrient hotspots in an otherwise P-limited wetland environment. Foliar delta N-15 values obtained from a previous study of 17 tree islands in both slough (perennially wet) and prairie (seasonally wet) locations served as a proxy of P availability at the stand level. We utilized five cloud-free SPOT 4 multispectral images (20 m spatial resolution) from different times of the seasonal cycle to derive two atmospherically corrected vegetation indices: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference water index (NDWI), averaged for each tree island. NDWI, which incorporates a shortwave infrared (SWIR) band that provides information on leaf water content, showed consistently higher linear fits with island foliar delta N-15 values than did NDVI. In addition, NDWI showed greater variation throughout the seasonal cycle than did NDVI, and was significantly correlated with average water stage, which suggests that the SWIR band captures important information on seasonally variable water status. Tree islands in slough locations showed higher NDWI than prairie islands during the dry season, which is consistent with higher levels of transpiration and nutrient harvesting and accumulation for perennially wet locations. Overall, the results suggest that water availability is closely related to P availability in subtropical tree islands, and that NDWI may provide a robust indicator of community-level water and nutrient status.

We focus on some specific textured patterns of clouds that are visible on Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) images and generated at the so-called \"sea breeze front\". This is the limit of the penetration of the sea breeze inland. The sea breeze circulation is a phenomenon that arises when land and sea surface temperatures reveal strong variations. This generates a landward wind that creates a cloud-free area starting from the coast line and ending at the sea breeze front. With the new geostationary meteorological sensors like MSG, this band of cloud-free area can clearly be seen. The automatic analysis of the sea breeze front with such image sensors (instead of using local measurements) is then of great importance. It has the precious advantage to extract huge amount of data and to get rid of the use of local sensors. Unfortunately, from an image processing point of view, this front appears as the limit of a very textured area. It is sometimes disturbed by clouds located in higher layers of the atmosphere. Due to this complexity, conventional detection methods issued from computer vision are not adapted. In this paper we propose an approach that automatically detects fronts in images and we apply this framework to the sea breeze fronts. The methodology is based on the well-known active contour method (or \"snake\") issued from the computer vision community. The specific textures involved as well as the transparency phenomena are dealt with some properties of the wavelet decomposition of the images. This decomposition enables to compute several criteria related to the presence or not of a front that are combined using the Dempster-Shafer theory. The validation of our approach is done on synthetic and real data. It is important to outline that the presented theoretical framework is not only devoted to the detection of the sea breeze front but can also be used to detect any others textured patterns.

Sample (field) plot size has long been considered a key sampling design parameter and focal point for optimization in forest surveys, because of its impact on sampling effort and the estimation accuracy of forest inventory attributes. In this study, we demonstrate how plot size and co-registration error interact to influence the estimation of LiDAR canopy height and density metrics, regression model coefficients, and the prediction accuracy of least-squares estimators of TAGB. We made use of simulated forest canopies and synthetic LiDAR point clouds, so that we could maintain strict control over the spatial scale and complexity of forest scenes, as well as the magnitude and type of planimetric error inherent in ground-reference and LiDAR datasets. Our results showed that predictions of TAGB improved markedly as plot size increased from 314 (10 m radius) to 1964 m(2) (25 m radius). The co-registration error (spatial overlap) between ground-reference and LiDAR samples negatively impacted the estimation of LiDAR metrics, regression model fit, and the prediction accuracy of TAGB. We found that larger plots maintained a higher degree of spatial overlap between ground-reference and LiDAR datasets for any given GPS error, and were therefore more resilient to the ill effects of co-registration error compared to small plots. The impact of co-registration error was more pronounced in tall, spatially heterogeneous stands than short, homogeneous stands. We identify and briefly discuss three possible ways that LiDAR data could be used to optimize plot size, sample selection, and the deployment of GPS resources in forest biomass surveys.

Although the potential risk of a component failure increases the longer the sensor\'s design life is exceeded, the possible gap in Landsat data acquisition is reduced with each passing day and the risk of Landsat imagery being unavailable diminishes for all except a handful of applications that are particularly data demanding. Advances in Landsat data compositing and fusion are providing opportunities to address issues associated with Landsat-7 SLC-off imagery and to mitigate a potential acquisition gap through the integration of imagery from different sensors. The latter will likely also provide short-term, regional solutions to application-specific needs for the continuity of Landsat-like observations.

Norway is particularly susceptible to large rockslides due to its many fjords and steep mountains One of the most dangerous hazards related with rock slope failures are tsunamis that can lead to large loss of life It is therefore very important to systematically identify potential unstable rock slopes Traditional landslide monitoring techniques are expensive and time consuming. Differential satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is an invaluable tool for land displacement monitoring Improved access to time series of satellite data has led to the development of several innovative multitemporal algorithms. Small baseline (SB) methods are based on combining and inverting a set of unwrapped interferograms that are computed with a small perpendicular baseline in order to reduce spatial phase decorrelation Another well proven technique is the persistent scatterer interferometric method (PSI) that is based on analysis of persistent point targets In this paper, we apply both approaches to study several rockslide sites in Troms County in the far north of Norway. Moreover, we take the opportunity to address the difference and similarities between the SB and the PSI multitemporal InSAR methods for displacement studies in rural terrain.

A small part of this flow was re-channelled into the Opak tributary valley. The high-resolution IKONOS images also helped us to identify geomorphic obstacles that enabled flows to ramp up and spill out from the sinuous channel, as flow avulsion. Flow avulsions are dangerous as the redirect flows to unexpected areas away from the main channel. Valley fills from previous deposits, channel bends, and anthropogenic barriers in the channel (locally known as Sabo dams) influence the down valley passage of the flows. Sabo dams, originally built to ameliorate the effect of high sediment load streams, caused block-and-ash flows to avulse of the containing channel, and devastate populated areas (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved', '[Thouret, Jean-Claude] Univ Clermont Ferrand, PRES Clermont, CNRS, Lab Magmas & Volcans,UMR6524, F-63038 Clermont Ferrand, France.

Remote sensing imagery has considerable potential to aid in the monitoring and prediction of biodiversity across many spatial and temporal scales. In this paper, we explored the possibility of defining relationships between species diversity indices and Landsat ETM+ reflectance values for Hyrcanian forests in Golestan province of Iran. We used the COST model for atmospheric correction of the imagery. Linear regression models were implemented to predict measures of biodiversity (species richness and reciprocal of Simpson indices) using various combinations of Landsat spectral data. Species richness was modeled using the band set ETM5, ETM7, DV1, wetness and variances of ETM1, ETM2 and ETM5 (adjusted R-2 = 0.59, RMSE = 1.51). Reciprocal of Simpson index was modeled using the band set NDVI, brightness, greenness, variances of ETM2. ETM5 and ETM7 (adjusted R-2=0.459 RMSE = 1.15). The results demonstrated that spectral reflectance from Landsat can be used to effectively model tree species diversity. Predictive map derived from the presented methodology can help evaluate spatial aspects and monitor tree species diversity of the studied forest. The methodology also facilitates the evaluation of forest management and conservation strategies in northern Iran. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Active microwave remote sensing is one of the most promising techniques for estimating the distribution of SWE at high spatial resolutions in large areas. Development of reliable and accurate inversion techniques to recover SWE is one of the most important tasks in current microwave researches. However, a number of snow pack properties, including snow density, particle size, crystal shape. stratification, ground surface roughness and soil moisture, affect the microwave scattering signals and need to be properly modeled and exploited. In this paper, we developed a multi-layer, multi-scattering model for dry snow based on recent theoretical advances in snow and surface modeling. In the proposed multi-layer model, Matrix Doubling method is used to account for scattering from each snow layer; and Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) is incorporated into the model to describe surface scattering. Comparisons were made between the model predictions and field observations from NASA Cold Land Processes Field Experiment (CLPX) during Third Intensive Observation Period (IOP3) and SARALPS-2007 field experiment supported by ESA. The results indicated that model predictions were in good agreement with field observations. With the confirmed confidence, the analyses on multiple scattering. scatterer shape, and snow stratification effects were further made based on the model simulations. Furthermore, a parameterized snow backscattering model with a simple form and high computational efficiency was developed using a database generated by the multiple-scattering model. For a wide range of snow and soil properties, this parameterized model agrees well with the multiple-scattering model, with the root mean square error 0.20 dB, 0.24 dB and 0.43 dB for VV, HH and VH polarizations, respectively. This simplified model can be useful for the development of SWE retrieval algorithm and for fast simulations of radar signals over snow cover in land data assimilation systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Hyperspectral images of the CHRIS/PROBA sensor in imaging mode 1 (5 observation angles, 62 bands, 410-1005 nm) were acquired throughout a two-year period for a Mediterranean ecosystem fully covered by the semi-deciduous shrub Phlomis fruticosa. During each acquisition, coincident ecophysiological field measurements were conducted. Leaf area index (LAI), leaf biochemical content (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids) and leaf water potential were measured. The hyperspectral images were corrected for coherent noises, cloud and atmosphere, in order to produce ground reflectance images. The reflectance spectrum of each image was used to calculate a variety of vegetation indices (VIs) that are already published in relevant literature. Additionally, all combinations of the 62 bands were used in order to calculate Normalized Difference Spectral Indices (NDSI(x,y)) and Simple Subtraction Indices (SSI(x,y)). The above indices along with raw reflectance and reflectance derivatives were examined for linear relationship with the ground-measured variables and the strongest relationships were determined. It is concluded that higher observation angles are better for the extraction of biochemical indices. The first derivative of the reflectance spectra proved to be very useful in the prediction of all measured variables. In many cases, complex and improved spectral indices that are proposed in the literature do not seem to be more accurate than simple NDSIs Such as NDVI. Even traditional broadband NDVI is proved to be adequate in LAI prediction, while green bands seem also very useful. However, in biochemical estimation narrow bands are necessary. Indices that incorporate red, blue and IR bands, such as PSRI, SIPI and mNDVI presented good performance in chlorophyll estimation, while CRI did not show any relevance to carotenoids and WI was poorly correlated to water potential. Moreover, analyses indicated that it is very important to use a near red-edge band (701 nm) for effective chlorophyll index design. SSIs that incorporate 701 nm with 511 or 605 nm showed best performance in chlorophyll determination. For carotenoid estimation, a band on the edge of carotenoid absorption (511 nm) combined with a red band performed best, while a normalized index of two water absorption bands (945, 971 nm) proved to be an effective water index. Finally, the attempt to investigate stress conditions through pigment ratios resulted in the use of the band centred at 701 nm. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Past studies have demonstrated the use of multispectral imagery for remote identification and mapping of visible or red attack damage in forests. This study aims to detect pre-visual or green attack damage in lodgepole pine needles by means of hyperspectral measurements, particularly via continuous wavelet analysis. Field measurements of lodgepole pine stands were conducted at two sites located northwest of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. In June and August of 2007, reflectance spectra (350-2500 nm) were collected for 16 pairs of trees. Each of the 16 tree pairs included one control tree (healthy), and one stressed tree (girdled to simulate the effects of beetle infestation). In addition, during the period of June through October 2008, spectra were collected from 15 pairs of control- and beetle-infested trees. Spectra derived from these 31 tree pairs were subjected to a continuous wavelet transform, generating a scalogram that compiles the wavelet power as a function of wavelength location and scale of decomposition. Linear relationships were then explored between the wavelet scalograms and chemical properties or class labels (control and non-control) of the sample populations in order to isolate the most useful distinguishing spectral features that related to infested or girdled trees vs. control trees.   A deficit in water content is observed in infested trees while an additional deficit in chlorophyll content is seen for girdled trees. The measurable water deficit of infested and girdled tree samples was detectable from the wavelet analysis of the reflectance spectra providing a novel method for the detection of green attack. The spectral features distinguishing control and infested trees are predominantly located between 950 and 1390 nm from scales 1 to 8. Of those, five features between 1318 to 1322 nm at scale 7 are consistently found in the July and August 2008 datasets. These features are located at longer wavelengths than those investigated in previous studies (below 1100 nm) and provide new insights into the potential remote detection of green attack. Spectral features that distinguish control and girdled trees were mostly observed between 1550 and 2370 nm from scales 1 to 5. The differing response of girdled and infested trees appears to indicate that the girdling process does not provide a perfect simulation of the effects caused by beetle infestation.   It remains to be determined if the location of the 1318-1322 nm features, near the edge of a strong atmospheric water absorption band, will be sufficiently separable for use in airborne detection of green attack. A plot comparing needle water content and wavelet power at 1320 nm reveals considerable overlap between data derived from both infested and control samples, though the groups are statistically separable. This obstacle may preclude a high accuracy separation of healthy and infected single individuals, but establishing threshold identification levels may provide an economical, efficient and expeditious method for discriminating between healthy and infested tree populations.

We measured canopy reflectance, effective green leaf area index (green LAIe) and chlorophyll fluorescence of dominant species. The treatment effects on green LAIe varied among sites. We calculated three reflectance indices: photochemical reflectance index PRI [531 nm: 570 nm], normalized difference vegetation index NDVI(680) [780 nm; 680 nm] using red spectral region, and NDVI(570) [780 nm: 570 nm] using the same green spectral region as PRI. All three reflectance indices were significantly related to green LAIe and were able to detect changes in shrubland vegetation among treatments. In general warming treatment increased PRI and drought treatment reduced NDVI values. The significant treatment effect on photochemical efficiency of plants detected with PRI could not be detected by fluorescence measurements. However, we found canopy level measured PRI to be very sensitive to soil reflectance properties especially in vegetation areas with low green LAIe. As both soil reflectance and LAI varied between northern and southern sites it is problematic to draw universal conclusions of climate-derived changes in all vegetation types based merely on PRI measurements. We propose that canopy level PRI measurements can be more useful in areas of dense vegetation and dark soils. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The sensible heat fluxes retrieved using MODIS data from a grassland located in the middle reach of Heihe river basin, Northwest China, are in good agreement with those measured from a Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS). The Root Mean Square Error of this comparison is 25.07 W/m(2).

We exploit the spectral content of AIRS data to demonstrate that airborne volcanic ash has a unique signature in the infrared (8-12 mu m) that can be used to infer particle size, infrared opacity and composition. The spectral signature is interpreted with the aid of a radiative transfer model utilizing the optical properties of andesite, rhyolite and quartz. Based on the infrared spectral signature, a new volcanic ash detection algorithm is proposed that can discriminate volcanic ash from other airborne substances and we show that the algorithm depends on particle size, optical depth and composition. The new algorithm has an improved sensitivity to optically thin ash clouds, and hence can detect them for longer (similar to 4 days) and at greater distances from the source(similar to 5000 km).

We apply here models based on canopy temperature estimated from high resolution airborne imagery to calculate tree canopy conductance (G(c)) and the crop water stress index (CWSI) of heterogeneous olive orchards. The Gc model requires the simulation of net radiation (R-n) and the aerodynamic resistance (r(a)) as a function of windspeed and canopy structure. In both cases, the R-n and r(a) models were tested against measurements and published data for olive orchards. Modeled values of G(c) of trees varying in water status correlated well with G(c) estimates obtained from stomatal conductance measurements in the same trees. The model used to calculate the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) took into account, not only the vapor pressure deficit but the R-n and the windspeed as well, parameters known to affect the temperature differences between the air and the tree canopy. The calculated CWSI for water deficit and well irrigated olive trees correlated with the water potential measured on the same trees. The methodology applied in this manuscript was used to validate the estimation of theoretical baselines needed for the CWSI calculations, comparing against traditional empirical baseline determination. High resolution thermal imagery obtained with the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS), and from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for two years was used to map G(c) and CWSI of an olive orchard where different irrigation treatments were applied. The methodology developed here enables the spatial analysis of water use within heterogeneous orchards, and the field characterization of water stress, leading to potential applications in the improvement of orchard irrigation management using high resolution thermal remote sensing imagery.

In 2003 and 2005, ALS data and field estimates of LAI(e) were acquired in a Norway spruce forest in SE Norway. We used LI-COR\'s LAI-2000 (R) Plant canopy analyzer (\"LAI-2000\") and hemispherical images (\"HI\") for field based estimates of LAI(e). ALS penetration rate calculated from first echoes and from first and last echoes was strongly related to field estimates of LAI(e). We fitted regression models of LAI(e) against the log-transformed inverse of the ALS penetration rate, and in accordance with the Beer-Lambert law this produced a linear, no-intercept relationship. This was particularly the case for the LAI-2000, having R(2) values > 0.9. The strongest relationship was obtained by selecting ALS data from within a circle around each plot with a radius of 0.75 times the tree height. We found a slight difference in the relationship for the two years, which can be attributed to the differences in the ALS acquisition settings. The relationship was valid across four age classes of trees representing different stages of stand development, except in one case with newly regenerated stands which most likely was an artifact. Using LAI(e) based on HI data produced weaker relationships with the ALS data. This was the case even when we simulated LAI-2000 measurements based on the HI data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Evidence suggests that recent changes in outbreak distribution and duration can be attributed to climate warming.

Here we assess the reliability of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) 16-day NDVI data for generating time series of the distribution of defoliation caused by moths attacking birch forest in Fennoscandia. We do so by first establishing the relationship between ground measures of moth larval density and a defoliation score based on MODIS-NDVI. We then calibrate and validate a model with the MODIS-NDVI defoliation score as a classifier to discriminate between areas with and without visible defoliation as identified from orthophotos and provide two examples of application of the model. We found the MODIS defoliation score to be a valid proxy for larval density (R(2)=0.88-0.93) above a certain, low threshold (a defoliation score of -5%). Areas with and without visible defoliation could be discriminated based on defoliation score with a substantial strength of agreement (max kappa = 0.736), and the resulting model was able to predict the proportion of area with visible defoliation in independent test areas with good reliability across the range of proportions. We conclude that satellite-derived defoliation patterns can be an invaluable tool for generating indirect population dynamical data that permits the development of targeted monitoring on relevant regional scales.

The results obtained from each of these datasets were compared to the lahar deposit manually digitized from aerial photography. SPOT5 imagery produced the most accurate map of the lahar deposit (77% correct), even though these data were acquired a year after the event. This is attributed to the spatial resolution of the data. The ALOS-PALSAR coherence mapping calculated from images acquired 2 months before and nine months after the lahar was not as accurate as that obtained using the optical imagery (43% correct), but this was still considered an important tool for acquiring data during cloudy periods. LiDAR topographic data, collected to constrain geomorphic changes caused by the lahar, was the least accurate in terms of mapping the lahar path (28% correct). No single technique was deemed to be the most accurate under all circumstances, and a combination of data types would produce the best results. By combining the satellite and LiDAR data, it was possible to accurately classify 92% of the lahar path. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This area includes the San Pedro Parks Wilderness area, which was designated as an official wilderness in 1964. Eight autumnal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TMI) scenes acquired from 1988 to 2006 were analyzed to determine whether significant changes have occurred throughout the region during the past 18 years and, if so, to assess whether the changes are long-term and gradual or short-term and abrupt. It was found that, starting in about 1995, many of the conifer stands within the Wilderness area showed consistently gradual and marked increases in the Shortwave Infrared/Near Infrared Index. These trends generally imply decreases in canopy greenness or increases in mortality. Other high-elevation conifer forests located outside of the Wilderness area showed similar spectral trends, indicating that changes are potentially widespread. The spatial patterns of forest damage as inferred from the image analyses were very similar to the general patterns of insect defoliation damage mapped via aerial sketch mapping by the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service Forest Health Monitoring Program. A field visit indicated that zones of spectral change are associated with high levels of forest damage and mortality, likely caused by a combination of insects and drought. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of using historical Landsat data for providing objective and consistent long-term assessments of the gradual ecosystem changes that are occurring within the western United States.

The Sarfartoq carbonatite complex consists of a core zone composed of dolomite carbonatite and minor sovite (calcite carbonatite) surrounded by a fenite zone and a marginal zone of gneisses frequently altered due to hydrothermal activity. High spatial and spectral resolution imaging spectrometer data recorded by the HyMap imaging system were used to map lithology of the Sarfartoq carbonatite complex. A careful analysis of the spectral reflectance properties of the carbonatite lithology preceded the HyMap data analysis stage. The spectral reflectance measurements showed that the various lithologic units including dolomite carbonatite, sovite, fenite and the marginal alteration zone have distinct spectral reflectance characteristics. The analysis of the HyMap data was based on an unsupervised clustering algorithm, the Self Organizing Maps (SOM), for the mapping of the main lithology and a hierarchical tree for the mapping of sparsely occurring sovite rocks. Spectral mixture analysis was applied to map fractional abundances and compare with the SOM results. The resulting lithological map shows the spatial distribution of dolomite carbonatite, sovite, fenite with abundant carbonatite dykes (representing the outer core of the carbonatite complex), fenite and hematized gneiss (marginal alteration zone). The results compare well with the field data collected for the assessment of the mapping accuracy and due to the spatially contiguous nature of the hyperspectral data could be used to better map the outcropping carbonatite lithology. The spectral reflectance measurements and the mapping results provide information of petrological importance for the carbonatite core zone. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However, in regions lacking good digital land cover information. nearest neighbors selected to predict continuous variables such as tree volume must be selected without regard to relevant categorical variables such as forest/non-forest. The result is that non-zero volume predictions may be obtained for pixels predicted to be non-forest, and volume predictions for pixels predicted to be forest may be erroneously small due to non-forest nearest neighbors. For users who wish to circumvent this discrepancy, a two-step algorithm is proposed in which the class of a relevant categorical variable such as land cover is predicted in the first step. and continuous variables such as volume are predicted in the second step subject to the constraint that all nearest neighbors must come from the predicted class of the categorical variable. Nearest neighbors, multinomial logistic regression, and discriminant analysis techniques were investigated for use in the first step. The results were generally similar for the three techniques, although the multinomial logistic regression technique was slightly superior. The k-Nearest Neighbors technique was used in the second step because many continuous forest inventory variables do not satisfy the distributional assumptions necessary for parametric multivariate techniques. The results for six 15-km x 15-km areas of interest in northern Minnesota, USA, indicate that areal estimates of tree volume, basal area, and density obtained from pixel predictions are comparable to plot-based estimates and estimates by conifer and deciduous classes are also comparable to plot-based estimates. When a mixed conifer/deciduous class was included, predictions for the mixed and deciduous class were confused.

These findings imply that, provided that an atmospheric correction scheme for the red and NIR bands is available, the extensive database of MERIS and MODIS imagery could be used for quantitative monitoring of chla turbid waters.

Large area insect monitoring is typically undertaken using manual aerial overview sketch mapping, whereby an interpreter depicts areas of homogenous insect attack conditions onto 1:250,000 OF 1: 100,000 scale maps. These Surveys provide valuable strategic data for management at the provincial scale. The coarse spatial and attribute resolution of these data however, make them inappropriate for fine-scale monitoring and operational planning. For instance, it is not possible to estimate the initial timing of attack and year of stand death. In this study, we utilise eight Landsat scenes collected over a 14 year period in north-central British Columbia, Canada, where the infestation has gradually developed both spatially and temporally. After pre-processing and normalising the eight scenes using a relative normalisation procedure, decision free analysis was applied to classify spectral trajectories of the Normalised Difference Moisture Index (NDMI). From the classified temporal sequence of images, key parameters were extracted including the presence of beetle disturbance and timing of stand decline. The accuracy of discriminating beetle attack from healthy forest stands was assessed both spatially and temporally using three years of aerial survey data (1996, 2003, and 2004) with results indicating overall classification accuracies Varying between 71 and 86%. As expected, the earliest and least severe attack year (1996), recorded the lowest overall accuracy. The relationship between the timing of stand attack (i.e. moderate to severe beetle infestation) and NDMI (initial year of detected disturbance) was also explored. The results Suggest that there is potential for deriving regional estimates of the year of stand death using Landsat data and decision tree analysis however, a higher temporal frequency of images is required to quantify the timing of mountain pine beetle attack.

Not counting the transitional water bodies located in the vicinity of estuaries, not less than seventy four coastal water bodies have to be monitored along the coast of the French Atlantic continental shelf and the English Channel. All the available data have to be gathered to implement a comprehensive monitoring scheme. To this purpose, we evaluate the capacity of ocean colour imagery to complete the conventional in situ data set collected in coastal networks. Satellite-derived chlorophyll-a concentration is obtained by the application of a coastal Look-Up-Table to water-leaving radiance of the Sea-viewing Wide Field Instrument Sensor (SeaWiFS) for the 1998-2004 period. Seven years of satellite-derived and in situ chlorophyll-a concentrations are compared at seven representative stations of different water bodies. These comparisons show that the satellite products are reliable in most of the situations studied and throughout the seasons. Then the satellite imagery is used to classify the coastal waters following the eutrophication risk criterion of the WFD. This classification is made according to the percentile-90 of chlorophyll-a calculated during the productive season, from March to October. Despite a lack of sensor coverage over a small fraction of the near shore waters, this work shows that the satellite monitoring can considerably ease the application of the WFD.

It is now recognised that a partition of the marine autotrophic pool into a suite of phytoplankton functional types, each type having a characteristic role in the biogeochemical cycle of the ocean, would increase our understanding of the role of phytoplankton in the global carbon cycle.

The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) has shown promise in tracking LUE at the leaf- to small canopy levels, but its use at regional to global scales still remains a challenge. In this study, we used different formulations of PRI calculated from the MODIS ocean band centered at 531 nm and a set of alternative reference bands at 488, 551, and 678 nm to explore the relationship between PRI and LUE where WE was measured at eight eddy covariance flux towers located in the boreal forest of Saskatchewan, Canada. The magnitude and variability of WE was significantly lower at the times when useful MODIS ocean band images were available (i.e. around midday under clear-sky conditions) relative to the rest of the growing season. PR1678 (reference band at 678 nm) showed the strongest relationship (r(2)=0.70) with LUE90a (i.e. 90-minute mean WE calculated using Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation, APAR), but only when all sites were combined. Overall, the relationships between the MODIS PRIs and LUE90a were always stronger for observations closer to the backscatter direction and there were no significant differences in the strength of the correlations whether LUE was calculated based on incident PAR or on APAR. Predictions of ecosystem photosynthesis at the time of the MODIS overpasses were significantly improved by multiplying either PAR or APAR by MODIS PRI (r(2) improved from 0.09 to 0.44 and 0.54 depending on the PRI formulation). We used our PRI-LUE model to create a regional LUE90a map for the three cover types covering 47,500 km(2) around the flux sites. The MODIS PRI-derived LUE90a map appeared to capture more realistic spatial heterogeneity of LUE across the landscape compared to a daily WE map derived using the look-up table in the MODIS GPP (MOD17) algorithm. While our LUE map is only a snapshot of minimum regional LUE90a values, with appropriate gap-filling methods it could be used to improve regional-scale monitoring of GPR Moreover, the strong relationship between midday and daily WE on clear days (r(2)=0.93) indicates that instantaneous MODIS observations of LUE90a could be used to estimate daily WE. Finally, pixel shadow fraction from the 5-Scale geometric-optical model was closely related to both MODIS PRI and tower-derived LUE suggesting that differences in stand leaf area and in diffuse illumination among flux sites play a role in the relationship we observed between LUE and MODIS PRI.

The dates correspond to recreational king mackerel, Scomberomorus cavalla, tournaments. A histogram-based algorithm was useful to detect coastal surface SST nL(W), and FLH fronts, specifically. A gradient-based algorithm, with a smaller kernel box of 3x3 pixels, best identified nearshore (< 10 m depth) features in Chi images at the mouth of Tampa Bay, but was less effective for fronts farther offshore where gradients were weaker. Local winds and tide levels estimated from a coastal observing buoy, and bathymetric gradients were examined to help understand the factors that influenced front formation and stability. Periods of strong and variable winds led to front movement of up to 10 km per day or dissipation within 2-3 days in over 80% of the fronts detected in SST, Chi, nL(W) and FLH imagery. Short episodes of less variable wind velocities typically led to more stable and stationary fronts, within 3-5 km, for up to four days. The occurrence of fronts closely associated with the coastal bathymetry, namely at the 20 m and 30 m isobaths, was significantly higher in the fall SST imagery and in the spring Chi imagery. Fall SST fronts related to bathymetric gradients likely resulted from progressive cooling of the water with depth. Stronger Chi and nL(W)443 gradients at the mouths of estuaries in the fall compared to the spring were attributed to increased precipitation and periods of stronger winds or tides. The FLH imagery was most useful in delineating coastal algal blooms. The automatic front detection techniques applied here can be an important tool for resource managers to track coastal oceanographic features daily, over synoptic spatial scales.

Remote sensing (RS) can be an important source of information for the study of these animals. A key advantage of RS is its ability to provide information over an animal\'s complete range, but models incorporating RS data are limited by RS\'s ability to detect important habitat features. In this study, we focus on the rare, poorly-understood mountain bongo antelope (Tragelaphus euryceros isaaci) which survives in the wild in isolated pockets of montane forest in Kenya. We hypothesize that mountain bongo habitat is multi-scaled. We analyzed field and RS data (derived from SPOT, ASTER, and MODIS) ranging in scale from 0.02-85.93 ha to test our hypothesis. Important microhabitat features were identified through logistic regression models of vegetation structure data collected in plots (0.04 ha) of bongo presence (n=36) and absence (n=90). Models were selected using an information theoretic approach. We analyzed the correlations between microhabitat (four canopy and four understorey structure measures) and RS variables derived using spectral mixture (SMA) and texture analysis; most ASTER and SPOT variables were significantly related with canopy structure variables (max vertical bar r vertical bar=0.56), but correlations between understorey structure and all but two RS variables were insignificant. Further logistic regression modeling showed that combining field microhabitat (primarily understorey structure variables) and larger-scaled RS measures (ASTER spectral mixture analysis variables aggregated to 450 m (20.25 ha)) provided superior models of bongo habitat selection than those based on field or RS data only. The results demonstrate that: 1) forest canopy characteristics at scales of similar to 20 ha and understorey structural conditions at the micro-scale of 0.04 ha were the most important features influencing bongo habitat selection; 2) models for predicting bongo habitat distribution must incorporate both micro- and macro-habitat variables; 3) optical RS data may characterize important micro-scale canopy variables with reasonable accuracy, but are ineffective for detecting understorey features (unless alternative techniques such as forest structural indices can be successfully applied); 4) RS and field data are both essential for understanding bongo habitat selection. The technique employed here for understanding this rare antelope\'s habitat selection may also be applied in studies of other large herbivores. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The MERIS FR products were derived using a coastal processor (FUB Case-2 Plug-In). We also compared the performance between FUB and standard processor (MEGS 7.4), using reduced resolution (RR) data (1 km resolution) from the open Baltic Sea, and compared the products to sea-truthing data. The optical variables measured for sea-truthing were chlorophyll, suspended particulate matter (SPM), as well as coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM, also termed yellow substances), and the spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient, K-d(490). The comparison of the RR data to the sea-truthing data showed that, in the open Baltic Sea, the MERIS standard processor overestimated chlorophyll by about 59%, and SPM by about 28%, and underestimated yellow substance by about 81%, whereas the FUB processor underestimated SPNI by about 60%, CDOM by about 78%, and chlorophyll a by about 56%. The FUB processor showed a relatively high precision for all optical components (standard deviation: 6-18%), whereas the precision for the MEGS 7.4 was rather low (standard deviation: 43-73%), except for CDOM (standard deviation: 13%). The analysis of the FR data showed that all FR level 2 water products derived from MERIS followed a polynomial decline in concentration when moving off-shore. The distribution of chlorophyll and SPM was best described by a 2nd order polynomial, and the distribution of CDOM by a 3rd order polynomial, verifying the diffusional model described in Kratzer and Tell [Kratzer, S. and Tett, P.

A new Kd(490) and Secchi depth algorithm based on MERIS channel 3 (490 nm) and channel 6 (620 nm) each was derived from radiometric sea-truthing data (TACCS, Satlantic). Applying the Kd(490) algorithm to the MERIS FR data over Himmerfjarden, and comparing to sea-truthing data the results showed a strong correlation (r=0.94). When comparing the FR data to the sea-truthing data CDOM and Kd(490) showed a low accuracy, but a high precision with a rather constant off-set. In summary, one may state that the precision of MERIS data improves by applying the FUB Case-2 processor and the accuracy improves with improved spatial resolution for chlorophyll and SPNI. Furthermore, the FUB processor can be used off-the-shelf for open Baltic Sea monitoring, provided one corrects for the respective off-set from sea-truthing data which is most likely caused by an inaccuracy in the atmospheric correction. Additionally, the FR data can be used to derive CDOM, Kd(490) and Secchi depth in Himmmerfjarden if one corrects for the respective off-set. We will need to perform more comparisons between sea-truthing and MERIS FR data before the new K-d(490) algorithm can be made operational, including also scenes from other times of year. In order to provide a level 2 product that can be used reliably by the Baltic Sea user community, our recommendation to ESA is to include the spectral attenuation coefficient as a MERIS standard product.

It has been suggested that the death and regeneration of trees in small gaps due to lightning may play a critical role in mangrove forest turnover; however, the large-scale quantification of spatial pattern and areas of gaps is lacking for investigating this issue. Airborne light detection and ranging (LIDAR) technology provides an effective way for identifying gaps by remotely obtaining direct measurements of ground and canopy elevations. A method based on an alternative sequential filter and black top-hat mathematical morphological transformation was developed to extract gap features. Comparison of identified gap polygons with raw LIDAR measurements and field surveys shows that the proposed method successfully extracted gap features in mangrove forests in Everglades National Park. There are 400-500 lightning gaps per square kilometer in mangrove forests at the study sites. The distribution of gap sizes follows an exponential form and the area of gaps with sizes larger than 100 m(2) account for 55-61% of the total area of gaps. The area of gaps in the mangrove forest in Everglades National Park is about 4-5% of the total forest area and the average gap formation rate is about 0.3% of the total forest area per year, indicating that lightning gaps play an important role in mangrove forest dynamics.

Improving the accuracy of mapping fuel models is essential for fuel management decisions and explicit fire behavior prediction for real-time support of suppression tactics and logistics decisions. The overall aim of this paper is to develop the use of lidar (LIght Detection and Ranging) remote sensing to accurately and effectively assess fuel models in East Texas. More specific goals include: (1) developing lidar derived products and the methodology to use them for assessing fuel models; (2) investigating the use of several techniques for data fusion of lidar and multispectral imagery for assessing fuel models; (3) investigating the gain in fuels mapping accuracy when using lidar as opposed to QuickBird imagery alone; and (4) producing spatially explicit digital fuel maps. Estimates of fuel models were compared with in-situ data collected over 62 plots. We employ a unique approach to classify fuel models using a combination of lidar height bins and multispectral image data. Different image processing approaches for fusing lidar and multispectral data, such as the Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) and Principle Component Analysis (PCA), were used to improve the overall accuracy of image classification. Supervised image classification methods provided better accuracy (90.10%) with the fusion of airborne lidar data with QuickBird data than with QuickBird imagery alone (76.52%).   According to our results, lidar derived data provide accurate estimates of surface fuel parameters efficiently and accurately over extensive areas of forests. This study demonstrates the importance of using accurate maps of fuel models derived using new lidar remote sensing techniques. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Frontal recession is a poor indicator of negative balance in this region where most glaciers are debris covered, but reduced glacier flow rates provide a valuable warning of stagnation. In-situ measurements of velocity are understandably rare and remote sensing measurements have hitherto been limited by severe topography and lack of suitable data.   In this paper, we compare two techniques to measure flow rates in Everest region glaciers. Firstly, satellite radar interferometry (SRI) has recently become more viable because of improved digital elevation data and precision orbit models, which now allow snapshots of velocities to be retrieved from ERS imagery in the mid 1990s without ground control information. Secondly, feature tracking between Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is found to be successful, even on the small glaciers of this region, because of the patterning associated with debris cover. This technique extends through the 1990s and beyond, the time frame over which velocities can be measured. Using the examples of the Khumbu glacier flowing south into Nepal and the Kangshung glacier flowing East into China from the Everest massif, we compare SRI and SAR feature tracking in ERS images, consider the errors in these techniques, and examine the potential to monitor flow rates across the region.   The techniques are found to be highly complementary and appropriate for monitoring flow rates in this region, suggesting that routine monitoring of Himalayan glaciers is possible. The Kangshung glacier appears to sustain relatively high flow rates of up to 10 cm/day which, along with a convex topographic profile, indicates a healthy glacier not exhibiting significant negative mass balance. In comparison, much of the Khumbu glacier appears to have stagnated, the surface velocity at Gorak Shep is only 20% of a field-based measurement in the 1970\'s, and the concave surface profile confirms the downwasting associated with a debris-covered glacier in recession.

In contrast, the LIDAR classification schedules led to an average classification accuracy of 64.8% and 52.3%, respectively, for the general and detailed vegetation data. Subsequent integration of the LIDAR and digital image classification schedules resulted in accuracy improvements of 16 to 20%, resulting in a superior final accuracy of 91% and 80.3%, respectively, for the three and eight classes of vegetation.

Global and regional active fire and burned area products are currently available from various satellite sensors. While only global products can provide consistent assessments of fire activity at the global, hemispherical or continental scales, the efficiency of their performance differs in various ecosystems. The available regional products are hard-coded to the specifics of a given ecosystem (e.g. boreal forest) and their mapping accuracy drops dramatically outside the intended area. We present a regionally adaptable semi-automated approach to mapping burned area using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. This is a flexible remote sensing/GIS-based algorithm which allows for easy modification of algorithm parameterization to adapt it to the regional specifics of fire occurrence in the biome or region of interest. The algorithm is based on Normalized Burned Ratio differencing (dNBR) and therefore retains the variability of spectral response of the area affected by fire and has the potential to be used beyond binary burned/unburned mapping for the first-order characterization of fire impacts from remotely sensed data. The algorithm inputs the MODIS Surface Reflectance 8-Day Composite product (MOD09A1) and the MODIS Active Fire product (MOD14) and outputs yearly maps of burned area with dNBR values and beginning and ending dates of mapping as the attributive information. Comparison of this product with high resolution burn scar information from Landsat ETM+ imagery and fire perimeter data shows high levels of accuracy in reporting burned area across different ecosystems. We evaluated algorithm performance in boreal forests of Central Siberia, Mediterranean-type ecosystems of California, and sagebrush steppe of the Great Basin region of the US. In each ecosystem the MODIS burned area estimates were within 15% of the estimates produced by the high resolution base with the R-2 between 0.87 and 0.99. In addition, the spatial accuracy of large burn scars in the boreal forests of Central Siberia was also high with Kappa values ranging between 0.76 and 0.79. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

A basic requirement for monitoring such zones is the data on temperature distribution, for which the method of environmental lapse rate and remote sensing with thermal infrared scanners have been used earlier. In this study, repetitive multispectral image data sets acquired from IRS-LISS-III satellite sensor have been used for snow mapping in the Gangotri glacier, Himalayas, and topographically corrected reflectance values have been computed using a digital elevation model. Temperature measurements at a field station have been used for estimating temperature distribution in the snow-covered basin on the corresponding dates. It is shown here that in the melting seasonal snow zone, the topographically corrected mean near-IR reflectance systematically decreases from higher to lower elevation levels, and can be broadly related to the environmental temperature distribution in a restricted range of about 0-5 degrees C. As a large number of satellites routinely provide data in the reflected infrared range, this method appears to have a reasonable potential, at least to provide surrogate data for filling-in gaps in the database, with possible applications in environmental surveillance, runoff modeling, climatic modeling and numerous other snowfield studies.

The study began with an analysis of skyward hemispherical photography to determine canopy characteristics associated with nest sites. It showed that nest sites had significantly less overhead canopy cover and larger maximum gap size than in non-nest areas. These findings led to the hypothesis that brightness variability in high to moderate resolution remotely sensed imagery may be greater at nest sites than in non-nest areas due to larger shadows and greater shadow variability related to these gap characteristics. This was confirmed when, in addition to some spectral band brightness variables, several image texture and spectrally unmixed fraction (shadow, bare soil) variables were found to be significantly different for nest and non-nest sites in Ikonos and Landsat imagery. These significantly different variables were used in maximum likelihood classification (MLC) and logistic regression (LR) to produce maps of potential nesting habitat. Mapping was conducted with Ikonos and Landsat in a local area where most known nest sites occur, and regionally using Landsat data for almost all of the hooded warbler range in southern Ontario. For the local area mapping using Ikonos data, a posteriori probabilities for both the MLC and LR methods showed that about 62% of the nest sites set aside for validation had been classified with high probability (p > 0.70) in the nest class. MLC mapping accuracy was 70% for the validation nest sites and 87% of validation nest sites were within 10 in of classified nesting habitat, a distance approximately equivalent to expected positional error in the data. LR accuracy was slightly lower. Nest site MLC mapping accuracy in the local area using Landsat data was 87% but the map was much coarser due to the larger pixel size. Regional mapping with Landsat imagery produced lower classification accuracy due to high errors of commission for the habitat class. This resulted from a poor spatial distribution and low number of observations of nest sites throughout the region compared to the local area, while the non-nest site data distribution was too narrow, having been defined and assessed (using standard accepted methods) as areas with no ground shrubs. If either of these problems can be ameliorated, regional mapping accuracy may improve. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The first was the aerodynamic resistance-surface energy balance model, and the second was the Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation, where the required surface conductance is estimated from remotely-sensed leaf area index. The models were tested using 3 years of evaporation and meteorological measurements from two contrasting Australian ecosystems, a cool temperate, evergreen Eucalyptus forest and a wet/dry, tropical savanna. The aerodynamic resistance-surface energy balance approach failed because small errors in the radiative surface temperature translate into large errors in sensible heat, and hence into estimates of evaporation. The P-M model adequately estimated the magnitude and seasonal variation in evaporation in both ecosystems (RMSE=27 W m(-2), R-2 = 0.74), demonstrating the validity of the proposed surface conductance algorithm. This, and the ability to constrain evaporation estimates via the energy balance, demonstrates the superiority of the P-M equation over the surface temperature-based model. There was no degradation in the performance of the P-M model when gridded meteorological data at coarser spatial (0.05 degrees) and temporal (daily) resolution were substituted for local ly-measured inputs.   The P-M approach was used to generate a monthly evaporation climatology for Australia from 2001 to 2004 to demonstrate the potential of this approach for monitoring land surface evaporation and constructing monthly water budgets frorn 1-krn to continental spatial scales.

Therefore, knowing the distribution of forest successional stages over a landscape facilitates a greater understanding of terrestrial ecosystems. One way of characterizing forest succession over the landscape is to use satellite imagery to map forest successional stages continuously over a region. In this study we use a forest succession model (ZELIG) and a canopy reflectance model (GORT) to produce spectral trajectories of forest succession from young to old-growth stages, and compared the simulated trajectories with those constructed from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery to understand the potential of mapping forest successional stages with remote sensing. The simulated successional trajectories captured the major characteristics of observed regional mean succession trajectory with Landsat TM imagery for Tasseled Cap indices based on age information from the Pacific Northwest Forest Inventory and Analysis Integrated Database produced by Pacific Northwest Research Station, USDA Forest Service. Though the successional trajectories are highly nonlinear in the early years of succession, a linear model fits well the regional mean successional trajectories for brightness and greenness due to significant cross-site variations that masked the nonlinearity over a regional scale (R-2=0.8951 for regional mean brightness with age; R-2=0.9348 for regional mean greenness with age). Regression analysis found that Tasseled Cap brightness and greenness are much better predictors of forest successional stages than wetness index based on the data analyzed in this study. The spectral history based on multitemporal Landsat imagery can be used to effectively identify mature and old-growth stands whose ages do not match with remote sensing signals due to change occurred during the time between ground data collection and image acquisition. Multitemporal Landsat imagery also improves prediction of forest successional stages. However, a linear model on a stand basis has a limited predictive power of forest stand successional stages (adjusted R-2=0.5435 using the Tasseled Cap indices from all four images used in this study) due to significant variations in remote sensing signals for stands at the same successional stage. Therefore, accurate prediction of forest successional stage using remote sensing imagery at stand scale requires accounting for site-specific factors influence remotely sensed signals in the future.

However, the spatial heterogeneity within the moderate spatial resolution pixel biases non-linear estimation processes of land surface variables from remote sensing data. To limit its influence on the description of land surface processes, corrections based on the quantification of the intra-pixel heterogeneity may be applied to non-linear estimation processes. A complementary strategy is to define the proper pixel size to capture the spatial variability of the data and minimize the intra-pixel variability.   This work provides a methodology to characterize and quantify the spatial heterogeneity of landscape vegetation cover from the modeling of the variogram of high spatial resolution NDVI data. NDVI variograms for 18 landscapes extracted from the VALERI database show that the land use is the main factor of spatial variability as quantified by the variogram sill. Crop sites are more heterogeneous than natural vegetation and forest sites at the landscape level. The integral range summarizes all structural parameters of the variograin into a single characteristic area. Its square root quantifies the mean length scale (i.e. spatial scale) of the data, which varies between 216 and 1060 in over the 18 landscapes considered. The integral range is also used as a yardstick to judge if the size of an image is large enough to measure properly the length scales of the data with the variogram. We propose that it must be smaller than 5% of the image surface. The theoretical dispersion variance, computed from the variograin model, quantifies the spatial heterogeneity within a moderate resolution pixel. It increases rapidly with pixel size until this size is larger than the mean length scale of the data. Finally based on the analysis of 18 landscapes, the sufficient pixel size to capture the major part of the spatial variability of the vegetation cover at the landscape scale is estimated to be less than 100 m. Since for all the heterogeneous landscapes the loss of NDVI spatial variability was small at this spatial resolution, the bias generated by the intra-pixel spatial heterogeneity on non-linear estimation processes will be reduced.

The study is based on radiometric, meteorological, and biophysical measurements obtained during the SMOSREX Experiment (Toulouse, France). Several approaches were followed to evaluate interception effects. Firstly, the analysis of microwave brightness temperature (TB) measurements at L-band indicated that interception increases vegetation emission at both polarisations. Secondly, the use of microwave indices to detect the presence/absence of interception was examined. In particular, a modified polarisation ratio at 50 degrees was found to be well related to the interception status of the standing vegetation. Finally, the vegetation optical depth (T), which pararneterises the extinction across the vegetation layer, was retrieved from the TB observations. It was found that tau increases with the increase in the water content stored within the vegetation and mulch after rainfall. The study highlights the strong impact of intercepted water in otherwise weakly attenuating covers such as grasses. Interception might therefore be an issue to consider in order to improve soil moisture retrieval algorithms from L-band observations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We show it is feasible to model forest canopy scattering using detailed 3D models of tree structure including the location and orientation Of individual needles. An existing structural growth model of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Treegrow, was modified to simulate observed growth stages of a Scots pine canopy from age 5 to 50 years. The 3D tree models showed close structural agreement with in situ measurements. Needles were added to the structural models according to observed phyllotaxy (distribution). Individual trees were used to generate model canopies, which in turn were used to drive optical and microwave models of canopy scattering. Simulated canopy radiometric response was compared with airborne hyperspectral reflectance data (HyMAP) and airborne synthetic aperture RADAR (ASAR) backscatter data. Model simulations agreed well in general with observations, particularly at optical wavelengths where model simulations of low and high density canopy stands were shown to bracket observations. Relatively small sensitivity of observed reflectance to canopy age was captured reasonably well by the simulations. The choice of needle shape and phyllotaxy was shown to have a significant impact on multiple scattering behaviour at the branch scale. In the microwave domain, simulated backscatter values agreed reasonably well with observations at L-band, less so at X-band. L-band simulated backscatter significantly underestimated observed backscatter at younger canopy ages, probably as a result of inappropriate modelling of soil/understory. It is demonstrated that a combined structural and radiometric modelling approach provides a flexible and powerful method for simulating the remotely sensed signal of a forest canopy in the optical and microwave domains. This is particularly useful for exploring the impact of canopy structure on the resulting signal and also for combined retrievals of forest structural parameters from optical and microwave data.

This research deals with how to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for establishing the relationships between MM occurrence and different factor terrain parameters over a representative region of Lebanon. Parameters expressed by: 1-ancillary data like lithology, proximity to fault zone, soil type, land cover/use, distance to drainage line and rainfall quantity, and 2-derived data like slope gradient and slope aspect, were correlated with MM using GIS-approaches. The MM were first detected through visual interpretation of two stereo-pairs of SPOT 4 images (anaglyph) at 10 in resolution. This study indicates, depending on bivariate Remote Sensing and GIS statistical correlations (Kendall Tau-b correlation), that the lithology is the most influencing factor on MM occurrence. It also shows that statistical correlations to mass movements exist best between factors at the following decreasing order of importance: lithology-proximity to fault line, lithology-soil type and lithology - distance to drainage line at 1% level of significance, and soil-land cover/use, slope aspect-land cover/use, and soil-slope gradient at 5% level of significance. These correlations were verified and checked through field observations and explained using univariate statistical correlations. Therefore, they could be extrapolated to other Mediterranean countries having similar geoenvironmental conditions. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The LAI values of 250 boreal coniferous stands were retrieved with the physically based model by inversion from a SPOT HRVIR1 image. The use of three spectral vegetation indices (NDVI, RSR and MSI) in LAI estimation was tested for the same stands. Ground-truth LAI was based on an allometric model which can be applied to routine stand inventory data. Stand reflectances were computed as an average of reflectances of the pixels located within the digital stand borders.   The relationships of LAI and spectral vegetation indices calculated from the SPOT data were very scattered. RSR exhibited the widest range of values (and the highest correlation with LAI), suggesting it to be more dynamic than MSI or NDVI. Inversion of the reflectance model was done twice: first using as simultaneous input three wavelength bands (red, NIR and MIR), then only the red and NIR bands. The aim was to observe whether including the MIR band in the inversion would improve the inverted LAI estimates or if using only the red and NIR bands would result in the same reliability of inverted values. The motivation for examining the influence of the MIR band resulted from several recent studies from the boreal zone which suggest that the pronounced understory effect could be minimized by the inclusion of the MIR band. The LAI values inverted by the model were slightly larger than the ground-truth LAI values. A minor improvement in LAI estimates was observed after the inclusion of the MIR band in reflectance model inversion. The errors in the ground-truth LAI were uncertain and the background understory reflectance was expected to be highly variable. Thus, the quality of the data used may be to a large extent responsible for the observed low utility of the tested channels. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In boreal regions, the results suffer from significant uncertainties because of the effect of snow on NDVI. In this paper, SPOT VEGETATION S10 data over Siberia have been analysed to define a more appropriate method. The analysis of time series of NDVI, normalized difference snow index (NDSI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI), together with an analysis of in situ phenological records in Siberia, shows that the vegetation phenology can be detected using NDWI, with small effect of snow. In spring, the date of onset of greening up is taken as the date at which NDWI starts increasing, since NDWI decreases with snowmelt and increases with greening up. In the fall, the date of onset of leaf coloring is taken as the date at which NDWI starts decreasing, since NDWI decreases with senescence and increases with snow accumulation. The results are compared to the results obtained using NDVI-based methods, taking in situ phenological records as the reference. NDWI gives better estimations of the start of greening up than NDVI (reduced RMSE, bias and dispersions, and higher correlation), whereas it does not improve the determination of the start of leaf coloring. A map of greening up dates in central Siberia obtained from NDWI is shown for year 2002 and the reliability of the method is discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, the counts of the delineated polygons in a region generated overstory stem densities validated to manually photointerpreted stem densities (photointerpreted vs. image-derived stem densities correlation was 0.87). We demonstrate with accurate classification maps and allometric equations relating DBH or crown area to biomass, that these crown-level parameters can be used to generate regional scale biomass estimates without the signal saturation common to coarse-scale optical and RADAR sensors.

To achieve this objective, remote-sensing reflectance spectra and relevant water constituents were collected in 25 1 stations over takes and reservoirs with a wide variability in optical parameters (i.e. 4 <= Chl <= 240 mg m (3): 18 <= Seechi disk depth <= 308 cm), SeaWiFS and MODIS NIR and red reflectances were simulated by using the in-situ hyperspectral data. The proposed algorithms predicted Chl with a relative random uncertainty of approximately 28% (average bias between -1% and -41%), Tile effects of reflectance uncertainties on the predicted Chl were also analyzed. It was found that, for realistic ranges of R-cs uncertainties, Chl could be estimated with a precision better than 40% and an accuracy better than +/- 35%. These findings imply that, provided that an atmospheric correction scheme specific for the red-NIR spectral region is available, the extensive database of SeaWiFS and MODIS images Could be used to quantitatively monitor Chl in turbid productive waters.

The daytime reflected solar irradiance and the surface emission at similar to 3.8 mu m have comparable magnitudes. Using surface radiances and a combination of day-night 2-channel TISI ratios, the similar to 3.8 gm reflectivity is derived. For implementing the TISI method, coefficients for NOAA 9-16 AVHRR channels are obtained. A numerical analysis with simulated surface radiances shows that for most surface types (showing nearly Lambertian behavior) the achievable accuracy is similar to 0.005 for emissivity (AVHRR channel-5) and similar to 1.5 K for LST. Data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is used for calculation of atmospheric attenuation. Comparisons are made over a part of central Europe on two different dates (seasons). Clouds pose a major problem to surface observations; hence, monthly emissivity composites are derived. Additionally, using TISI-based monthly composites of emissivities, a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based method is tuned to the particular study area and the results are intercompared. Once the coefficients are known, the NDVI method is easily implemented but holds well only for vegetated areas. The error of the NDVI-based emissivities (with respect to the TISI results) ranges between -0.038 and 0.032, but for vegetated areas the peak of the error-histogram is at similar to 0.002. The algorithm for retrieving emissivity via TISI was validated with synthetic data. Due to the different spatial scales of satellite and surface measurements and the lack of homogeneous areas, which are representative for low-resolution pixels and ground measurements, ground-validation is a daunting task. However, for operational products ground-truth validation is necessary. Therefore, also an approach to identify suitable validation sites for meteorological satellite products in Europe is described.

This paper reports a study of the NDVI-LAI relationship through the years from 1996 to 2001 at a deciduous forest site. Six years of LAI patterns from the forest were estimated using a radiative transfer model with input of above and below canopy measurements of global radiation, while NDVI data sets were retrieved from composite NDVI time series of various remote sensing sources, namely NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR; 1996, 1997, 1998 and 2000), SPOT VEGETATION (1998-2001), and Terra MODIS (2001). Composite NDVI was first used to remove the residual noise based on an adjusted Fourier transform and to obtain the NDVI time-series for each day during each year.   The results suggest that the NDVI-LAI relationship can vary both seasonally and inter-annually in tune with the variations in phenological development of the trees and in response to temporal variations of environmental conditions. Strong linear relationships are obtained during the leaf production and leaf senescence periods for all years, but the relationship is poor during periods of maximum LAI, apparently due to the saturation of NDVI at high values of LAI. The NDVI-LAI relationship was found to be poor (R 2 varied from 0.39 to 0.46 for different sources of NDVI) when all the data were pooled across the years, apparently due to different leaf area development patterns in the different years. The relationship is also affected by background NDVI but this could be minimized by applying relative NDVI.   Comparisons between AVHRR and VEGETATION NDVI revealed that these two had good linear relationships (R-2=0.74 for 1998 and 0.63 for 2000). However, VEGETATION NDVI data series had some unreasonably high values during beginning and end of each year period, which must be discarded before adjusted Fourier transform processing. MODIS NDVI had values greater than 0.62 through the entire year in 2001, however, MODIS NDVI still showed an \"M-shaped\" pattern as observed for VEGETATION NDVI in 2001. MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was the only index that exhibited a poor linear relationship with LAI during the leaf senescence period in year 2001. The results suggest that a relationship established between the LAI and NDVI in a particular year may not be applicable in other years, so attention must be paid to the temporal scale when applying NDVI-LAI relationships.

Additionally, tropospheric water vapour was measured using a 92-GHz radiometer. This paper presents the theoretical error analysis used to characterize the ozone instrument, and a comparative study of the retrieved profiles with the coincident measurements taken with different instruments. To evaluate and validate the retrieved stratospheric ozone profiles, we have used a set of ozone profiles measured with the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE); while the water vapour data was calibrated against a set of 3-year-radiosounding-balloon data taken by the Argentine National Weather Service. This study also includes a comparison of individual ozone profiles measured using a second ground-based millimetre wave radiometer-spectrometer tuned at 276 GHz from the Max-Planck-Institut fur Aeronomie (MPAE), Germany. During this particular campaign carried out in November 1994, the ground-based measurements were contrasted with two space-born experiments: the Millimetre Wave Atmospheric Sounder (MAS), flown in the NASA-ATLAS 3 mission and the above-mentioned HALOE.   From the error analysis and the comparison tests, it follows that between 20 to 40 km the TROPWA instrument is able to retrieve ozone profiles with absolute errors varying from 10% to 20%, relative errors less than 5%, and with a height resolution, calculated as full width at half maximum (FWHM), varying from 5 to 11 km depending on the altitude. The major discrepancies between the different set of profiles are about +8% to -10% (+0.4 to -0.8 ppmv), mainly due to the coarser height resolution of our instrument. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The SRTM sensor mapped 80% of the Earth\'s land mass with a C-band Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) instrument, producing the most complete digital surface map of Earth. Due to the relatively short wavelength (5.6 cm) of the SRTM instrument, the majority of incoming electromagnetic energy is reflected by scatterers located within the vegetation canopy at heights well above the \"bald-Earth\" surface. Interferometric SAR theory provides a basis for properly identifying and accounting for the dependence of this scattering phase center height on both instrument and target characteristics, including relative and absolute vertical error and vegetation structural attributes.   An investigation to quantify the magnitude of the vertical error component was conducted using SRTM data from two vegetation-free areas in Iowa and North Dakota, revealing absolute errors of -4.0 and -1.1 m, respectively. It was also shown that the relative vertical error due to phase noise can be reduced significantly through sample averaging. The relative error range for the Iowa site was reduced from 13 to 4 in and for the North Dakota site from 7 to 3 in after averaging of 50 samples. Following error reduction, it was demonstrated that the SRTM elevation data can be successfully correlated via linear regression models with ground-measured canopy heights acquired during the general mission timeframe from test sites located in Georgia and California. Prior to outlier removal and phase noise reduction, initial adjusted r(2) values for the Georgia and California sites were 0.15 and 0.20, respectively. Following outlier analysis and averaging of at least 20 SRTM pixels per observation, adjusted r(2) values for the Georgia and California sites improved to 0.79 (rmse=l.l m) and 0.75 (rmse=4.5 m), respectively. An independent validation of a novel bin-based modeling strategy designed for reducing phase noise in sample plot data confirmed both the robustness of the California model (adjusted r(2)=0.74) as well as the capacity of the binning strategy to produce stable models suitable for inversion (validated rmse=4.1 m). The results suggest that a minimum mapping unit of approximately 1.8 ha is appropriate for SRTM-based vegetation canopy height mapping. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The concentration of suspended sediments derived from bottom sediment resuspension or discharge of sediment-laden rivers is highly variable over a wide range of time and space scales. Although there has been considerable effort to use remotely sensed images to provide synoptic maps of suspended particulate matter, there are limited routine applications of this technology due in part to the low spatial resolution, long revisit period, or cost of most remotely sensed data. In contrast, near daily coverage of mediumresolution data is available from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra instrument without charge from several data distribution gateways. Equally important, several display and processing programs are available that operate on low cost computers.   The utility of MODIS 250 m data for analyzing complex coastal waters was examined in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Using simple processing procedures, MODIS images were used to map the concentration of Total Suspended Matter (TSM). A robust linear relationship was established between band 1 (620-670 nm) MODIS Terra 250 m data and in situ measurements of TSM (r(2) = 0. 89; n = 52; MSE=4.74) acquired during six field campaigns. This study demonstrates that the moderately high resolution of MODIS 250 m data and the operating characteristics of the instrument provide data useful for examining the transport and fate of materials in coastal environments, particularly smaller bodies of water such as bays and estuaries.

Results indicate that the new integrated approach could explain 60% of the variation in savanna grass nitrogen concentration on an independent test data set, with a root mean square error (rmse) of 0.13 (+/- 8.30% of the mean observed nitrogen concentration). This result is better compared to the result obtained using multiple linear regression, which yielded an R-2 of 38%, with a RMSE of 0.16 (+/- 10.30% of the mean observed nitrogen concentration) on an independent test data set. The study demonstrates the potential of airborne hyperspectral data and neural networks to estimate and ultimately to map nitrogen concentration in the mixed species environments of Southern Africa.

Adjacent scenes were acquired within 7-25 days apart to minimize variations in the land surface reflectance between acquisition dates. Each Landsat ETM+ scene was independently geo-referenced and atmospherically corrected using a variety of standard approaches. Leaf area index (LAI) models were then applied to the surface reflectance data and the difference in LAI between overlapping scenes was evaluated. The results from this analysis show that systematic LAI retrieval from Landsat ETM+ imagery using a baseline atmospheric correction approach that assumes a constant aerosol optical depth equal to 0.06 is consistent to within +/- 0.61 LAI units. The average absolute difference in LAI retrieval over all 10 image pairs was 26% for a mean LAI of 2.05 and the maximum absolute difference over any one pair was 61% for a mean LAI of 1.13. When no atmospheric correction was performed on the data, the consistency in LAI retrieval was improved by 1%. When a scene-based dense, dark vegetation atmospheric correction algorithm was used, the LAI retrieval differences increased to 28% for a mean LAI of 2.32. This implies that a scene-based atmospheric correction procedure may improve the absolute accuracy of LAI retrieval without having a major impact on retrieval consistency. Such consistency trials provide insight into the current limits concerning surface reflectance and LAI retrieval from fine spatial resolution remote sensing imagery with respect to the variability in clear-sky atmospheric conditions.

This study evaluates five algorithms for mapping subpixel land cover fractions and continuous fields of vegetation properties within the BOREAS study area. The algorithms include a conventional \"hard\", per-pixel classifier, a neural network, a clustering/look-up-table approach, multivariate regression, and linear least squares inversion. A land cover map prepared using a Landsat TM mosaic was adopted as the source of fine scale calibration and validation data. Coarse scale mixtures of five basic land cover classes and continuous vegetation fields, both corresponding to the field of view of SPOT-VEGETATION imagery (1.15-km pixel size), were synthesised from the TM mosaic using a modelled point spread function. Two measures of land cover distribution were used, fractions of fine scale land cover categories and continuous fields of vegetation structural characteristics. The subpixel algorithms were applied using both proximate (<100 km) and distant (>400 km) separation between training and validation regions. \"Hard\" classification performed poorly in estimating proportions or continuous fields. The neural network, look-up-table and multivariate regression algorithms produced good matches of spatial patterns and regional land cover composition for the proximate treatment. However, all three methods exhibited substantial biases with the distant treatment due to the characteristics of the training data. Linear least squares inversion offers a relatively unbiased but less precise alternative for subpixel proportion and fraction mapping as it avoids calibration to the a priori distribution of land cover in the training data. In general, a combination of multivariate regression for proximate training data and linear least squares inversion for distant training data resulted in woody fraction estimates within 20% of the Landsat TM classification-based estimates.

The baseline is 4 years of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellite Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sea surface temperature (SST) data taken from 1997 to 2000. Comparison of upwelling images to simultaneous ERS-2 (European Remote Sensing Satellite) wind fields indicates that the summer monsoon winds constitute a major generation forcing. During the 1997 El Nino, the monsoon winds enhanced the upwelling and induced the upwelling center to move southward. During the 1998 La Nino, the monsoon winds weakened the upwelling. In contrast with the tropical Pacific, in the study area, La Nina implies a warm event and El Nino a cold event. We use empirical orthogonal function (EOF) methods to analyze the spatial and temporal variance of the upwelling. The three principal modes account for 37%, 15%, and 8% of the total variance, respectively. The first EOF modes reveal that the SST variance in the north and south subregions underwent a positive-negative sign switch in summer 1997. The second EOF modes represent the monthly evolution in normal years. The third modes seem to be sensitive to the 1998 La Nina event. Simultaneous TOPEX/POSEIDON and ERS-2 altimeter data provide further evidence for our analysis. Comparison with California coastal upwelling and mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) coastal upwelling indicates that the Vietnam coastal upwelling is the most intensive one. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Passive microwave remotely sensed data have great potential for providing estimates of soil moisture with good temporal repetition on a daily basis and on a regional scale (similar to 10 km). However, the effects of vegetation cover, soil temperature, snow cover, topography, and soil surface roughness also play a significant role in the microwave emission from the surface. Different soil moisture retrieval approaches have been developed to account for the various parameters contributing to the surface microwave emission. Four main types of algorithms can be roughly distinguished depending on the way vegetation and temperature effects are accounted for. These algorithms are based on (i) land cover classification maps, (ii) ancillary remote sensing indexes, and (iii) two-parameter or (iv) three-parameter retrievals (in this case, soil moisture, vegetation optical depth, and effective surface temperature are retrieved simultaneously from the microwave observations). Methods (iii) and (iv) are based on multiconfiguration observations, in terms of frequency, polarization, or view angle. They appear to be very promising as very few ancillary information are required in the retrieval process. This paper reviews these various methods for retrieving surface soil moisture from microwave radiometric systems. The discussion highlights key issues that will have to be addressed in the near future to secure operational use of the proposed retrieval approaches. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

This work describes that the unexplained double-peak feature previously seen on canopy derivative reflectance is due entirely to chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) effects, demonstrating the importance of derivative methods for fluorescence detection in vegetation. Measurements were made in a controlled environmental chamber where temperature and humidity were varied through the time course of the experiments in both short- and long-term trials using Acer negundo ssp. californium canopies. Continuous canopy reflectance measurements were made with a spectrometer on healthy and stressed vegetation, along with leaf-level steady-state fluorescence measurements with the PAM-2000 Fluorometer during both temperature-stress induction and recovery stages. In 9-h trials, temperatures were ramped from 10 to 35 degreesC and relative humidity adjusted from 92% to 42% during stress induction, returning gradually to initial conditions during the recovery stage. Canopy reflectance difference calculations and derivative analysis of reflectance spectra demonstrate that a double-peak feature created between 688, 697 and 710 nm on the derivative reflectance is a function of natural steady-state fluorescence emission, which gradually diminished with induction of maximum stress. Derivative reflectance indices based on this double-peak feature are demonstrated to track natural steady-state fluorescence emission as quantified by two indices, the double-peak index (DPi) and the area of the double peak (A(dp)). Results obtained employing these double-peak indices from canopy derivative reflectance suggest a potential for natural steady-state fluorescence detection with hyperspectral data. Short- and long-term stress effects on the observed double-peak derivative indices due to pigment degradation and canopy structure changes were studied, showing that both indices are capable of tracking steady-state fluorescence changes from canopy remote sensing reflectance.

Closeness of fit(r(2) values) of regression models between satellite brightness data and measured Secchi disk transparency (SDT) decreased with increasing size of the time window between image collection and ground observation of SDT. Use of SDT data collected within +/-1 day of the image date is recommended. but where SDT data are limited. windows up to 7 days yield reasonable results, especially in late summer when water clarity is relatively constant. Average brightness data from at least nine pixels in the deep open area of a take should be used to predict take clarity. but the accuracy of predicted SDT did not improve much as the number of pixels in the area of interest (AOI) increased above this value, A three-coefficient regression model using the TM1/TM3 ratio and TM1 was a consistent and reliable predictor of SDT (r(2) values of .7-.8). A similar relationship involving the MSS1/MSS2 ratio and MSS1 was a reasonable predictor of SDT for MSS data. Efforts to produce a standard prediction equation for SDT applicable to images collected on different dates were not successful, but a simple regression procedure to account for differences in atmospheric conditions among image collection dates substantially decreased the range of coefficients in the regression model.

Although aboveground biomass is difficult to quantify over large areas using traditional techniques, lidar remote sensing holds great promise for biomass estimation because it directly measures components of canopy Structure such as canopy height and the vertical distribution of intercepted canopy surfaces. In this study, our primary goal was to explore the sensitivity of lidar to differences in canopy structure and aboveground biomass in a dense, neotropical rainforest. We first examined the relationship between simple vertical canopy profiles derived from field measurements and the estimated aboveground biomass (EAGB) across a range of field plots located in primary and secondary tropical rainforest and in agroforesty areas. We found that metrics from field-derived vertical canopy profiles arc highly Correlated (R-2 up to .94) with EAGB across the entire range of conditions sampled. Next, we found that vertical canopy profiles from a large-footprint lidar instrument were closely related with coincident field profiles, and that metrics from both field and lidar profiles are highly correlated. As a result. metrics from lidar profiles are also highly correlated (R-2 up to .94) with EAGB across this neotropical landscape. These results help to explain the nature of the relationship between lidar data and EAGB, and also lay the foundation to explore the generality of the relationship between vertical canopy profiles and biomass in other tropical regions.

However, these algorithms are applied at relatively coarse spatial resolutions 1 km, which may subsume significant heterogeneity in vegetation LUE (epsilon(n), g MJ(-1) and, hence, introduce error. To examine the effects of spatial heterogeneity on a LUE algorithm, imagery from the Advanced very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) at 1-km resolution was used to implement a LUE approach for NTP estimation over a 25-km(2) area of corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max Merr.) in central Illinois, USA. Results from several E. formulations were compared with a NIPP reference surface based on measured NPPs and a high spatial resolution land cover surface derived from Landsat ETM+. Determination of E. based on measurements of biomass production and monitoring of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) revealed that E of soybean was 68% of that for corn. When a LUE algorithm for estimating NTPP was implemented in the study area using the assumption of homogeneous cropland and the En for corn, the estimate for total biomass production was 126% of that from the NPP reference surface. Because of counteracting errors, total biomass production using the soybean epsilon(n) was closer (86%) to that from the NPP reference surface. Retention of high spatial resolution land cover to assign epsilon(n) resulted in a total NPP very similar to the reference NPP because differences in leaf phenology between the crop types were small except early in the growing season. These results suggest several alternative approaches to accounting for land cover heterogeneity in E. when implementing LUE algorithms at coarse resolution. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Experimental results showed that though differences between pixels derived with and without PSF effects were small on the average, the PSF generally brightened dark objects and darkened bright objects. This impact of the PSF lowered the performance of a Support vector machine (SVM) classifier by 5.4% in overall accuracy and increased the overall root mean square error (RMSE) by 2.4% in estimating subpixel percent land cover. An inversion method based on the known PSF model reduced the signals originating from surrounding areas by as much as 53%. This method differs from traditional PSF inversion deconvolution methods in that the PSF was adjusted with lower weighting factors for signals originating from neighboring pixels than those specified by the PSF model. By using this deconvolution method, the lost classification accuracy due to residual impact of PSF effects was reduced to only 1.66% in overall accuracy. The increase in the RMSE of estimated subpixel land cover proportions clue to the residual impact of PSF effects was reduced to 0.64%. Spatial aggregation also effectively reduced the errors in estimated land cover proportion images. About 50% of the estimation errors were removed after applying the deconvolution method and aggregating derived proportion images to twice their dimensional pixel size.

The drift effects were found to be greater for bare ground than for vegetated land cover classes, however significant effects were found for most vegetated classes. The magnitude of the orbital drift effect for most global cover types was at least as large as the other errors that affect LST measurement. A simple empirical correction for observation time based on solar zenith angle (SZA) was used to correct the PAL BT time series following Gutman [Int. J. Remote Sens. 20 (1999a) 3407]. The correction from this method was compared with that predicted by a physically based model and was found to differ in the early part of each satellite\'s duty cycle. Finally, the impacts of correction on the effective observation time were analyzed and the simple statistical correction was found to suffer from greater variability than has hitherto been recognized. A modification to the statistical correction to adjust the effective observation time is described. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

These variables play an important role in hydrological, ecological, and land surface-atmosphere interactions. Additional comparisons were done for seven large regions (ca. 10(6) km(2)) centered on the continental land surface areas in order to test for regional differences and to reduce the effect of coastal transition zones on spatial resampling. The mean statistical differences between the TOVS and AVHRR estimates were 5 degreesC for surface temperature, 4 degreesC for air temperature, and 1.5 kPa for vapor pressure deficit. In addition to long-term and spatially extensive ground data sets, these comparisons provide independent validation of different estimation methods using various satellite sensor measurements resampled to comparable spatial scales. Favorable comparison of the two sensors considered here provide greater confidence in the use of these data sets for global monitoring and modeling applications. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

A postclassification approach, based on image segmentation/region classification techniques, was used to map degraded areas. This procedure allowed to save time and to curtail inherent subjectivity commonly involved in visual interpretation, producing accurate land-cover change maps. According to these maps. degraded areas comprise 94.4 ha in 1987. 286.4 ha in 1991, and 404.4 ha in 1994. After \"garimpeiros\" abandoned the region sometime prior to 1994, vegetation soon started recovering mined areas as shown in images acquired in 1995, 1996, and 1999. According to these images, degraded areas decreased to 311.2, 283.7, and 246.2 ha, respectively. Data also indicate that vegetation regrowth is faster near the border of degraded areas, and becomes slower to the center of these areas, where damage process is more intense. Based on the satellite images-derived regrowth rates. it is possible to infer that degraded areas would not be entirely recovered by vegetation by the year 2019. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Radar remote sensing is appropriate for monitoring rice because the areas where this crop is cultivated are often cloudy and rainy. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is thus anticipated to be the dominant high-resolution remote sensing data source for agricultural applications in tropical and subtropical regions. IP also provides revisit schedules suitable for agricultural monitoring. This paper presents the results of a study examining the backscatter behavior of rice as a function of time using multitemporal RADARSAT data acquired in 1996 and 1997. A rice-type distribution map was produced, showing four types of rice with different life spans ranging from 80 days to 120 - 125 days. The Life span of a rice crop has significant impact on the yield, as well as on the taste and quality of the rice, with the longer growing varieties having the best taste and the highest productivity. The rice production of three counties and two administrative regions, totaling 5000 km(2), was estimated in this study. The accuracy of the rice classification was found to be 91% (97% after postclassification filtering) providing confidence that multitemporal RADARSAT data is capable of rice mapping. An empirical growth model was then applied to the results of the rice classification, which related radar backscatter values to rice life spans. These life spans could then be used to sum up the production estimates, which were obtained from agronomic models already in use for rice by local agronomists. These models related the yield of rice to their life span based on empirical observations for each type of rice. The resulting productivity estimate could not be compared to any other existing data on yield production for the study-area, but was well received by the local authorities. Based on the studies carried out in the Zhaoqing test site since 1993, it is suggested that rice production estimates require three radar data acquisitions taken at three different stages of crop growth and development. These three growth stages an: at the end of the transplanting and seedling development period, during the ear differentiation period, and at the beginning of the harvest period. Alternatively, if multiparameter radar data is available, only two data acquisitions may be needed. These would be at the end of the transplanting and seedling development period, and at the beginning of the harvest period. This paper also proposes an operational scenario for rice monitoring and production estimation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

An upwelling intensity, defined by the total heat loss in the upwelling cold water region, is used to determine the relationship between coastal upwelling and the wind stress derived from the ERS-2 (European Remote Sensing Satellite) data. The results show that the upwelling intensity has a good linens relationship with the total alongshore wind stress while it has a fore: correlation with the cross-shore component of wind stress. These results imply that the alongshore wind stress is the main factor to pump the cold water up to the sea surfacer layer. Meanwhile, the satellite infrared images also indicate that the centroid of cold water moved southward from 15 degreesN to 11 degreesN during the observation period. The size of upwelling area changed as well, and finally evolved into a cold jet stretching offshore along 11 degreesN-12 degreesN in the mid-August 1997.

To characterize the spatial variability of N over large fields, traditional methods (soil testing, plant tissue analysis, and chlorophyll meters) require many point samples. Because of the close link between leaf chlorophyll and leaf N concentration, remote sensing techniques have the potential to evaluate the N variability over large fields quickly. Our objectives were to (1) select wavelengths sensitive to leaf chlorophyll concentration, (2) stimulate canopy reflectance using a radiative transfer model, and (3) propose a strategy for detecting leaf chlorophyll status of plants using remotely sensed data. A wide range of leaf chlorophyll levels was established in field-grown corn (Zea mays L.) with the application of 8 N levels: 0%, 12.5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 125%, and 150% of the recommended rate. Reflectance and transmittance spectra of fully expanded upper leaves were acquired over the 400-nm to 1,000-nm wavelength range shortly after anthesis with a spectroradiometer and integrating sphere. Broad-band differences in leaf spectra were observed near 550 nm, 715 nm, and >750 nm. Crop canopy reflectance was simulated using the SAIL (Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves) canopy reflectance model for a wide range of background reflectances, leaf area indices (LAI), and leaf chlorophyll concentrations. Variations in background reflectance and LAI confounded the detection of the relatively subtle differences in canopy reflectance due to changes in leaf chlorophyll concentration. Spectral vegetation indices that combined near-infrared reflectance and red reflectance (e.g. OSAVI and NIR/Red) minimized contributions of background reflectance, while spectral vegetation indices that combined reflectances of near-infrared and other visible bands (MCARI and NIR/Green) were responsive to both leaf chlorophyll concentrations and background reflectance. Pairs of these spectral vegetation indices plotted together produced isolines of leaf chlorophyll concentrations. The slopes of these isolines were linearly related to leaf chlorophyll concentration. A limited test with measured canopy reflectance and leaf chlorophyll data confirmed these results. The characterization of leaf chlorophyll concentrations at the field scale without the confounding problem of background reflectance and LAI variability holds promise as a valuable aid for decision making in managing N applications.

The objective of this study was to take advantage of this data set to improve the geometrical characterization of local soil structure using a fractional Brownian model in order to simulate radar backscattering over agricultural fields. The experimental soil profiles are proved to be locally fractal over a spatial range of a few centimeters (clod structure). The relation between the shape of the correlation function and the fractal dimension is brought to light. A new empirical correlation function is used to adjust the experimental one. It leads to an improvement in the analytic backscattering model Integral Equation Model. Soil profiles, generated with combination between fractional Brownian local structure and global structure with respect to the surface root mean square (rms height) and the correlation length, are used in Moment Method backscattering simulations, which provide results in excellent agreement with radar data.

In this study tee seek to evaluate the role of sensor overpass time when mapping,a SWE by comparing two data sets of 5-day averaged, winter season (December, January, and February) SWE imaging for a ground-validated prairie study area. The first data set is derived from SSM/I morning overpass times, the second from afternoon overpass times. Correlation analysis and modified mean bias error calculations are used to quantify the association between the two data sets. In addition., a series of principal components analysis (PCA) tests have been utilized to quantify the spatial and temporal association between the two time series. Results indicate a strong agreement in SWE retrievals between the two data sets, with little systematic bias that can be attributed to sensor overpass time. Differences in snow-covered areas are more marked, with the morning overpass data consistently estimating greater snow extent. The PCA indicates that the results of time series analysis can be influenced by the choice of sensor overpass time, although the dominant characteristics of the seasonal snow cover evolution are captured by both data sets. Surface temperature data are utilized to illustrate the dependence of algorithm performance on the physical state of the snowpack.

We propose three different methods to estimate the spectra of pure components from a set of unknown mixture spectra. Two of the methods consist in different optimization procedures based on objective functions defined from the coordinate axes of the dominant factors. The third one consists it the design of a neural network whose architecture implements the LSMM principles. The different procedures have been tested for the case of three endmembers. First, were used simulated and real data corresponding to mixtures of vegetation and soil. Factors that limit the accuracy of the results, such as the number of channels and the level of data noise have been analyzed. Results have indicated that the three methods provide accurate estimations of the spectral endmembers, especially the third one. Moreover, the second method, that is based on the exploration of the mixture positions in the factor space, has demonstrated to be the most appropriate when the dimensionality of the data is reduced.

Since different ocean color sensors usually have different band spectral characterization, it is rather difficult to apply the SeaWiFS atmospheric correction algorithm to other sensors if one needs to regenerate lookup tables at spectral bands different from SeaWiFS. In this article, we evaluate the accuracy of the SeaWiFS atmospheric correction algorithm for various ocean color sensors using the current SeaWiFS lookup tables. The focus in on the following satellite ocean color sensors: the Modular Optoelectronic Scanner (MOS), the Ocean Color and Temperatures Sensor (OCTS), and the Polarization and Directionality of the Earth\'s Reflectances (POLDER). These sensors have slightly different spectral bands compared with the SeaWiFS. It was found that, with an appropriate calculation of the Rayleigh scattering contributions at each sensor\'s spectral band and a simple modification in computing the diffuse transmittance of the ocean-atmosphere system, the SeaWiFS atmospheric correction applied to other sensors is as accurate as for SeaWiFS for the solar zenith angles theta(0) less than or equal to 60 degrees.

The aim of this study is to assess the performance of AVIRIS for estimating the sum of chlorophyll a and pheaophytin (CHL) by means of a sensitivity analysis. The irradiance reflectance R(0-) and, subsequently, the radiance at the sensor were simulated from the water constituent concentrations. These simulations enabled the quantification of the change of L-rs due to variations in CHL. Comparison of these changes with the noise equivalent radiance as specified for AVIRIS gives an indication of the accuracy for AVIRIS in estimating CHL. The biooptical model was calibrated for a coastal and an inland water in The Netherlands. From the simulation results for Lake Ijsselmeer, it was concluded that AVIRIS can estimate chlorophyll a with an accuracy of 20% for relative low CHL values of 10 mg m(-3) and 11-12% for CHL values of more than 30 mg m(-3). A ratio of one of the AVIRIS bands around 713 nm to the band at 677 nm is most sensitive for detecting CHL. For the North Sea the most sensitive bands are found around 530 nm. The estimated accuracy for CHL retrieval ranges from 33% for CHL values of 2 mg m(-3) to 10-12% for CHL of more than 12 mg m(-3).

Three others were based on a minimum value technique: minimum value composite of Channel 1 (M(i)VCB1), of Channel 2 (M(i)VCB2) and of albedo (M(1)VCA). The compositing period used was 1 week, and four output channels suitable for identifying burned areas were generated: AVHRR Channel 2 (Ch2), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), surface temperature (T-S), and global environment monitoring index (GEMI). The different compositing criteria were assessed based on their ability to retain burned areas and also on their choice of close to nadir pixels. The separability od burned and unburned areas for each of the compositing criteria was assessed for each of the individual output channels. The criterion that showed best results in terms of separability was M(i)VCA followed very closely by M(1)VCB2; the MVCN criterion clearly showed the least merit of all. An overall analysis of the satellite zenith angles showed that the M(i)VCB2 criterion selected the smallest angles or closer to nadir pixels followed by M(i)VCA, MVCN, MVCTs, and M(i)VCB1. Although impossible to choose a single best compositing criteria in absolute terms, M(i)VCA proved to be the best compromise because it chose near to nadir pixels and performed best in terms of separability between burned and unburned spectral signatures. Future work will determine how to combine different channels (e.g., GEMI, Ch2, T-s, NDVI) for burned area detection, once the M(i)VCA compositing has been performed.

LIBERTY provides a simulation, at a fine spectral resolution, of quasiinfinite leaf reflectance (as represented by stacked leaves) and single leaf reflectance. Single leaf reflectance and transmittance are important input variables to vegetation canopy reflectance models. A prototype parameterization of LIBERTY was based upon measurements of pine needles and known absorption coefficients of pure component leaf biochemicals. The estimated infinite-reflectance output was compared with the spectra of both dried and fresh pine needles with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 2.87% and 1.73%, respectively. The comparisons between measured and estimated reflectance and transmittance values for single needles were also very accurate with RMSE of 1.84% and 1.12%, respectively. Initial inversion studies have demonstrated that significant improvements can be made to LIBERTY by utilizing in vivo adsorption coefficients which have been determined by the inversion process. These results demonstrate the capability of LIBERTY to model accurately the spectral response of pine needles.

Following atmospheric correction, the total remote sensing reflectance signal was partitioned into bottom and water volume reflectance components, using measurements of bottom albedo, water depth, and the diffuse attenuation coefficient at the time of the over-flight. The water components were entered in the Sea-WiFS biooptical model to derive spectral absorption and scattering coefficients. After applying minor algorithm and coefficient adjustments, model results compared favorably with in situ measurements. The biooptical model was subsequently applied to the aircraft imagery to describe the spatial distribution of absorption and scattering. Elevated absorption and particle scattering were observed over the sand bar and shoreward (alpha 555=0.19 m(-1), b555=0.7 m(-1)).

These studies showed that the relation between woody canopy cover and red reflectance varies with geographical location, season, and other factors. This paper models the relation between woody canopy cover and red reflectance, using two simple geometric canopy models developed by Li-Strahler and Jasinski, respectively. Model simulations show that the relation between woody canopy cover and red band reflectance is sensitive to changes in background reflectance, canopy reflectance, solar zenith angle, and topography, which together determine the intercept, slope, and linearity of the relation. The model results provide a theoretical framework that serves as a guide for the most effective conditions for the use of reflectance measurements to estimate canopy cover to be selected a priori. It is predicted that woody canopy cover is best estimated with the use of red band measurements acquired at a solar zenith angle less than 30 degrees in a season when the contrast between background reflectance and canopy reflectance is the largest during the year.

Six Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Local Area Coverage (LAC) arctic scenes are classified into nine classes: water, snow lice, ice cloud, land, thin stratus, stratus over water, cumulus over water, textured snow over water, and snow-covered mountains. Sixty-seven spectral and textural features are computed and analyzed by the feature selection algorithms. The divergence, histogram analysis, and discriminant analysis approaches are intercompared for their effectiveness in feature selection. The fuzzy expert system method is used not only to determine the effectiveness of each approach in classifying polar scenes, but also to further reduce the features into a more optimal set. For each selection method, features are ranked from best to worst, and the best half of the features are selected. Then, rules using these selected features are defined. The results of running the fuzzy expert system with these rules show that the divergence method produces the best set of features, not only does it produce the highest classification accuracy, but also it has the lowest computation requirements. A reduction of die set of features produced by the divergence method using the fuzzy expert system results in an overall classification accuracy of over 95 %.

Mapping the emissivity from satellite data is therefore a very important question to solve. The main problem is the coupling of the temperature and emissivity effects in the thermal radiances. Several methods have been developed to obtain surface emissivity from satellite data. In this way we propose a theoretical model that relates the emissivity to the NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) of a given surface and explains the experimental behavior observed by van de Griend and Owe. We can use it to obtain the emissivity in any thermal channel, but in this work toe have focused on the 10.5- to 12.5-mu m region, where most thermal sensors on board satellites work at present. The model is applicable to areas with several soil and vegetation types and where the vegetation cover changes. From the theoretical model we have developed an operational methodology to obtain the effective emissivity combining satellite images and field measurements. The error of the methodology ranges from 0.5% (due to the experimental limitations of the field methods) to 2% (considering the case in which we have no information about the studied area). To check the general validity of the model, we have validated and applied it in different atmospheric environments and in areas with a different degree of roughness, i.e., from midlatitude (France, Argentina) to tropical (Sahel, Botswana) atmospheres, and from flat (La Mancha, Spain) to rough (Valencia, Spain) surfaces, and we have obtained an error of estimate of 0.6% on the emissivity.', 'UNIV VALENCIA, FAC FIS, DEPT TERMODINAM, E-46100 BURJASSOT, VALENCIA, SPAIN.', 'University of ValenciaRI Valor, Enric/G-5128-2014; Caselles, Vicente/AAA-2835-2019', NULL, 'Valor, Enric/0000-0003-1144-1381; Caselles, Vicente/0000-0002-1612-5495', NULL, NULL, 38, 585, 682, 4, 111, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

The objective was to derive the analytical expressions of radiative transfer in covers that may comprise strongly anisotropic vegetation layers and/or bottom interface.

It results in a multi-layered four-flux model with a fast computer code. Parameters (i.e., r(sm) and r(dm)) that characterize the anisotropic behavior of canopy layers are computed with the same input parameters as the SAIL model. Moreover, at least one additional parameter is used for characterizing the anisotropic behavior of the bottom interface, that is, soil surface. Depending on the LAI (leaf angle index) and LAD (leaf angle distribution) of the upper layer and on the degree of anisotropy of the underlying layers, difference between BRFs that are derived from the four-flux model and from the SAIL model can be large.

In most cases, atmospheric conditions are simulated with a radiative transfer code and sensor calibration coefficients are obtained from preflight sensor calibrations or in-flight calibrations over bright surfaces (such as White Sands, New Mexico, USA, or La Crau, France). Though these procedures are well accepted, there have been few studies specifically designed to validate the accuracy of such reflectance factor retrievals (RFR) for both bright and dark targets. Data from two experiments conducted in an agricultural region in central Arizona were analyzed to quantify the accuracy of RFR from the Landsat TM and SPOT HRV sensors. These data included measurements made with groundbased and aircraft-based four-band radiometers and the NASA Advanced Solid-State Array Spectrometer (ASAS) aboard a C130 aircraft, and TM and HRV images acquired at nadir and off-nadir viewing angles. Results showed that the off-nadir reflectance factors measured using ground- and aircraft-based instruments, including ASAS, were comparable. The RFR from the satellite-based TM and HRV sensors generally resulted in an overestimation of dark target reflectance (up to 0.05 reflectance in the visible) and an underestimation of bright target reflectance (up to 0.1 reflectance in the near-infrared). Even greater error was possible when RFR was based on outdated sensor calibrations, particularly those conducted prelaunch. There was supporting evidence from studies at three sites (White Sands, New Mexico; Maricopa, Arizona; and Walnut Gulch, Arizona) that the Landsat-5 TM sensor sensitivity may have degraded by as much as 20% from the prelaunch calibration. Regarding the potential error in RFR related to recent changes in the processing of Landsat TM data (Level-0 and Level-1) by EOSAT Corporation, we found that the Level-0 data was slightly greater (similar to 2 digital counts) than the Level-1 data for all bands and all targets in our study.', 'USDA ARS,US WATER CONSERVAT LAB,PHOENIX,AZ 85040.

In polygons with timber volumes less than 150 m(3) ha(-1), variations in stand density and background reflectance, identified from MEIS-3 meter imagery, impeded volume classification from TM data. Forest ground call samples and corresponding terrain data, derived from a digital terrain model, were classified according to spatially homogeneous TM data, and the resulting classes were used to analyze the sensitivity of TM data to stand characteristics. From correlation and analysis of variance of classes, TM Bands 4 and 5 were found to be strongly inversely related to stand timber volume (P = 0.01) with TM Band 5 having the greatest dynamic range. Timber volume was strongly related to the bulk reflectance characteristics of the stand including stand height, age, species composition, slope, and aspect, and could thus be estimated from the remote sensing data. A geometric-optical reflectance simulation was used to estimate the relative contributions of forest cover and terrain to stand reflectance. The effects of terrain on the relationship between TM data and volume were small relative to the effects of forest cover. The radiometric basis of these relationships was discussed in relation to simulations of stand reflectance. For stand volumes of less than 400 m(3) ha(-1), simulated stand reflectance in both TM Bands 4 and 5 was sensitive to the proportions of shadow and exposed background in the stand, but had little sensitivity at volumes greater than 400 m(3) ha(-1) TM data may be used to estimate timber volume in other sites that possess similar characteristics to the site assessed here.RP GEMMELL, FM (通讯作者)，GEMMELL & ASSOC,4 EGERTON RD,CAMBRIDGE CB5 8PL,ENGLAND.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 29, 72, 76, 0, 13, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE PUBL CO INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Most hand-held, airborne, and satellite-based infrared sensors measure a composite of both the soil and plant temperatures. The concept proposed here, termed the vegetation index/temperature (VIT) trapezoid, is an attempt to combine spectral vegetation indices with composite surface temperature measurements to allow application of the CWSI theory to partially-vegetated fields without knowledge of foliage temperature. Based on this approach, a new index [water deficit index (WDI)] was introduced for evaluating evapotranspiration rates of both full-cover and partially vegetated sites. By definition, WDI is related to the ratio of actual and potential evapotranspiration; in practice, WDI can be computed using remotely sensed measurements of surface temperature and reflectance (red and near-infrared spectrum) with limited on-site meteorological data (net radiation, vapor pressure deficit, windspeed, and air temperature). Both the VIT trapezoid and WDI concepts were evaluated using 1) a simulation of a two-component (soil and vegetation) energy balance model and 2) existing data from an experiment in an alfalfa field in Phoenix, Arizona.

The main objective was to evaluate the impact of measurement scale and spatial aggregation on the information content and classification accuracies of airborne MEIS-II data acquired over a midlatitude temperate forested environment. The original MEIS-II data were resampled to four spatial resolutions, namely 5 m, 10 m, 20 m, and 30 m. Forest classes were established according to three progressive levels of spatial aggregation. Descriptive statistics (Wald-Wolfowitz runs test, mean and variance) were calculated on transects of pixels representing each forest class delineated on the images at every spatial resolution. A maximum-likelihood classification was also performed for each combination of spatial resolution and aggregation level. The results reveal that, except for the mean, changing the measurement scale and the aggregation level of the classes greatly affects the values of the descriptive statistics. The Z value of the Wald-Wolfowitz runs test decreases with decreasing spatial resolution. The effect is more pronounced when the classes are progressively aggregated. For most classes, the variance decreases with the decrease of spatial resolution. In such cases, the impact of changing the measurement scale is greater than the change of aggregation level. Per-class accuracies are also considerably modified depending on the measurement scale and the aggregation level. Within a particular aggregation level, some classes are better classified at fine spatial resolutions, while others require coarser spatial resolutions. Three major conclusions can be stated from these results: 1) The information content of remote sensing images is dependent on the measurement scale determined by the spatial resolution of the sensor; 2) neglecting the scale and aggregation level when classifying remote sensing images can produce haphazard results having little correspondence with the objects of the scene; and 3) there is no unique spatial resolution appropriate for the detection and discrimination of all geographical entities composing a complex natural scene such as a forested environment.

Since it is often not possible to relate digital number, reflectance, or temperature to subpixel area fraction, the statistical models described are used to determine the effect of pixel size and thresholding operations on the estimate of area fraction for hypothetical geophysical fields.

Provided that the problems of normalization of multidate satellite imageries and seasonal signature variation are solved, the reflectance change of a particular forest stand may be compared to the change predicted by established reflectance successional trajectories. In case of normal forest development, the measured reflectance changes must be close to those predicted. Some kinds of the disturbance-type forest changes (e.g., extensive thinning due to damage) are detectable by optical methods.RP NILSON, T (通讯作者)，ESTONIAN ACAD SCI,INST ASTROPHYS & ATMOSPHER PHYS,2444 TORAVERE,ESTONIA.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 22, 87, 90, 0, 11, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

An intensive soil survey was performed and relationships between soil properties (i.e., drainage class, depth of active zone, water holding capacity, carbon/nitrogen ratio, pH, and sum of bases), species composition, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the Advanced Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) were derived. Results showed that there was great variability in soil properties across the landscape due to complex regional glacial activity and recent alluvial events. Significant statistical differences were observed in species composition and NDVI between soil mapping units and with soil drainage class.

This overestimation occurs because the NDVI produces larger index values for the same vegetation amount over dark backgrounds. Thus, the purpose of this article was to investigate newer vegetation indices that have been developed to minimize soil background effects and to develop a reflectance-based crop coefficient for corn that applies over a wide range of agricultural soil reflectance. Two soils (light- and dark-colored) with red reflectance of 31 % and 13 %, respectively, were selected for this study. Reflectance data of the corn canopy were acquired with four combinations of these soils (light, dry; light, wet; dark, dry, and dark, wet) in trays inserted at the same place beneath the corn canopy. The soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), with an adjustment factor (L) set to 0. 5, was found to adequately minimize soil background influences from sparse to dense vegetation conditions. A linear transformation between the K(cb) for corn and the SAVI was used to convert the SAVI into the K(cr). The maximum difference for this K(cr) between the light, dry soil background and the dark, wet soil background (extreme cases) was less than 6 %. The K(cr) based on the SAVI corrects for a wet soil surface and requires no additional calibration to estimate the basal crop coefficient for corn grown on most agricultural soils.RP BAUSCH, WC (通讯作者)，USDA ARS, NAT RESOURCES RES CTR, WATER MANAGEMENT RES UNIT, AERC, CSU, FT COLLINS, CO 80523 USA.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 30, 157, 178, 0, 13, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Field reflectance measurements of patches of bracken are statistically different from those of other vegetation frequently associated with bracken in eastern Australia. There is, however, a lot of variation in reflectance measurements for any vegetation type, and some patches of vegetation may be misidentified on the basis of their reflectance characteristics. This paper examines variation in reflectance associated with shadowing, zenith angle, and percent cover of bracken. Up to 70 % of the variation in ground-based measurements of reflectance from bracken and associated vegetation was accounted for by variation in shadowing and zenith angle. Variation in amount of shadowing is partially related to the age of bracken fronds, probably because the structure of the bracken canopy changes as fronds senesce. For patches of bracken mixed with other vegetation, there were gradual changes in reflectance correlated with change in amount Of bracken cover. Therefore, it may be possible to estimate the percent bracken cover in a stand based on reflectance measurements, rather than simply classifying stands as \'\'bracken\'\' or \'\'nonbracken.\'\' Such estimates of percent cover may be particularly useful in Australia, where bracken often occurs mixed with other vegetation types rather than in large homogeneous stands. These results are encouraging for the prospect of using remote sensing to look at spread of bracken and lor to estimate biomass for stands of particular frond ages. Correlations between reflectance and proportion of dead bracken and between amount of bracken and reflectance are potentially useful for examining short- and long-term effects of herbicide treatments or other management strategies on large bracken stands.RP TAYLOR, JE (通讯作者)，UNIV NEW S WALES, SCH BIOL SCI, POB 1, KENSINGTON, NSW 2033, AUSTRALIA.RI Taylor, Jennifer/G-1743-2011', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Taylor, Jennifer/0000-0001-6461-0869', NULL, NULL, 28, 11, 11, 0, 3, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

This research was conducted to determine how these variables influence the light environment above, below and adjacent to a leaf.  Leaf spectral properties for big-leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum) were measured in the laboratory and used in the model.  Model results were reported as relative radiant flux (phi-r), defined as a percentage of the light entered into the model.  The model showed that upward relative radiant flux phi-ur from a leaf was highly dependent on the reflectance of the background and the wavelength of light.  The greatest variation in phi-ur was observed in the near infrared (NIR).  The phi-ur also varied depending upon the height of the leaf above the background and the size of the leaf.  Leaves were brightest when placed the farthest distance above the background.  Small leaves reached maximum brightness at lower heights than larger leaves.  Finally, phi-ur varied spatially.  Leaf edges reflected more light than the leaf center except for leaves positioned very close to the background.  Additional studies using the model showed that the intensity of light within a leaf shadow varied spatially, with the greatest downward relative radiant flux phi-dr, occurring directly below the center of the leaf.  Furthermore, phi-dr within the shadow cast by the leaf decreased as the height of the leaf above the background increased.  The rate of decrease depended upon the size of the leaf.  The smaller the leaf, the greater was the change in phi-dr with change in leaf height.  These results imply that NIR canopy reflectance, due to leaf transmittance, may be highly dependent upon the reflectance of its background.  Furthermore, architecturally different canopies may show different degrees of dependence upon background reflectance in the NIR.  These results extend to closed canopies, in which leaf size and spacing may vary the reflectance of the canopy.  Finally, these results suggest that the amount of light scattered to the side by leaves increases the amount of NIR light measured from adjacent, unshadowed backgrounds.RP ROBERTS, DA (通讯作者)，UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT GEOL SCI,AJ-20,SEATTLE,WA 98195, USA.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 23, 22, 23, 0, 5, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

However, these indexes are established at specific station and unsuitable to evaluate the regional drought, which becomes the focus of this study. A novel drought monitoring method using the zenith troposphere delay (ZTD) derived from global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and precipitation is proposed, and a new index, which is named regional precipitation and ZTD index (RPZI), is established. The station-based precipitation and ZTD index (PZI) is first proposed by considering the data selection, expression, multi-time scale and standardization. The RPZI is then calculated by using the Thiessen Polygon method to determine the weighting of each station in the located area. The proposed PZI is first validated in 8 climatic regions of China over the period of 2006-2018 at 801 metrological stations. The RPZI is further evaluated in arid, semiarid, humid, and semi humid areas of China over the period of 2006-2018 and Townsville, Queensland in Australia over the period of 1998-2018, respectively. Comparison results show that the proposed RPZI has a good consistency with the regional precipitation smoothing index (RPSI) when compared with station-based SPEI, station-based PZI, and regional SPEI (RSPEI), and the correlation coefficient is the highest between the RPZI and RPSI with values of 0.81, 0.90, 0.93, and 0.85 in four areas of China, and the corresponding value reaches 0.964 in Queensland, Australia. Such results show the good capacity of the proposed RPZI for regional drought monitoring, which is of great importance for global drought disaster prevention.', '[Zhao, Qingzhi; Liu, Kang; Sun, Tingting] Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geomat, Xian 710054, Peoples R China.

However, the shifts and trends of SPM and potential drivers have not been well investigated across large spatial and temporal dimensions. This study developed a robust machine learning model to generate SPM time series in 269 lakes across China larger than 30 km2 from 2002 to 2021 using MODIS/Aqua imagery. The support vector regression model showed satisfactory performance on SPM retrievals over four orders of magnitude (0.1-1000 mg L-1) (mean absolute percentage error = 26%). The model performance was shown to be insensitive to changes in environmental and observing conditions (e.g., aerosol type and thickness, viewing geometry), based on a radiative transfer simulation model. The long-term MODIS record showed a spatial pattern of lower SPM in the western lakes compared to the shallow lakes of east China. Importantly, the SPM showed a significant decrease in the 21st century (average rate of change of-0.2 mg L-1/decade). The interannual variations in SPM were aggregated into five categories, ranging from lakes with continuous changing patterns to those with reversed changing patterns. The driving factors behind the changing patterns vary between different climate zones and ecoregions. A warmer and wetter climate was associated with decreasing SPM in western lakes, while the decrease in wind speed and reduced possibility of soil erosion were the primary drivers of progressively lower SPM in the eastern shallow lakes. These results not only show a comprehensive picture of the SPM dynamics of lakes in China but also provide new insights into the complex mechanisms that drive SPM spatiotemporal dynamics.', '[Cao, Zhigang; Ma, Ronghua; Duan, Hongtao; Shen, Ming; Liu, Dong; Xue, Kun] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.

In this study, we proposed a method to determine the background area for each drainage outlet and delineate the mixed surface thermal plumes based on 7,172 Landsat thermal infrared images. We further used a deep convolutional neural network integrated with prior location knowledge to extract core surface thermal plumes for 74 drainage outlets of 66 nuclear power plants worldwide. Our final model achieved a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8998 and an F1 score of 0.8886. We found that the mean maximal water surface temperature (WST) increment of the studied plants globally was 4.80 K. The Tianwan plant in China experienced the highest WST increase (8.51 K), followed by the Gravelines plant in France and the Ohi plant in Japan (7.91 K and 7.71 K, respectively). The Bruce plant in Canada had the largest thermal-polluted surface area (7.22 km2). We also provided the dataset, Global Coastal Nuclear power plant Thermal Plume (GCNT-Plume), to describe the long-term occurrence of water surface thermal plumes. Three influencing factors of the water surface thermal plume were further analyzed in this study, including total capacity, drainage type, and location type, which were associated with operating power, drainage method, and geographical features, respectively. Total capacity was more statistically related to the maximum of WST increment under shallow drainage condition. The mean WST increment of shallow drainage was 1.22 K higher than that of deep drainage. Surface plumes larger than 4 km2 frequently occurred in the Great Lakes, while small surface thermal plumes (< 1 km2) were primarily found in estuaries.

Yet much less is known about the relationships between forest structural diversity (i.e., the number and physical arrangement of vegetation elements in a forest) and carbon cycling, and the factors that mediate these relationships. We capitalize on spaceborne lidar data from NASA\'s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) and on-the-ground forest inventory and analysis (FIA) data from 1796 plots across the contiguous United States to assess relationships among the structural and species diversity of live trees and aboveground carbon storage. We found that carbon storage was more strongly correlated with structural diversity than with species diversity, for both forest inventory-based metrics of structural diversity (e.g., height and DBH diversity) and GEDI-based canopy metrics (i.e., foliage height diversity (FHD)). However, the strength of diversity-carbon storage relationships was mediated by forest origin and forest types. For both plotbased and GEDI-based metrics, the relationship between structural diversity (i.e., height diversity, DBH diversity, and FHD) and carbon storage was positive in natural forests for all forest types (broadleaf, mixed, conifer). For planted forests, structural diversity showed positive relationships in planted conifer forests but not in planted mixed forests. Species diversity did not show strong associations with carbon storage in natural forests but showed a positive relationship in mixed coniferous-broadleaf planted forests. Although plot-based structural diversity metrics refine our understanding of drivers of forest carbon balances at the plot scale, remotely sensed metrics such as those from GEDI can help extend that understanding to regional/national scales in a spatially continuous manner. Carbon storage showed stronger associations with plot-based structural diversity than with stand age, soil variables, or climate variables. Incorporating structural diversity into management and restoration strategies could help guide efforts to increase carbon storage and mitigate climate change as nature-based solutions.', '[Crockett, Erin T.

Land subsidence associated with the urban development can lead to serious issues which should be thoroughly understood and carefully managed. To address this challenge, an enhanced polarisation time-series InSAR (Pol-TS-InSAR) processing framework was developed, using the dual polarisation (DP) Sentinel-1 data to integrate information from different polarimetric channels with different weighting during the TS-InSAR deformation analysis. Ninety DP Sentinel-1 images acquired between 2019 and 2022 are analysed using Pol-TS-InSAR to map the land subsidence in Sydney, with the assistance of the GPS measurements. Improvement of measurement points density from Pol-TS-InSAR is observed compared to the single polarimetric TS-InSAR counterpart for all land use types (ranging between 68% and 208%). The com-parison between the Pol-TS-InSAR measurements and GPS measurements shows an absolute mean difference and RMS difference of 0.75 mm/yr and 0.95 mm/yr, respectively, in vertical direction. The results of the ground subsidence analysis revealed that the main subsidence factors in Sydney are related to groundwater extraction, mining activities, underground tunnel construction and landfill. The latter two factors were less well-known prior to this study. In additional to these factors, land subsidence related to high-rise building construction has also been observed, even though the impact seems to be less significant than other factors.', '[Ng, Alex Hay-Man; Liu, Ziyue; Huang, Hengwei] Guangdong Univ Technol, Dept Surveying Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.

However, remote sensing of understory plant communities is challenging due to the obstruction by the forest canopy. In this study, we proposed an automated dense Sentinel-2 time series-based approach for understory plant communities and created maps of four understory classes (i.e., native shrubs of greenbrier and mountain laurel, and invasive shrubs of barberry and the assemblage of mixed invasive) at 10 m resolution in Connecticut\'s deciduous forests in 2020. A harmonic time series model and three years of Sentinel-2 time series from 2019 to 2021 were used to classify understory species based on their unique, intra-annual phenology characteristics. The time series model coefficients captured the subtle phenology differences and created synthetic cloud-free images within a short temporal window in the spring prior to canopy leaf-on (hereafter called \"observation window\"). During the observation window, Sentinel-2 data penetrated the deciduous overstory canopy and observed the unique trajectories of different understory species due to their phenology differences. We also calculated spatial texture features (i.e., mean, second moment, and contrast from gray level co-occurrence matrix) based on the synthetic images created within the observation window to capture the different conditions of leaf growth and distinct spatial patterns within deciduous forests. By using the spectral, temporal, and spatial features as input variables from dense Sentinel-2 data, auxiliary data (i.e., LiDAR and soil drainage layer), a random forest classifier, and a new strategy to iteratively select representative sample (namely ISRS), understory species maps were created with an overall accuracy of approximately 93%, and the user\'s and producer\'s accuracies varied from 39% to 99% for the three mapped understory species and one assemblage of species. The proposed method created an accurate binary map of understory presence with an overall accuracy of 95%, a producer\'s accuracy of 84%, and a user\'s accuracy of 68%. Additionally, we separated the invasive (i.e. barberry and mixed invasive of multi-flora rose, oriental bittersweet, honeysuckle, winged euonymus, and autumn olive) and native (greenbrier and mountain laurel) species with an overall accuracy of 94%. We estimated that the invasive species cover an area of 649.33 +/- 140.59 km(2), which occupied a large proportion (similar to 53%) of the shrub understory in Connecticut\'s deciduous forests.', '[Yang, Xiucheng; Qiu, Shi; Zhu, Zhe; Rittenhouse, Chadwick; Riordan, Dustin; Cullerton, Mari] Univ Connecticut, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.

Mapping of erosion hotspots improves our ability to identify and potentially remediate the most active erosion sources. The topical savannas of the Great Barrier Reef catchments, in northeast Australia, are generating excessive sediment yields, primarily from gully erosion. To reduce the adverse impacts on marine ecosystems, there is an urgent need to identify priority erosion hotspots and implement mitigation measures. While repeat airborne LiDAR surveys allow subtle topographic change detection, they are cost-intensive for catchment-scale applications and their applicability is constrained by data avalability and detection treshold of ground level change. In contrast, satellite-based radar imagery can allow large scale tracking of geomorphic change at high temporal resolution. Here we apply a new method based on Sentinel-1 C-band radar images and Coherence Change Detection (CCD), where large stacks of interferometric coherence images are subdivided with rain gauge time-series for separation of erosion-rich and erosion-free coherence information. After correcting the former with the latter, the resulting corrected coherence maps are compared with differential elevation models derived from multitemporal LiDAR, regional scale gully delineation maps, maps of gullying potential and in-situ field verification. Our results demonstrate the promising potential of this technique in detecting gully erosion hotspots. The coherence loss indicating erosion/deposition is well detected in wide gully morphologies, however, the line-of-sight angle does not allow penetration into narrow linear gullies. Further, CCD detects sheetwash or rill erosion occurring in areas identified as at risk of gully expansion, which is commonly below detection threshold for multitemporal LiDAR datasets. When used with LiDAR-derived geomorphic change mapping and gullying potential maps, CCD allows identification of gully erosion dynamics and forecasting gully evolution and creation, which is critical for supporting mitigation measures.', '[Castellazzi, Pascal] CSIRO, Deep Earth imaging FSP, Environm, Waite Rd, Urrbrae, SA 5064, Australia.

Collecting field data is one of the most labor-intensive and time-consuming tasks in biomass mapping using airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. Building on a LiDAR biomass index (LBI) developed for use with terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data, we successfully developed an improved and robust LBI-based approach to estimate forest AGB at both individual tree and plot levels while minimizing the effort required for field data collection. This approach was tested for larch, birch, and eucalyptus over three forest farms in Northeast China and one in Southern China. The results showed that LBI was highly correlated with the diameter, height, and AGB of larch trees. AGB estimates derived using LBI-based models for the three tree species were close to ground measure-ments at the individual tree level. They explained 81% to 95% of the variance of independent test data not used to calibrate those models. Tree level AGB estimates are required by many applications, but they could not be provided by commonly used plot-based biomass mapping approaches like LiDAR metrics-based regression (LMR) or Random Forest (RF). Calibrated with small fractions of the trees needed to calibrate LMR and RF models, LBI-based biomass models produced plot level biomass estimates comparable to or better than those produced using the two plot-based methods. More importantly, the LBI-based models generalized far better than LMR and RF among the three larch forest farms located hundreds of kilometers apart. These promising results warrant more research on the effectiveness of the LBI-based approach for other forest types and tree species not considered in this study. As LiDAR technology and related algorithms are evolving rapidly, further improvements to this approach might be feasible. A robust LBI-based approach applicable to a wide range of tree species and forest types across the globe will greatly facilitate the use of increasingly better and more affordable ALS data to support REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) and other forest-based climate mitigation initiatives.', '[Du, Liming; Pang, Yong; Bai, Yu; Kong, Dan] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Resource Informat Tech, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.

Given that Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can effectively penetrate clouds and collect images in all-weather conditions during day and night, the complementary use of optical and SAR data can be helpful for remote-sensing measurements and assessments of burned sites. Nevertheless, the widely used burn-sensitive spectral indices hardly help analyze SAR data due to the inherent difference between optical and SAR sensors in physical imaging mechanisms. In this study, we aim to leverage multi-source data for burned area mapping and burn severity assessment by translating SAR images into optical images using ResNet-based Pix2Pix model. Experiments were performed on 8669 pairs of bitemporal Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical patches over 304 large wildfire events in Canada with a wide range of land covers. The translated optical images from SAR data occupied similar spectral properties to real optical observations and the corresponding generated spectral indices (i.e., delta Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), relative dNBR, and Relativized Burn Ratio) also showed high agreement with real optical indices. In terms of burned area detection using the generated indices, their medium values of the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) were over 85%, achieving promising performance that outperformed the SAR-based index. Burn severity maps derived from multi-source data achieved a relatively high Kappa coefficient of 0.77.

Under conditions of climate change and global warming, outbreaks of the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus, L.) are threatening spruce forests and the related timber industry across Europe, and early detection of infestations is important for damage control. Infested trees without visible discoloration (green attack) have been identified using multispectral images, but how early green attacks can be detected is still unknown. This study aimed to determine when infested trees start to show an abnormal spectral response compared with healthy trees, and to quantify the detectability of infested trees during the infestation process. Pheromone bags were used to attract bark beetles in a controlled experiment, and subsequent infestations were assessed in the field on a weekly basis. In total, 977 trees were monitored, including 208 attacked trees. Multispectral drone images were obtained before and during the insect attacks, representing different periods of infestation. Individual tree crowns (ITC) were delineated by marker-controlled watershed segmentation, and the average reflectance of ITCs was analyzed based on the duration of infestation. The detectability of green attacks and driving factors were examined. We propose new Multiple Ratio Disease-Water Stress Indices (MR-DSWIs) as vegetation indices (VI) for detecting infestations. We defined a VI range of 5-95% as a healthy tree, and a VI value outside that range as an infested tree. Detection rates using multispectral images were always higher than discoloration rates observed in the field, and the newly proposed MR-DSWIs detected more infested trees than the established VIs. Infestations were detectable at 5 and 10 weeks after an attack at a rate of 15% and 90%, respectively, from the multispectral drone images. Weeks 5-10 of infestation therefore represent a suitable period for using the proposed methodology to map infestation at an early stage.', '[Huo, Langning; Lindberg, Eva; Bohlin, Jonas; Persson, Henrik Jan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Resource Management, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Swedish University of Agricultural SciencesRP Huo, LN (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Resource Management, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'langning.huo@slu.se', 'Huo, Langning/0000-0001-8432-8609; Persson, Henrik   J./0000-0002-3403-057X; Lindberg, Eva/0000-0002-1792-0773', 'Hildur & Sven Wingquist\'s Foundation for Forest Science Research; SLU   Forest Damage Center; Stiftelsen Seydlitz MP bolagen Foundation;   Stiftelsen Nils och Dorthi Troedssons Foundation', 'This project was funded by Hildur & Sven Wingquist\'s Foundation for   Forest Science Research, the SLU Forest Damage Center, the Stiftelsen   Seydlitz MP bolagen Foundation, and the Stiftelsen Nils och Dorthi   Troedssons Foundation.

The C3S provides access to high-quality climate data through its Climate Data Records (CDRs) of atmospheric, marine and land Essential Climate Variables (ECVs). Global Earth Surface Albedo (SA) satellite-based products are included in the land (biosphere) portfolio. SA is a magnitude which quantifies the fraction of solar energy reflected by the surface of the Earth. This paper details the retrieval methodology and preliminary validation results for global estimates of surface albedo based on Sentinel-3 observations for the C3S ECVs data (C3S SA v3.0). The retrieval algorithm exploits the synergistic use of the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) on-board Sentinel-3 A and B satellites. Firstly, the atmospherically corrected reflectances are generated in the Copernicus Global Land Service framework. After that, the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) inversion module concludes the BRDF model parameters, which are transferred to the angular integration module in order to generate spectral albedo quantities for the selected OLCI (Oa03, Oa04, Oa07, Oa17 and Oa21) and SLSTR (S1, S2, S5 and S6) bands. At the end, the spectral integration module generates broadband albedo quantities in three different standard broadband spectral regions (visible [0.4 mu m - 0.7 mu m ], near infrared [0.7 mu m - 4 mu m] and total shortwave [0.3 mu m - 4 mu m]). Preliminary validation results over 10-months demonstration period (July 2018-April 2019) show, in terms of spatial and temporal consistency, that C3S Sentinel-3 SA global estimates reached in general good agreement as compared to other satellite operational references derived from MODIS (MCD43A3 C6) and PROBA-V (C3S PROBA-V SA v1.0) acquisitions. The comparison with ground data shows similar results to the MCD43A3 C6 comparisons but opposite sign in differences (marginally positive in case of Sentinel-3), with accuracy of 0.005 (3.7%), precision of 0.016 (11.3%) and uncertainty of 0.032 (22.7%). Our results have demonstrated the feasibility to estimate global fields of SA from Sentinel-3 observations, with similar quality of existing operational products. These Sentinel-3 based SA datasets will give the continuity to the existing C3S SA CDR, introducing improvements in terms of spatial resolution (300 m) and spectral information (9 spectral albedos) in contrast to previous datasets based on Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR; 4 km, 4 channels) and Vegetation instruments (VGT; 1 km, 4 channels).', '[Sanchez-Zapero, Jorge; Camacho, Fernando; Martinez-Sanchez, Enrique; Gorrono, Javier] Earth Observat Lab EOLAB, C-Savina 8-A4, Paterna 46980, Valencia, Spain.

This study proposes a satellite-based approach to assess ecosystem resilience to wildfires based on post-fire trajec-tories of four key functional dimensions of ecosystems related to carbon, water, and energy exchanges: (i) vegetation primary production; (ii) vegetation and soil water content; (iii) land surface albedo; and (iv) land surface sensible heat. For each dimension, several metrics extracted from satellite image time-series, at the short, medium and long-term, describe both resistance (the ability to withstand environmental disturbances) and re-covery (the ability to pull back towards equilibrium). We used MODIS data for 2000-2018 to analyze trajectories after the 2005 wildfires in NW Iberian Peninsula. Primary production exhibited low resistance, with abrupt breaks immediately after the fire, but rapid recoveries, starting within six months after the fire and reaching stable pre-fire levels two years after. Loss of water content after the fire showed slightly higher resistance but slower and more gradual recoveries than primary production. On the other hand, albedo exhibited varying levels of resistance and recovery, with post-fire breaks often followed by increases to levels above pre-fire within the first two years, but sometimes with effects that persisted for many years. Finally, wildfire effects on sensible heat were generally more transient, with effects starting to dissipate after one year and overall rapid recoveries. Our approach was able to successfully depict key features of post-fire processes of ecosystem functioning at different timeframes. The added value of our multi-indicator approach for analyzing ecosystem resilience to wildfires was highlighted by the independence and complementarity among the proposed indicators targeting four dimensions of ecosystem functioning. We argue that such approaches can provide an enhanced characterization of ecosystem resilience to disturbances, ultimately upholding promising implications for post-fire ecosystem management and targeting different dimensions of ecosystem functioning.', '[Marcos, Bruno; Goncalves, Joao; Honrado, Joao P.] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, InBIO Lab Associado, CIBIO, Campus Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal.

Such information can be inferred from radiometric measurements in optical and thermal spectral ranges. The Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) presents the advantage to mix spectral information since it associates land surface temperature (LST) with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). NDVI is known to be weakly impact by directional effects, which is not the case of TVDI as the accuracy assessment of LST can be severely hampered directional anisotropy (DA). In this paper, DA feature of TVDI is analyzed using the kernel-driven model Vinnikov-Li (VinLi) that serves to perform through simulations and remove DA. The study uses both airborne and satellite datasets. TVDI was found to be angularly dependent, with a possible uncertainty larger than 15%. Compared against TVDI without angular correction, the normalized results displayed a better correlation with soil moisture content, and the root mean squared error (RMSE) of estimated soil moisture content decreased obviously, from 0.050 m3/m3 to 0.045 m3/m3 for airborne data over maize canopies, from approximately 0.036 m3/m3 to 0.030 m3/m3 for satellite data over cropland canopies, and from approximately 0.032 m3/m3 to 0.028 m3/m3 for satellite data over grassland canopies. The evaluation was carried out using the complied synthetic datasets based on the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy Fluxes (SCOPE) model. These also confirmed the occurrence of significant DAs of TVDIs and good performance of VinLi in reducing DA of TVDI by >50%. Based on the VinLi method, an angular-independent TVDI appears necessary to reduce uncertainties originated from illuminating and viewing geometries for the purpose of agriculture monitoring with possible drought episodes. Although further evaluation is still needed using surface measurements, the outcomes support a confident use of TVDI for observations from satellite and airborne/unmanned aerial vehicle.', '[Bian, Zunjian; Fan, Tengyuan; Dong, Yadong; Cao, Biao; Li, Hua; Du, Yongming; Xiao, Qing; Liu, Qinhuo] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

At the diurnal scale, only geostationary satellites can currently provide sub-daily data at regular intervals, also it can help to minimize data gaps due to clouds at the seasonal scale. However, the potential of geostationary satellites for monitoring photosynthesis has not been explored in depth. In this study, we tracked diurnal to seasonal variations in gross primary production (GPP) using the product of near-infrared reflectance of vegetation and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (NIRvP) over deciduous forests, mixed forests and a rice paddy during the growing season. For this purpose, we generated three levels of reflectance and PAR from Geostationary Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-2A (GK-2A). We examined how NIRvP derived from GK-2A tracked in-situ GPP data collected from five flux tower sites in South Korea. Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) normalized NIRvP agreed well with in-situ GPP over the course of the growing season at hourly (R-2 = 0.68-0.77) and daily timesteps (R-2 = 0.71-0.83). Atmospheric correction and BRDF normalization improved the performance of NIRvP in tracking GPP at both the diurnal and seasonal time scales. Also, GK-2A showed a much higher percentage of available high-quality BRDF data over the whole growing season for all study sites than the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (GK-2A: 85%; MODIS: 39%), especially during the cloudy monsoon period.

Each algorithm was applied to time series of Landsat observations collected within two separate years at six locations around the world, to produce monthly (July 1 +/- 15 days), seasonal (July 1 +/- 45 days), and annual (July 1 +/- 180 days) composite images free of cloud, cloud shadow, and snow/ice. By comparing the composite images to reference Landsat images acquired in the growing season (closest to July 1 within +/- 15 days) for each year, we evaluated the performance of the algorithms in preserving the spectral and spatial fidelity (hereafter referred to as spectral and spatial evaluation, respectively), as well as land cover classification and land change detection (hereafter referred to as application evaluation). The results demon-strated that no single algorithm outperformed all other algorithms in all the evaluations, but that performance depended on compositing intervals and cloud cover. For monthly composites, the MAX-RNB algorithm generally produced the best results in the spectral and application evaluations. For seasonal composites, the NLCD algo-rithm produced the best results in the spectral and application evaluations. For annual composites, the PAC algorithm produced the best results in the spectral evaluation and change detection, whereas BAP produced the best results in land cover classification. The BAP algorithm also produced the best results in the spatial evaluation for all the compositing periods.

Ship wake can not only assist in ship detection, but also invert ship navigation information, which has attracted wide attention. However, most of the work on ship wake detection is still through non-deep learning methods. Limited by factors such as unclear features, complex background interference and insufficient label information in large-scale SAR images, deep learning methods have developed slowly in the field of ship wake detection. In this paper, we propose a lightweight deep learning network for ship and wake detection. In the framework, a YOLO structure based deep learning is implemented to achieve ship and wake classification and localization. For this purpose, we initially create a Gaofen-3 SAR dataset containing about 1000 pairs of ships and wakes. To streamline the deep learning network, based on the background and pixel characteristics of SAR images, we design a combined convolutional module in combination with an attention mechanism, which replaces the convolutional layers in the backbone to extract more diverse feature maps at a low cost. In addition, in view of the geometric features of ship wake, the optimized design is conducted in the target prediction stage, and the angle-related loss function is developed to guide the training of the network, which not only ensures the detection of the ship target, but also greatly improves the accuracy of wake line detection. Experimental results show that the developed lightweight network achieves accurate and stable detection of ships and wakes in the dataset, and it has excellent generalization ability in complex background and weak target detection. The performance is comparable to the state-of-the-art models, where the average precision of ship and wake detection reaches 77.86% and 97.29%, respectively. Particularly, the average angle error between the predicted and actual values of wake lines is reduced by 3.476 degrees. Moreover, the low energy consumption (model size is one-sixth of YOLOv4) and real-time detection (>23.1 FPS) of the algorithm offer great potential for embedded deployment.', '[Ding, Kaiyang; Yang, Junfeng; Wang, Zhao; Wang, Deyi; Wang, Xiaohao; Ni, Kai; Zhou, Qian] Tsinghua Univ, Shenzhen Int Grad Sch, Div Adv Mfg, Tsinghua Campus, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.

There is a lack of effective monitoring of coastal subsidence with high accuracy and high spatial resolution for improving coastal risk assessment and mitigation. This study is the first attempt to integrate satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) methods to investigate the spatiotemporal pattern of coastal subsidence. The study area is around Eagle Point, Texas, a region known for its fast rate of relative sea-level rise in recent decades. From 2006 to 2011, the line-of-sight velocities were up to-33 mm/year based on ascending ALOS-1 PALSAR-1 images. From 2016 to 2021, the vertical velocities were up to-34 mm/ year based on ascending and descending Sentinel-1 images. Additional details of the subsidence pattern were revealed by incorporating the surface difference derived from 1-m airborne LiDAR results. Comparisons of the InSAR-derived velocities from image time series and the LiDAR-derived surface changes from time-lapsed ob-servations were conducted at different spatial levels with linkages to land cover patterns and topography. The results showed that local subsidence rates could vary significantly below the spatial resolution of InSAR results, indicating a valuable role of airborne LiDAR results in extending InSAR results to parcel and building levels and explaining subpixel uncertainties. Also, subsidence appeared to be stronger in vegetated areas than in developed areas and negatively correlated with surface imperviousness. The magnitude of subsidence was not correlated with elevation along selected transect lines. Overall, this study demonstrated the benefits of combining InSAR results with other geospatial datasets to characterize coastal subsidence. In particular, the high vertical accuracy of InSAR results and the high spatial resolution of airborne LiDAR results could be complementary, highlighting the necessity of multi-resolution data fusion to support studies on coastal flood vulnerability, infrastructure reliability, and erosion control.', '[Zhong, Wen; Chu, Tianxing; Tissot, Philippe] Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Conrad Blucher Inst Surveying & Sci, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA.

Consequently, a large literature exists on the classification of water from satellite imagery. Yet, previous methods have been limited by (1) the > 10 m spatial resolution of public satellite imagery, (2) classification schemes that operate at the pixel level, and (3) the need for multiple spectral bands. We advance the state-of-the-art by (1) using commercial satellite imagery with panchromatic and multispectral resolutions of similar to 30 cm and similar to 1.2 m, respectively, (2) developing multiple fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) that can learn the morphological features of water bodies in addition to their spectral properties, and (3) FCN that can classify water even from panchromatic imagery. This study focuses on rivers in the Arctic, using images from the Quickbird-2, WorldView-1, WorldView-2, WorldView-3, and GeoEye satellites. Because no training data are available at such high resolutions, we construct those manually. First, we use the red, green, blue, and near-infrared bands of the 8-band multispectral sensors. Those trained models all achieve excellent precision and recall over 90% on validation data, aided by on-the-fly preprocessing of the training data specific to satellite imagery. In a novel approach, we then use results from the multispectral model to generate training data for FCN that only require panchromatic imagery, of which considerably more is available. Despite the smaller feature space, these models still achieve a precision and recall of over 85%. We provide our open-source codes and trained model parameters to the remote sensing community, which paves the way to a wide range of environmental hydrology applications at vastly superior accuracies and 1-2 orders of magnitude higher spatial resolution than previously possible.', '[Moortgat, Joachim; Durand, Michael; Howat, Ian] Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.

Satellite-derived vegetation indices indicate widespread greening of the surface, often associated with regional evidence of shrub expansion obtained from long-term ecological monitoring and repeated orthophotos. However, explicitly quantifying shrub expansion across large scales using satellite observations requires characterising the fine-scale mosaic of Arctic vegetation types beyond index-based approaches. Although previous studies have illustrated the potential of estimating fractional cover of various Plant Functional Types (PFTs) from satellite imagery, limited availability of reference data across space and time has constrained deriving fraction cover time series capable of detecting shrub expansion. We applied regressionbased unmixing using synthetic training data to build multitemporal machine learning models in order to estimate fractional cover of shrubs and other surface components in the Mackenzie Delta Region for six time intervals between 1984 and 2020. We trained Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) models using Landsat-derived spectral-temporal-metrics and synthetic training data generated from pure class spectra obtained directly from the imagery. Independent validation using very-high-resolution imagery suggested that KRR outperforms RFR, estimating shrub cover with a MAE of 10.6% and remaining surface components with MAEs between 3.0 and 11.2%. Canopy-forming shrubs were well modelled across all cover densities, coniferous tree cover tended to be overestimated and differentiating between herbaceous and lichen cover was challenging. Shrub cover expanded by on average + 2.2% per decade for the entire study area and + 4.2% per decade within the low Arctic tundra, while relative changes were strongest in the northernmost regions. In conjunction with shrub expansion, we observed herbaceous plant and lichen cover decline. Our results corroborate the perception of the replacement and homogenisation of Arctic vegetation communities facilitated by the competitive advantage of shrub species under a warming climate. The proposed method allows for multidecadal quantitative estimates of fractional cover at 30 m resolution, initiating new opportunities for mapping past and present fractional cover of tundra PFTs and can help advance our understanding of Arctic shrub expansion within the vast and heterogeneous tundra biome.', '[Nill, Leon; Boike, Julia; Hostert, Patrick] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.

It can take multiple years for the landscape to adjust to the new topography after the earthworks are completed, with subsidence in the fill areas and uplift in the areas of excavation. Understanding the pattern and extent of this differential vertical movement has great importance for ensuring the structural integrity of any infrastructure built on the site. We therefore studied the spatial deformation field of the YND from January 2015 to December 2018 using satellite synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) technology. Persistent scatterers (PS) and distributed scatterers (DS) were combined in a twotier network to overcome problems with temporal decorrelation of the InSAR phase signals. The derived deformation field was validated with in-situ ground leveling and GNSS measurements, and interpreted using a forward geophysical model. The results indicate that our approach provides a more detailed understanding of the deformation than conventional PSI and SBAS methods. Subsidence of up to 87 mm/yr occurred over about 4.4 km2 of the fill region, and uplift of up to 26 mm/yr in the excavated areas. There is a strong linear relationship between these displacements and prior topographic elevation change. The primary cause of subsidence in fill areas is compaction of remoulded loess. Instantaneous elastic and gradual poroelastic deformation are the main causes of uplift in excavated areas.', '[Zhou, Chaodong; Lan, Hengxing; Li, Langping; Wu, Yuming; Zhao, Xiaoxia; Zhang, Yixing; Yao, Jiaming] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

The nature and magnitude of such impact is largely driven by disturbance intensity. In this study, by integrating field plot measurements collected by the Forest Inventory and Analysis program with time series Landsat observations, we produced the first set of annual forest disturbance intensity map products quantifying the percentage of basal area removal (PBAR) at the 30-m resolution for the conterminous United States (CONUS) from 1986 to 2015. The derived map products revealed that during the 30-year study period, the annual average PBAR values of all disturbed pixels across CONUS ranged from 66% to 70%, and the proportion of those pixels having stand-clearing disturbances ranged from 40% to 58%. High disturbance intensities were concentrated in the Southeastern states from Texas to Virginia and along the Pacific coast and the Cascades in the West. At the national scale, the annual mean PBAR and proportion of stand clearing area (PSCA) values both appeared to follow second order trajectories, with increasing trends at the beginning, decreasing trends towards the end, and turning points around 2003. Overall, there is a net increase of 2% in PBAR and 3% in PSCA from 1986 to 2015. The temporal trends of PBAR and PSCA were also investigated at state and ecoregion levels, with substantial differences found among many states and ecoregions. While states and ecoregions generally follow second order trajectories, the majority had increasing trends throughout much of the study period, reflecting higher disturbance intensities during the later years compared to earlier years. Large increase (>10%) in PBAR was seen in several states (e.g., Virginia, Arkansas, and Minnesota) and ecoregions (e.g., Northern Minnesota Wetlands); however, large decreases (>10%) in PBAR were not observed in any states, and were seen in only one ecoregion, the Blue Mountains in the southeast.

In this regard, first, in the preprocessing step, the data is prepared for entering into the proposed deep network. Then, a hybrid deep convolutional neural network (HDCNN) is proposed which is a combination of the U-net architecture and residual networks. In this network, effective features are generate4d in different scales during the downsampling process from the input DSM and the DTM is extracted during the upsampling process. To rectify the results, a multi-scale fusion strategy is proposed to produce the final DTM by fusing the generated DTMs at different scales and with different spatial shifts. The performance of the proposed approach is analyzed by implementing four different evaluation scenarios in five different datasets. The evaluation results demonstrated significant performance and high generalizability of the proposed approach.

Nevertheless, our understanding of the seasonal dynamics of dryland ecosystem carbon uptake through photosynthesis [gross primary productivity (GPP)] remains relatively limited due in part to the limited availability of long-term data and unique challenges associated with satellite remote sensing across dryland ecosystems. Here, we comprehensively evaluated longstanding and emerging satellite vegetation proxies in their ability to capture seasonal dryland GPP dynamics. Specifically, we evaluated: 1) reflectance-based proxies normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), near infrared reflectance index (NIRv), and kernel NDVI (kNDVI) from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); and 2) newly available physiologically-based proxy solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). As a performance benchmark, we used GPP estimates from a robust network of 21 western United States eddy covariance tower sites that span representative gradients in dryland ecosystem climate and functional composition. We found that NIRv and SIF were the best performing GPP proxies and captured complementary aspects of seasonal GPP dynamics across dryland ecosystem types. NIRv offered better performance than the other proxies across relatively low-productivity, sparsely non-evergreen vegetated sites (R2 = 0.59 +/- 0.13); whereas SIF best captured seasonal dynamics across relatively high-productivity sites, including evergreen-dominated sites (R2 = 0.74 +/- 0.07). Notably, across grass-dominated sites, all reflectance-based proxies (NDVI, SAVI, NIRv and kNDVI) showed significant seasonal bias (hysteresis) that strengthened with the total fraction of woody vegetation cover, likely due to seasonal patterns in woody vegetation reflectance that are unrelated to or decoupled from GPP. Future efforts to fully integrate the complementary strengths of NIRv and SIF could significantly improve our understanding and representation of dryland GPP dynamics in satellite-based models.', '[Wang, Xian; Smith, William K.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.

However, LST may not always provide an adequate boundary condition to simultaneously constrain the soil evaporation and plant transpiration especially under water limited conditions. A refinement to TSEB model by coupling surface soil moisture information to derive the soil and vegetation component temperatures and a new transpiration algorithm was developed (TSEB-SM). The TSEB-SM model was evaluated under a wide range of surface soil water content values and vegetation cover conditions and compared with the performance with the original TSEB model using only LST. While the results showed that the TSEB-SM model produced similar agreement in the fluxes and ET as the original TSEB for the cropland and grassland sites, TSEB-SM model performance was notably improved at the shrub-forest and desert steppe sites with a significant reduction in mean absolute percent difference in daily ET from nearly 65% to 25% and from approximately 50% to 40%, respectively. It also appears to be more reliable in partitioning ET into soil evaporation and plant transpiration when compared to the partitioning using the water use efficiency (uWUE) approach in combination with the eddy covariance measurements. With satellite data such as MODIS LST and leaf area index, and surface soil moisture retrievals from microwave satellite observations, the TSEB-SM model may potentially be a more reliable tool for monitoring regional ET partitioning under sparse canopy cover conditions.', '[Song, Lisheng] Anhui Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Tourism, Wuhu, Peoples R China.

Ongoing climate change increases the risk of this hazard globally due to recession of glaciers leading to formation and expansion of glacial lakes, and permafrost degradation which impacts the stability of glaciers, slopes and moraines. Here, we demonstrate the capability of our approach for monitoring lake outburst susceptibility using time-series of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (S-1 SAR) data. We selected Lunana in the Bhutanese Himalayas as an example region as it is highly susceptible to glacial lake outburst floods and suitable baseline data were available. We used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to calculate average radar backscatter intensity (ARBI) of glaciers, lakes, basins, and moraines. To determine the periodicity of the highest and the lowest radar backscatter intensity, we denoised the ARBI data using a Fast Fourier Transform and autocorrelated using a Pearson correlation function. Additionally, we determined glacier melt area, basin melt area, lake area, open water area, and lake ice area using radar backscatter intensity data. The Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique was used to investigate the stability of moraines and slopes around glacial lakes. The PSI results were qualitatively validated by comparison with high-resolution digital elevation model differencing results. Our approach showed that glaciers and basins in the region underwent seasonal and periodic changes in their radar backscatter intensity related to changes in ice and snow melt. Lakes also showed seasonal changes in their radar backscatter intensity related to the variation of lake ice and open water area, but the radar backscatter intensity change was not periodic. We could also infer lake area change using a time-series radar backscatter intensity data such as the rapid expansion of Bechung Tsho. The PSI analysis showed that all the terminal moraines were stable except Drukchung Tsho. Its terminal moraine showed subsidence at the rate of -5.18 mm/yr. Sidewalls of lakes were also stable with the exception of Lugge Tsho at site 4. Due to the free availability of S-1 SAR data, the efficiency of processing a large amount of imagery within GEE, and the PSI technique, we were able to understand the outburst susceptibility of glacial lakes in the region at great detail. The regular acquisition of S-1 SAR data enables continuous monitoring of glacial lakes. A similar approach and concept can be transferred to any geographic region on earth that shares similar challenges in glacial lake monitoring.', '[Wangchuk, Sonam; Bolch, Tobias] Univ St Andrews, Dept Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.

Based on this model, global wind-sea and swell climate and variability were investigated using 27-year jointly calibrated altimeter data. The climatology of the swell and wind-sea H-s (H-WS and H-SW) are in good agreement with those of the total H-s and U-10, respectively. This is because of the dominance of swells in the World Ocean with respect to both occurrence frequency and energy proportion and the close coupling between wind and wind-seas. The interannual variability of H-WS and H-SW are closely related to some climate indices, but the responses of wind-seas and swells are different for the same atmospheric oscillation because of the large propagation distances of swells. For long-term variability, significant positive/negative long-term trends of H-WS/H-SW were found almost all over the World Ocean. Such opposite trends can be explained by the positive/negative trends of U-10/H-s: a shorter fetch or duration of wind leads to a lower H-s, but a higher U-10 leads to higher wind-sea probability and energy weight. However, large uncertainty still exists in these trends and further exploration is needed.', '[Jiang, Haoyu; Yang, Zheng] China Univ Geosci, Hubei Key Lab Marine Geol Resources, Wuhan, Peoples R China.

Remote sensing can capture LNC, while interrelated traits and spectral diversity across plant species prevent development of transferable LNC assessment models based on leaf reflectance. Here, we developed a new transfer learning method by coupling transfer component analysis with the support vector regression, namely TCA-SVR, to transfer LNC assessment models across different plant species. We benchmarked the performance of TCA-SVR against a well-established partial least squares regression (PLSR) model with five remote sensing datasets on 60 plant species measured from three spectroradiometers with varied spectral resolutions and illumination and viewing angles. The result showed that leaf reflectance presented the high spectral diversity in different spectral regions, plant species, and growth stages. The combination of visible (VIS), near infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared (SWIR) reflectance (e.g. 550-2300 nm) achieved the optimal LNC assessment across all datasets. Results on the testing datasets showed that the transferability of the PLSR models highly depended on the LNC distribution and spectral features, which were associated with the differences in plant species, spectral measurements, and growth conditions between datasets. These differences led to the large variations in LNC and leaf reflectance, which thus produced the overestimations and underestimations of LNC. Compared to the PLSR model, TCA-SVR greatly improved the transferability of the LNC assessment model by reducing the average root mean square error by 36.76%. Further, the implementation of modeling updating can help TCA-SVR learn the features related to the difference in plant species and LNC ranges by transferring samples from the target dataset to the source dataset. Our model updating approach improved the performance of TCA-SVR and only needed 5% of the off-site samples to supplement the source dataset to achieve an effective assessment of LNC. Refining the proposed method with new remote sensing datasets will aid rapid monitoring of plant nitrogen status and may improve carbon-nitrogen interactions in existing ecosystem models.', '[Wan, Liang; He, Yong; Cen, Haiyan] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Biosyst Engn & Food Sci, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.

To dynamically monitor fine particulate matter over large geographic areas, some machine learning methods have been utilized to estimate its concentration using satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD). To improve the estimation of PM2.5 concentration across large areas, a geospatial-temporal joint code is proposed in this paper to characterize the influence of spatial-temporal information hidden in satellitebased aerosol products. This encoding method can reveal the relationship between the PM2.5 concentration and its geospatial location and observation time. Instead of aggregating observation data over neighbors, the method directly encodes the spatial-temporal information as features of the end-to-end gradient boosting model for the estimation of PM2.5. Experimental results of PM2.5 concentration in 2019 across China show that the state-of-theart method is outperformed by the proposed method by a large margin, with R-2 from 0.89 to 0.92, RMSE from 10.35 to 7.89 mu g/m(3), and MAE from 6.71 to 5.17 mu g/m(3).

DEM products covering polar regions are critical remote sensing data sources to provide fundamental terrain information for glaciological studies. It is necessary to provide accurate CFs for DEM specific applications, such as mass balance calculation or the substitution of water values with geoid values in the DEM editing process. However, much less attention is paid to automatically delineate CFs from DEM data. In this study, we propose a DEM-based Automatic CF Extraction method (DACE) to efficiently extract the CFs from DEM data. In DACE, a height-sensitive terrain feature is designed to enhance the contrast between the ice sheet and the ocean by combining elevation and roughness information. To improve the CF extraction performance, a two-category image classification based on game theory is proposed that considers the spatial consistency of the feature image created. For validation, DACE was applied to DEM products generated from the single-pass SAR interferometry mission TanDEM-X (TDM) at different posting sizes (12 and 90 m) and to the optical photogrammetrybased Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica (REMA) with a 2 m posting. The proposed algorithm can achieve a CF extraction accuracy of better than 14, 20, and 70 m for the 2-m REMA, 12-and 90-m TDM DEMs, respectively, when compared with the manually delineated CFs. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively extract the CFs from DEM data. DACE can be used to replace water values and edit the DEMs themselves. The CFs extracted from the DEM data can also be used for glacier mass balance calculation with the DEM-based geodetic method and for the temporal analysis of CF changes when multi temporal DEM data are available.', '[Dong, Yuting] China Univ Geosci, Sch Geog & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.

The ability to generate land cover maps has benefited from free and open access to imagery, as well as increased storage and computational power. The accuracy of the land cover maps is directly linked to the calibration (or training) data used, the predictors and ancillary data included in the classification model, and the implementation of the classification, among other factors (e.g., classification algorithm, land cover heterogeneity). Various means for improving calibration data can be implemented, including using independent datasets to further refine training data prior to mapping. Opportunities also arise from a profusion of possible calibration datasets from pre-existing land cover products (static and time series) and forest inventory maps through to observation from airborne and spaceborne lidar observations. In this research, for the 650 Mha forested ecosystems of Canada, we explored approaches to refine calibration data, integrate novel predictors, and optimize classifier implementation. We refined calibration data using measures of forest vertical structure, integrated novel spatial (via distance-to metrics) model predictors, and implemented a regionalized approach for optimizing training data selection and model-building to ensure local relevance of calibration data and capture of regional variability in land cover conditions. We found that additional vetting of training data involved the removal of 44.7% of erroneous samples (e.g. treed vegetation without vertical structure) from the training pool. Nationally, distance to ephemeral waterbodies was a key predictor of land cover, while the importance of distance to permanent water bodies varied on a regional basis. Regionalization of model implementation ensured that classification models used locally relevant descriptors and resulted in improved classification outcomes (overall accuracy: 77.9% +/- 1.4%) compared to a generalized, national model (70.3% +/- 2.5%). The methodological developments presented herein are portable to other land cover projects, monitoring programs, and remotely sensed data sources. The increasing availability of remotely sensed data for land cover mapping, as well as non-image data for aiding with model development (from calibration data to complementary spatial data layers) provide new opportunities to improve and further automate land cover mapping procedures.', '[Hermosilla, Txomin; Wulder, Michael A.; White, Joanne C.] Nat Resources Canada, Pacific Forestry Ctr, Canadian Forest Serv, 506 West Burnside Rd, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada.

Yet, spatially varying drought impacts on grasslands remain poorly understood as they are driven by complex interactions of environmental conditions and land management. Sentinel-2 time series offer untapped potential for improving grassland monitoring during droughts with the required spatial and temporal detail. In this study, we quantified drought effects in a major Central European grassland region from 2017 to 2020 using a regression-based unmixing framework. The Sentinel-2-based intra-annual time series of photosynthetic vegetation (PV), nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and soil fractional cover provide easily interpretable quantities relevant for understanding drought effects on grasslands. Fractional cover estimates from Sentinel-2 matched in-situ conditions observed during field visits. The comparison to a multitemporal reference dataset showed the best agreement for PV cover (MAE = 7.2%). Agreement was lower for soil and NPV, but we observed positive relationships between fractional cover from Sentinel-2 and the reference data with MAE = 10.1% and MAE = 15.4% for soil and NPV, respectively. Based on the fractional cover estimates, we derived a Normalized Difference Fraction Index (NDFI) time series contrasting NPV and soil cover relative to PV. In line with meteorological and soil moisture drought indices, and with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), NDFI time series showed the most severe drought impacts in 2018, followed by less severe, but persisting effects in 2019. Drought-specific metrics from NDFI time series revealed a high spatial variability of onset, duration, impact, and end of drought effects on grasslands. Evaluating drought metrics on different soil types, we found that grasslands on less productive, sandy Cambisols were strongly affected by the drought in 2018 and 2019. In comparison, grasslands on Gleysols and Histosols were less severely impacted suggesting a higher drought resistance of these grasslands. Our study emphasizes that the high temporal and spatial detail of Sentinel-2 time series is mandatory for capturing relevant vegetation dynamics in Central European lowland grasslands under drought.', '[Kowalski, Katja; Okujeni, Akpona; Hostert, Patrick] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.

However, diffraction events, as well as internal layering, can be also observed. In some cases, the bedrock below glaciers is masked by dense diffractions usually interpreted as the effect of liquid water pockets inside the so-called warm ice. However, the actual physical meaning of such GPR facies is not always obvious, because it can be related also to mixed debris and ice deposits. We adopted a strategy well known in medical sciences and referred as \"differential diagnosis\" in order to infer which is the actual meaning of a high scattering facies imaged within the Eastern Gran Zebru glacier (Central Italian Alps) and, more generally, of all the internal glacier features. In fact, in many cases, there is no direct information to limit the subjectivity of geophysical interpretation; therefore, we provide all the discriminative hypotheses based on both independent and integrated criteria including GPR attribute analysis, imaging effects, reflection analysis, GPR frequency evaluations combined with geomorphological and remote sensing data obtained by two photogrammetric UAV and thermal infrared surveys. On the basis of the differential diagnosis, we concluded that the high scattering zone embedded within the studied glacier is most likely related to a mixture of ice and debris probably formed during a past shrinking phase. Beside this case study, this approach could be helpful in other GPR glaciological surveys, in which the target is related not only to the bedrock detection, but also to a detailed analysis of the internal facies of a glacier.', '[Forte, E.; Santin, I; Gutgesell, P.] Trieste Univ, Dept Math & Geosci, Trieste, Italy.

This is particularly important for studying surface urban heat islands (SUHI) since built-up and natural landscapes are known to have distinct epsilon values. Given the small signal associated with the SUHI compared to LST, accurately prescribing urban and rural epsilon would improve our satellite-derived SUHI estimates. Here we test the sensitivity of SUHI to the epsilon assumption made while deriving LST from Landsat measurements for almost 10,000 global urban clusters for summer and winter days. We find that adjusting the epsilon values from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) dataset based on pixel-level normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) increases the summer to winter contrast in daytime SUHI, a constrast that has been noted in previous studies. Overall, the difference between the two methods of prescribing epsilon, one from ASTER and one after NDVI-adjustment, is moderate; around 10% during summer and around 20% during winter, though this difference varies by climate zone, showing higher deviations in polar and temperate climate. We also combine five different methods of prescribing emissivity to provide the first global estimates of SUHI derived from Landsat. The global ensemble mean SUHI varies between 2.42 degrees C during summer to 0.46 degrees C in winter. Regardless of the surface emissivity model used, compared to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra observations, Landsat data show higher SUHI daytime intensities during summer (by more than 1.5 degrees C), partly due to its ability to better resolve urban pixels. We also find that the epsilon values prescribed for urban land cover in global and regional weather models are lower than the satellite-derived broadband epsilon values. Computing sensitivities of urban and rural LST to epsilon, we demonstrate that this would lead to overestimation of SUHI by these models (by around 4 degrees C for both summer and winter), all else remaining constant. Our analysis provides a global perspective on the importance of better constraining urban epsilon for comparing satellite-derived and model-simulated SUHI intensities. Since both the structural and geometric heterogeneity of the surface controls the bulk epsilon, future studies should try to benchmark the suitability of existing LST-epsilon separation methods over urban areas.', '[Chakraborty, Tc; Lee, Xuhui] Yale Sch Environm, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.

The analysis, besides showing elevated R-RS(lambda) in the blue-green spectral region in the presence of coccoliths, confirms a shift toward the blue of the R-RS(lambda) spectra as the bloom declines and coccoliths accumulate at the surface. Results also document a decreased capability of determining the bloom state in the presence of optically complex waters such as those associated with river runoff.

Asia has been experiencing rapid changes in anthropogenic aerosols during the past two decades due to fast growth in population and economy. It is still an open question how aerosol loadings, represented by aerosol optical depth (AOD), have evolved in this century, particularly during the past decade when China and India implemented a clean air act aiming to improve air quality. Based on Terra aerosol retrievals and aerosol reanalysis, a change point of AOD trend is detected at 2010 in East China versus a persistent increasing AOD trend in the Indian subcontinent with no detectable change point from 2000 to 2019. In East China, positive AOD trend (+0.11 +/- 0.022 decade- 1) is confirmed from 2000 to 2010 (hereinafter the former period) yet negative trend (-0.26 +/- 0.027 decade- 1) is identified from 2011 to 2019 (hereinafter the later period). In the Indian subcontinent, persistent positive trend (+0.04 +/- 0.001) is detected from 2000 to 2019 (hereinafter the whole period). All of these trends are attributed mainly to changes in sulfate aerosols. Further analysis of the aerosol pollution extreme events (APEE; defined as daily AOD over the long-term local 90th AOD percentile) manifest a positive trend (+0.16 +/- 0.029 decade- 1) of the APEEs\' magnitude in East China during the former period yet a negative trend (-0.11 +/- 0.020 decade- 1) during the latter period; the Indian subcontinent demonstrates a positive trend (+0.02 +/- 0.004 decade- 1) during the whole period due to increasing sulfate aerosols. The APEEs have become more frequent (+3.5 +/- 0.53 day month-1 decade- 1) in East China during the former period yet less frequent (-3.6 +/- 0.39 day month-1 decade-1) during the latter period; in the Indian subcontinent, more frequent APEEs (+1.1 +/- 0.25 day month-1 decade- 1) have been detected during the whole period. Consistent with the AOD trends, clear-sky radiation in East China shows a negative trend at the surface (-3.2 +/- 0.67 W m- 2 decade- 1), a positive trend in the atmosphere (+1.4 +/- 0.68 decade- 1), and a negative trend at the top of the atmosphere (-1.8 +/- 0.43 decade- 1) during the former period, respectively; opposite trends with much larger magnitude are seen during the latter period. In the Indian subcontinent, the clear-sky radiation trends during the whole period are -1.4 +/- 0.38, +1.7 +/- 0.31, and + 0.5 +/- 0.16 W m- 2 decade- 1 at the surface, in the atmosphere, and at the top of the atmosphere, respectively. Comparison of radiation trends at clear-sky and all-sky conditions suggests that absorbing aerosols dominate the radiation budget in the atmosphere and the aerosol reanalysis of the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research ans Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) might overestimate the radiation response to clouds. This study provides an up-to-date analysis of the long-term trends in aerosols and their extreme events and radiation in two of the world\'s heavily polluted regions and the results have important implications for assessment of the environmental and climatic impacts of the ongoing clean air acts in Asia.', '[Hu, Zhiyuan; Ji, Zhenming; Dong, Wenjie] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Key Lab Trop Atmosphere Ocean Syst, Minist Educ, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China.

SLSTR data from the `near nadir\' scan are used to produce a set of global, daily active fire (AF) products similar to those produced from MODIS data. The Sentinel-3 AF products are generated in both Near Real Time (NRT) and Non Time Critical (NTC) mode and are expected ultimately to replace those from MODIS Terra when that mission starts to reach its end of life. Middle infrared (MIR) observations are critical for the AF application, and SLSTR has two MIR channels (S7 and F1) based on different detector designs and located at different positions in the instrument focal plane, delivering different dynamic ranges with the same spectral response function. The SLSTR AF detection and FRP retrieval algorithm uses both S7 and F1 channel data, but there are options on how these are combined to generate the final AF products. Past work has shown that MODIS\' AF product characteristics are strongly view zenith angle (VZA) dependent, and since the SLSTR `near nadir\' scan actually extends out to a maximum VZA of 55. (similar to the maximum MODIS VZA), any such view angle dependency may also impact the choice of how the S7 and F1 channel data are combined to generate the SLSTR AF products. Here we use a combination of simulation modelling and analysis of more than 15,000 early SLSTR AF products to study how VZA affects the Sentinel-3 AF product characteristics, and how this varies when the S7 and F1 channel data are combined in different ways. Maximum use of S7 channel data provides an AF product whose statistical characteristics vary markedly with VZA around the near nadir scan. For example, the median FRP extracted from the more than 15,000 products studied varies by around an order of magnitude between the centre and edge of scan positions, a level of VZA-dependency similar to that seen with the MODIS AF products. By contrast, maximum use of data from the F1 channel provides a median FRP that varies only by a factor of similar to 3 over the same VZA range. Our simulation modelling demonstrates that this difference is a result of the area of the F1 channel ground pixel footprint remaining far more consistent around the near nadir scan compared to that of S7, which also leads to minimised F1 pixel oversampling even at high VZA observations. The result is that FRP retrievals for a fire derived using the F1 channel observations are far less sensitive to where in the scan the fire is observed. When generated in this way, the Sentinel-3 FRP product characteristics appear similar to those of the VIIRS AF products, since VIIRS also has a method of minimising pixel area growth away from nadir. We conclude that maximum use of the SLSTR F1 channel observations provides significant benefits to the Sentinel-3 AF product, and that unless there are other reasons not to do so any operational processing to generate the NRT and NTC product versions should consider this option as the default. Our findings also show the value of the novel detector design of the SLSTR F1 channel, whose advantageous pixel footprint characteristics mean that similar designs should be considered for future sensors aiming to support active fire applications.', '[Xu, Weidong; Wooster, Martin J.; Zhang, Tianran] Kings Coll London, Leverhulme Ctr Wildfires Environm & Soc, Dept Geog, London WC2B 4BG, England.

Our results show that Mexico\'s oil and gas sector has the largest discrepancy, with oil and gas emissions (1.3 +/- 0.2 Tg a-1) higher by a factor of two relative to bottom-up estimates-accounting for a quarter of total anthropogenic emissions. Our satellite-based inverse modeling estimates show that more than half of the oil/gas emissions in eastern Mexico are from the southern onshore basin (0.79 +/- 0.13 Tg a-1), pointing at high emission sources which are not represented in current bottom-up inventories (e.g., venting of associated gas, high-emitting gathering/processing facilities related to the transport of associated gas from offshore). These findings suggest that stronger mitigation measures are critical to curbing the anthropogenic footprint of methane emissions in Mexico, especially the large contribution from the oil and gas sector.', '[Shen, Lu; Scarpelli, Tia; Sulprizio, Melissa P.; Zhuang, Jiawei; Qu, Zhen; Lu, Xiao; Jacob, Daniel J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.

Although intensive LAI validation studies have been carried out globally, retrieval accuracy has been assessed only over short time spans and product quality is reported as a constant based on the assumption that it is stationary. However, a preliminary evaluation found a time-dependent signal degradation of the MODIS sensors which may cause the uncertainty of the Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF) product to exceed the preset uncertainty buffer in the retrieval algorithm and result in MODIS LAI quality variation and time-series inconsistency with VIIRS LAI. Therefore, to ensure the reliability of trend-detection studies and to answer the critical question of whether the algorithm configuration is still suitable for the uncertainty level of present BRF product, there is a need for a more comprehensive investigation regarding the performance stability of LAI retrieval algorithm due to model uncertainty and input uncertainties. This paper reports analyses of inter-annual stability and trends of LAI uncertainties (inferred from product quality flag rather than ground-based validation) as well as LAI magnitudes using multi-year (MODIS: 2001-2019, VIIRS: 2013-2019) and multi-site (445 sites) datasets. We found that the quality metrics of the two products are consistent across different biome types and LAI values (R2 ranged from 0.88 to 0.99). In the 19-year MODIS period, we found a significant increasing trend in LAI magnitudes (4.5%/ decade) which agrees with previous reports, while there was no significant trend in product quality. Moreover, quality metrics showed much smaller inter-annual variations than LAI values, which confirms the performance stability of retrieval algorithms and suggests that the configuration of MODIS algorithm is still compatible with the uncertainty of algorithm inputs. Additionally, this study provides support to the \"Greening Asia\" studies by eliminating the possibility that the \"greening\" could be attributed to artificial trends caused by sensor degradation. We also found very small inter-annual variations in atmospheric conditions (e.g., cloud and aerosols), which further assures that the performance stability of retrieval algorithm. Overall, our results demonstrate the robustness of the retrieval algorithm in the presence of changes in input uncertainties. The temporal stability of the algorithm performance indirectly strengthen the confidence in the continuous use of MODIS LAI products either independently or in combination with its successor - VIIRS LAI - to study global and regional vegetation dynamics', '[Yan, Kai; Pu, Jiabin] China Univ Geosci, Sch Land Sci & Tech, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.

Monitoring SM is crucial for many applications and can help to determine the impact of climate change. Therefore, it is essential to have continuous and long-term databases for this variable. Satellite missions have contributed to this; however, the continuity of the series is compromised due to the data gaps derived by different factors, including revisit time, presence of seasonal ice or Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) contamination. In this work, the applicability of different gap-filling techniques is evaluated on the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) SM combined product, which is the longest available satellite-based SM data record. The methods used were linear, cubic and autoregressive interpolation and support vector machines (SVMs). This study focused on Southern Europe and spanned the years 2003?2015. The different methods were applied in the temporal and spatial domains and evaluated using the holdout cross-validation technique. A set of variables was introduced in the SVM model to estimate SM, namely, land surface temperature, precipitation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), potential evaporation, soil texture and geographical coordinates. For the SVMs, several combinations of these variables were considered, including a principal component analysis (PCA) containing all of them. Although the different methods show a generally good performance, the SVM method outperforms the rest. Using the SM of the precedent day (SMt-1) is key to obtain good estimates. The median value of the correlation coefficient (R) obtained with the SVM and the SMt-1 series in the temporal analysis was 0.83, and the RMSE was 0.025 m3m? 3. Similar results were obtained in the spatial analysis, with the best performance (R = 0.88; RMSE = 0.024 m3m? 3) obtained by the SVM using the SMt-1 series and the static variables. The application of PCA to input variables was not beneficial, and the interpolation methods failed when dealing with large spatial or temporal gaps. A validation of the CCI SM series with in situ SM data from four networks located in Spain, France, Germany and Italy was also performed and no substantial differences were observed between results obtained with the original and with the reconstructed series. In addition, best inputs obtained with SVM were used to evaluate the random forest (RF) method in the temporal and spatial domain. This method showed a good ability to estimate soil moisture values in the temporal domain but to a lesser extent than SVM while for the spatial domain it did not seem to be as accurate. Our results confirm that we can efficiently deal with spatio-temporal gaps on observational SM databases using the SVM method and the past time series and soil texture as supporting information.', '[Almendra-Martin, Laura; Martinez-Fernandez, Jose; Gonzalez-Zamora, Angel] Univ Salamanca, Inst Hispano Luso Invest Agr, CIALE, Villamayor, Spain.

An in-situ validation based on the stations from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) and a triple collocation (TC) evaluation are both conducted to assess the accuracy of these RZSM products.

PHC yield diagnostic absorption features in the near, shortwave, midwave, and thermal infrared (NIR-SWIR-MWIR-TIR) ranges. Thus far, the NIR-SWIR range has been primarily exploited for remote sensing PHC detection, whereas the application of MWIR and TIR data has remained underexplored. In this work, we aim to close this gap by using the Spatially-Enhanced Broadband Array Spectrograph System (SEBASS) (7.6?13.5 ?m) to map PHC-impregnated soil substrates. A laboratory experiment was performed to identify the features in pure crude oil samples, in dry/wet mineral substrates, and in their physical mixtures using attenuated total reflectance (ATR) and directional-hemispherical reflectance (DHR) measurements. A similar setting was designed in an open environment and imaged by the SEBASS sensor. Close-range spectroscopy indicated that PHC features between 7 and 15 ?m are subtle in comparison to the features of the mineral substrates, thus hindering direct identification of the PHC spectrally. However, the PHC coating of the grains increased the emissivity of the background features -a finding that was supported by SEBASS data processing using a matched filtering technique. The SEBASS data indicated that besides an increase in the emissivity of the underlying substrates, the presence of PHC also induces a change in the temperature of the contaminated targets. The combination of these two factors highlighted the contaminated sites indirectly. Since the mapping of clean, moist and PHC contaminated sites with TIR data depends on variations in the emissivity and temperature of the targets, the application can be extended to orbital sensors with lower spectral resolution (such as ASTER and ECO-STRESS), enabling the monitoring of larger areas.', '[Scafutto, Rebecca Del\'Papa Moreira; Filho, Carlos Roberto de Souza] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Geosci, UNICAMP, POB 6152, BR-13083855 Campinas, SP, Brazil.

However, the extent of light penetration into the soil sample, also termed soil information depth, is not well understood. In this study a new analytical model that links the particle size distribution and soil reflectance in the near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands of the electromagnetic spectrum is introduced. The model enables the partitioning of measured reflectance spectra into surface and volume (subsurface) contributions, thereby yielding insights about the soil information depth. The model simulations indicate that the surface reflectance contribution to the total reflectance is significantly higher than the volume reflectance contribution for a broad range of soils that vastly differ in texture, mineralogical composition and organic matter contents. The ratio of volume to total reflectance is higher for sandy soils than for clayey soils, especially at longer optical wavelengths, but the ratio rarely exceeds 15%. Therefore, the light reflection from dry soils is predominantly a surface phenomenon and the information depth in most soils rarely exceeds 1 mm. The results of this study reveal an intimate physical relationship between soil reflectance and the particle size distribution in the NIR/SWIR range, which opens a potential new avenue for retrieval of the particle size distribution from remotely sensed reflectance via a universal process-based approach.', '[Norouzi, Sarem; Liaghat, Abdolmajid; Ebrahimian, Hamed] Univ Tehran, Dept Irrigat & Reclamat Engn, Karaj, Iran.

The scattering mechanisms causing radar signatures are usually attributed to surface scattering due to sea surface roughness variations caused by raindrops impinging onto the sea surface and/or by up- and downdraft winds. In this paper, we address another radar signature of rain, which is often observed in C-band (and also in X-band) SAR images, but whose origin has been a matter of debate in the ocean remote sensing community since long time and has not been solved yet. This radar signature consists of areas of very high radar backscatter (bright patches) at co- as well as well as at cross-polarization. This paper aims at providing evidence that it is not caused by surface scattering, but by volume scattering from wobbling, non-spherical, oblate hydrometeors within the melting layer. To this end, we first review the theory of radar backscattering from the melting layer as developed by D\'Amico et al (1098) and then present historic radar backscatter data from the melting layer carried out by ground-based and airborne radars, which validate this theory. Then we show four representative Sentinel-1 SAR images acquired over the sea area close to Hong Kong and a SIR-C/X-SAR image acquired over the Gulf of Mexico, which show pronounced radar signatures of rain (bright patches) at co-polarization (VV) and cross-polarization (VH). The analysis of the SAR images yields the result that within the bright patches the ratio of the radar backscatter at cross-polarization to the one at co-polarization shows the same characteristics as the linear depolarization ratio (LDR) measured by radar meteorologist in radar backscattering from the melting layer. Furthermore, we show that radar signatures of rain due to volume scattering may interfere with co-polarization radar signatures of rain due to surface scattering. Thus, cross-polarization SAR images are better suited to detect radar backscattering from the melting layer than co-polarization SAR images, This investigation is of relevance for ocean surface wind retrieval using C-band SARs, since scattering at hydrometeors in the melting layer can cause significant errors in ocean wind retrieval. Areas with simultaneously high co- and cross-polarization NRCS values of around -10 dB and -20 dB, respectively, have to be flagged as areas where the conventional wind retrieval algorithm cannot be applied.', '[Alpers, Werner] Univ Hamburg, Inst Oceanog, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.

Remote sensing of a(CDOM)(440) enables characterization of ecosystem processes and aids in retrieval of chlorophyll a, a proxy for phytoplankton biomass. Spectrally adjacent band-ratio domains, e.g., blue to green, have previously been applied for remote sensing of a(CDOM)(440) in coastal and oceanic waters with similar results compared to more complex semi-analytical algorithms. Estimation of a(CDOM)(440) from ratios of the most spectrally separated ocean color wavebands (end members), e.g., ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR), termed end-member analysis (EMA), has previously been shown to increase the accuracy of global a(CDOM)(440) retrievals from in-water observations of diffuse attenuation and to enable a unified algorithmic perspective without requiring regional adjustment of internal bio-optical parameters. EMA of above-water observations is evaluated herein, with a focus on coastal and inland waters in which increasing optical complexity and likelihood of bottom reflectance challenge the oceanic algorithms developed for deep and optically simple (case-1) waters. Analysis herein of three independent, in situ, bio-optical datasets indicates significant correlation between a(CDOM)(440) and end-member band ratios (next-generation 320 and 780 nm or legacy 412 and 670 nm ratios) with a coefficient of determination, R-2, of 0.87 (log-scale) or higher based on a dataset spanning the dynamic range of global, conservative water bodies. For applicable wavelengths, EMA algorithms are shown to agree with case-1 relationships and to produce consistent log-scale uncertainties across more than three orders of magnitude in a(CDOM)(440) values (0.001-2.305 m(-1)). EMA using UV and NIR wavelengths (320 and 780 nm) is applied to low-altitude airborne observations and satisfies 25% uncertainty based on unbiased percent differences (UPDs) within each of three dissimilar match-up sites ranging in a(CDOM)(440) from 0.02-0.57 m(-1). Results demonstrate that EMA is a useful and robust approach for the remote sensing of a(CDOM)(440) in coastal and inland waters, which are generally shallower, contain more optically complex environments, and span a greater range in a(CDOM)(440) than oceanic waters.', '[Houskeeper, Henry F.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, 315 Portola Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.

The identification of changes in urban settlements is of great interest for damage assessment after natural disasters, cadastral mapping and monitoring urban development or illeg.   Satellite remote sensing is useful in this scenario and SAR data is attractive due to its wide and ubiquitous coverage, the day and night all-weather availability, the exact repetition of the acquisition geometry, the repeated illumination and the sensitivity to slight changes in the geometrical structure of the targets in the scene.   This sensibility is an advantage, but turns into a drawback especially in an urban environment where every subtle change may cause an unwanted detection.   This environment is indeed one of the most challenging for the detection of those changes that are of any real interest since these events are masked by thousands of irrelevant detections.   This paper tackle this problem with a combination of an improved, high-resolution coherent change detection technique called M-CCD and with a GIS post-processing. The result is a map of changes affecting buildings that are of a significant scale and consequently of a certain interest in an urban environment.   In this contribution, the complete workflow is detailed and an assessment of the detected changes is done with high resolution optical images through visual photo-interpretation.

Spaceborne hyperspectral observations, such as those from NASA\'s Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) mission, show promise for meeting this need, yet there are surprisingly few validation studies of AIRS near-surface atmospheric state retrievals. In this study, we use triple collocation to validate AIRS Level 3 retrievals of near-surface atmospheric state over land using twelve years of gridded station observations and two reanalyses. Deseasonalized AIRS retrievals correlate well with deseasonalized ground observations outside the tropics, but correlate less well in the tropics. Lower temporal sensitivity near the surface in the tropics contributes to the lower correlation for near-surface air temperature and is consistent with known physics of the tropical atmosphere, in which temperatures outside the boundary layer (which dominate the AIRS retrieval signal) are poorly correlated with those near the surface. Retrievals in the tropics may also be more susceptible to errors in cloud-clearing algorithms, and to uncertainty in surface emissivity. Since ET is greatest in the tropics, and tropical measurement networks are particularly sparse, this work motivates new approaches for measuring ET in the tropics.', '[Sun, Jing; Wang, Yan; Lu, Hui; Yang, Kun; Li, Yishan] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.

OCO-3 combines the flight spare spectrometer from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) mission, which has been in operation since 2014, with a new Pointing Mirror Assembly (PMA) that facilitates observations of non-nadir targets from the nadir-oriented ISS platform. The PMA is a new feature of OCO-3, which is being used to collect data in all science modes, including nadir (ND), sun-glint (GL), target (TG), and the new snapshot area mapping (SAM) mode.   This work provides an initial assessment of the OCO-3 instrument and algorithm performance, highlighting results from the first 8 months of operations spanning August 2019 through March 2020. During the In-Orbit Checkout (IOC) phase, critical systems such as power and cooling were verified, after which the OCO-3 spectrometer and PMA were subjected to a series of rigorous tests. First light of the OCO-3 spectrometer was on 26 June 2019, with full science operations beginning on 6 August 2019. The OCO-3 spectrometer on-orbit performance is consistent with that seen during preflight testing. Signal to noise ratios are in the expected range needed for high quality retrievals of the column-averaged carbon dioxide (CO2) dry-air mole fraction (XCO2) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), which will be used to help quantify and constrain the global carbon cycle.   The first public release of OCO-3 Level 2 (L2) data products, called \"vEarly\", is being distributed by NASA\'s Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC). The intent of the vEarly product is to evaluate early mission performance, facilitate comparisons with OCO-2 products, and identify key areas to improve for the next data release. The vEarly XCO2 exhibits a root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of similar or equal to 1, 1, 2 ppm versus a truth proxy for nadir-land, TG&SAM, and glint-water observations, respectively. The vEarly SIF shows a correlation with OCO-2 measurements of > 0.9 for highly coincident soundings. Overall, the Level 2 SIF and XCO2 products look very promising, with performance comparable to OCO-2.

Here, a three-layer model of air, vegetation cover, and soil is considered. In practice, the surface reflectivity (Gamma) along with its statistics derived from the CYGNSS data and the ancillary vegetation opacity (tau) data from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) are employed. The expression for empirically retrieving SM from tau, Gamma and its corresponding statistics are determined through the linear regression technique. The CYGNSS data collected over the land surfaces within +/- 37 degrees (latitude) during the whole year of 2018 are investigated. The reference SM data are obtained from SMAP, and are regarded as ground-truth in this work. Validation and assessment are performed on the pan-tropical daily data collected throughout the annual circle at a resolution of 36 x 36 km(2). Experimental evaluation demonstrates good consistency between the SM derived from CYGNSS data and the ground-truth, with a correlation coefficient of 0.80 and a root-mean-square error of 0.07 cm(3)/cm(3). This method succeeds in providing SM estimations on a pan-tropical scale that does not rely on ongoing knowledge of SM and merely employs the least ancillary data. Furthermore, the intense temporal and spatial coverages of CYGNSS SM results are also illustrated. The use of CYGNSS SM significantly enhances the pan-tropical coverage of SMAP SM by about 22% on average.

Constructing a remote sensing model of aquatic vegetation can deepen our understanding of the spectral characteristics and directional reflection characteristics of the aquatic vegetation canopy under various environmental conditions. However, the existing aquatic vegetation models are limited to continuously distributed canopies. This paper proposes an aquatic-vegetation-geometric-optical (AVGO) model at canopy scale for discrete aquatic vegetation. After dividing the reflectance of water background into specular components and diffuse components, the reflectances of all reflecting surfaces are classified into different reflectance components based on the differences in their materials and on whether the reflectors are illuminated by direct sunlight. Then the scene bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) is regarded as an area-weighted sum of different reflectance components. Detailed verifications were conducted to ensure that the simulation model operates as intended. The performance of the AVGO model was qualitatively validated with the WCRM model and showed the physical plausibility of the model prediction. Quantitative validations against an artificially designed experiment were consistent with the bidirectional reflectance and the nadir-viewed spectral reflectance. This model can be used for canopy modeling of discrete emergent or submerged aquatic vegetation. Potential applications include retrieval of biophysical or biochemical parameters and aquatic vegetation abundance based on hyperspectral data.', '[Zhou, Guanhua; Yang, Song] Beihang Univ, Sch Instrumentat Sci & Optoelect Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.

In this study, a method is proposed to detect the spatiotemporal changes in drought characteristics, which show the effects of anti-drought measures on drought mitigation. Two agricultural drought mitigation evaluation indices are proposed, the agricultural drought frequency change (ADFC) and agricultural drought area change (ADAC), which are calculated by combining the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and vegetation health index (VHI), two widely used drought monitoring indices. The PDSI and VHI represent the natural and actual agricultural drought severity under natural and actual conditions respectively, and their differences in drought frequency and affected area reflect the level of anti-drought measures in mitigating agricultural drought. The feasibility of using ADFC and ADAC to quantify the effects of anti-drought measures for agriculture is explored using data from six typical agricultural provinces in the North China Plain and Northeast China. The results show that ADFC and ADAC could reflect both the spatiotemporal changes in agricultural drought characteristics and the influence of anti-drought measures on agricultural drought. The trend of the drought mitigation index is consistent with agricultural activity statistics. These two indices could be further used to evaluate the effects of different anti-drought methods and aid in defeating agricultural drought across many countries.', '[Wu, Bingfang; Ma, Zonghan; Yan, Nana] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

Cloud and shadows, combined with low satellite repeat cycles, reduce surface observation availability. In addition, only a single year of data can be used where there is high inter-annual variation, for example, over many croplands. These factors reduce the ability to fit time series models and reduce model fitting accuracy. In solution, we propose a novel fill-and-fit (FF) approach for application to medium resolution satellite time series. In the \'fill\' step, gaps are filled using a recently published algorithm developed to fill large-area gaps in satellite time series using no other satellite data. In the \'fit\' step, a linear harmonic model is fitted to the gap-filled time series. The FF approach, and the conventional harmonic model fitting without gap filling, termed the F approach, are demonstrated using seven months of Landsat-7 and -8 surface reflectance Analysis Ready Data (ARD) over agricultural regions in North Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, and Kansas. Synthetic model-predicted reflectance for days through the growing season are examined, and assessed quantitatively by comparison with an independent Landsat surface reflectance data set. The six Landsat reflective band root-mean-square difference (RMSD) between the predicted and the independent reflectance, considering millions of pixel observations for each ARD tile, show that the FF approach is more accurate than the F approach. The mean FF RMSD values varied from 0.025 to 0.026 for the four tiles, whereas the mean F RMSD values varied from 0.026 to 0.047. These mean FF RMSD values are< 0.03 which is comparable to the uncertainty specification for the Landsat 8 OLI TOA reflectance, but greater than the atmospheric correction uncertainty in any Landsat 8 OLI band. The greatest RMSD values were found over the Minnesota tile and occurred due to a long period of missing data early in the growing season, and the smallest RMSD values were found for the Kansas tile because of the high availability of clear surface observations. The F approach could not be applied where there were insufficient clear surface observations to fit the model, and where the model was applied, the fitting was often sensitive to issues including gaps in the Landsat time series and the presence of undetected cloud- and shadow-contaminated observations. The FF approach could be applied to every ARD tile pixel location and the predicted reflectance was spatially-coherent and natural looking. Examples are shown that illustrate the potential of using FF predicted synthetic reflectance time series for land surface monitoring.', '[Yan, Lin; Roy, David P.] Ctr Global Change & Earth Observat, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA.

Active sensor systems, such as lidar, can generate detailed canopy height products. Relationships between canopy height and biomass are commonly established via regression analysis using information from ground-truth plots. In this way, many site-specific height-biomass relationships have been proposed in the literature and applied for mapping in regional contexts. However, such relationships are only valid within the specific forest type for which they were calibrated. A generalized relationship would facilitate biomass estimation across forest types and regions. In this study, a combination of lidar-derived and ancillary structural descriptors is proposed as an approach for generalization between forest types. Each descriptor is supposed to quantify a different aspect of forest structure, i.e., mean canopy height, maximum canopy height, maximum stand density, vertical heterogeneity and wood density. Airborne discrete return lidar data covering 194 ha of forest inventory plots from five different sites including temperate and tropical forests from Africa, Europe, North, Central and South America was used. Biomass predictions using the best general model (nRMSE = 12.4%, R-2 = 0.74) were found to be almost as accurate as predictions using five site-specific models (nRMSE = 11.6%, R-2 = 0.78). The results further allow interpretation about the importance of the employed structure descriptors in the biomass estimation and the mechanisms behind the relationships. Understanding the relationship between canopy structure and aboveground biomass and being able to generalize it across forest types are important steps towards consistent large scale biomass mapping and monitoring using airborne and potentially also spaceborne platforms.', '[Knapp, Nikolai; Fischer, Rico; Huth, Andreas] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modeling, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.

Topography is an essential controlling factor for the directionality of SLR for high-relief regions (e.g., mountain regions) where there is land surface heterogeneity and non-isothermal properties at pixel scales. However, satellite sensors can only receive radiance from a specific surface object at a small number of simultaneous viewing angles, which makes the quantitative modeling of thermal anisotropy challenging. Therefore, we developed the topographic longwave radiation model (TLRM) to describe the directionality of SLR components taking into account the variability of both subpixel topography and thermal anisotropy in high-relief regions. The reliability of TLRM was validated using the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model over two typical geomorphic areas: a valley scene and a peak scene. The preliminary validation shows good agreement in terms of surface upward longwave radiance, which confirms the potential of TLRM for capturing the anisotropic patterns of land surfaces. The radiance values simulated by the DART model were first revised for the spectral mismatch. Then, they are used to correct residual deviation for TLRM using linear regressions. The root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2) were 0.830 W/(m(2) .sr) and 0.746 for the valley scene, respectively, and 0.239 W/(m(2).sr) and 0.711 for the peak scene, respectively. Compared with TLRM, models that do not consider terrain effects generate significant discrepancies in high relief SLR components. The differences in downward longwave radiation can reach -60 W/m(2) in valleys without considering terrain effects. Based on the reference of hemispherical upward longwave radiation, surface upward longwave radiation estimated by the direct estimation method had a bias of 11.41 W/m(2) and standard deviation (STD) of 7.30 W/m(2), while the directional upward longwave radiation had a bias of 5.99 W/m(2) and STD of 4.08 W/m(2), showing lower estimation variation. The discrepancy between surface net longwave radiation (NLR) and terrain-corrected NLR ranged between 50 and -130 W/m(2) with clear negative biases mainly occurring in valleys. With higher spatial resolutions of remotely sensed imagery, the influence of complex terrain on land surface radiative flux has become more significant. This parameterization scheme is expected to better represent the topographic effects on SLR, enhance understanding of thermal anisotropy in non-isothermal mixed pixel areas of high relief, and improve the inversion accuracy of SLR.', '[Jiao, Zhong-Hu] China Earthquake Adm, Inst Geol, State Key Lab Earthquake Dynam, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.

ArcticDEM is a collection of high-resolution (2 m) space-borne stereogrammetric digital surface models (DSM) covering the entire land area north of 60\' of latitude. The free-availability of ArcticDEM data offers new possibilities for aboveground biomass mapping (AGB) across boreal forests, and thus it is necessary to evaluate the potential for these data to map AGB over alternative open-data sources (i.e., Sentinel-2). This study was performed over the entire land area of Norway north of 60\' of latitude, and the Norwegian national forest inventory (NFI) was used as a source of field data composed of accurately geolocated field plots (n = 7710) systematically distributed across the study area. Separate random forest models were fitted using NPI data, and corresponding remotely sensed data consisting of either: i) a canopy height model (ArcticCHM) obtained by subtracting a high-quality digital terrain model (DTM) from the ArcticDEM DSM height values, ii) Sentinel-2 (S2), or iii) a combination of the two (ArcticCHM + S2).   Furthermore, we assessed the effect of the forest- and terrain-specific factors on the models\' predictive accuracy. The best model (,i.e., ArcticCHM + S2) explained nearly 60% of the variance of the training set, which translated in the largest accuracy in terms of root mean square error (RMSE = 41.4 t ha(-1)). This result highlights the synergy between 3D and multispectral data in AGB modelling.   Furthermore, this study showed that despite the importance of ArcticCHM variables, the S2 model performed slightly better than ArcticCHM model. This finding highlights some of the limitations of ArcticDEM, which, despite the unprecedented spatial resolution, is highly heterogeneous due to the blending of multiple acquisitions across different years and seasons. We found that both forest- and terrain-specific characteristics affected the uncertainty of the ArcticCHM + S2 model and concluded that the combined use of ArcticCHM and Sentinel-2 represents a viable solution for AGB mapping across boreal forests. The synergy between the two data sources allowed for a reduction of the saturation effects typical of multispectral data while ensuring the spatial consistency in the output predictions due to the removal of artifacts and data voids present in ArcticCHM data. While the main contribution of this study is to provide the first evidence of the best-case-scenario (i.e., availability of accurate terrain models) that ArcticDEM data can provide for large-scale AGB modelling, it remains critically important for other studies to investigate how ArcticDEM may be used in areas where no DTMs are available as is the case for large portions of the boreal zone.', '[Puliti, S.; Hauglin, M.; Breidenbach, J.; Rahlf, J.; Solberg, S.; Astrup, R.] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res NIBIO, Div Forest & Forest Resources, Natl Forest Inventory, Hogskoleveien 8, N-1433 As, Norway.

However, to date, passive remote sensing measurements have provided limited information about aerosol extinction profiles. In this study, we propose the use of a spectral sorting approach to constrain the aerosol vertical structure using spectra of reflected sunlight absorption within the molecular oxygen (O-2) A-band collected by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2). The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated using spectra acquired over the western Sahara coast by comparing the aerosol profile retrievals with lidar measurements from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). Using a radiative transfer model to simulate OCO-2 measurements, we found that high-resolution O-2 A-band measurements have high sensitivity to aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol layer height (ALH). Retrieved estimates of AOD and ALH based on a look up table technique show good agreement with CALIPSO measurements, with correlation coefficients of 0.65 and 0.53, respectively. The strength of the proposed spectral sorting technique lies in its ability to identify spectral channels with high sensitivity to AOD and ALH and extract the associated information from the observed radiance in a straightforward manner. The proposed approach has the potential to enable future passive remote sensing missions to map the aerosol vertical distribution on a global scale.', '[Zeng, Zhao-Cheng] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA.

Improved timely and accurate observations of the Earth\'s surface and dynamics are expected from the synergistic use of Landsat and Sentinel-2 data, which entails coordinating the spatial resolution gap between Landsat (30 m) and Sentinel-2 (10 m or 20 m) images. However, widely used data fusion techniques may not fulfil community\'s needs for generating a temporally dense reflectance product at 10 m spatial resolution from combined Landsat and Sentinel-2 images because of their inherent algorithmic weaknesses. Inspired by the recent advances in deep learning, this study developed an extended super-resolution convolutional neural network (ESRCNN) to a data fusion framework, specifically for blending Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) data. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of the deep learning-based fusion algorithm in yielding a consistent and comparable dataset at 10 m from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. Further accuracy assessments revealed that the performance of the fusion network was influenced by both the number of input auxiliary Sentinel-2 images and temporal interval (i.e., difference in image acquisition dates) between auxiliary Sentinel-2 images and the target Landsat-8 image. Compared to the benchmark algorithm, area-to-point regression kriging (ATKPK), the deep learning-based fusion framework proved better in the quantitative assessment in terms of RMSE (root mean square error), correlation coefficient (CC), universal image quality index (UIQI), relative global-dimensional synthesis error (ERGAS), and spectral angle mapper (SAM). ESRCNN better preserved the reflectance distribution as the original image compared to ATPRK, resulting in an improved image quality.

In this work we used ground spectro-radiometric and chamber-based CO2 flux measurements in a nutrient manipulated Mediterranean grassland in order to: 1) develop a multiple-constraint inversion approach of SCOPE able to retrieve vegetation biochemical, structural as well as key functional traits, such as chlorophyll concentration (C-ab), leaf area index (LAI), maximum carboxylation rate (V-cmax) and the Ball-Berry sensitivity parameter (m); and 2) compare the potential of the of gross primary production (GPP) and sun-induced fluorescence (SIF), together with up-welling Thermal Infrared (TIR) radiance and optical reflectance factors (RF), to estimate such parameters. The performance of the proposed inversion method as well as of the different sets of constraints was assessed with contemporary measurements of water and heat fluxes and leaf nitrogen content, using pattern-oriented model evaluation.   The multiple-constraint inversion approach proposed together with the combination of optical RF and diel GPP and TIR data provided reliable estimates of parameters, and improved predicted water and heat fluxes. The addition of SIF to this scheme slightly improved the estimation of m. Parameter estimates were coherent with the variability imposed by the fertilization and the seasonality of the grassland. Results revealed that fertilization had an impact on V-cmax while no significant differences were found for m. The combination of RF, SIF and die] TIR data weakly constrained functional traits. Approaches not including GPP failed to estimate LAI; however GPP overestimated C-ab, in the dry period. These problems might be related to the presence of high fractions of senescent leaves in the grassland.

Accurate monitoring of woody vegetation in savannas is therefore desirable, yet large scale mapping approaches rely on relatively coarse spatial resolution satellite data, which cannot directly capture the scattered nature of savanna trees. Studies at regional scale thus estimate the fractional cover of woody plants for a given area, whereas binary tree/no-tree estimates are restricted to the use of very high-resolution (VHR) images at local scales. With the launch of the Sentinel satellite systems (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2), the spatial resolution of images approaches the size of medium/large tree crowns, providing the opportunity to map the presence/absence of tree canopies, rather than the fraction of woody cover or forested areas. Here, we used a support vector machine (SVM) to classify the presence/absence of woody canopies from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data at a 10-m spatial resolution for the entire African Sahel. Training samples for the SVM classifier were collected from VHR images provided by Google Earth and Sentinel satellite data were processed in Google Earth Engine. Accuracy assessment was performed based on independent VHR images, showing an overall accuracy of 93% (71% and 98% for producer\'s accuracy of woody and non-woody pixels, 91% and 93% for user\'s accuracy of woody and non-woody pixels) when combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data (overall accuracy of 89% using Sentinel-1 only and 91% using Sentinel-2 only). The combined use proved to perform significantly better (p < 0.05) than the single use of any of the two. A comparison with existing tree cover maps (by aggregating presence/absence of tree canopies into fractional cover) showed noticeable differences, reflecting the need for new woody cover products adapted to the nature of savanna ecosystems. The Sentinel woody canopy map was able to reproduce the general pattern of scattered woody canopies, but generally overestimated the woody coverage (11.37 26.13% (mean sd) when aggregating to 250 m resolution) due to the 10 x 10-m spatial resolution which exceeds the crown size of a typical savanna tree. The cloud-based Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 analysis presented is a step towards large scale mapping of woody canopy (tree/no-tree) in savannas. Ultimately, such direct assessment of woody canopy areas will allow monitoring of temporal dynamics of woody canopies in future studies as Sentinel time-series expands to multiple years.', '[Zhang, Wenmin; Li, Yunmei; Lyu, Heng] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

Therefore, predicting the dynamics of future SSTs is of vital importance which can help identify these extreme events and alleviate the losses they cause. In this paper, a machine learning method combining the long short-term memory (LSTM) deep recurrent neural network model and the AdaBoost ensemble learning model (LSTM-AdaBoost) is proposed to predict the short and mid-term daily SST considering that LSTM is good at modelling long-term dependencies but suffers from overfitting, while AdaBoost has strong prediction capability and is not easily overfitted. By combining these two strong and heterogeneous models, the prediction errors related to variance may cancel out each other and the final results can be improved. In this method, the historical time-series satellite data of SST anomaly (SSTA) is used instead of SST itself considering that the fluctuations of SSTs are very small compared to their absolute magnitudes. The seasonality of the SSTA time series is first modelled using polynomial regression and then removed. Then, the deseasonalized time series are used to train the developed LSTM model and AdaBoost model independently. Daily SSTA predictions are made using these two models, and eventually, their predictions are combined as final predictions using the averaging strategy. A case study in the East China Sea that predicts the daily SSTA 10?days ahead shows that the proposed LSTM-AdaBoost combination model outperforms the LSTM and AdaBoost separately, as well as the optimized support vector regression (SVR) model, the optimized feedforward backpropagation neural network model (BPNN), and the stacking LSTM-AdaBoost model (S_LSTM-AdaBoost), when judged using multiple error statistics and from different perspectives. The results suggest that the LSTM-AdaBoost combination model using the averaging strategy is highly promising for short and mid-term daily SST predictions.', '[Xiao, Changjiang; Chen, Nengcheng; Gong, Jianya; Chen, Zeqiang] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.

It is a key plant functional trait that is widely used in Earth System Models for simulation of the global carbon and water cycles. Measuring V-cmax is time-consuming and laborious; therefore, the spatiotemporal distribution of V-cmax is still poorly understood due to limited measurements of V-cmax. In this study, we used a data assimilation approach to map the spatial variation of V-cmax for global terrestrial ecosystems from a 11-year-long satellite-observed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) record. In this SIF-derived V-cmax map, the mean V-cmax value for each plant function type (PFT) is found to be comparable to a widely used N-derived V-cmax dataset by Kattge et al. (2009). The gradient of V-cmax along PFTs is clearly revealed even without land cover information as an input. Large seasonal and spatial variations of V-cmax are found within each PFT, especially for diverse crop rotation systems. The distribution of major crop belts, characterized with high V-cmax values, is highlighted in this V-cmax map. Legume plants are characterized with high V-cmax values. This V-cmax map also clearly illustrates the emerging soybean revolution in South America where V-cmax is the highest among the world. The gradient of V-cmax in Amazon is found to follow the transition of soil types with different soil N and P contents. This study suggests that satellite-observed SIF is powerful in deriving the important plant functional trait, i.e. V-cmax, for global climate change studies.', '[He, Liming; Chen, Jing M.; Liu, Jane; Wang, Rong; Rogers, Cheryl] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Planning, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.

The algorithm was tested at five diverse reef sites globally (Lighthouse Reef, Belize; Saona Island, Dominican Republic; St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands; Heron Island, Australia; Hawaii Island, U.S.) using 31 satellite images from six Dove satellites. Derived water depth was validated (RMSE = 1.22 to 1.86 m) with field-measured sampling points (61,025) ranging in depth from 1 to 15 m. Algorithm performance was best at depths of 4-10 m. This new adaptive algorithm can be effectively applied to derive high spatial resolution bathymetric maps from Planet Dove satellite imagery across a wide range of conditions.', '[Li, Jiwei; Knapp, David E.; Asner, Gregory P.] Arizona State Univ, Ctr Global Discovery & Conservat Sci GDCS, Tempe, AZ USA.

In this study, geographic location, terrain, snow cover days and brightness temperature were evaluated. Then, critical factors were used to develop an Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) SD downscaling model. The results indicated the following: (1) SD is greatly influenced by geographic location, snow covered days, terrain parameters and brightness temperature difference. The surface roughness exhibited the best correlations with ground observations, which reflects 44% of the variation in SD; (2) the novel multifactor power SD downscaling model, which combines AMSR2 brightness temperature data and other auxiliary data, showed higher accuracy and stability and was closely correlated with the SD ground observations, and it reflected 80% of the SD variation; (3) compared with the AMSR2 ascending and descending orbital SD products released by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the SD datasets in China from the Environmental and Ecological Science Data Center for West China (WESTDC), the proposed downscaled SD datasets for the TP were greatly improved, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and average absolute error (MAE) were greatly reduced (2.00 cm and 0.25 cm, respectively); (4) the downscaled SD datasets for the TP showed good accuracy (RMSE = 0.58 cm) in areas with a SD of < 3 cm; and (5) the worst monitoring accuracy of the downscaled SD product was for grasslands, with a RMSE of 2.07 cm.

However, field observations have been limited by the harsh climate and complex terrain on the plateau, which greatly restricts our ability to predict the existence of and variations in frozen soils, especially at the regional scale. Here, we present a study relying solely on satellite data to drive process-based simulation of soil freeze-thaw processes. Modifications are made to an existing process-based model (Geomorphology-Based Eco-Hydrological Model, GBEHM) such that the model is fully adaptable to remote sensing inputs. The developed model fed with a combination of MODIS, TRMM and AIRX3STD satellite products is applied in the upper Yellow River Basin (coverage of similar to 2.54 x 10(5) km(2)) in the northeast TP and validated against field observations of freezing and thawing front depths (D-ft) and soil temperature (T-soil) at 54 China Meteorological Administration (CMA) stations, as well as frozen-ground types at 22 boreholes. Results indicate that the developed model performs reasonably well in simulating D-ft (R-2 = 0.69; mean bias = -0.03 m) and T-soil (station averaged R-2 and mean bias range between 0.90-0.96 and -0.51 similar to -0.14 degrees C at eight observational depths, respectively), and outperforms the original GBEHM forced with ground-measured meteorological variables. The frozen-ground types are also (in general) accurately identified by the satellite-based approach, except for a few permafrost boreholes located near the permafrost boundary regions. Additionally, we also demonstrate the importance of considering dynamic soil water content in frozen soil simulation: We find that a static-soil-moisture assumption (as used in previous studies) would lead to biased soil temperature estimates by > 0.5 degrees C. Our study demonstrates the value of using satellite data in frozen-soil simulation over complex landscapes, potentially leading to a greater understanding of soil freeze-thaw processes at the regional scale.', '[Zheng, Guanheng; Yang, Yuting; Yang, Dawen; Lei, Huimin; Yang, Hanbo] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.

Photosynthesis is particularly controlled by leaf pigments such as chlorophyll, carotenoids or anthocyanins. Incoming solar radiation is mainly captured by chlorophyll, whereas plant organs are also protected from excess radiation by carotenoids and anthocyanins. Current and upcoming optical earth observation sensors are sensitive to these radiative processes and thus feature a high potential for mapping the spatial and temporal variation of these photosynthetic pigments. In the context of remote sensing, leaf pigments are either quantified as leaf area-based content [mu g/cm(2)] or as leaf mass-based concentration [g/g or %]. However, these two metrics are fundamentally different, and until now there has been neither an in-depth discussion nor a consensus on which metric to choose. This is notable considering the amount of studies that do not explicitly differentiate between pigment content and concentration. We therefore seek to outline the differences between both metrics and thus show that the remote sensing of leaf pigment concentration [%] is unsubstantial. This is due to the fact that, firstly, pigment concentration is likely to primarily reflect variation in leaf mass per area and not pigments itself. Second, the radiative transfer in plant leaves is especially determined by the absolute content of pigments in a leaf and not its relative concentration to other leaf constituents. And third, as a ratio, pigment concentration is an ambiguous metric, which further complicates the quantification of leaf pigments at the canopy scale. Given these issues related to the use of chlorophyll concentration, we thus conclude that remote sensing of leaf pigments should be primarily performed on an area basis [mu g/cm(2)].', '[Kattenborn, Teja; Schiefer, Felix; Schmidtlein, Sebastian] KIT, Inst Geog & Geoecol, Kaiserstr 12, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.

Fire is introduced under specific environmental conditions, with explicit duration, intensity and rate of spread. Such conditions deviate from those encountered during the fire season. As a result, prescribed burns mostly affect surface fuels and understorey vegetation, an outcome markedly different when compared to wildfires.   Information on prescribed burning outcomes is important for evaluating the extent to which land management objectives have been achieved. This study focused on the ability of Radar Burn Ratio (RBR), a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based multi-temporal index, to appraise the outcome of prescribed burns in eucalypt forests of Western Australia. L-band datasets acquired by the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR-2) sensor were used to relate changes in radar backscatter coefficient with the effects of prescribed burning. Two modelling approaches based on post- to pre-fire ratios were used to evaluate prescribed burn impacts. Post-fire tree survival in areas affected by high fire impacts was inferred by assessing the recovery rates of the backscatter coefficient for the first year after the burn.   The impact of prescribed burns was estimated with relatively high overall accuracy (79%) using cross-polarized backscatter (HV) under dry conditions. The HH polarization and the Normalized Difference Backscatter Intensity (NDBI) showed certain ability to detect burned areas under wet conditions. The results suggest that L-band backscatter coefficient may contribute to evaluating the success of prescribed burns in Western Australian eucalypt forests through its sensitivity to changes in vegetation structure. In addition, tree survival (as opposed to mortality) and recovery towards the pre-fire state might be inferred by analysing short-term post-fire trends of the backscatter coefficient in areas affected by high fire impacts.', '[Fernandez-Carrillo, Angel; Tanase, Mihai A.] Univ Alcala, Dept Geol Geog & Environm, C Colegios 2, Alcala De Henares 28801, Spain.

An understanding of their progression and behaviour is necessary to reduce risks and to develop operational management strategies in the event of an active fire. Many empirical fire-spread models have been developed to predict the spread and overall behaviour of a wildfire, based on a range of parameters such as weather and fuel conditions. However, these parameters may not be available with sufficient accuracy or spatiotemporal resolution to provide reliable fire spread predictions. Fuel condition data include variables such as vegetation quantity, structure and moisture content and, in the event of previous wildfires, the burn severity and stage of ecosystem recovery. In this study, an index called the Vegetation Structure Perpendicular Index (VSPI) is introduced. The VSPI utilises the short-wave infrared reflectance in bands centred at 1.6 and 2.2 pm, essentially representing the amount and structure of the vegetation\'s woody biomass (as opposed to the photosynthetic activity and moisture content). The VSPI is quantified as the divergence from a linear regression between the two bands in a time series and represents vegetation disturbance and recovery more reliably than indices such as the Normalised Burn Ratio (NBR) and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The VSPI index generally shows minor inter-annual variability and stronger post-wildfire detection of disturbance over a longer period than NBR and NDVI. The index is developed and applied to major wildfire events within eucalypt forests throughout southern Australia to estimate both burn severity and time to recovery. The VSPI can provide an improved information layer for fire risk evaluation and operational predictions of wildfire behaviour.', '[Massetti, Andrea; Rudiger, Christoph] Monash Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Clayton, Vic, Australia.

Using time series observations, the vegetation change tracker (VCT) algorithm was designed to map the location, timing, and spectral magnitudes of forest disturbance events.

This study focuses on estimating disturbance intensity as measured by percent basal area removal using spectral indices from the VCT algorithm over North and South Carolina. Repeat measurements on Forest Service Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) ground plots, which provide changes in basal area between multiple dates at precise locations, are used for training and validation of the model. The overall R-2 between predicted disturbance intensity and reference data is 0.66, and cross-validation prediction uncertainty is 14% in North Carolina. Possible causes of this uncertainty could be site heterogeneity and the temporal offset between ground measurements and satellite observations.

However, the spatial distribution of LST over mountainous areas is not only strongly affected by the differences in surface thermal properties but also by the differences in thermal or radiative environment induced by the topographic variations, presenting significant terrain effect. This effect greatly hinders researches on surface energy fluxes and soil moisture estimation in these regions. To normalize the terrain effect, a random forest (RF)-based normalization approach was developed in this study and applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data over a typical mountain region in the eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau, China. An LST linking model was first constructed to express the complicated interrelationship between LST and other surface variables, including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), leaf area index (LAI), surface albedo (ALB), cumulative incident solar radiation (CSR), normalized difference water index (NDWI), surface elevation (ELV), and surface slope (SLP). The estimation results well indicated the good accuracy of the model with the coefficient of determination (R-2) above 0.92 for 90 selected days in 2015. Based on the good LST linking model, the LST normalization was achieved by replacing the topography affected factors (CSR, ELV, and SLP) with reference values for each pixel when keeping the rest status factors as their original values. The normalization result was indirectly validated by the normalization results with the traditional method based on the linear correction upon the regression between surface elevation and LST. The cross-validation clearly indicated the proposed method had an obvious advantage in reducing the topography-induced LST difference based on the average decrease in the temperature range (9.51 K) and the standard deviation (1.09 K) for the images on the 90 selected days over the study area. In contrast, the traditional method was hard to capture the terrain effect only based on the relationship between LST and surface elevation due to the complex interaction between LST and other factors. Overall, the proposed method shows a good application potential for normalizing the terrain effect on LST, and the results will be helpful for the LST-based estimation of surface energy fluxes or soil moisture over mountainous areas.', '[Zhao, Wei; Li, Ainong; Yin, Gaofei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China.

Concurrently, where available, agency records of fires have also been used to assess fire regimes. Yet, it remains unclear if these independent datasets measure the same fires, which raises concerns about the interpretation and benchmarking of models derived from these products. Here, we present a novel product intercomparison of the MODIS burned area and active fire products across the conterminous United States using nearly 250,000 agency reported wildfires as reference data to model consistencies and inconsistencies between all three datasets. We compared agency reported wildfires from the Fire Program Analysis fire occurrence database to the MODIS products to identify which fires were detected vs. omitted by MODIS products relative to agency fire records, and by agency fire records relative to MODIS. We created generalized linear models as a function of fire attributes (e.g. size) and environmental variables (e.g. cloud cover) to predict MODIS detection of agency wildfires, and anthropogenic variables (e.g. agriculture) to predict agency detection of MODIS fires. We modeled fire detection probability separately for MODIS burned area and active fire products, and for the eastern and western U.S. Overall, we found that MODIS product detection rates ranged from 3.5% to 23.4% of all documented agency wildfires > 1 ha, and that likelihood of detection increased with fire size. Agency detection rates ranged from 23.5% to 48% of MODIS burned area and active fires. Under ideal conditions, the MODIS active fire product had a 50% probability of detecting a wildfire that grew to at least 10 ha (eastern U.S.) 78 ha (western U.S.), while the burned area product had a 50% probability of detecting a wildfire that grew to at least 169 ha (eastern U.S.) 234 ha (western U.S.). Cloud cover and leaf area index were significant predictors of MODIS fire detection, while state boundaries were significant predictors of agency fire detection. This analysis presents an important assessment of the fire attributes and ground conditions that influence MODIS fire detection relative to extensive and increasingly used ground-based wildfire records. The large discrepancy in records of fire occurrence between MODIS and agency fire datasets highlights the need for this type of analysis into the types of fires likely to be included in each database.', '[Fusco, Emily J.; Finn, John T.; Bradley, Bethany A.] Univ Massachusetts, Grad Program Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.

However, exposure assessment of PM2.5 has been negatively affected by sparsely distributed monitoring stations. In addition, several limitations exist among the existing methods for high spatiotemporal resolution PM2.5 estimation, including ignorance or limited use of spatial autocorrelation, single-model methods, and use of aerosol optical depth data with non-random missingness. These limitations probably introduce bias or high uncertainty in model estimation. In this paper, we proposed an approach of constrained mixed-effect bagging models to leverage advanced algorithm of the high-resolution AOD retrieved by Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC), with other spatiotemporal predictors and spatial autocorrelation to reliably estimate PM2.5 at a high spatiotemporal resolution. Our base model was a daily mixed-effect spatial model that accounted for spatial autocorrelation using embedded structured and unstructured spatial random effects. Point estimates from the base models were then averaged based on the bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to reduce variance in prediction. Then, constrained optimization was developed to minimize the impact of missing AOD and to capture a full time-series of PM2.5 concentration. Our daily-level bagging allowed AOD-PM2.5 association and spatial autocorrelation to vary daily, which substantially improved the model performance. As a case study of daily PM2.5 predictions in 2014 in Shandong Province, China, our approach achieved R-2 of 0.87 (RMSE: 18.6 mu g/m(3)) in cross validation, and R-2 of 0.75 (RMSE: 20.6 mu g/m(3)) in an independent test, similar to or better than most existing methods. We further extended the 2014 models to simulate 2014-2016 full time-series of biweekly average PM2.5 concentrations with no use of covariates in 2015-2016 but constrained optimization over 2014 daily point estimates; the results showed well-captured temporal trend with a total correlation of 0.81 between the simulated and observed values from 2015 to 2016. Our approach can be applied for other regions for exposure estimation of PM2.5 when measurements alone are not able to capture the desirable spatial and temporal resolutions.', '[Li, Lianfa; Zhang, Jiehao; Fang, Ying; Ge, Yong; Wang, Jinfeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China.

Satellite derived pre- and post-fire differenced severity indices (Delta FSI), such as the differenced Normalised Burn Ratio (Delta NBR), are widely used to map the severity of large wildfires. Fire severity classification is commonly undertaken through the identification of severity class thresholds in Delta FSI. However, several shortcomings have been identified with severity classifications using Delta FSI, including poor delineation of low fire severity classes, and unsatisfactory performance when Delta FSI classification thresholds are applied to new landscapes. Our study assesses the performance of the Random Forest classifier (RF) for improving the accuracy of satellite based wildfire severity mapping across heterogeneous landscapes using Landsat imagery. We collected point based fire severity training data (n = 10,855) from sixteen large wildfires occurring across south-eastern Australia between 2006 and 2016. The predictive accuracy of fire severity classification using Delta NBR and the RF incorporating numerous spectral indices, was assessed using bootstrapping and cross validation. Image acquisition and index calculation for each fire was undertaken in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Results of the bootstrapping validation show that the RF classifier had very high classification accuracy ( > 95%) for unburnt (UB), crown scorch (CS) and crown consumption (CC) severity classes, and high classification accuracy ( > 74%) for low severity classes (crown unburnt, CU; partial crown scorch, PCS). The RF classification outperformed the Delta NBR classification for all severity classes, increasing classification accuracy by between 6%-21%. Cross validation using independent fires produced similar median classification accuracy as the bootstrapping validation, though the RF classification of CU was substantially reduced to similar to 55%. Delta NBR, Delta NDWI and Delta NDVI were the three most important variables in the RF model. The Landsat satellite platform used to derive the indices had little effect on classification accuracy. Maps produced using the RF classifier in GEE had similar spatial patterns in fire severity classes as maps produced using time-consuming hand digitisation of aerial images. GEE was found to be a highly efficient platform for image acquisition, processing and production of severity maps. Our study shows that fire severity mapping using RF classifiers provides a robust method for broad scale mapping of fire severity across heterogeneous landscapes. Furthermore, the GEE-based classification framework supports the operational application of this approach in a land management agency context for the rapid production of fire severity maps.', '[Collins, L.] La Trobe Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Evolut, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.

One is the POLYnomial based approach originally designed for MERIS (POLYMER) but adopted and implemented for MODIS, and the other is the traditional Gordon and Wang (1994b) near-infrared (NIR) approach with iteration to account for non-negligible NIR water-leaving radiance, which is currently embedded in the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) software package and used operationally by NASA for processing MODIS data (termed as NASA standard atmospheric correction or NSAC). The approaches are evaluated for both quality and quantity of their retrieved R-rs in the visible domain. The quality is gauged through three statistical measures between in situ and MODIS-retrieved R-rs: root mean square error (RMSE, sr(-1)), unbiased root mean square (uRMS), and mean bias (delta, sr(-1)). For common points where both approaches yield valid R-rs retrievals, POLYMER shows worse performance than NSAC for blue bands (< 488 nm) and comparable performance for green and red bands. However, POLYMER shows the ability to retrieve more valid R-rs data points (2-3 folds) than NSAC for this evaluation dataset primarily because the latter fails over strong sun glint regions where the MODIS NIR bands saturate but the former is designed to work over sun glint regions using non-saturation MODIS bands. For those data points where only POLYMER yield valid R-rs retrievals, data quality is slightly worse than from the common data points. Although these results may vary slightly among individual subregions, it is generally true that POLYMER may be used as a surrogate of NSAC for atmospheric correction of MODIS when data quantity is significantly limited due to perturbations of sun glint and thin clouds that are typical for subtropical and tropical regions.', '[Zhang, Minwei; Hu, Chuanmin; Cannizzaro, Jennifer; English, David; Barnes, Brian B.] Univ S Florida, 140 Seventh Ave South, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.

There are however, few datasets available to address spatial uncertainties, such as the influence of snow microstructure, at scales relevant to space-borne application. In this study we introduce measurements from SnowSAR, an airborne, dual-frequency (9.6 and 17.2 GHz) synthetic aperture radar (SAR), to evaluate high resolution (10 m) backscatter within a snow-covered tundra basin. Coincident in situ surveys at two sites characterize a generally thin snowpack (50 cm) interspersed with deeper drift features. Structure of the snowpack is found to be predominantly wind slab (65%) with smaller proportions of depth hoar underlain (35%). Objective estimates of snow microstructure (exponential correlation length; l(ex)), show the slab layers to be 2.8 times smaller than the basal depth hoar. In situ measurements are used to parametrize the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS3&a) and compare against collocated SnowSAR backscatter. The evaluation shows a scaling factor (phi) between 1.37 and 1.08, when applied to input of l(ex), minimizes MEMLS root mean squared error to < 1.1 dB. Model sensitivity experiments demonstrate contrasting contributions from wind slab and depth hoar components, where wind rounded microstructures are identified as a strong control on observed backscatter. Weak sensitivity of SnowSAR to spatial variations in SWE is explained by the smaller contributing microstructures of the wind slab.', '[King, Joshua; Derksen, Chris; Toose, Peter] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Div Climate Res, Toronto, ON, Canada.

It accurately reproduced measured SWE, using different data sources for training and evaluation. In the central-Sierra American River basin, we used a k-NN algorithm to interpolate data from continuous snow-depth measurements in 10 sensor clusters by fusing them with 14 years of daily 500-m resolution SWE-reconstruction maps. Accurate SWE estimation over the melt season shows the potential for providing daily, near real-time distributed snowmelt estimates. Further south, in the Merced-Tuolumne basins, we evaluated the potential of k-NN approach to improve real-time SWE estimates. Lacking dense ground-measurement networks, we simulated k-NN interpolation of sensor data using selected pixels of a bi-weekly Lidar-derived snow water equivalent product. k-NN extrapolations underestimate the Lidar-derived SWE, with a maximum bias of -10 cm at elevations below 3000 m and +15 cm above 3000 m. This bias was reduced by using a Gaussian-process regression model to spatially distribute residuals. Using as few as 10 scenes of Lidar-derived SWE from 2014 as training data in the k-NN to estimate the 2016 spatial SWE, both RMSEs and MAEs were reduced from around 20-25 cm to 10-15 cm comparing to using SWE reconstructions as training data. We found that the spatial accuracy of the historical data is more important for learning the spatial distribution of SWE than the number of historical scenes available. Blending continuous spatially representative ground-based sensors with a historical library of SWE reconstructions over the same basin can provide real-time spatial SWE maps that accurately represents Lidar-measured snow depth; and the estimates can be improved by using historical Lidar scans instead of SWE reconstructions.', '[Zheng, Zeshi; Oroza, Carlos A.; Bales, Roger C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.

The Copernicus CryoLand Pan-European FSC time series for 2001-2016 re-gridded to 0.1 degrees serves as input for the production of 16 years of melt-off day maps for Europe. These maps are compared with passive microwave radiometer (MWR) melt retrievals, to compare the performance of these two independent datasets, particularly concerning the effect of physiographic and snow conditions on the accuracy of the melt-off day estimates. Both these datasets are evaluated against melt-off day derived from in situ snow depth (SD) time series observed at European weather stations. We also present the relationship of these snow melt-off day products to a passive microwave radiometer-derived landscape freeze/thaw product.   Our results show that the melt-off day derived from optical springtime FSC time series provides the strongest correlation with the snow melt-off day with respect to the in situ data. Overall the deviation of CryoLand FSC data derived melt-off day to that indicated by in situ observations is quite small, with positive bias of 0.9 days, and RMSE of 13.1 days. For 85% of the analyzed cases the differences are between 10 days. Across Europe the MWR-based detection of melt-off day is less accurate; the investigated method performs the best for areas with sustained seasonal snow cover. Based on the time series for MWR-based melt-off day (1980-2016) and FT-ESDR (1980-2014), separately for boreal forests and tundra, we also found a clear trend towards earlier snow clearance: a decrease of melt-off day by as much as 5 days per decade in boreal forest region was observed.', '[Metsamaki, Sari; Bottcher, Kristin; Mattila, Olli-Pekka; Koponen, Sampsa] Finnish Environm Inst, Helsinki, Finland.

We conducted an airborne L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisition campaign on Wax Lake Delta, Louisiana, USA, in May 2015, to investigate whether water velocities and flow patterns over kilometer scales can be determined from remote sensing. Thirteen SAR flight lines over the delta region were acquired in 3 h with six different flight directions, concurrently with a small boat campaign. We show that SAR azimuth displacement due to Doppler shift can be used to estimate the surface water flow relative to the static and submerged vegetation interspersed on delta islands, using a simple Bragg wave scattering model and accounting for the Bragg wave\'s free velocity and wind drift. At Wax Lake Delta, we find that similar to 0.40 m/s water velocities within the main deltaic channels slow to 0.1-0.2 m/s as flow spreads laterally across, and converges within, the vegetated islands, coinciding with shallow (< 0.5 m) depths and heightened flow resistance.

Moss communities constitute much of the understory in Arctic vegetation, and as poikilohydric plants moss are highly sensitive to timing and duration of moisture levels. Here we investigate the role of moisture content on NDVI, red and near-infrared reflectance, and gross primary productivity (GPP) of two sphagnum and two pleurocarpus moss community types during two separate drying experiments. For both experiments, blocks of moss were collected near Imnavait Creek, Alaska, saturated to full water capacity, and then allowed to air dry before being re-saturated. Drying of blocks was conducted in a translucent outdoor tent during the first experiment and under indoor climate-controlled conditions during the second. Community NDVI (experiment 1 and 2), and GPP (experiment 2) were measured at regular intervals during the dry-down and after rewetting. In both experiments, moss NDVI sharply declined between 80% and 70% moisture content for sphagnum moss communities (NDVI change = -0.17 to -0.2), but less so for pleurocarpus moss communities (NDVI change = -0.06 to -0.12). Changes in NDVI were largely the result of increases in reflectance in red wavelengths. Peak GPP for all community types in the second experiment (1.31 to 2.08 mu mo] m(-2)s(-1)) occurred at 80% moisture content and declined significantly as moisture content decreased. Rates of GPP continued to decline below 80% moisture content until near zero as moss reached a steady weight (air dry) over a period of 84 h, while NDVI values declined slowly between 70% hydration and fully air dry. Re-saturation caused NDVI to increase in both sphagnum (NDVI change = + 0.18 to + 0.23) and pleurocarpus (NDVI change = + 0.10 to + 0.17) communities. Only sphagnum communities showed GPP resuming (0.824 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)) after 24 h. The strong changes in NDVI and mismatch of moss NDVI values and GPP with moisture content fluctuations indicate that using NDVI as a proxy for productivity in Arctic vegetation communities may be problematic and underscores the need for quantification of moss community coverage, composition, and moisture content.', '[May, Jeremy L.; Unger, Steven; Oberbauer, Steven F.] Florida Int Univ, 11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA.

If PFTs are possible to detect and discriminate spectrally, then it may be possible to use remote sensing applications to map ecosystem processes or services within and across landscapes. As a first step towards this application, we explored whether functional groups of 22 dominant South African wetland species were spectrally separable based on their PFTs. We measured 23 biochemical and morphological PFTs in combination with spectra from 350 to 2349 nm using a handheld radiometer. First, we evaluated the possibility of accurately predicting morphological and biochemical PFTs from reflectance spectra using three approaches: spectrum averaging, redundancy analysis (RDA), and partial least squares regression (PLSR). Second, we established whether functional groups and species were spectrally distinguishable. We found seven PFTs to be important in at least two of the three approaches: four morphological and three biochemicals. Morphological traits that were important were leaf area (PISA: r(2) = 0.40, regression: r(2) = 0.41), specific leaf area (r(2) = 0.67), leaf mass (r(2) = 0.43, r(2) = 0.38), and leaf length/width ratio (r(2) = 0.62). Biochemical traits that play a role in the structural composition of vegetation, like lignin content (r(2) = 0.98, r(2) = 0.54), concentration (r(2) = 0.45) and cellulose content (r(2) = 0.57, r(2) = 0.49), were found to be important by at least two of the analyses. Three other traits were important in at least one of the analyses: total biomass (r(2) = 0.56), leaf C/N ratio (r(2) = 0.99), and cellulose concentration (r(2) = 0.76). Redundancy analysis suggests that there is a large percentage (52%) of the spectrum not explained by the PFTs measured in this study. However, spectral discrimination of functional groups, and even species, appears promising, mostly in the ultraviolet A part of the spectrum. This has interesting applications for mapping PFTs using remote sensing techniques, and therefore for estimating related ecosystem processes and services.', '[Rebelo, Alanna J.; Meire, Patrick] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Ecosyst Management Res Grp ECOBE, Univ Pl 1C, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.

The integration of a backdating approach improves LCLU change classification results for the first date of a bi-temporal image sequences. Conversely, moderate spatial resolution satellite images such as those from Landsat sensors may not allow for detailed urban land use and land cover mapping. The objective of this study is to test a new bi-temporal change identification approach that integrates image classification of fine spatial resolution satellite imagery at time-2 and moderate spatial resolution satellite imagery (Landsat) at time-1, in a backdating and GEOBICA framework for mapping urban land use change. We compare the results from this approach to those of a GEOBICA approach based on fine spatial resolution imagery in both periods. The overall accuracy of the time-1 Landsat image classification is 0.82 and that of the fine spatial resolution image is 0.87. Moreover, the overall accuracy of the areal change data estimated from the pixel-wise spatial overlay of bitemporal FRes LCLU maps is 0.80 while that from overlaying a time-2 FRes-generated map to that from a Landsat time-1 image is 0.81.

We estimated gridded ET, from field (30 m) to regional (1 km) scales, and we performed a specific study on grassland ecosystems in the Alps in South Tyrol (Italy), to evaluate the model sensitivity to different types of land management. The energy balance model TSEB ALEXI (Two Source Energy Balance Atmosphere Land EXchange Inverse) was first applied to Meteosat satellite data. Then ET was estimated by the flux disaggregation procedure DisALEXI, driven by MODIS and Landsat LST retrievals, which has never been applied before in a mountain region. We evaluated the model against eddy covariance (EC) measurements from established stations in the Alps, and analyzed the main limitations which affect the model performance in mountainous regions. The TSEB model, applied in plot-scale mode using tower based meteorological and LST input data, performed well with errors in daytime (6-18 UTC + 1) latent heat flux around 30-60 W m(-2) in comparison with flux measurements corrected for the lack of closure in the energy balance. For landscape ET retrievals, while Landsat resolution (30 m) is preferable for capturing small-scale heterogeneity in landscape moisture conditions, and for direct comparison with tower fluxes, persistent cloud cover resulted in no clear Landsat scenes during the study period. MODIS-based retrievals at 1 km resolution are too coarse to resolve the flux tower footprint in this complex landscape, yielding discrepancies of 100 W m(-2) in model-measurement comparisons. Still, MODIS DisALEXI partitioning of the energy budget was reasonable and enabled to detect evaporative stress at regional scale expressed as the ratio between actual and potential ET, WET. We evaluated WET in comparison with a crop stress index based on cumulative air temperature and precipitation at different stations in the study area, and investigated ability to capture differential responses between managed and unmanaged grasslands. Results show that in the Alps i) moderate resolution thermal data can be used to monitor evaporative stress at the regional scale; ii) the spatial-temporal evolution of ET can be characterized from MODIS and Landsat thermal data with limitations which are due to the low availability of clear-sky scenes and to the small-scale (similar to 10 m) changes in soil moisture, topography and canopy density, which control ET patterns in mountainous regions; iii) solar radiation and leaf area index are critical variables which strongly affect the accuracy of the modeled energy fluxes.', '[Castelli, M.; Zebisch, M.; Notarnicola, C.] Eurac Res, Inst Earth Observat, Via Druso 1, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy.

This paper presents an innovative flood mapping technique based on an index which is computed using multi temporal statistics of Synthetic Aperture Radar images. The index compares a large amount of reference scenes to those acquired during the investigated flood and allows an easy categorization of \"flooded\" areas; either areas solely temporarily covered by water or areas with mixed water and vegetation. The method has been developed specifically to exploit Sentinel-1 data but can be applied to any other sensor. It has been tested for the 2010 flood of Veneto (Italy) and the floods of 2015 in Malawi and Uganda. Extensive qualitative analysis and cross-comparison with other state-of-the art methods, proved the proposed approach highly reliable and particularly effective, allowing a precise, simple and fast flood mapping.

One approach, known as the \"spectral variation hypothesis\" (SVH), proposes that biodiversity is linked to spectral diversity. However, SVH-based approaches, which we refer to as \"spectral diversity metrics\", can be confounded by soil exposure and are sensitive to the spatial resolution of the data. To address these issues, we 1) investigated the impact of soil exposure on spectral diversity, 2) identified optimal bands for mapping biodiversity using a spectral diversity metric based on dimension reduction, and 3) assessed the impact of spatial resolution on spectral diversity metrics. In this study; alpha-diversity (species richness) was used as a measure of plant biodiversity. The study was based on two imaging spectrometry data sets from the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve in Central Minnesota, USA, at two levels: proximal and airborne. The data sets included varying degrees of soil background sampled at two different spatial resolutions (1 mm and 0.75 m). We explored five spectral diversity metrics, including the coefficient of variation, convex hull volume, spectral angle mapper, spectral information divergence, and a newly proposed dimension reduction-based metric called \"convex hull area.\" For the proximal data set (pixel size of 1 mm), filtering soil pixels by applying a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) threshold improved the performance of all spectral diversity metrics significantly, with the coefficient of variation showing the highest correlation with species richness. In the airborne data set (pixel size of 0.75 m), the convex hull area outperformed other metrics. These findings demonstrate promising approaches for remote sensing of biodiversity, illustrate a confounding effect of soil background on remote diversity measurement, and indicate that the most informative regions of the electromagnetic spectrum for estimating species richness can vary with spatial scale.', '[Gholizadeh, Hamed; Gamon, John A.; Zygielbaum, Arthur I.] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily LST is one of such high spatiotemporal datasets that are widely used. But, it has a large amount of missing values primarily because of clouds, shadows, and other atmospheric conditions. Gapfilling the missing values is an important approach to create seamless high spatiotemporal LST datasets. However, current gapfilling methods have limitations in terms of accuracy and efficiency to assemble the data over large areas (e.g., national and continental levels). In this study, we developed a 3-step hybrid method by integrating daily merging (gapfilling missing values at one overpass using values at the other three overpasses each day), spatiotemporal gapfilling (estimating missing values based on values of their spatial and temporal neighbors), and temporal interpolation (gapfilling missing values based on values of their neighboring days), to create a seamless high spatiotemporal LST dataset using the four daily LST observations from the two MODIS instruments on Terra and Aqua satellites. We applied this method in urban and surrounding areas in the conterminous U.S. in 2010. The evaluation of the gapfilled LST product indicates its root mean squared error (RMSE) to be 3.3 K for mid-daytime (1:30 pm) and 2.7 K for mid-nighttime (1:30 am) observations. The method can be easily extended to other years and regions and is also applicable to other satellite products for large areas. This seamless daily (mid-daytime and mid-nighttime) LST product with 1 km spatial resolution is of great value for studying urban climate (e.g., quantifying surface urban heat island intensity, creating seamless high spatiotemporal air temperature dataset) and the related impacts on people (e.g., health and mortality), ecosystems (e.g., phenology), and energy systems (e.g., building energy use).', '[Li, Xiaoma; Zhou, Yuyu] Iowa State Univ, Dept Geol & Atmospher Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA.

This is generally considered the step introducing greatest uncertainty, and some apparently discrete inventories are not fully independent, as they have been cross-calibrated to aid this stage. We present a novel emissions inventory approach that bypasses the fuel consumption step, directly linking geostationary FRP measures to emission rates of total particulate matter (TPM), via coefficients derived from observations of smoke plume aerosol optical depth (AOD). The approach is fully top-down\', being based on spacebome observations alone, is performed at or close to the FRP data\'s original pixel resolution, and avoids the need to assume or model fuel consumption per unit area prior to the emissions calculation. Rates and totals of trace gas and carbon emission can be inferred from the TPM fluxes, and in combination with satellite burned area (BA) products the approach provides an innovative top down approach to mapping fuel consumption per unit area (kgm(-2)) as a last step in the calculation. Using this innovative methodology, which we term \'FREemissions\' (FREM), we generate a 2004-2012 fire emissions inventory for southern Africa, based on Meteosat FRP-PIXEL data. We find basic annual average TPM emissions 45% higher than the widely used GFASv1.2 inventory, with our higher totals in line with independent assessments that necessitate a significant upscaling of GFAS TPM emissions to match observed AODs. Our estimates are also 12% higher than GFEDv4.1s, which already includes a substantial upward adjustment for fires too small to be detected by the MODIS MCD64A1 BA product. If we adjust the FREM-derived emissions for SEVIRI\'s inability to detect the lower FRP component of the regions fire regime then the differences between FREM and GFAS/GFED grow further, to a mean of 64% with respect to GFED4.1s TPM emissions for example. These upwardly adjusted FREM estimates agree very well with FEER, an FRP- and AOD-based inventory driven by polar-orbiting MODIS FRP \'snapshots\' rather than geostationary observations. Similarly higher totals are seen for FREM\'s fire-emitted trace gases, derived using the emission factor ratios of gases to particulates. Our exploitation of geostationary FRP requires fewer assumptions than use of polar orbiter FRP measures, avoids biases coming from incomplete sampling of the fire diurnal cycle, and enables the FREM approach to provide fire emissions and fuel consumption estimates at a higher spatio-temporal resolution than any inventory currently available (e.g. 0.05 degrees and hourly averages or better), including per km(2) of area burned. The approach offers great potential to generate very high resolution fire emissions datasets for the tropics, sub-tropics and potentially temperate zones, with updates available in near real-time from the global suite of geostationary meteorological satellites operated by organisations such as EUMETSAT (Meteosat), NOAA (GOES) and JMA (Himawari).', '[Mota, Bernardo; Wooster, Martin J.] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London WC2R 2LS, England.

The Green-excess Index (GEI) derived from Red, Green and Blue digital image brightness values from digital repeat photography (a.k.a. phenocams) was used to track the inter-annual variability in seasonal greening and above ground biomass for two dominant aquatic emergent graminoids on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska: Carex aquatilis and Arctophila fulva. Four years of seasonal and inter-annual greening trends show strong differences in timing and intensity of greenness among species. Thawing degree-days (TDD, days above 0 degrees C) was a good predictor of GEI in both A. fulva and C. aquatilis. Employing regression tree analyses, we found a greening threshold of 46 TDD for A. fulva, after which GEI increased markedly, while C. aquatilis greened more gradually with a greening mid-point of 31 TDD. Based on long-term climate records and TDD thresholds, greening date has begun 16 thawing degree-days earlier over the past 70 years. To understand the effects of latitude and nutrients on seasonal greening, we compared southern sites and nutrient enriched sites with reference sites. We found statistically higher greenness in southern sites and enriched sites compare to reference sites in both plant species, supporting the role of nutrients and warmer temperatures as key factors enhancing productivity in arctic wetlands. In addition, this study provides an inexpensive, alternative method to monitor climate and nutrient effects at high frequency in arctic aquatic systems through camera-derived GEI greenness and has the potential to bridge the gap between plot level and satellite based observations given its strong relationships with biomass and NDVI.', '[Andresen, C.

Multi-temporal analyses of single- (VV-) polarization SAR imagery indicate that the surface roughness is more variable at shorter scales (responsible for the X-band backscatter) than at longer scales (C-band). Less variation at both radar bands was found in sea-grass meadows. TerraSAR-X dual-co-polarization data were used for polarimetric analyses based on a decomposition of the Kennaugh matrix, whose elements provide information on the total intensity at both co-polarizations and on the relative strength of even- and odd-bounce backscattering. At steep incidence angles (around 30 degrees) the radar backscatter from bare sand flats is similarly strong at both co-polarizations, while the vertically polarized radar return dominates at higher incidence angles (above 40). At low water levels, resulting in lower moisture of the sandy sediments, strong single-bounce radar backscattering was observed, while higher water levels (and moisture) caused weak mixed (single- and double-bounce) backscattering. Apart from the absolute water level its history, e.g. the time and level of the closest low tide, must be considered. During the vegetation period, sea-grass meadows cause a stronger increase in horizontally (HH-) polarized radar backscatter, along with an increased double-bounce backscattering. We conclude that the Kennaugh element framework has potential to be used for classification purposes in intertidal areas, but also that, for a full interpretation of the SAR imagery, the exact topography and the surface roughness have to be known.', '[Gade, Martin; Wang, Wensheng; Kemme, Linnea] Univ Hamburg, Inst Meereskunde, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.

Multi-temporal remote sensing represents a key tool to investigate vegetation phenology, particularly in environments with limited accessibility and lack of in situ measurements. This paper presents the first characterisation of mangrove forest phenology from the Yucatan Peninsula, south east Mexico. We used 15-year time-series of four vegetation indices (EVI, NDVI, gNDVI and NDWI) derived from MODIS surface reflectance to estimate phenological parameters which were then compared with in situ climatic variables, salinity and litterfall. The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) was used to smooth the raw data and four phenological parameters were estimated: start of season (SOS), time of maximum greenness (Max Green), end of season (EOS) and length of season (LOS). Litterfall showed a distinct seasonal pattern with higher rates during the end of the dry season and during the wet season. Litterfall was positively correlated with temperature (r = 0.88, p < 0.01) and salinity (r = 0.70, p < 0.01). The results revealed that although mangroves are evergreen species the mangrove forest has clear greenness seasonality which is negatively correlated with litterfall and generally lagged behind maximum rainfall. The dates of phenological metrics varied depending on the choice of vegetation indices reflecting the sensitivity of each index to a particular aspect of vegetation growth. NDWI, an index associated to canopy water content and soil moisture had advanced dates of SOS, Max Green and EOS while gNDVI, an index primarily related to canopy chlorophyll content had delayed dates. SOS ranged between day of the year (DOY) 144 (late dry season) and DOY 220 (rainy season) while the EOS occurred between DOY 104 (mid-dry season) to DOY 160 (early rainy season). The length of the growing season ranged between 228 and 264 days. Sites receiving a greater amount of rainfall between January and March showed an advanced SOS and Max Green. This phenological characterisation is useful to understand the mangrove forest dynamics at the landscape scale and to monitor the status of mangrove. In addition the results will serve as a baseline against which to compare future changes in mangrove phonology due to natural or anthropogenic causes.', '[Pastor-Guzman, J.; Dash, Jadunandan; Atkinson, Peter M.] Univ Southampton, Global Environm Change & Earth Observat Res Grp, Geog & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.

In this study, we investigate whether integrating remotely sensed terrestrial water storage changes (TWSC) from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission into a global water resources and use model enables a more realistic representation of the basin hydrology during droughts. For our study, the WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM), which simulates the impact of human water abstractions on surface water and groundwater storage, has been chosen for simulating compartmental water storages and river discharge during the so-called \'Millennium Drought\' (2001-2009). In particular, we test the ability of a parameter calibration and data assimilation (C/DA) approach to introduce long-term trends into WGHM, which are poorly represented due to errors in forcing, model structure and calibration. For the first time, the impact of the parameter equifinality problem on the C/DA results is evaluated. We also investigate the influence of selecting a specific GRACE data product and filtering method on the final C/DA results. Integrating GRACE data into WGHM does not only improve simulation of seasonality and trend of TWSC, but also it improves the simulation of individual water storage components. For example, after the C/DA, correlations between simulated groundwater storage changes and independent in-situ well data increase (up to 0.82) in three out of four sub-basins. Declining groundwater storage trends - found mainly in the south, i.e. Murray Basin, at in-situ wells - have been introduced while simulated soil water and surface water storage do not show trends, which is in agreement with existing literature. Although GRACE C/DA in MDB does not improve river discharge simulations, the correlation between river storage simulations and gauge-based river levels increases significantly from 0.15 to 0.52. By adapting the C/DA settings to the basin-specific characteristics and reducing the number of calibration parameters, their convergence is improved and their uncertainty is reduced. The time-variable parameter values resulting from C/DA allow WGHM to better react to the very wet Australian summer 2009/10. Using solutions from different GRACE data providers produces slightly different C/DA results. We conclude that a rigorous evaluation of GRACE errors is required to realistically account for the spread of the differences in the results.', '[Schumacher, M.] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England.

The method enables an objective estimate (i.e. independent of population density and observational networks) of tornado climatology in forested regions. The method is based on the identification of narrow and elongated areas as forest disturbances obtained using Landsat satellite images and Landsat-based Global Forest Change (GFC) data. These areas were subsequently verified with high-resolution satellite images for verification of a tomadic cause of forest damage. Landsat and MODIS satellite images, weather station observations and reanalysis data were additionally involved in order to determine tornado dates. A minimum F scale tornado intensity was estimated by a Weibull distribution model using information on tornado path lengths and widths. The method is applied to the forested regions of northeast Europe, where 110 tornado tracks were identified between the 2000 and 2014 years, 105 of which were previously unreported and discovered for the first time. For some regions, tornado density estimates using the new method is 2-3 times higher than other previously published estimates. The largest number of tornadoes occurred in 2009, and June is the most favourable month for tornado formation (including strong tornadoes and tornado outbreaks). Most identified tornadoes have path length < 10 km with maximum and mean widths of approximately 200-300 m and 100-200 m, respectively. A few tornadoes with long and wide paths were found; four of them likely had F3 minimal intensity.', '[Shikhov, Andrey] Perm State Univ, Dept Cartog & Geoinformat, Perm, Russia.

Methods for validating burned area products have been developed based on a probability sample of a space by time partitioning of the population. We extend this basic methodology to improve stratification and sample allocation, key elements of a sampling design used to collect burned area reference data. We developed and evaluated an approach to partition each year and biome into low and high burned area (BA) strata. Because the threshold used to separate the sampling units into low and high BA can vary by year and biome, this approach offers a more targeted stratification than used in previous studies for which a common threshold was applied to all biomes. A hypothetical population of validation data was then used to quantitatively compare the precision of accuracy estimates derived from different stratification and sample size allocation options. We evaluated two options that had been previously examined in the BA validation literature, and extended previous studies by adding two new options specifically developed for ratio estimates. Stratification based on mapped BA reduced standard errors of the global burned area accuracy estimates from one-half to one-eighth relative to standard errors of simple random sampling. Stratifying by mapped BA was also found to reduce standard errors of accuracy estimates for most year by biome strata indicating that this advantage of stratification and sample allocation applies generally to a range of conditions (i.e., biomes and years).The most precise estimates were obtained using a sample size per stratum allocation n(h) proportional to N-h root(BA(h)) over bar where N-h is the number of units in stratum h and (BA(h)) over bar is the mean mapped BA for stratum h. The best sampling design from our analyses was then used to select a set of 1,000 samples from a hypothetical population of validation data and confidence intervals were computed for each sample. Close to 95% of these confidence intervals contained the true population value thus confirming the validity of confidence intervals produced from the estimates and standard errors.

(2009) and An et al. (2010), for soil moisture retrieval over agricultural fields covered by several crops. The volume scattering component was first removed from the full coherency matrix. Then, in order to reduce the effect of the incidence angle on the retrieval results, a normalization process at a reference incidence angle was conducted for the first time, on the dominant surface or dihedral scattering component from which the soil moisture was retrieved. The time series of Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) data and the ground measurements of soil and vegetation characteristics collected during the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Validation Experiment in 2012 (SMAPVEX12) were used to compare the three decomposition methods with respect to the scattering mechanisms and the soil moisture retrieval performances. The results show that the performance of each decomposition method for soil moisture retrieval depends on the crop types and the crop phenological stages. Indeed, Freeman-Durden model provided the best results for corn and wheat, Hajnsek decomposition performed well for canola, while better results were obtained for soybean using An decomposition. At the early growth stage, both the surface and dihedral scattering components contributed to retrieve the soil moisture, while at a later crop development, the surface scattering component is almost the only scattering mechanism from which soil moisture was retrieved. Thus, the best performance for soil moisture retrieval was obtained a) at the early crop development stage from Hajnsek decomposition which better integrated the dihedral component and b) at a later growth stage from An decomposition which enhanced the surface scattering. Finally, an overall soil moisture underestimation with RMSE of 0.06-0.11 m(3)/m(3) was observed from the three decompositions, and the highest retrieval rate of 33%-39% was obtained from An decomposition as a result of the enhanced surface scattering.

Although satellite observations provide soil moisture instantaneously at large scale, few studies have addressed the application of satellite soil moisture retrieval in dryland areas with changing land use. In this study, we propose a method to evaluate the spatiotemporal variance of satellite retrieval based on the evaluation of soil moisture retrievals from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). The operation period of this instrument (June 2002 to October 2011) covers the re-vegetation of the semi-arid Loess Plateau. Our study found that AMSR-E retrievals posted by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) capture the spatiotemporal variance of soil moisture in the Loess Plateau, as well as the in-situ measured soil moisture decrease following the massive re-vegetation-despite it differing from the in-situ measurement in spatial scale. Soil moisture decrease in response to the massive re-vegetation occurred in a transition zone of grass-forest ecosystems with annual precipitation between 450 and 550 mm. Our study suggests that current AMSR-E JAXA retrievals are an essential alternative to field measurement and model simulation, because they can identify the location and spatial extent of areas where soil moisture is sensitive to climate change and managed re-vegetation. To avoid the overconsumption of soil water and limited plant growth in transition zone, managers of dryland areas should pay special attention to species selection. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

MODIS data are often used to investigate SGLs, including calculating SGL area changes through time, but no existing work presents a method that tracks changes to individual (and total) SGL volume in MODIS imagery over a melt season. Here, we develop such a method by first testing three automated approaches to derive SGL areas from MODIS images from the MOD09 level-2 surface-reflectance product, by comparing calculated areas for the Paakitsoq and Store Glacier regions in West Greenland with areas derived from Landsat-8 (LS8) images. Second, we apply a physically-based depth-calculation algorithm to the pixels within the SGL boundaries from the best performing area-derivation method, and compare the resultant depths with those calculated using the same method applied to LS8 imagery. Our results indicate that SGL areas are most accurately generated using dynamic thresholding of MODIS band 1 (red) MOD09 data with a 0.640 threshold value; calculated values from MODIS are closely comparable to those derived from LS8. Third, we incorporate the best performing area- and depth-detection methods into a Fully Automated SGL Tracking (\"FAST\") algorithm that tracks individual SGLs between successive MODIS images. Finally, we apply the FAST algorithm to the two study regions, where it identifies 43 (Paakitsoq) and 19 (Store Glacier) rapidly draining SGLs during 2014, representing 21% and 15% of the respective total SGL populations, including some clusters of rapidly draining SGLs. The FAST algorithm improves upon existing automatic SGL tracking methods through its calculation of both SGL areas and volumes over large regions of the GrIS on a fully automatic basis. It therefore has the potential to be used for investigating statistical relationships between SGL areas, volumes and drainage events over the whole of the GrIS, and over multiple seasons, which might provide further insights into the factors that trigger rapid SGL drainage.

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing data are very useful for monitoring rice growth. Therefore, this paper focuses on building a robust, accurate and operational scheme for phenology estimation based on SAR and multi spectral remote sensing data. The proposed scheme has three main improvements. First, two main types of rice field - transplanted indica rice field (TRF) and direct-sown japonica rice field (DRF) - were considered individually. Second, 149 SAR signatures and optical Vegetation Indices (Vls) were extracted from time-series of optical and full/compact-pol SAR data and a novel feature selection method based on Monte Carlo experiments and the correlation limitation (MCCL) was proposed. Third, six different phenological labeling cases were considered, with the multiclass relevant vector machine (mRVM) being used to identify different stages. Based on the improvements above, we generated the optimal feature matrix based on the MCCL; this matrix consisted of the optimal feature subset (OFS) used for the identification of each stage. The overall phenological estimation accuracy (OPEA) based on the optical Vls and SAR signatures together (86.59%), was shown to be better than that based on either the optical Vls or the SAR signatures only. In addition, it was significant to consider the differences between the DRF and TRF for rice phenology estimation. The OPEA was higher than 85% when the DRF and TRF were considered separately, much higher than the accuracy obtained (68.89%) when the differences between the DRF and TRF were ignored. Lastly, the availability of the proposed feature selection method MCCL was discussed. It was found that the best OPEA was generated using the OFS selected by the proposed MCCL when the dimensions of the OFS were kept small. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In the United States, these metrics are reported weekly at state or district (multiple counties) levels by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) using field observations provided by trained local reporters. However, the ground data collection process supporting this effort is time consuming and subjective. Furthermore, operational crop management and yield estimation efforts require information with more granularity than at the state or district level. This paper evaluates remote sensing approaches for mapping crop phenology using vegetation index time-series generated by fusing Landsat and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) surface reflectance imagery to improve temporal sampling over that provided by Landsat alone. The case study focuses on an agricultural region in central Iowa from 2001 to 2014. Our objectives are 1) to assess Landsat-MODIS data fusion results over cropland; 2) to map crop phenology at 30 m resolution using fused surface reflectance data; and 3) to identify the relationships between remotely sensed crop phenology metrics and the crop progress stages reported by NASS. The results show that detailed spatial and temporal variability in vegetation development across this landscape can be identified using the fused Landsat-MODIS data. The mean difference (bias) in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) between actual Landsat observations and the fused Landsat-MODIS data, generated for Landsat overpass dates, is in the range of 0.011 to 0.028 for every year. The derived phenological metrics show distinct features for different crops and natural vegetation at field scales. Strong correlations are observed between remotely sensed phenological stages, based on NDVI curve inflection points, and the observed crop physiological growth stages from the NASS Crop Progress (CP) reports. The green-up dates detected from remote sensing data typically occurred during crop vegetative stages when 2-4 leaves were developed for both corn and soybeans, or about 1-3 weeks after the reported emergence dates when the plant were first visible to ground based observers. Despite being a lagging indicator, remotely sensed green-up can be used effectively to backcast emergence, e.g. as input to spatially distributed crop models. The differences in green-up date between corn and soybean were 8-10 days, consistent with the offset in emergence dates reported by NASS at district level. The reported harvest dates were typically about 2-3 weeks after the dormancy stage was detected via remote sensing for corn and about 1-2 weeks for soybeans. This suggests that probable harvest times for individual fields may be predicted 1-3 weeks ahead using remote sensing data. The results suggest that crop phenology and certain growth stages at field scales (30 m spatial resolution) can be linked and mapped by integrating imagery from multiple remote sensing platforms.

Sentinel-2 images provide four 10 m bands and six 20 m bands. To provide more explicit spatial information, this paper aims to downscale the six 20 m bands to 10 m spatial resolution using the four directly observed 10 m bands. The outcome of this fusion task is the production of 10 Sentinel-2 bands with 10 m spatial resolution. This new fusion problem involves four fine spatial resolution bands, which is different to, and more complex than, the common pan-sharpening fusion problem which involves only one fine band. To address this, we extend the existing two main families of image fusion approaches (i.e., component substitution, CS, and multiresolution analysis, MRA) with two different schemes, a band synthesis scheme and a band selection scheme. Moreover, the recently developed area-to-point regression kriging (ATPRK) approach was also developed and applied for the Sentinel-2 fusion task. Using two Sentinel-2 datasets released online, the three types of approaches (eight CS and MRA-based approaches, and ATPRK) were compared comprehensively in terms of their accuracies to provide recommendations for the task of fusion of Sentinel-2 images. The downscaled ten band 10 m Sentinel-2 datasets represent important and promising products for a wide range of applications in remote sensing. They also have potential for blending with the upcoming Sentinel-3 data for fine spatio-temporal resolution monitoring at the global scale.

A challenge of this model in regard to surface reflectance anisotropy effects comes from its underestimation of the directional reflectance signatures near the Sun illumination direction; also known as the hotspot effect. In this study, a method has been developed for improving the ability of the RTLSR model to simulate the magnitude and width of the hotspot effect. The method corrects the volumetric scattering component of the RTLSR model using an exponential approximation of a physical hotspot kernel, which recreates the hotspot magnitude and width using two free parameters (C-1 and C-2, respectively). The approach allows one to reconstruct, with reasonable accuracy, the hotspot effect by adjusting or using the prior values of these two hotspot variables. Our results demonstrate that: (1) significant improvements in capturing hotspot effect can be made to this method by using the invested hotspot parameters; (2) the reciprocal nature allow this method to be more adaptive for simulating the hotspot height and width with high accuracy, especially in cases where hotspot signatures are available; and (3) while the new approach is consistent with the heritage RTLSR model inversion used to estimate intrinsic narrowband and broadband albedos, it presents some differences for vegetation clumping index (CI) retrievals. With the hotspot-related model parameters determined a priori, this method offers improved performance for various ecological remote sensing applications; including the estimation of canopy structure parameters.

The \'Soil-Canopy Observation Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes\' (SCOPE) model, which combines radiative transfer and enzyme kinetics of photosynthesis with turbulent heat exchange in vegetation canopies, was partly inverted to obtain model parameters from R taken over healthy (unstressed) crops during the growing season. Reflectance spectra between 400 and 900 nm obtained at midday on different days in the growing season were used to obtain pigment concentrations, leaf area index and leaf inclination. These parameters were then used to simulate diurnal cycles of half-hourly ChIF spectra, using measured weather variables as input. Three scenarios were simulated: (i) a constant emission efficiency of ChIF (at the photosystem level), (ii) a variable emission efficiency calculated per half hour with an electron transport, photosynthesis and ChlF model for the photosystem, and (iii) a constant emission efficiency that was set to a theoretical maximum value for fully blocked photochemical electron transport of photosystem II and minimal non-photochemical quenching. The simulations of the first two scenarios were compared to ChIF retrieved from field measurements in the O-2-A band with the spectral fitting method in unstressed rice and alfalfa. This comparison and a sensitivity analysis showed that SCOPE reproduces most of the seasonal variability of SIF after tuning to R even if the ChlF emission efficiency is kept constant, and F760 values are mostly determined by chlorophyll content, dry matter, senescent material and leaf area and leaf inclination, whereas leaf water and carotenoid content had small effects. Diurnal variations in the ChIF emission efficiency at photosystem level were small in these crops. The simulations of the third scenario were compared to measurements of grass that was treated chemically to block electron transport and to provoke maximum ChlF. This comparison showed that the observed increase in F760 can indeed be explained by a change in the ChIF emission efficiency at the photo system level. It is concluded that hyperspectral reflectance and the ChIF signal together can reveal both the dynamics of vegetation structure and functioning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Objectives included comparing the performance of Landsat 7- and 8-derived inputs separately and combined in mapping tree height at a regional scale, assessing the relative value of good observation counts and different Landsat spectral inputs for tree height estimation across a range of environments, and describing tree height distributions and discontinuities in Sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 5371 images were processed and per pixel quality assessed to create a set of multi-temporal metrics for the 2013 and 2014 calendar years for Landsat 7 only, Landsat 8 only and both Landsat 7 and 8 combined. Differences in performance were slight between different sensor inputs. However, performance generally improved with increasing numbers of good observations. Metrics derived from red reflectance data contributed most in estimating tree height. The regression tree algorithm accurately reproduced theLiDAR-derived height training data with an overall mean absolute error (MAE) for tree height estimation of 2.45 m using integrated Landsat 7 and 8 data. Significant underestimations were quantified for tall tree cover (MAE of 4.65 m for >20 m heights) and overestimations for low/no tree cover (MAE 1.61 for <5 m heights). Resulting tree distributions were found to be discontinuous with a primary dry seasonal woodlands cluster of 510 m in height, a second cluster of primarily dry evergreen forest tree cover from 11-17 m, and a third cluster of humid evergreen forest tree cover >= 18 m. The integration of Landsat 7 and 8 and forthcoming Sentinel 2 time-series optical data to extend the value of LiDAR forest structure measurements is recommended. (C) 2016 The Authors.

In contrast, detecting fires from space faster than current conventional capabilities in the continental U.S. has not been considered attainable, except in remote, sparsely populated areas. We present a research prototype version of the GOES Early Fire Detection (GOES-EFD) algorithm focused on minimizing the time to first detection of a wildfire incident. The algorithm is designed for regional-scale surveillance and combines multitemporal anomaly tests developed in our previous work, contextual hot-spot tests, and dynamic event classification and tracking. The GOES-EFD version 0.4 was initially tested with 40-day summer 2006 data over central California. The algorithm identified most of large (final size> 2 ha) wildfires within 30 min and 31% of the wildfires were detected before they were reported by the public. Under identical operation conditions, GOES-EFD 0.4 provided quicker initial detection than the temporally filtered operational WF-ABBA algorithm (version 6.1) and committed fewer false alarms. There is a substantial potential for further reducing detection latency and increasing reliability. Following the ongoing optimizations, tests, and integration in collaboration with the fire management agencies and first responders, GOES-EFD could be deployed for regional scale real-time surveillance to complement existing fire identification methods.

This study develops an automated approach to overcome the above challenges and to correctly determine SSHs by combining DMS images, ATM L1B\'s apparent reflectivity and statistical discrimination. Dynamic pixel intensity thresholds are established to classify leads under different solar illuminations. This automated approach is then validated by manual selection in detecting SSHs. The high agreement of SSHs from this automated approach with those from manual selection indicates the reliability and usefulness of this approach. Within a 45-km section of one ATM L1B file, SSH demonstrates a linear gradient, which is applied to derive SSHs where there are no leads. The resulted SSHs are then used to compute total freeboard and ice thickness. This automated approach is also tried to retrieve SSH and then compute the total freeboard on one entire IceBridge sea ice flight each in Arctic and Antarctica. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Monitoring surface deformation over permafrost will help to understand the dynamics of these processes, assess climate changes, and prevent potential damages to engineering structures underlain by permafrost. This article employs an improved small baseline subset lnterferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-InSAR) technique to monitor the surface deformation over the Danxiong-Yangbajing area in the southern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), with emphasis on climatic factors modeling. A new deformation model considering both the external (mainly climatic) and internal factors (such as tectonic activities and thermal character of frozen soil) is constructed and introduced into the SBAS-InSAR to estimate the surface deformation over permafrost. The results show that the peak-to-peak annual deformation over natural surface is 3.6-5.0 cm, while that along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway (QTH) and the Qinghai-Tibet Railway (QTR) is 2.8-3.7 cm. We also find that the surface deformation over frozen soil is negatively correlated to air temperature and precipitation, with the correlation being -0.80 to -0.45 and -0.95 to -0.75, respectively. The root mean squares (RMSs) of the residual (un-modeled) deformation got by the proposed method are much smaller than that by the existing methods. We also successfully examine a time lag of about 60 days between the retrieved maximal subsidence and the highest air temperature in warm seasons (from May to September). After compensating for this time lag, the RMSs of the residual deformation reduce significantly and the correlation between the deformation and the temperature rises considerably, varying from -0.95 to -0.65. The method presented in this paper is more suitable to model and analyze the surface deformation in permafrost areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This type of information would facilitate timely field studies and enable more rapid counter measures, as well as enable studies of the dynamics of an insect outbreak. In this study we developed a method based on MODIS derived NDVI for near real-time monitoring of insect induced forest defoliation in a subalpine birch forest in northern Sweden. The method is based on deviations from a seasonal trajectory of NDVI representing forest conditions without disturbances. A Kalman filter is applied to handle noise and satellite derived NDVI observations of low quality, and cumulative sums (CUSUM) of the deviations from the seasonal trajectory representing undisturbed forests are used to detect disturbances. An annual offset of the seasonal trajectory is introduced in CUSUM to handle inter-annual variability in the start of season. Evaluation of the method showed that 74% of the defoliation was detected with a misclassification of undisturbed areas of 39% in MODIS pixels with at least 50% birch forest cover. The ability of the method to detect defoliation can be adjusted to fit the purpose of a study; with a higher threshold applied, 100% of the defoliation in the evaluation data was detected with 56% of the undisturbed areas misclassified as defoliated. The method also facilitates studies of the intraseasonal temporal dynamics of an insect outbreak, which is a major advantage compared to methods that classifies pixels into undisturbed or defoliated for an entire season. Furthermore, the method can be extended to monitor within-season refoliation after an insect outbreak. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Its long record of terminus retreat measurements (1800-present) shows multi-decadal oscillations and more recently a slowing down of the retreat. Its complex dynamics are also indicated by studies of proglacial melt-water at the terminus. However, there have been no systematic measurements of its surface velocity or how it changes seasonally or over longer-term time scales. Here, I have characterized the spatiotemporal variations of surface velocity of the Gangotri glacier using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data spanning nearly two decades (1991-2011).   The main findings are as follows: (1) The glacier undergoes seasonal fluctuations in surface velocities: there was a clear summer speedup of similar to 57%-126% compared to winter velocities between 0 and 12.6 km from the terminus, with peak summer speeds of 63.1 +/- 5.4 m/yr in 1992, 66.6 +/- 6.0 m/yr in 1999, 58.2 +/- 4.5 m/yr in 2004 and 42.8 +/- 4.2 m/yr in 2007 whereas winter speeds were relatively stable (25-30 m/yr) during the same period. This summer speedup is indicative of increased basal sliding, known to occur when melt-waters penetrate to the glacier bed resulting in reduced friction. (2) These summer velocities exhibited an inter-annual reduction, which was manifest as a reduction in summer speed up from >120% in 2004 to <60% in 2007. This pattern continued into 2011, despite the availability of abundant melt-water during those years. This inter-annual reduction indicates the formation of increasingly efficient melt-water channels year on year resulting in lesser lubrication at the glacier-bed interface.   My results show that the Gangotri glacier is dynamic throughout its length with systematic spatiotemporal variations in surface velocity that elucidate its subglacial processes. Based on my results and other evidence in the literature, I propose that the subglacial drainage system of the Gangotri glacier is subject to seasonal and inter annual hydrodynamic coupling between winters and melt-seasons akin to other glaciers.

Moreover, it is also difficult for traditional fixed-site monitoring to capture the substantial spatial variability of PM2.5 over dense urban areas or regions with significant topography. Hence, recent developments in satellite based remote-sensing allowing the reconstruction of long-term, wide-area and high-resolution estimates of current and historical PM2.5 concentration is an important step forward, allowing the quantification of the long-term pollution exposure of PM2.5 in developing cities and in dense urban areas using the satellite-derived PM2.5 data. In this study, instead of just looking at the spatial average PM2.5 concentrations, we have studied the long-term population exposure of PM2.5 by analyzing the population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations at regional, city and district scales by combining 1 km x 1 km satellite-derived PM2.5 and population density data sets. The variation of population exposure to PM2.5 across the urban areas in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region from 2000 to 2014 was studied. Our result shows that the PM2.5 concentrations over the PRD increased steadily from 2000 to 2004, remained at quite a high level through 2008 and then started to decline after 2009. More importantly, our analysis also shows that, at regional, city and district levels, the population-weighted mean PM2.5 concentrations from data with 1 km resolutions are typically the highest, followed by the population-weighted mean PM2.5 concentrations from data with 10 km resolutions and then the simple spatial PM2.5 averages. This suggests that the use of simple spatial concentrations can lead to systematic underestimation of the overall population exposure and the associated health impacts. This systematic difference is related to the positive correlation between PM2.5 pollutant concentration and population density, and shows the usefulness of using high-resolution satellite-retrieved PM2.5 concentrations to quantify the overall population exposure. The higher population weighted mean PM2.5 concentration in comparison with simple spatial average indicates that, for more effective reduction of overall population exposure and protection of public health, control efforts must be further targeted at high-population high-pollution areas, and land-use and city planning should also encourage population to redistribute away from the highly polluted areas.

The uncertainty estimates are derived independently of in-situ data. This enables validation of both the retrieved SSTs and their uncertainty estimate using in-situ data records. The total uncertainty budget is comprised of a number of components, arising from uncorrelated (e.g. noise), locally systematic (e.g. atmospheric), large scale systematic and sampling effects (for gridded products). The importance of distinguishing these components arises in propagating uncertainty across spatio-temporal scales. We apply the method to SST data retrieved from the Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and validate the results for two different SST retrieval algorithms, both at a per pixel level and for gridded data. We find good agreement between our estimated uncertainties and validation data. This approach to calculating uncertainties in SST retrievals has a wider application to data from other instruments and retrieval of other geophysical variables. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

For the first target, a learning mechanism is presented to estimate selfhood scales; for the second target, two methods (i.e., \"zipper merging\" and \"restricted forest\") using the learned selfhood scales are proposed to respectively improve per-pixel and object-based classification results. The experimental results demonstrate that these methods achieve significant improvements in both per-pixel and object-based land cover mapping in urban areas as their overall accuracies are improved by 2.8% and 7.6% respectively. Moreover, the proposed methods are further used to generate land cover maps in Beijing and Zhuhai cities, which perform much better than the classical methods. Accordingly, it can be concluded that selfhood scales are effective to improve land cover mapping in urban areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The majority of studies to date focused on the impacts light pollution has on our ability to view the night sky, as well as on biodiversity, ecosystems and humans. However, in recent years, with the emergence of new high spatial resolution sensors, providing detailed evaluation of night lights at the local level, more attention has been given for estimating and quantifying artificial light within cities. In this study, we evaluate urban night lights within the city of Jerusalem by combining data from two remote sensing tools: ground measurements using Sky Quality Meter (SQM) devices and space-borne measurements using EROS-B night light imagery. In addition, we examined the use of the SQM for evaluating artificial light in different view directions: upwards, downwards and horizontally. Differences in night lights were found between the three SQM view directions, with the brightest values measured in the horizontal direction (8.7-18.9 mag(SQM) arcsec(-2), and darlcest values in the downwards direction (11.2-19.5 mag(SQM) arcsec(-2)). The downwards SQM measurements were influenced by surface albedo, the horizontal direction was the most exposed to direct lights from buildings and cars, while in most locations the upwards direction represented skyglow. Using quantile regression we found strong correlations between the SQM and EROS-B brightness values. Statistically significant correlations (R-2 = 0.53) were found between the upwards and downwards devices to the EROS-B in the 0.95 quantile, as well as between the horizontal device to the EROS-B in the 0.90 quantile (R-2 = 0.44). In addition to local and external light sources, bright areas on the EROS-B image were associated with areas of low vegetation cover and high albedo. This study provides evidence for the correspondence between field and space-borne measurements of artificial lights and emphasizes the need for better understanding of light pollution at the local level and for taking into account of the three dimensional nature of light pollution.

We tested the new approach by using Landsat TM data collected in 2001 and 2009 at the Beijing metropolitan region. We found that: 1) an object-based backdating approach achieved higher accuracy for change detection, LULC classification and change analysis than the pixel-based backdating approach. With the object-based approach, the overall accuracies for the classification and change analysis were 84.33% (versus 69.33% for a pixel-based approach), and 80.00% (versus 70.50% for a pixel-based approach), respectively. 2) The object-based backdating approach greatly increases the efficiency because classification and change analysis are only conducted for locations with changes.

However, they acquire images at view angles 7.5 degrees from nadir that cause small directional effects in the surface reflectance. There are also variations with solar zenith angle over the year that can cause apparent change in reflectance even if the surface properties remain constant. When Landsat data from adjoining paths, or from long time series are used, a model of the surface anisotropy is required to adjust all Landsat observations to a uniform nadir view (primarily for visual consistency, vegetation monitoring, or detection of subtle surface changes). Here a generalized approach is developed to provide consistent view angle corrections across the Landsat archive. While this approach is not applicable for generation of Landsat surface albedo, which requires a full characterization of the surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), or for correction to a constant solar illumination angle across a wide range of sun angles, it provides Landsat nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) for a range of terrestrial monitoring applications.   The Landsat NBAR is derived as the product of the observed Landsat reflectance and the ratio of the reflectances modeled using MODIS BRDF spectral model parameters for the observed Landsat and for a nadir view and fixed solar zenith geometry. In this study, a total of 567 conterminous United States (CONUS) January and July 2010 Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) images that have swath edge overlapping paths sensed in alternating backscatter and forward scattering orientations were used. The average difference between Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM + surface reflectance in the forward and backward scatter directions at the overlapping Landsat scan edges was quantified. The CONUS July view zenith BRDF effects were about 0.02 in the Landsat visible bands, and about 0.03, 0.05 and 0.06, in the 2.1 mu m, 1.6 mu m and near infrared bands respectively. Comparisons of Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM + NBAR derived using MODIS BRDF spectral model parameters defined with respect to different spatial and temporal scales, and defined with respect to different land cover types, were undertaken. The results suggest that, because the BRDF shapes of different terrestrial surfaces are sufficiently similar over the narrow 15 Landsat field of view, a fixed set of MODIS BRDF spectral model parameters may be adequate for Landsat NBAR derivation with little sensitivity to the land cover type, condition, or surface disturbance. A fixed set of BRDF spectral model parameters, derived from a global year of highest quality snow-free MODIS BRDF product values, are provided so users may implement the described Landsat NBAR generation method.

MODIS 16-day 250 m NDVI imagery for the GLB was used in conjunction with National Land Cover Database (NLCD) from 2001, 2006 and 2011, and the Cropland Data Layers (CDL) from 2011 to 2014 to conduct classification evaluations. Inter-class separability was measured by Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distances between selected cover type pairs (both general classes and specific crops), and intra-class variability was measured by calculating simple Euclidean distance for samples within cover types. For the GLB, we found that the application of a smoothing algorithm significantly reduced image noise compared to the raw data. However, the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) measures for smoothed NDVI temporal profiles resulted in large inconsistencies. Of the five algorithms tested, only the Fourier transformation algorithm and Whittaker smoother improved inter-class separability for corn soybean class pair and significantly improved overall classification accuracy. When compared to the raw NDVI data as input, the overall classification accuracy from the Fourier transformation and Whittaker smoother improved performance by approximately 2-6% for some years. Conversely, the asymmetric Gaussian and double-logistic smoothing algorithms actually led to degradation of classification performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this study we evaluated the effects of such errors on statistical estimates of growing stock volume using model-assisted and model-based estimation. With model-assisted estimation, positional errors affect the model parameter estimates for the models that are used as part of the estimation framework. In addition, positional errors affect the estimators, since the deviations between model predictions and field measurements are often larger than they would have been without positional errors. Using model-based estimation positional errors affect the model parameter estimates and thus the estimators. We compared the effects of positional errors in model-assisted and model-based estimation through Monte Carlo sampling simulation in a simulated study area resembling the forest conditions in Kuortane, western Finland. The forest population was created using a copula modelling approach based on field, Landsat and LiDAR data. We found that positional errors led to slightly biased estimators, and estimators with larger variances compared to the cases where data were perfectly geo-located. The relative increase of the variances of the estimators was of equal magnitude for model-assisted and model-based estimation, when models were developed and applied to data with geopositional errors. Further, the variance estimators were always more precise for the model-based estimators compared to the model-assisted estimators. When the models were developed based on perfectly geo-located data but applied to data with positional errors, model-based estimation was superior to model-assisted estimation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Interference Pattern Technique (IPT) based on the analysis of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) estimated by a GNSS receiver, presents the main advantage of being applicable everywhere by using a single geodetic antenna and receiver, transforming them to real tide gauges. Classical SNR analysis method used to estimate the variations of the reflecting surface height h(t) has a limited domain of validity due to its variation rate dh/dt (t) assumed to be negligible. We present here a significant advance in this altimetric methodology using GNSS multipath to conjointly estimate h(t) and g (0 over areas characterized by high amplitudes of tides and presence of waves. It drastically enhances the temporal and spatial monitoring of tides and waves. Inversion approach is based on a Least Square Method (ISM), combining simultaneous measurements from different GNSS constellations (GPS, GLONASS). Our method is validated with SNR data acquired on an offshore site of 60-meter height, in conditions were assumptions of the classical SNR analysis method are not valid (i.e. with a semi-diurnal tide amplitude of similar to 4 m, vertical velocity of the sea surface due to tide reaching 0.2 mm/s, and presence of waves with amplitude up to few meters). Linear correlation between the estimates with our method and tide gauges records are better than 0.97, whereas it only equals 0.82 with the classical method over the whole 3 months of acquisition. Our dynamic SNR method allows a very good estimate of the main tide periods and permits to detect swell and waves with realistic amplitudes and periods, which is not the case with tide gauges (located in protected areas) or classical SNR analysis method.

We assess three forested ecosystems: a mature, closed-canopy deciduous broadleaf forest; a mature evergreen needleleaf forest; and a Loblolly pine plantation with a range of even-aged stands. For individual tree based approaches, individual tree metrics improve explanatory power from R-2 = 057 to R-2 = 0.85 in the mature conifer site, but do not show statistically significant improvements in the other two sites. We suggest that with large field sample plots in areas of open canopy cover, individual tree metrics can significantly improve aboveground biomass (AGBM) estimation as they directly take into account stand density. Regarding scalingbased approaches, we demonstrate that the proposed methods are currently unsuitable at local scales in forests without a tight relationship between canopy top height and basal area, as seen in two of our study areas. Individual tree information shows promise for improving AGBM modeling capabilities, and may also facilitate scalingbased approaches, but further research regarding the application of allometric equations and the spatial scale of models is necessary to continue advancing the field of high-resolution forest biomass accounting.

Here we provide a two-stage framework of long-term mapping of urban areas at an annual frequency in Beijing, China, over the period from 1984 to 2013. Classification for each year was carried out initially based on a number of Landsat scenes within that year using spectral information from a base image plus NDVI time series derived from all scenes. A temporal consistency check involving both temporal filtering and heuristic reasoning was then applied to the sequence of classified urban maps for further improvement. We assessed this time-series of urban maps based on two schemes. One is change detection in rapidly developing areas over the past three decades, and the other is accuracy assessment over the whole region in four selected years (i.e., 1984, 1990, 2000 and 2013). Based on validation using independent samples, the 0As (overall accuracies) of these four years are 96%, 93%, 92% and 95%, respectively. Meanwhile, the average accuracy of change detection for all years is 83%. In addition, the proposed temporal consistency check was found to be able to make considerable improvements (about 6%) to the overall accuracies and results of change detection. The resultant urban land sequence revealed that the average growth rates were 47.51 +/- 4.17 km(2)/year, 34.65 +/- 2.90 km(2)/year and 99.48 +/- 1.3 km(2)/year for 1984-1990, 1990-2000 and 2000-2013, respectively.

Indirect estimation entails constructing models of the relationship between the response variable of interest and remotely sensed auxiliary variables at two times and then estimating change as the differences in the model predictions for the two times. Direct estimation entails constructing models of change directly using observations of change in the response and the remotely sensed auxiliary variables for two dates. The direct method is generally preferred, although few statistically rigorous comparisons have been reported. This study focused on statistically rigorous, indirect and direct estimation of biomass change using forest inventory and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data for a Norwegian study area. Three sets of statistical estimators were used: simple random sampling estimators, indirect model-assisted regression estimators, and direct model-assisted regression estimators. In addition, three modeling approaches were used to support the direct model-assisted estimators. The study produced four relevant findings. First, use of the ALS auxiliary information greatly increased the precision of change estimates, regardless of whether indirect or direct methods were used. Second, contrary to previously reported results, the indirect method produced greater precision for the study area mean than the traditional direct method. Third, the direct method that used models whose predictor variables were selected in pairs but with separate coefficient estimates and models whose predictor variables were selected without regard to pairing produced the greatest precision. Finally, greater emphasis should be placed on the effects of model extrapolations for values of independent variables in the population that are beyond the range of the variables in the sample.

Due to the often remote location of glaciers in inaccessible and high-mountain terrain, satellite observations frequently provide the only available measurements. Furthermore, satellite data provide observations of glacier characteristics that are difficult to monitor using ground-based measurements, thus complementing the latter. In the Glaciers_cci project of the European Space Agency (ESA), three of these characteristics are investigated in detail: glacier area, elevation change and surface velocity. We use (a) data from optical sensors to derive glacier outlines, (b) digital elevation models from at least two points in time, (c) repeat altimetry for determining elevation changes, and (d) data from repeat optical and microwave sensors for calculating surface velocity. For the latter, the two sensor types provide complementary information in terms of spatio-temporal coverage. While (c) and (d) can be generated mostly automatically, (a) and (b) require the intervention of an analyst. Largely based on the results of various round robin experiments (multi-analyst benchmark studies) for each of the products, we suggest and describe the most suitable algorithms for product creation and provide recommendations concerning their practical implementation and the required post-processing. For some of the products (area, velocity) post-processing can influence product quality more than the main-processing algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Operationally, techniques are used to flag contaminated retrievals; however, these techniques are less precise in removing dust-contaminated values. A commonly stated metric of quality for SST daytime retrievals is 0.5 degrees C; thus dust contents that produce errors greater than this value should be of concern. Here we report on significant correlation between potential SST error and observed aerosol optical depths (AOD) that was found in the tropical region dominated by Saharan dust. Utilizing a radiative transfer model with variable dust contents and typical vertical distributions, errors greater than the desired 0.5 degrees C accuracy are observed for dust AODs as low as 0.05. Errors of over 1 degrees C occur with 0.25 AOD. Analysis of the AERONET data from Cape Verde, which includes the Saharan Air layer off the west coast of Africa, reveals that 90% of the days during the boreal summer are found to have AOD amounts that correspond to error greater than 0.5 degrees C. We found that a correction accurate within 0.25 degrees C requires a mean accuracy of 0.1 AOD and proper vertical placement of the dust layer within 250 m. While empirical SST retrievals often have some measure of climatological dust contamination built into them, this work shows that typical variability in dust loadings is a non-trivial error source against SST retrieval goals.

Recently a new program (named Fmask) designed to accomplish these tasks was introduced for use with images from Landsats 4-7 (Zhu & Woodcock, 2012). In this paper, there are the following: (1) improvements in the Fmask algorithm for Landsats 4-7; (2) a new version for use with Landsat 8 that takes advantage of the new cirrus band; and (3) a prototype algorithm for Sentinel 2 images. Though Sentinel 2 images do not have a thermal band to help with cloud detection, the new cirrus band is found to be useful for detecting clouds, especially for thin cirrus clouds. By adding a new cirrus cloud probability and removing the steps that use the thermal band, the Sentinel 2 scenario achieves significantly better results than the Landsats 4-7 scenario for all 7 images tested. For Landsat 8, almost all the Fmask algorithm components are the same as for Landsats 4-7, except a new cirrus cloud probability is calculated using the new cirrus band, which improves detection of thin cirrus clouds.

However, estimating DOC from optical remote sensing requires a robust relationship between CDOM and DOC. This is particularly problematic for reservoirs because they have variable dissolved organic matter composition that complicates the CDOM-DOC relationship. We investigated six manmade reservoirs along a temperate to tropical gradient that represent a range of reservoir types and watershed conditions to determine whether a linear relation between CDOM and DOC could be established. We measured CDOM absorption and DOC concentration during the wet and dry seasons in the six reservoirs. We found the CDOM absorption coefficient and CDOM spectral slope were uncorrelated due to exogenous DOC inputs from multiple sources. Alone, the absorption coefficient of CDOM was a poor predictor of DOC concentration. Including both CDOM absorption coefficient and spectral slope in a multiple regression accounted for both composition and concentration, significantly improving the regression r(2). By using both CDOM absorption coefficient and spectral slope, we identify a framework for a potential solution to overcome the influence of dissolved organic matter source and transformation history on the CDOM-DOC relationship. We conclude that local variability, seasonality and optical complexity should be considered in remote sensing based approaches for global freshwater DOC estimation.

A method integrating these two remotely sensed data sets is presented in this study. Snow depth retrieval is performed using microwave brightness temperature at 19 and 37 GHz from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and the Special Sensor Microwave Image/Sounder (SSMI/S), and visible/infrared surface reflectance from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroadiometer (MODIS) products. Microwave brightness temperature provides information about the volume of snow pack, and visible/infrared surface reflectance can indicate snow presence and surface grain size. With these two remote sensing data sets, snow depth is retrieved by a nonlinear data mining technique, the modified sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm for support vector machine (SVM) regression. The proposed method is tested by using 16,329 records of dry snow measured at 54 meteorological stations in Xinjiang, China over an area of 1.6 million km(2) from 2000 to 2009. The root mean square error (RMSE), relative RMSE and the correlation coefficient of our method are 621 cm, 0.64 and 0.87, respectively. These results are better than those obtained using only brightness temperature data (8.80 cm, 0.90 and 0.73), the traditional spectral polarization difference (SPD) algorithm (15.07 cm, 1.54 and 0.58), a modified Chang algorithm in WESTDC (9.80 cm, 1.00 and 0.62), or the multilayer perceptron classifier of artificial neural networks (ANN) (9.23 cm, 0.94 and 0.72). The daily snow water equivalent (SWE) retrieved by this method has an RMSE of 8.05 mm and a correlation of 0.84, which are better than those of NASA NSIDC (32.87 mm and 0.47) or Globsnow (19.07 mm and 0.59). This study demonstrates that the combination of visible/infrared surface reflectance and microwave brightness temperature via an SVM regression can provide a more accurate retrieval of snow depth.

For continental hydrology, its use is complicated by a number of environmental factors such as river width and shape, land cover type in the vicinity of the river banks, and the topography of the relief. These factors make precision vary significantly. Locations where the satellites cross the river can be used as \"virtual gauging stations\" that can complement the existing network of in situ stations. This article describes processing techniques that take some of these environmental factors (river shape and width) into account to improve the precision of altimetry measurements of the water level. These techniques are based on some a priori information about the river banks and on modeling a phenomenon called \"off-nadir hooking\". This approach is tested on the Sao Francisco River in Brazil, which for most of its path is considered narrow for satellite altimetry applied to hydrology. Data from Envisat cover the period 2002-2010 while the recently launched SARAL satellite provided data for 2013. The results show that the accuracy varies significantly depending on a number of environmental factors some of which are discussed in depth. In about one-half of the 16 satellite water gauging stations, the RMS errors are lower than 60 cm and in some cases better than 30 cm. These variations could not be directly related to the river width, but appear to be mostly related to the land cover and to the processing chain that often extracts altimetry points from an off-nadir location. All processing is fully described and the results are presented for both the Envisat/RA-2 and SARAL/Altika altimeters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Generally, temporal measurement or monitoring of LAI is challenging or even impossible in remote areas. High-temporal resolution remote sensing imaging can be used to estimate LAI from vegetation indices calculated from band ratios. This paper shows the sensitivity of LAI estimation from satellite imaging to atmospheric correction (with ATCOR) and evaluates the effects of LAI uncertainty on water balance modelling. LAI as a SVAT model input parameter was estimated based on the empirical relationship between field measurements, and the vegetation indices NDVI (Normalized-Difference Vegetation Index), SAVI (Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index) and SARVI (Soil-Atmosphere Resistant Vegetation Index) for six RapidEye images obtained between 2011 and 2012. In summary, we found that the ATCOR parameter \'visibility\' has the strongest influence on LAI estimation. Likewise, atmospherically corrected successive images gathered from around the same time period had low LAI differences (mean absolute difference of 0.09 +/- 0.08) on overlapping image areas. This uncertainty is negligible in SVAT modelling in most cases, thereby allowing mosaicked successive atmospherically corrected images to be used. We showed that LAI uncertainties arising from atmospheric correction (ATCOR 3) can translate into small (LAI +/- 0.1 approximate to evapotranspiration +/- 0.9%, interception +/- 2.5%, evaporation +/- 33%, transpiration +/- 0.7%) to moderate (LAI +/- 0.3 approximate to evapotranspiration +/- 4.1%, interception +/- 7.5%, evaporation +/- 9.9%, transpiration +/- 2.4%) SVAT model uncertainty.

Landsat data provides the necessary spatial, temporal and spectral detail to map and analyze forest cover and forest change processes. With the opening of the Landsat archive, new opportunities arise to monitor forest dynamics on regional to continental scales. In this study we analyzed changes in forest types, forest disturbances, and forest recovery for the Carpathian ecoregion in Eastern Europe. We generated a series of image composites at five year intervals between 1985 and 2010 and utilized a hybrid analysis strategy consisting of radiometric change classification, post-classification comparison and continuous index- and segment-based post-disturbance recovery assessment. For validation of the disturbance map we used a point-based accuracy assessment, and assessed the accuracy of our forest type maps using forest inventory data and statistically sampled ground truth data for 2010. Our Carpathian-wide disturbance map achieved an overall accuracy of 86% and the forest type maps up to 73% accuracy. While our results suggested a small net forest increase in the Carpathians, almost 20% of the forests experienced stand-replacing disturbances over the past 25 years. Forest recovery seemed to only partly counterbalance the widespread natural disturbances and clear-cutting activities. Disturbances were most widespread during the late 1980s and early 1990s, but some areas also exhibited extensive forest disturbances after 2000, especially in the Polish, Czech and Romanian Carpathians. Considerable shifts in forest composition occurred in the Carpathians, with disturbances increasingly affecting coniferous forests, and a relative decrease in coniferous and mixed forests. Both aspects are likely connected to an increased vulnerability of spruce plantations to pests and pathogens in the Carpathians. Overall, our results exemplify the highly dynamic nature of forest cover during times of socio-economic and institutional change, and highlight the value of the Landsat archive for monitoring these dynamics.

However, they remain relatively unstudied because of the inaccessibility of the terrain and the difficulties in field work caused by the thick debris mantles. Observations of debris-covered glaciers are therefore scarce and airborne remote sensing may bridge the gap between scarce field observations and coarse resolution space-borne remote sensing. In this study we deploy an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) before and after the melt and monsoon season (May and October 2013) over the debris-covered tongue of the Lirung Glacier in Nepal. Based on stereo-imaging and the structure for motion algorithm we derive highly detailed ortho-mosaics and digital elevation models (DEMs), which we geometrically correct using differential GPS observations collected in the field. Based on DEM differencing and manual feature tracking we derive the mass loss and the surface velocity of the glacier at a high spatial accuracy. On average, mass loss is limited and the surface velocity is very small. However, the spatial variability of melt rates is very high, and\' ice cliffs and supra-glacial ponds show mass losses that can be an order of magnitude higher than the average. We suggest that future research should focus on the interaction between supra-glacial ponds, ice cliffs and englacial hydrology to further understand the dynamics of debris-covered glaciers. Finally, we conclude that UAV deployment has large potential in glaciology and it may revolutionize methods currently applied in studying glacier surface features.

Thus far, however, little effort has been made to monitor the phenologies of the various canopies of multilayer forests separately, despite their importance in regulating forest biogeochemical cycles. Here we report phenological changes in multi-layer canopies of deciduous broadleaf and evergreen needleleaf forests in the Republic of Korea during the spring of 2013. We installed light-emitting diode (LED) sensors at four different canopy heights at two sites to measure the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using red and near-infrared (NIR) spectral reflectance and to estimate leaf area index (LAI) using the blue band gap fraction. LED-sensors identified leaf-out dates of over- and understory canopies at both sites; leaves unfolded 8-11 days earlier in the understory canopy than the overstory canopy. At the deciduous forest site, LED-NDVI failed to capture the leaf-out date in the overstory canopy, because all four LED-sensors started to see green-up from the understory canopy while the overstory canopy was leafless. LED-LAI identified different leaf-out dates for the over- and understory canopy, because the gap fraction was measured explicitly for each canopy layer. In the evergreen forest site, LED-NDVI signals between the top of the tower and beneath the overstory canopy were decoupled because of the dense evergreen overstory canopy. Both LED-NDVI and LED-LAI identified new needle expansion in the overstory canopy and understory canopy development. MODIS NDVI agreed well with LED-NDVI data (R-2 = 0.96, RMSE = 0.04) at the deciduous forest site, and we discovered that understory canopy development determined the onset of greenness based on MODIS NDVI data. LED-LAI data agreed well with independent estimates from the other instruments, indicating that LED-sensors could be used to monitor multi-layer canopy LAI. Continuous, in-situ observation of multi-layer canopy phenology will aid in the interpretation of satellite remote sensing phenology products and improve land surface models that adopt a multi-layer canopy model.

However, several processing steps are required to convert calibrated top-of-atmosphere radiances to the desired geophysical parameter(s). These steps add various amounts of uncertainty that can cumulatively render the geophysical parameter imprecise and potentially unusable if the objective is to analyze trends and/or seasonal variability. This research presented here has focused on: (1) atmospheric correction of HICO imagery; (2) retrieval of bathymetry using an improved implementation of a shallow water inversion algorithm; (3) propagation of uncertainty due to environmental noise through the bathymetry retrieval process; (4) issues relating to consistent geo-location of HICO imagery necessary for time series analysis, and; (5) tide height corrections of the retrieved bathymetric dataset The underlying question of whether a temporal change in depth is detectable above uncertainty is also addressed. To this end, nine HICO images spanning November 2011 to August 2012, over the Shark Bay World Heritage Area, Western Australia, were examined. The results presented indicate that precision of the bathymetric retrievals is dependent on the shallow water inversion algorithm used. Within this study, an average of 70% of pixels for the entire HICO-derived bathymetry dataset achieved a relative uncertainty of less than +/- 20%. A per-pixel t-test analysis between derived bathymetry images at successive timestamps revealed observable changes in depth to as low as 0.4 m. However, the present geolocation accuracy of HICO is relatively poor and needs further improvements before extensive time series analysis can be performed.

A single pixel temperature derived from a satellite image can therefore represent a continuum of surface temperatures that may vary by hundreds of degrees Celsius. For thermally mixed pixels it is therefore more meaningful to estimate radiant flux [Watts] and/or radiant exitance [Watts per metre squared]. Here we introduce a new method for calculating radiant flux from thermally heterogeneous surfaces with temperatures in the 100 to 1100 degrees C range. It involves modelling radiance spectra using a spectral library. Two spectral libraries were created to represent two different sensor configurations i) a VNIR-SWIR imaging spectrometer and ii) a two channel SWIR imager, both characterized by a 30 m spatial resolution. We compare our approach against that of the \"dual-band method\". The spectral library approach was able to calculate radiant flux to within 30% of the actual value for targets radiating at or above 0.7 MW (i.e. when using an imaging spectrometer) or 7.1 MW (i.e. when using just two SWIR wavebands). The dual-band approach, on the other hand, required targets to be radiating at least 12 MW before a 30% accuracy level could be obtained. All of the approaches could accurately fit the spectral radiance values that they modelled. However, they could not reliably determine subpixel temperature distributions. This indicates that it might never be possible to retrieve subpixel temperature distributions reliably using short-wave infrared spectra alone. This finding has significant implications for the remote sensing of hot targets. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Accurate analysis of the tidal deflection of a glacier tongue is necessary to understand the elastic properties and dynamics of glacial ice. We extracted the tidal deflection of Campbell Glacier Tongue (CGT), one of the fast-flowing glacier tongues in East Antarctica, by using 120 Double-Differential Interferometric SAR (DDInSAR) images from the 16 COSMO-SkyMed one-day tandem interferometric SAR image pairs obtained during 2010 and 2011.A map of tide deflection ratio (alpha-map), defined as the ratio of the tidal deflection over tide height, was generated by pixel-based linear regression between the DDInSAR-derived tidal deflection and the tidal variation predicted by various tide models such as TPXO7.1, FES2004, CATS2008a and Ross_Inv after the inverse barometer effect correction. We also generated the maps of R-2, root mean square error (RMSE), and intercept (beta) of the linear regression model. We confirmed that the horizontal flow of the Campbell Glacier is steady over the whole data acquisition period due to the fact that alpha values were close to zero over the grounded part of the glacier. Ross_Inv provided the most reliable alpha-map with the highest R-2 (0.97) and the smallest RMSE (03 cm) beyond the hinge zone than other tide models. The spatial variation of the tidal response of the whole CGT was clearly defined from the alpha-map. The grounding line retreated by 0.3-1.5 km in comparison with that in 1996 defined by Rignot et al., 2011a. The ice thickness of CGT was estimated to be 397 +/- 71 m from ICESat surface elevation data. The Young\'s modulus of CGT was found to be 0.5-1.3 GPa (0.8 GPa at an ice thickness of 397 m) by simulating the alpha in the hinge zone using a 2-dimensional finite element method.

However, most land subsidence surveys focus on one single city, mainly Mexico City, and thus fail to reveal the regional extent of the problem. Here we use 2007-2011 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series analysis of ALOS data to resolve land subsidence in the entire central Mexico region. We identify land subsidence in 21 areas, including 17 cities. Linear vertical rates over 30 cm/yr are observed in Mexico City, while in the other locations rates of 5-10 cm/yr are detected. We define 3 main categories of subsidence using the averaged velocity maps in conjunction with previously published structural, surface geology, and land use mapping: (1) rapid, large-scale subsidence, (2) rapid, local-scale subsidence, and (3) slow, patchy subsidence. The correlation between subsidence and land use confirms that groundwater extraction mainly for agricultural and urban activities is the main cause of land subsidence. We observe that the boundaries of the subsiding areas are typically characterized by high velocity gradients often coinciding with pre-existing faults, motion on these faults being driven by water extraction rather than by tectonic activity. Regional surveys of this type are necessary to understand the spatial and temporal evolution of land subsidence, to constrain the distribution and connectivity of water-bearing units, and ultimately to reach better hazard mitigation plans.

Regional data products are created using ocean color inversion schemes based on MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) neural nets trained with field measurements from the Coastal Atmosphere and Sea Time Series (CoASTS) and Bio-Optical mapping of Marine Properties (BiOMaP) programs. MLP input is the remote sensing reflectance Res at MERIS center-wavelengths specifically selected for different water types in view of minimizing the perturbing effects of inaccurate atmospheric correction on the retrieval of regional data products. A new method is also proposed to define the applicability of regional MLPs to input Res. Results indicate that MERIS alg2 values tend to overestimate the equivalent quantity computed with MLP regional algorithms. The agreement between MERIS and regional TSM data products is significantly better than that reported for alg2 and ad, especially for BLKS. Findings highlight the relevance of using regional inversion schemes to evaluate standard products over extended oceanographic regions as a complement to the analysis of match-ups between marine products measured in situ and derived from space-born data.

However, their spatial extent, their temporal evolution, and even sometimes their existence are often poorly known. This study aims to monitor variable urban ground motion (uplift and subsidence) from 1993 to 2010 in the metropolitan area of Manila, Philippines. Because high subsidence rates have been reported in this city in previous studies, conventional Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) was applied with an adapted stacking procedure to the archive of ERS and Envisat satellite images to produce surface deformation-velocity maps for different periods. The results showed that the city is locally affected by vertical ground motions on the order of 15 cm/yr. Moreover, the spatio-temporal evolution of the ground-motion phenomena is highly nonlinear. These results are in good agreement with previous studies focused on groundwater use in Manila and in the Marikina Fault Valley, suggesting a plausible interpretation of the processes causing surface motion. Incidentally, the ground motions are affecting the locations of several geodetic instruments, including a tide gauge with sea-level records starting in 1902, two permanent GPS (Global Positioning System) stations, and a DORIS (Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite) station. A major implication of those large and locally variable ground motions is that they impede the use of the nearby GPS and DORIS data to correct the tide-gauge records and to derive robust sea-level trends associated with climate change.

Data used in the study included Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m time-series NDVI, accumulated precipitation (A-PPT) from September to August and annual stocking intensity (SI). We conducted Mann-Kendall analysis on grassland growing season NDVI (GS-NDVI), A-PPT and SI to demonstrate spatial variation in their temporal trends at local and regional scales. We developed both global Ordinary Linear Square (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models to analyze the impacts of climate variation and human activities such as grazing practice on potential pasture productivity from both temporal and spatial contexts. Results show that grasslands in most CPs had increasing trends in GS-NDVI for the time period, and no significantly decreasing trend was found over all CPs at the regional or ecoregional scales. A-PPT itself accounted for over 96% of inter-annual variation in grassland NDVI. At the regional level, the temporal trends in A-PPT and stocking intensity were more significant factors in accounting for spatial variation of NDVI than were A-PPT and SI per se. Results show that the past adopted grazing intensities did not significantly influence grassland potential productivity at either temporal or spatial scales in the study area.

Previous work based on a simulation model with ground-level measured reflectance data of pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.), and birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh. and Betula pendula Roth) tree species and idealized Leica ADS80 sensitivities suggested that the addition of a fifth sensitivity band in the red edge wavelength region to the existing Leica ADS80 system significantly improves the classification performance. In this paper, we extend this analysis using a simulated model with accurate spectral sensitivity information and airborne AisaEAGLE II hyperspectral data for these three tree species. We simulated multispectral responses using spectral sensitivity characteristics of the Leica ADS40, the Vexcel UltraCam-D, the Intergraph-Z/I Digital mapping camera and the Leica ADS40 system with an added band in the 691-785 nm region. We evaluated the tree species classification performance of these simulated responses using Discriminant Analysis and Support Vector Machine classifiers. The classification experiment result showed that the simulated responses of the 5-band multispectral system yielded the most robust classification performance with approximately 98% accuracy. This result was similar to the accuracy obtained with the hyperspectral data. Although differences were observed in the sensitivity functions of the 4-band systems, there were no large differences observed in the classification performances between them. With the simulated 5-band system, there was an increase of 5-13% points in classification accuracy when compared to the accuracies of the 4-band systems. The results obtained via proposed 5-band system support results from previous studies suggesting that there is a need for a sensitivity band in the red edge wavelength region for applications in tree species classification.

They are used for estimating understory light conditions and their influence on a broad range of biological components in forest ecosystems, from the demography and population dynamics of individual species to community structure. Angular canopy closure is more closely related to the direct and indirect light experienced by a plant or an animal than vertical canopy cover, but more challenging to estimate. We used airborne laser scanner (ALS) data to estimate canopy cover for 210 5-m radius vegetation plots in semi-open habitats and forests in protected nature areas in Denmark. The method was based on the area of Thiessen (Voronoi) polygons generated from the ALS points. We also estimated angular canopy closure by transforming ALS points from Cartesian to spherical coordinates, and calculating the percentage of azimuth and zenith angle intervals which contained points. We compared these estimates with field-based estimates using densiometer for 60 vegetation plots in forest. Finally, we compared ALS-based estimates of canopy cover and canopy closure to field-based estimates of understory light, based on the average Ellenberg indicator values for light for the plant species present in a given plot. The correlations of Ellenberg values with ALS-based canopy closure were higher (r(2): 0.47) than those with ALS-based canopy cover (r(2): 026) and densiometer readings (r(2): 0.41) for the forest sites. ALS-based canopy closure is thus a reasonable indicator of understory light availability and has the advantage over field-based methods that it can be rapidly estimated for extensive areas.

In the Sahel, meningitis epidemics are a serious public health issue. Social factors are of prime importance in the dynamics of the epidemics, however climate and environmental factors are also suspected to play an important role.   This study focuses on three Sahelian countries (Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger) which are among the most concerned in the \"meningitis belt\" and affected by strong dust events every year. It investigates the capability of the aerosol index (AI) derived from OMI (ozone monitoring instrument) to represent the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and the aerosol surface concentration (particulate matter <10 mu m; PM10) at different time-steps. The comparison of the OMI-AI with ground-based measurements of AOT shows a good agreement at a daily time-step (R approximate to 0.7). The correlation between OMI-AI and PM10 measurements is lower (R approximate to 03) but it increases at a weekly time-step (R approximate to 0.5). The difference in the level of correlation between the AOT and the PM10 is partly related to changes in the altitude of the dust layers, especially from April to June, the period of transition from the dry to the wet season. A temporal shift is observed in the occurrence of the maximum of PM10 concentration (March), of AOT (April) and of OMI-AI (June). Nevertheless, during the core of the dry season (January to March) when dust is transported at low altitude, the OMI-AI is able to correctly detect the dust events and to reproduce the dust variability at the regional scale.   For dust impact studies on health, only the surface level is relevant. Thus, we conclude that the OMI-AI is suitable especially at a weekly time-step from January to March. In particular for meningitis impact studies, it appears as suitable from the onset to the maximum of the epidemics. A preliminary investigation of the link between the OMI-AI and the WHO weekly national epidemiological reports reveals a 1-week time-lag between the occurrence of dust and meningitis during the increasing phase of the disease.

The main feature of the proposed model is the incorporation of crop phenology detection using MODIS data, called the \"Shape-Model Fitting Method\". MODIS WDRVI taken 7-10 days before the corn silking stage had strong linear correlation with corn final grain yield at both field and regional scales. The model revealed spatial patterns of corn final grain yield all over the U.S. from 2000 to 2011. State-level corn yield was estimated accurately with coefficient of variation below 10% especially for the 18 major corn producing states including Iowa, Illinois, Delaware, Minnesota, Ohio, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Nebraska, Kentucky, New York, South Dakota, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, New Jersey and Maryland. The results corresponded well with the spatial pattern of high-yield regions derived from the USDA/NASS data. However, the model tended to underestimate corn grain yield in three irrigated regions: the Midwestern region depending on the Ogallala Aquifer, the downstream basin of the Mississippi, and the southwestern region of Georgia. In contrast, it tended to overestimate corn grain yield around the outlying regions of the U.S. Corn Belt, specifically, the East Coast, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Missouri. The estimation accuracy of the proposed model differed depending on the region. However, the annual variation of state level corn grain yield could be detected with high accuracy, especially in the major corn producing states. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The products included the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (K-d_490) and for the visible range (K-d_PAR), and euphotic depth (Z(eu), corresponding to 1% of the surface incident photosynthetically available radiation or PAR). Above-water hyperspectral reflectance data collected over optically shallow waters of the Florida Keys between June 1997 and August 2011 were used to help understand algorithm performance over optically shallow waters. The in situ data covered a variety of water types in South Florida and the Caribbean Sea, ranging from deep clear waters, turbid coastal waters, and optically shallow waters (K-d_490 range of similar to 0.03-1.29 m(-1)). An algorithm based on Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs) showed the best performance (RMSD<13% and R-2 similar to 1.0 for MODIS/Aqua and SeaWiFS). Two algorithms based on empirical regressions performed well for offshore clear waters, but underestimated K-d_490 and K-d_PAR in coastal waters due to high turbidity or shallow bottom contamination. Similar results were obtained when only in situ data were used to evaluate algorithm performance. The excellent agreement between satellite-derived remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and in situ R-rs suggested that the different product uncertainties resulted primarily from algorithm inversion as opposed to atmospheric correction. A simple empirical model was developed to derive Z(eu), from K-d_490 for satellite measurements of nearshore waters. MODIS/Aqua gave the best results in general relative to in situ observations. Our findings lay the basis for synoptic time-series studies of water quality in coastal ecosystems, yet more work is required to minimize the bottom interference in the Florida Keys optically shallow waters.

Variation exists in which MODIS datasets are used, how they are processed for analysis, and what ground reference data are used. Moreover, various land-use/land-cover classes are ultimately resolved, and as yet, crop-specific classifications (e.g. soy-corn vs. soy-cotton double crop) have not been reported in the literature, favoring instead generalized classes such as single vs. double crop. The objective of this study is to present a rigorous multiyear evaluation of the applicability of time-series MODIS 250-m VI data for crop classification in Mato Grosso, Brazil. This study shows progress toward more refined crop-specific classification, but some grouping of crop classes remains necessary. It employs a farm field polygon-based ground reference dataset that is unprecedented in spatial and temporal coverage for the state, consisting of 2003 annual field site samples representing 415 unique field sites and five crop years (2005-2009). This allows for creation of a dataset containing \"best-case\" or \"pure\" pixels, which we used to test class separability in a multiyear cross validation framework applied to boosted decision tree classifiers trained on MODIS data subjected to different pre-processing treatments. Reflecting the agricultural landscape of Mato Grosso as a whole, cropping practices represented in the ground reference dataset largely involved soybeans, and soy-based classes (primarily double crop \'soy-commercial\' and single crop \'soy-cover\') dominated the analysis along with cotton and pasture. With respect to the MODIS data treatments, the best results were obtained using date-of-acquisition interpolation of the 16-day composite VI time series and outlier point screening, for which five-year out-of-sample accuracies were consistently near or above 80% and Kappa values were above 0.60. It is evident that while much additional research is required to fully and reliably differentiate more specific crop classes, particular groupings of cropping strategies are separable and useful for a number of applications, including studies of agricultural intensification and extensification in this region of the world.

Here, a novel empirical Chla algorithm based on a Red-Green-Chorophyll-Index (RGCI) was developed and validated for MODIS and SeaWiFS observations between 1998 and 2011. The algorithm showed robust performance with two independent datasets, with relative mean uncertainties of similar to 30% and similar to 50% and RMS uncertainties of similar to 40% and similar to 65%, respectively, for Chla ranging between 1.0 and >30.0 mg m(-3). These uncertainties are comparable or even lower than those reported for the global open oceans when traditional blue-green band ratio algorithms are used.   A long-term Chla time series generated from SeaWiFS and MODIS observations showed excellent agreement between sensors and with in situ measurements. Substantial variability in both space and time was observed in the four bay segments, with higher Chla in the upper bay segments and lower Chla in the lower bay segments, and higher Chla in the wet season and lower Chla in the dry season. On average, river discharge could explain similar to 60% of the seasonal changes and similar to 90% of the inter-annual changes, with the latter mainly driven by climate variability (e.g. El Nino and La Nina years) and anomaly events (e.g. tropical cyclones). Significant positive correlation was found between monthly mean Chla anomalies and monthly Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.43, p<0.01, N = 147), with high Chla associated with El Nino and lower Chla associated with La Nina. Further, a Water Quality Decision Matrix (WQDM) was established from satellite observations, providing complementary and more reliable information to the existing WQDM based on less synoptic and less frequent field measurements. The satellite-derived WQDM and long-term time-series data support the decision making efforts of the management agencies that regulate nutrient discharge to the bay. Similar approaches may be established for other estuaries where field data are much more limited than for Tampa Bay. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Results suggest potential for spatial transferability of such models, but success is contingent on the equation meeting certain criteria: 1) use of a near infrared band in combination with at least one visible band, 2) development based on SSCs similar to those in the observed region, and 3) a nonlinear form. Using a highly predictive SSC-reflectance model (Spearman\'s rho = 0.95), we develop a twelve-year time series of SSC in the westernmost end of Lake Athabasca, observe the timing and sources of major sediment flux events, and identify a threshold river discharge of similar to 1700 m(3)/s above which SSC in Lake Athabasca is clearly associated with flow in the Athabasca River. We also track the influx of Athabasca River water to floodplain lakes, and in three of the lakes identify distinct discharge thresholds (1040 m(3)/s, 1150 m(3)/s, and 1850 m(3)/s) which result in lake recharge. For each of these lakes, we find a statistically significant decline in the threshold exceedence frequency since 1970, suggesting less frequent recharge during the summer. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
