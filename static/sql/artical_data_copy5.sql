Recent satellite missions measuring soil moisture from space continue to improve the availability of soil moisture information. However, the utility of these satellite products is limited by the large footprint of the microwave sensors. This study presents a merging framework that combines a hyper-resolution land surface model (LSM), a radiative transfer model (RTM), and a Bayesian scheme to merge and downscale coarse resolution remotely sensed hydrological variables to a 30-m spatial resolution. The framework is based on HydroBlocks, an LSM that solves the field-scale spatial heterogeneity of land surface processes through interacting hydrologic response units (HRUs). The framework was demonstrated for soil moisture by coupling HydroBlocks with the Tau-Omega RTM used in the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. The brightness temperature from the HydroBlocks-RTM and SMAP L3 were merged to obtain updated 30-m soil moisture. We validated the downscaled soil moisture estimates at four experimental watersheds with dense in-situ soil moisture networks in the United States and obtained overall high correlations (> 0.81) and good mean KGE score (0.56). The downscaled product captures the spatial and temporal soil moisture dynamics better than SMAP L3 and L4 product alone at both field and watershed scales.

In this study, we evaluated and analyzed the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L3 F/T product, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) F/T product and Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) F/T product over different regions in China, including the Genhe area in Northeast China, the Saihanba area in North China, and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) area. The overall accuracy of F/T products assessed with the 5 cm depth soil temperature is 90.38% for SMAP, 90.23% for AMSR2 and 84.73% for MEaSUREs in cold and humid temperate forest climates and the plateau continental climate area (Genhe, Tianjun, and Qumalai) where permafrost is distributed, and 76.64% for SMAP, 83.67% for AMSR2 and 77.37% for MEaSUREs in the cold plateau mountain climate and plateau continental climate area (Saihanba and Chengduo) with frozen ground distributed seasonally, respectively. The overall accuracy is 69.05% for SMAP, 76.5% for AMSR2 and 81.4% for MEaSUREs in the Ngari, Naqu, and Dachaidan regions belonging to arid and semi-arid climates. It can be seen that SMAP and AMSR2 achieve the best performance in the distributed permafrost area, the second-best performance in the seasonal distributed permafrost area, but the worst performance in the areas with arid and semi-arid climate types due to inconsistent F/T signals between water with small changes and temperature with apparent changes during the F/T transition. The MEaSUREs product showed almost the same performance in different regions, indicating that it was less affected by climate types and the distribution of frozen soil than SMAP and AMSR2 products. SMAP F/T product detected by L-band with long penetration and AMSR2 F/T product calibrated with 5 cm soil temperature could represent the 5 cm F/T, but the MEaSUREs F/T product was more likely to describe the surface F/T state due to calibrated with air temperature and the short penetration of 36.5 GHz. In mid-low latitude areas (Tianjun and Qumalai) with a short duration of snow cover days and a fast snowmelt, the effect of snow melting on F/T products was negligible. Moreover, the spring snowmelt affects the three F/T products in Chengduo, but the SMAP product is not affected by the winter snowmelt, whereas the AMSR2 product is affected by the winter snowmelt.', '[Wang, Jian; Jiang, Lingmei; Cui, Huizhen; Wang, Gongxue; Yang, Jianwei; Liu, Xiaojing; Su, Xu] Beijing Normal Univ, Jointly Sponsored Beijing Normal Univ & Inst Remo, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Chinese Acad Sci,Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.', 'Beijing Normal University; Chinese Academy of SciencesRP Jiang, LM (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Jointly Sponsored Beijing Normal Univ & Inst Remo, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Chinese Acad Sci,Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.', 'jiang@bnu.edu.cnRI Jiang, Lingmei/L-6099-2016; shuqian, liu/CAF-5267-2022', 'Jiang, Lingmei/0000-0002-9847-9034; Wang, Gongxue/0000-0002-1563-1388', 'Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP)   [2019QZKK0206]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese   Academy of Sciences [XDA19070204]; National Natural Science Foundation   of China [41671334]', 'This study was supported by the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific   Expedition and Research Program (STEP, Grant No. 2019QZKK0206), the   Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences   (XDA19070204), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China   (41671334).

This paper presents high-resolution sulfur dioxide (SO2) maps over the Korean Peninsula, produced by SO2 retrievals from GeoTASO measurements during the Korea-United States Air Quality Field Study (KORUS-AQ) from May to June 2016. The highly sensitive GeoTASO instrument with a spatial resolution of similar to 250 m x 250 m can detect point emission sources of SO2 within its fields of view, even without merging multiple overlapping observations. To retrieve SO2 vertical columns from the GeoTASO measurements, we apply an algorithm based on principal component analysis (PCA), which is effective in suppressing noise and biases in SO2 retrievals. The retrievals successfully capture SO2 plumes and various point sources such as power plants, a petrochemical complex, and a steel mill, located in South Chungcheong Province, some of which are not detected by a ground-based in situ measurement network. Spatial distributions of SO2 from GeoTASO observations in source areas are consistent with those from the Stack Tele-Monitoring System reports and airborne in situ SO2 measurements. Comparisons of SO2 retrievals from GeoTASO and existing satellite sensors demonstrate the significance of high-resolution SO2 observations, by indicating that GeoTASO detects small SO2 emission sources that are not precisely resolved by single overpasses of satellites. To assess future geostationary SO2 observations having a higher spatial resolution, we upscale the GeoTASO SO2 retrievals to a spatial resolution of the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS). Since the upscaled GeoTASO retrievals also detect SO2 plumes clearly, we expect from GEMS to identify even small SO2 emission sources over Asia.', '[Chong, Heesung; Lee, Seoyoung; Kim, Jhoon; Choi, Myungje; Koo, Ja-Ho] Yonsei Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seoul 03722, South Korea.

Changes in surface characteristics permit reasonably accurate delineation between burned and unburned areas, but variability in severity within burned areas is much more challenging to detect. Previous studies have relied primarily on categorical data to calibrate severity indices in terms of classification accuracy, but this approach does not readily translate into an expected amount of error in terms of actual tree mortality. We addressed this issue by examining a dataset of 40,370 geolocated trees that burned in the 2013 California Rim Fire using 36 Landsat-derived burn severity indices.   The differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) performed reliably well, but the differenced SWIR:NIR ratio most accurately predicted percent basal area mortality and the differenced normalized vegetation index (dNDVI) most accurately predicted percent mortality of stems >= 10 cm diameter at breast height. Relativized versions of dNBR did not consistently improve accuracy; the relativized burn ratio (RBR) was generally equivalent to dNBR while RdNBR had consistently lower accuracy.   There was a high degree of variability in observed tree mortality, especially at intermediate spectral index values. This translated into a considerable amount of uncertainty at the landscape scale, with an expected range in estimated percent basal area mortality greater than 37% for half of the area burned (> 50,000 ha). In other words, a 37% range in predicted mortality rate was insufficient to capture the observed mortality rate for half of the area burned. Uncertainty was even greater for percent stem mortality, with half of the area burned exceeding a 46% range in predicted mortality rate. The high degree of uncertainty in tree mortality that we observed challenges the confidence with which Landsat-derived spectral indices have been used to measure fire effects, and this has broad implications for research and management related to post-fire landscape complexity, distribution of seed sources, or persistence of fire refugia. We suggest ways to account for uncertainty that will facilitate a more nuanced and ecologically-accurate interpretation of fire effects.   This study makes three key contributions to the field of remote sensing of fire effects: 1) we conducted the most comprehensive comparison to date of all previously published severity indices using the largest contiguous set of georeferenced tree mortality field data and revealed that the accuracy of both absolute and relative spectral indices depends on the tree mortality metric of interest;2) we conducted this study in a single, large fire that enabled us to isolate variability due to intrinsic, within-landscape factors without the additional variance due to extrinsic factors associated with different biogeographies or climatic conditions; and 3) we identified the range in tree mortality that may be indistinguishable based on spectral indices derived from Landsat satellites, and we demonstrated how this variability translates into a considerable amount of uncertainty in fire effects at the landscape scale.', '[Furniss, Tucker J.; Lutz, James A.] Utah State Univ, Wildland Resources Dept, Logan, UT 84322 USA.

But reliable MODIS detection of seasonal and interannual leaf phenology patterns has also been questioned and is generally not validated with field observation. Here we compare inter-annual patterns of local-scale upper canopy leaf phenology and demography derived from tower-mounted phenocams at two upland forest sites in the Central Amazon, to corresponding satellite vegetation indices retrieved from MODIS-MAIAC (Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction). We focus on forest response to an unprecedented drought caused by the El Nino of 2015-16. At both sites, multi-year phenocam data showed post-drought shifts in leaf demography. These were consistent with MODIS-MAIAC anomalies in two vegetation indices. Specifically, a precocious leaf flush at both sites during the first two post-drought months, Feb-Mar 2016, caused (1) an anomalous decrease in flushing trees in Jun Jul of 2016 and (2) an increase of trees with early mature stage leaves (2-4 mo age) in Apr-May-Jun of 2016. At both sites, these two phenological anomalies showed up in MODIS-MAIAC as, respectively, (1) a strong negative anomaly in Gcc (Green chromatic coordinate), which prior work has shown to be sensitive to the abundance of leaves 0-1 mo old, and (2) a strong positive anomaly in EVI, which is sensitive to abundance of leaves 2-4 mo age. A shift to sub-optimal seasonal leaf age mix is expected to change the ecosystem-scale intrinsic photosynthetic capacity for similar to 18 month after the drought.', '[Goncalves, Nathan Borges; Pinho, Davieliton Mesquita; Nelson, Bruce Walker] INPA Natl Inst Amazon Res, Environm Dynam Dept, Manaus, AM, Brazil.

In situ ground measurements are used to characterize the surface reflectance and the atmosphere in order to constrain the radiative transfer code and predict at-sensor reflectance (also referred to as top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance) to compare with concurrent GOES-16 ABI measurements. The five-day field campaign provided repeated TOA reflectance estimates, allowing assessment not only of the calibration accuracy of the ABI reflective channels 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6, but also of its stability over the duration of the campaign. The results show that the accuracy of the ABI reflective channels calibration is within specification for channels 1, 3, 5, and 6 - average biases within 2%; for channel 2 the bias is 5%. The estimated uncertainty on the derived biases is 2-2.4%. Some calibration stability issues were present in the ABI calibration at the time of the campaign: (i) a jump on the order of 2% in channels 1 and 6, coincident with an ABI solar calibration event, reflects an instability of the ABI gains in these channels, and (ii) short-term variability in channels 1 and 2 is due to striping (ABI detector-to-detector calibration differences).

However, a model with the capability to simulate the temporal variation of urban thermal anisotropy (UTA) and with inversion abilities has not yet been developed. In this paper, the relationship between the temporal variation of UTA and temperature contrasts among surface components is investigated. Based on a system of previously developed geometric models for simulation of thermal anisotropy in simplified urban neighborhoods of different densities, a system of advanced geometric models, GUTA-T, is proposed that incorporates the temporal variability of UTA through the dependence of temperature contrasts on solar zenith angle theta(s) under clear skies. A 3-D microscale urban surface temperature model and a sensor view model are combined to generate a synthetic UTA dataset for a variety of simplified urban geometries and with which to evaluate GUTA-T. The results show that parameter inversions are sensitive to sun-surface-sensor geometries. The seasonal and hourly behavior of anisotropy is simulated by GUTA-T with mean absolute differences of 1.06 degrees C, 1.25 degrees C, 1.69 degrees C and 1.04 degrees C for the view zenith and azimuth angles (theta(v), phi(v)) of (40 degrees, 90 degrees), (60 degrees, 270 degrees), (60 degrees, 180 degrees) and (40 degrees, 130 degrees), respectively. Evaluation using diurnal measurements over an urban scale model shows that the root mean square difference between simulated anisotropy and the reference anisotropy generated from observed directional temperatures and a high-accuracy computer model is 2.02 degrees C for theta(s) <= 60 degrees. If the proposed model is to be calibrated with satellite data, a second directional observation from the opposite side of the surface target area can improve model performance significantly. Calibrations using samples including only small (e.g., theta(s) >= 30 degrees) or large s (e.g., theta(s) >= 50 degrees) tend to decrease the anisotropy time-series simulation accuracy. Due to its inversion abilities, the GUTA-T model has the potential to simulate and correct anisotropy in time-series thermal infrared remote sensing data, thereby improving the analysis either of spatial variation within an image, or of temporal variation of angular urban surface temperature.', '[Wang, Dandan; Chen, Yunhao; Wang, Leibin] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

However, the model results ranging from -2.8 to 2.2 K remain controversial because of unavoidable uncertainty, leaving a great gap for global change prediction. This study aims to evaluate the forcing on the land surface temperature (Ts) using satellite-based observations. Based on the Blackbody radiation and surface radiation budget, first, a semi-physical framework is developed to estimate the Ts. Subsequently, the aerosol forcing is calculated by measuring the Ts difference between the changing aerosol scenario and baseline scenario with a fixed aerosol amount. Results show that the framework simulates Ts with acceptable accuracy (R = 0.62 and RMSE = 1.48 K), which supports the estimation of aerosol forcing. Generally, the change in the aerosol contributes 0.005 +/- 0.237 K to the global Ts, which presents significant temporal and spatial variabilities. Temporally, the forcing shows a decreasing trend of -0.0006 K/year (R-2 = 0.29, p = 0.031). Spatially, the forcing tends to warm the surface in regions with arid climate, low-cloud fraction, and moderate vapor or in sparsely vegetated and cool regions because of the potential interactions with climatic and environmental factors.

The widely distributed sediments and rapid urbanization in the GBA result in the concurrence of large- and small-scale subsidence. Mono-sensor synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images usually suffer from the limitation of either low resolution or small coverage, and thus, are not applicable to completely monitoring the GBA. In this study, we used Sentinel-1 (S1), COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) images jointly to reveal multi-scale subsidence of the GBA. The overall subsidence ranged from 0 to 112.3 mm/yr derived from the 2015-2017 S1 images. Three regional subsidence bowls (Zhuhai-Zhongshan, Jiangmen, and Guangzhou-Zhongshan) formed in the western alluvial plain. The high correlation between regional subsidence and Quaternary sediments confirms that sediment consolidation is the main cause of subsidence. The land use and numerical modeling results suggest that groundwater extraction and artificial loading are the triggering factors. Two representative local subsidence cases were analyzed using high-resolution images: reclamation settlement at the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) and sinkhole subsidence due to the excavation of the Shenzhen Wenbo skyscraper foundation pit. The validation at the HKIA showed that the measurements from the CSK and S1 data both agreed well with the leveling data. However, CSK outperformed S1 in the sense that it increased the point density by a factor of 5, improved the height precision by a factor of 4, and showed fewer false alarms. CSK is therefore more applicable to monitoring the local subsidence of key infrastructures. The cross-heading tracks of TSX and CSK images detected precursory subsidence before the sinkhole collapse from two sides, indicating that the cross-heading tracks benefit the comprehensive monitoring of local subsidence in high-rise and high-density built environments. In summary, the synergistic use of multi-sensor SAR images demonstrates the practicability of the operational surveillance of multi-scale subsidence from regional surveying to the fine monitoring of local areas in the GBA.', '[Ma, Peifeng; Shi, Guoqiang; Lin, Hui] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Space & Earth Informat Sci, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

These blooms have been linked to a decline in natural sheet flow over the past century from upstream Everglades National Park. Remote sensing algorithms for monitoring cyanobacteria blooms are highly desired but have been mainly developed for freshwater and coastal systems with minimal bottom reflectance contributions in the past. Examination of in situ optical properties revealed that Synechococcus blooms in Florida Bay exhibit unique spectral absorption and reflectance features that form the basis for algorithm development. Using a large, multi-year match-up dataset (2002-2012; n = 682) consisting of in situ pigment concentrations and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R-rc(lambda)), classification criteria for detecting cyanobacteria blooms with chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a) similar to 5-40 mg m(-3) were determined based on a new approach to combine the MODIS Cyanobacteria Index, CIMODIS, and spectral shape around 488 nm, SS(488). The inclusion of SS(488) was required to prevent false positive classifications in seagrass-rich, non-bloom waters with high bottom reflectance contributions. 75% of cyanobacteria blooms were classified accurately based on this modified CI approach with < 1% false positives. A strong correlation observed between cyanobacteria bloom in situ Chl-a and CIMODIS r(2) = 0.80, n = 32) then allowed cyanobacterial chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl(cl)) to be estimated. Model simulations and image-based analyses showed that this technique was insensitive to variable aerosol properties and sensor viewing geometry. Application of the approach to the entire MODIS time-series (2000 present) may help identify factors controlling blooms and system responses to ongoing management efforts aimed at restoring flow to pre-drainage conditions. The method may also provide insights for algorithm development for other lagoonal estuaries that experience similar blooms.', '[Cannizzaro, Jennifer P.; Barnes, Brian B.; Hu, Chuanmin] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.

Still, its estimation in vivo is challenging due to the large variability induced by numerous features: canopy-related factors, including biochemical and structural characteristics, and factors external to the canopy such as soil background, solar irradiation, and sun-target sensor geometry conditions. Here we revisit a semi-analytical modeling framework for deriving the light absorption coefficient of plant canopies from reflectance data. The proposed approach is based on the partition of the total light absorption coefficient into photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic pigment components in the canopy, and canopy backscattering. The model-derived absorption coefficient of chlorophyll was compared with field matchups of total canopy chlorophyll content in three crops with contrasting leaf structures, canopy architectures and photosynthetic pathways: maize, soybean, and rice.

However, the benefits of UAV centimeter-scale imagery are still unclear compared to coarser resolution data acquired from satellites or aircrafts. This study aims (i) to propose novel methods for retrieving canopy variables from UAV multispectral observations, and (ii) to investigate to what extent the use of such centimeter-scale imagery makes it possible to improve the estimation of leaf and canopy variables in sugar beet crops (Beta vulgaris L.). Five important structural and biochemical plant traits are considered: green fraction (GF), green area index (GAI), leaf chlorophyll content (Cab), as well as canopy chlorophyll (CCC) and nitrogen (CNC) contents.   Based on a comprehensive data set encompassing a large variability in canopy structure and biochemistry, the results obtained for every targeted trait demonstrate the superiority of centimeter-resolution methods over two standard remote-sensing approaches (i.e., vegetation indices and PROSAIL inversion) applied to average canopy reflectances. Two variables (denoted GF(GREENPIX) and VICAB) extracted from the images are shown to play a major role in these performances. GFGREENPix is the GF estimate obtained by thresholding the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI) image, and is shown to be an accurate and robust (e.g., against variable illumination conditions) proxy of the structure of sugar beet canopies, i.e., GF and GAL VICAB is the mND(blue) index value averaged over the darkest green pixels, and provides critical information on C-ab. When exploited within uni-or multivariate empirical models, these two variables improve the GF, GAL C-ab, CCC and CNC estimates obtained with standard approaches, with gains in estimation accuracy of 24, 8, 26, 37 and 8%, respectively. For example, the best CCC estimates (R-2 = 0.90) are obtained by multiplying C-ab and GAI estimates respectively derived from VICAB and a log-transformed version of GF(GREENPIX), log(1-GF(GREENPIX)).   The GF(GREENIPIX) and VICAB variables, which are only accessible from centimeter-scale imagery, contributes to a better identification of the effects of canopy structure and leaf biochemistry, whose influences may be confounded when considering coarser resolution observations. Such results emphasize the strong benefits of centimeter-scale UAV imagery over satellite or airborne remote sensing, and demonstrate the relevance of low-cost multispectral cameras to retrieve a number of plant traits, e.g., for agricultural applications.', '[Jay, Sylvain; Malatesta, Ghislain; Heno, Stephanie; Maupas, Fabienne] Inst Tech Betterave, 45 Rue Naples, F-75008 Paris, France.

Forest pest insects, such as Ips typographus (L.), are spreading toward the northern latitudes and are now able to produce more generations in their current range; this has increased forest disturbances. Timely information on tree decline is critical in allowing forest managers to plan effective countermeasures and to forecast potential infestation areas. Field-based infestation surveys of bark beetles have traditionally involved visual estimates of entrance holes, resin flow, and maternal-gallery densities; such estimates are prone to error and bias. Thus, objective and automated methods for estimating tree infestation status are required.   In this study, we investigated the feasibility of dual-wavelength terrestrial lidar in the estimation and detection of I. typographus infestation symptoms. In addition, we examined the relationship between leaf water content (measured as gravimetric water content and equivalent water thickness) and infestation severity. Using two terrestrial lidar systems (operating at 905 nm and 1550 nm), we measured 29 mature Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) trees that exhibited low or moderate infestation symptoms. We calculated single and dual wavelength lidar intensity metrics from stem and crown points to test these metrics\' ability to discriminate I. typographus infestation levels using regressions and linear discriminant analyses.   Across the various I. typographus infestation levels, we found significant differences (p < 0.05) in gravimetric water content, but not in equivalent water thickness due to the latter statistic\'s high correlation with leaf density. The results show correlations between the lidar intensity metrics and several infestation symptoms: defoliation, discoloration and resin flow. The intensity metrics explain 50% of the variation in the infestation severity (as determined in the field based on canopy and stem symptoms). The overall accuracy with three infestation classes (no, low, or moderate) was 66%, but the overall accuracy with two infestation classes (not infested, or infested) was 90%. The classifiers combine lidar intensity metrics from the stem and the canopy to allow for the detection of bark-beetle infestations in the early, so called green-attack stage. The intensity metrics explain part of the variations in tree-level gravimetric water content and equivalent water thickness, with adjusted R-2 values of 0.48 and 0.68, respectively. Terrestrial dual-wavelength lidar shows potential for providing objective tree-decline measurements at tree level: this method can be further used to enhance forest inventories and automate tree vigor data collection, which has traditionally required expert knowledge.', '[Junttila, S.; Holopainen, M.; Lyytikainen-Saarenmaa, P.] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Latokartanonkaari 7, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.

Many studies use arbitrary metrics or simple linear-distance thresholds to match trees in different datasets without quantifying the level of agreement. For example, successful match-pairing is often claimed where two data points, representing the same tree in different datasets, are located within 5 m of one another. Such simple measures are inadequate for representing the multi-variate nature of ITC delineations and generate misleading measures of delineation accuracy. In this study, we develop a new framework for objectively quantifying the agreement between GR and remotely-sensed tree datasets: the Accuracy of Remotely-sensed Biophysical Observation and Retrieval (ARBOR) framework. Using common biophysical properties of ITC delineated trees (location, height and crown area), trees represented in different data sets were modelled as overlapping Gaussian curves to facilitate a more comprehensive assessment of the level of agreement. Extensive testing quantified the limitations of some frequently used match-pairing methods, in particular, the Hausdorff distance algorithm. We demonstrate that within the ARBOR framework, the Hungarian combinatorial optimisation algorithm improves the match between datasets, while the Jaccard similarity coefficient is effective for measuring the correspondence between the matched data populations. The ARBOR framework was applied to GR and remotely-sensed tree data from a woodland study site to demonstrate how ARBOR can identify the optimum ITC delineation technique, out of four different methods tested, based on two measures of statistical accuracy. Using ARBOR will limit further reliance on arbitrary thresholds as it provides an objective approach for quantifying accuracy in the development and application of ITC delineation algorithms.', '[Murray, Jon; Gullick, David; Blackburn, George Alan; Whyatt, James Duncan] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.

One approach to estimate crop yield with remote sensing is data assimilation, which integrates sequential observations of canopy development from remote sensing into model simulations of crop growth processes. However, it remains challenging to efficiently scale this approach to large areas while maintaining reliable prediction at field scales. In this paper, we explored the factors limiting the generalization of the data assimilation approach and found that the accuracy of crop model prediction and the systematic model errors can significantly affect the performance of data assimilation and the yield estimation. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical data assimilation framework, which enables maize yield estimation at field levels across large areas for the Midwestern US with no a priori knowledge about the management of individual fields. This approach applies data assimilation algorithms at two spatial scales. At the county scale, we adopted a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to recalibrate uncertain and sensitive model parameters based on aggregated Leaf Area Index (LAI) time series derived from Landsat images and county-level yield statistics. Using the county-specific models, we assimilated LAI time series into crop model simulations using Ensemble Kalman Filter for individual fields or pixels. This method was validated by multiple field-level maize yield datasets across major production states in the US Midwest. The Root Mean Squared Error ranges from 1.4 to 2.3 ton/ha, and the percentage error is between 9% and 21%. The hierarchical data assimilation framework provides a novel solution that downscales county-level yield statistics to 30-meter resolution yield maps, which can inform between and within field maize yield variability. This study contributes valuable insights towards practical large-scale crop yield mapping at high resolutions.', '[Kang, Yanghui] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geog, 550 N Pk St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

Numerous studies have reported local relations between forest structure and albedo in the boreal zone. However, more research is needed to establish these relations for geographically extensive areas, and to examine seasonal courses of albedo to understand the effects of forest structure on mean annual shortwave energy balance. Remote sensing is a viable option for accomplishing these goals, but there are many challenges related to e.g. long periods of cloud cover and low solar elevations in high latitudes. We used the new MODIS Collection 6 (MCD43A3) daily albedo product, and analyzed MODIS albedo dependence on airborne LiDAR-based forest structure in 22 study sites in Estonia, Finland, Sweden, and Russia (57 degrees-69 degrees N, 12 degrees-57 degrees E). Wall-to-wall LiDAR data allowed us to take into account the effective spatial resolution of MODIS, which notably improved correlations between albedo and forest structure. Use of the best quality backup algorithm (magnitude inversion) together with main algorithm results in the MODIS albedo product did not reduce the correlations compared to using main algorithm only. We quantified the effects of landscape-level forest structure (forest height, canopy cover, fraction of young forest) and fraction of broadleaved deciduous forest on mean annual albedo. We showed that because the forest structure-albedo relations are the strongest in snow-covered periods, and because the snow-covered period is longest in the north, the effect of forest structure on mean annual albedo increases towards the north. On the other hand, the effect of broadleaved fraction did not show such latitudinal trend. Our results indicate that even within a single climatic zone the optimal forest management solution to mitigate climate change depends on geographic location.', '[Hovi, Aarne; Rautiainen, Miina] Aalto Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Built Environm, POB 14100, Aalto 00076, Finland.

In this study we assessed multiple ways to minimize spectral confusion using airborne lidar data as an additional data source and spectral feature selection. Several approaches were tested using simulated hyperspectral data and two case studies in the city of Brussels, Belgium, one based on hyperspectral (APEX) data and one on multispectral (Sentinel-2) data. We found that the implementation of height distribution information (1) as an endmember model selection tool and (2) as a basis for additional fraction constraints at the individual pixel scale, significantly reduced spectral confusion between spectrally similar, but structurally different land cover classes (on average by 80% for the APEX case). This had a net positive effect on subpixel fraction estimations (average R2 increased from 0.34 to 0.80 and from 0.23 to 0.63 for APEX and Sentinel-2, respectively) and pixel classification accuracies (kappa increased from 0.38 to 0.6 for the APEX case). When applied to fine spatial resolution data containing many single-class pixels, endmember model selection based on height information resulted in the additional benefit of lowering computation times by 85%. Spectral feature selection successfully discarded redundant spectral information (on average retaining only 19 out of 218 bands), thereby further lowering processing times by 50%, without affecting accuracies. Despite these significant improvements, spectral confusion remained an issue between classes showing no distinction in height information, particularly pavement and soil. Future research should therefore focus on integrating the proposed approach with advanced endmember detection and selection algorithms, along with exploring innovative ways of highlighting small spectral differences using spectral transformations. The algorithm we propose constitutes a viable approach for mapping of structurally diverse ecosystems, such as urban environments, at multiple spatial scales and with varying level of thematic detail.', '[Degerickx, J.; Somers, B.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, Leuven, Belgium.

The TanDEM-X (TDX) InSAR mission of German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the upcoming Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) together may provide more accurate estimates of global forest structure and biomass via their synergic use. In this paper, we explored the efficacy of simulated GEDI data in improving height estimates from TDX InSAR data. Our study sites span three major forest types: a temperate forest, a mountainous conifer forest, and a tropical rainforest. The GEDI lidar coverage was simulated for the full nominal two-year mission duration, under both cloud-free and 50%-cloud conditions. We then used these GEDI data to parameterize the Random Volume over Ground (RVoG) model driven by TDX imagery. In particular, we explored the following three strategies for forest structure estimation: 1) TDX data alone; 2) TDX + GEDI-derived digital terrain model (DTM); and 3) TDX + GEDI DTM + GEDI canopy height. We then validated the retrieved forest heights against wall-to-wall airborne lidar measurements. We found relatively large biases at 90 [m] spatial resolution, from 4.2-11.9 [m], and root mean square errors (RMSEs), from 7.9-12.7 [m] when using TDX data alone under constrained RVoG assumptions of a fixed extinction coefficient (sigma) and a zero ground-to-volume amplitude ratio (mu = 0). Results improved significantly with the aid of a DTM derived from GEDI data which enabled estimation of spatially-varying a values (vs. fixed extinction) under a mu = 0 assumption, with biases reduced to 1.7-4.2 [m] and RMSEs to 4.9-8.6 [m] across cloudy and cloud-free cases. The best agreement was achieved in the third strategy by also incorporating information of GEDI-derived canopy height to further enhance the RVoG parameters. The improved model, when still assuming mu = 0, reduced biases to less than or close to 1 m and further reduced RMSEs to 4.0-6.7 [m]. Finally, we used GEDI data to estimate spatially-varying mu in the RVoG model. We found biases of between -0.7-0.9 [m] and RMSEs in the range from 2.6-7.1 [m] over the three sites. Our results suggest that use of GEDI data improves height inversion from TDX, providing heights at more accuracy than can be achieved by TDX alone, and enabling wall-to-wall height estimation at much finer spatial resolution than can be achieved by GEDI alone.', '[Qi, Wenlu; Hancock, Steven; Tang, Hao; Armston, John; Dubayah, Ralph] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

Light use efficiency (LUE) is a key indicator of photosynthesis, which is determined by the most limiting/co-limiting environmental stresses such as nutrition, water, and temperature, restraining the photochemical reaction process across both space and time due to remote sensing offers a capability to relate changes in LUE with changes in the spectral characteristics of leaves through the photochemical reflectance index (PRI). The PRI is a narrow waveband index that responds with changes in xanthophyll-induced absorption feature at 531 nm. It remains challenging, however, to upscale PRI from leaf to canopy and ultimately to the landscape level due to physiological and structural factors such as leaf angle distribution, leaf area, canopy structure and pigment pool size as well as observational considerations such as sun-view geometry and background reflectance. As a result, understanding patterns of PRI and LUE across different climate-induced stress conditions and within age-induced vertical stand structures is helpful for improving our understanding how these relationships change over forested landscapes in anticipation of future airborne and ultimately satellite based observations. In this study, we report on the use of the automated multi-angular spectro-radiometer (AMSPEC) and eddy-covariance techniques to examine how PRI and LUE varies at young (HDF88) and older (DF49) Douglas-fir sites. Results indicate that a strong relationship between bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) corrected PRI and LUE exists (DF49: R-2 = 0.73; HDF88: R-2 = 0.79). The overall LUE at the older, more structurally complex site was higher than at the younger, structurally simpler stand under a range of air temperature and light conditions. We used the standard deviation (SD) of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) return pulses to characterize canopy vertical structure of the site, and found that complex vertical structures (i.e., high SD) may contribute to a higher long-term averaged LUE (R-2 = 0.87). While interesting we conclude the mechanism of the relationship between LUE and vertical forest structures needs to be further explored because of the key role internal and external shadowing has on light regimes with stands and thus vertical patterns of LUE varying across forest stands of different age.', '[Jia, Wen; Pang, Yong] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Resource Informat Tech, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.

The risk of extreme waves is a known hazard in the shipping routes crossing some of the main current systems.

We report a typical case of a swell system propagating in the Agulhas current, using wind and sea state measurements from several satellites, jointly with state of the art analytical and numerical modeling of wave-current interactions. In particular, Synthetic Aperture Radar and altimeter measurements are used to show the evolution of the swell train and resulting local extreme waves. A ray tracing analysis shows that the significant wave height variability at scales < similar to 100 km is well associated with the current vorticity patterns. Predictions of the WAVEWATCH III numerical model in a version that accounts for wave-current interactions are consistent with observations, although their effects are still under-predicted in the present configuration.

Remote sensing evapotranspiration and water demand estimation over large cultivated areas were used to manage irrigation to minimize losses during the crop growing cycle. The research aimed to explore the potential of the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) sensor on board Sentinel-2A to estimate crop parameters, mainly surface albedo (alpha) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) that influence the dynamics of potential evapotranspiration (ETp) and Irrigation Water Requirements (IWR) of processing tomato crop (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Maximum tomato ETp was calculated according to the FAO Penman-Monteith equation (FAO-56 PM) using appropriate values of canopy parameters derived by processing Sentinel-2A data in combination with daily weather information. For comparison, we used the actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) derived from the soil water balance (SWB) module in the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model and calibrated with in-situ Root Zone Soil Moisture (RZSM). The experiment was set up in a privately-owned farm located in the Tarquinia irrigation district (Central Italy) during two growing seasons, within the framework of the EU Project FATIMA (FArming Tools for external nutrient Inputs and water Management). The results showed that canopy growth, maximum evapotranspiration (ETp) and IWR were accurately inferred from satellite observations following seasonal rainfall and air temperature patterns. The net estimated IWR from satellite observations for the two-growing seasons was about 272 and 338 mm in 2016 and 2017, respectively.

Moreover, methods for mining the regularity of landscape-structure heterogeneity (i.e., spatial variations in landscape structures) are still limited, particularly for applications in urban land-cover mapping. This study hence proposes a novel approach with the aims to (1) characterize landscape structures considering the above three elements; (2) mine the regularity of landscape-structure heterogeneity; and (3) apply landscape-structure information as contexts to improve urban land-cover mapping. To achieve the first aim, landscape-structure features including pair-wise spatial relationships and neighborhood-based landscape metrics are defined.

Finally, a hierarchical classifier based on the feedforward multi-layer perceptron is developed for the third aim. Experiments are conducted in a heterogeneous urban environment in Beijing, China. The results show that the proposed approach, which considers 34 landscape-structure features and 19 landscape-structure types, achieves a classification accuracy improvement of 6.43% compared with the approaches without considering landscape-structure information.

(1)We applied the algorithm to multispectral and panchromatic images captured at the Deckle Beach, Florida using the WorldView-2 commercial satellite. The algorithm involves four steps using spectral and spatial information from radiometrically calibrated multispectral and panchromatic images. First, we fused multispectral and panchromatic images using a principal component analysis (PCA)-based pan-sharpening method to obtain multispectral pan-sharpened bands. In the second step, we enhanced the image contrast of the pan-sharpened bands for better scar detection. In the third step, we classified the contrast enhanced image pixels into scar and non-scar categories based on a sparse coding algorithm that produced an initial scar map in which false positive scar pixels were also present.

However, covariance with structural canopy properties is hampering the ability to predict leaf biochemical traits in structurally heterogeneous forests. Here, we used imaging spectroscopy data to map canopy level leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus concentrations (P-mass) of a temperate mixed forest. By integrating predictor variables derived from airborne laser scanning (LiDAR), capturing the biophysical complexity of the canopy, we aimed at improving predictions of N-mass and P-mass. We used partial least squares regression (PLSR) models to link community weighted means of both leaf constituents with 245 hyperspectral bands (426-2425 nm) and 38 LiDAR-derived variables. LiDAR-derived variables improved the model\'s explained variances for N-mass (R-cv(2) 0.31 vs. 0.41, % RSMEcv 3.3 vs. 3.0) and P-mass (R-cv(2) 0.45 vs. 0.63, % RSMEcv 15.3 vs. 12.5). The predictive performances of N-mass models using hyperspectral bands only, decreased with increasing structural heterogeneity included in the calibration dataset. To test the independent contribution of canopy structure we additionally fit the models using only LiDAR-derived variables as predictors. Resulting values ranged from 0.26 for N-mass to 0.54 for 13,P-mass indicating considerable covariation between biochemical traits and forest structural properties. N-mass was negatively related to the spatial heterogeneity of canopy density, whereas Pm, was negatively related to stand height and to the total cover of tree canopies. In the specific setting of this study, the importance of structural variables can be attributed to the presence of two tree species, featuring structural and biochemical properties different from co-occurring species. Still, existing functional linkages between structure and biochemistry at the leaf and canopy level suggest that canopy structure, used as proxy, can in general support the mapping of leaf biochemistry over broad spatial extents.', '[Ewald, Michael; Fassnacht, Fabian Ewald; Schmidtlein, Sebastian] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Geog & Geoecol, Kaiserstr 12, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.

An active fire detection algorithm based on VIRR data has already been designed and tested in different study areas worldwide. Most of the previously related algorithms were developed merely focusing on the spatial and spectral features of pixels while the temporal attributes of these observed active fires were ignored. In this research, multi-temporal VIRR data were used to construct time series of pixels. The core content of the algorithm consists of the changes in the time-series profiles together with the observed data. By calculating the predicted mid infrared (MIR) value and the stable MIR value of the target area, fire pixels can be easily distinguished. To assess the performance of this algorithm, a total of eight target areas distributed across the world were used for testing. Two stages of validation were carried out with data of different spatial resolutions. A rough comparison was carried out first. During this step, results from Collection 6 of MODIS Fire and Thermal Anomalies products (MOD14A1) and results generated from the previously used algorithm were used for comparison.

The quality of observations from VGI and the typical lack of an underlying probability sampling design raise concerns regarding use of VGI in widely-applied design-based statistical inference. This article focuses on the fundamental issue of sampling design used to acquire VGI. Design-based inference requires the sample data to be obtained via a probability sampling design. Options for incorporating VGI within design-based inference include: 1) directing volunteers to obtain data for locations selected by a probability sampling design; 2) treating VGI data as a \"certainty stratum\" and augmenting the VGI with data obtained from a probability sample; and 3) using VGI to create an auxiliary variable that is then used in a model-assisted estimator to reduce the standard error of an estimate produced from a probability sample. The latter two options can be implemented using VGI data that were obtained from a non-probability sampling design, but require additional sample data to be acquired via a probability sampling design. If the only data available are VGI obtained from a non-probability sample, properties of design-based inference that are ensured by probability sampling must be replaced by assumptions that may be difficult to verify. For example, pseudo-estimation weights can be constructed that mimic weights used in stratified sampling estimators. However, accuracy and area estimates produced using these pseudo-weights still require the VGI data to be representative of the full population, a property known as \"external validity\". Because design-based inference requires a probability sampling design, directing volunteers to locations specified by a probability sampling design is the most straightforward option for use of VGI in design-based inference. Combining VGI from a non-probability sample with data from a probability sample using the certainty stratum approach or the model-assisted approach are viable alternatives that meet the conditions required for design based inference and use the VGI data to advantage to reduce standard errors.', '[Stehman, Stephen V.] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Forest & Nat Resources Management, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.

Over most of the sea-ice free ocean, SIRAL operates in LRM mode and the classical iceberg detection algorithm can be applied without modification. It can also be applied to the Reduced SAR or pseudo-LRM data computed from SAR and SARin data. In SAR mode, iceberg signatures are bright spots in the waveform thermal noise part. They can be easily detected using classical image processing tools. The area of the iceberg is estimated using the size of the signature. In SARin mode, the coherence of the signals can insure the presence of scatterers above the sea surface and is used with the SAR detection algorithm to reduce the probability of false alarm and to better delineate icebergs.

The spatial resolution of existing soil maps can commonly be too coarse to account for local soil variations and owing to the cost and resource needs required to update information these maps lack temporal information. With improved computational processing capabilities, increased data storage and most recently, the increasing amount of freely available data (e.g. Landsat, Sentinel-2A/B), remote sensing imagery can be integrated into existing soil mapping approaches to increase temporal and spatial resolution of soil information. Satellite multi-temporal data allows for generating cloud free, radiometrically and phenologically consistent pixel based image composites of regional scale. Such data sets are of particular use for extracting soil information in areas of intermediate climate where soils are rarely exposed. The Soil Composite Mapping Processor (SCMaP) is a new approach designed to make use of per-pixel compositing to overcome the issue of limited soil exposure. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the automated processors ability to handle large image databases to build multispectral reflectance composite base data layers that can support large scale top soil analyses. The functionality of the SCMaP is demonstrated using Landsat imagery over Germany from 1984 to 2014 applied over 5 year periods. Three primary product levels are generated that will allow for a long term assessment and distribution of soils that include the distribution of exposed soils, a statistical information related to soil use and intensity and the generation of exposed soil reflectance image composites. The resulting composite maps provide useful value-added information on soils with the exposed soil reflectance composites showing high spatial coverage that correlate well with existing soil maps and the underlying geological structural regions.', '[Rogge, Derek; Zeidler, Julian; Mueller, Andreas; Esch, Thomas; Heiden, Uta] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, German Remote Sensing Data Ctr DFD, D-82234 Oberpfaffenhofen, Wessling, Germany.

There is an increasing need for albedo data to be available for use in applications that require a fine spatial resolution and for validating coarse-resolution datasets; however, such products with long-term global coverage are not available thus far. Existing algorithms for Landsat albedo estimation all require surface reflectance from explicit and reliable atmospheric correction, which may sometimes be unavailable or carry uncertainties due to saturated visible bands or a lack of dense vegetation. In addition, most of the existing algorithms require concurrent clear-sky observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) correction, which limited the data availability for Landsat albedo estimation. To overcome these problems, in this study, we adopt the direct estimation approach previously used with coarser resolution data, such as MODIS and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and apply it to multiple Landsat data obtained by Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +), and Operational Land Imager (OLI). By incorporating Landsat spectral response functions and a database of bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) into radiative transfer simulations, a unified algorithm is developed to estimate surface albedo directly from the Landsat top-of-atmospheric reflectance data obtained by MSS, TM, ETM +, and OLI with few ancillary inputs. To overcome the saturation problems in the visible bands of TM and ETM + over very bright surfaces, a refined approach is employed by using only non-saturated bands. The validation results against ground measurements over various land cover types and climate regions show that our algorithm is effective for both snow-free and snow-covered surfaces and can achieve root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of not more than 0.034. In addition, we show the high potential of the earlier MSS data for producing consistent surface albedo estimations based on inter-comparison with TM-based results with RMSEs of 0.011-0.017 and R-2 of 0.858-0.963. This long-term, 30-m resolution surface albedo estimation can date back to the early 1980s, which allows for improved understanding of long-term climate change and land cover change effects.', '[He, Tao] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.

One option to minimize this risk is the application of forest management measures aimed at generating species mixtures predicted to be more resilient to these threats. In order to apply such measures appropriately, forest managers need up-to-date, accurate and consistent forest maps at relatively fine spatial resolutions. Cost efficiency is a major factor when creating such maps. Taking European spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) as an example, this paper describes an innovative approach for mapping two tree species using a combination of commercial very high resolution WorldView-2 (WV2) images and Landsat time series data. As a first step, this study used a supervised object-based classification of WV2 images covering relatively small test sites distributed across the region of interest. Using these classification maps as training data, wall-to-wall mapping of fractional coverages of spruce and pine was achieved using multi-temporal Landsat data and Random Forests (RF) regression. The method was applied for the entire state of Bavaria (Germany), which comprises a total forested area of approximately 26,000 km(2). As applied here, this two-step approach yields consistent and accurate maps of fractional tree cover estimates with a spatial resolution of 1 ha. Independent validation of the fractional cover estimates using 3780 reference samples collected through visual interpretation of orthophotos produced root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 11% (for spruce) and 14% (for pine) with almost no bias, and R-2 values of 0.74 and 0.79 for spruce and pine, respectively. The majority of the validation samples (75% (spruce) and 84% (pine)) were modeled within the assumed uncertainty of +/- 15% of the reference sample. Accuracies were significantly better compared to those achieved using a single-step classification of Landsat time series data at the pixel level (30 m), because the two-step approach better captures regional variation in the spectral signatures of target classes. Moreover, the increased number of available reference cells mitigates the impact of occasional errors in the reference data set. This two-step approach has great potential for cost-effective operational mapping of dominant forest types over large areas.', '[Immitzer, Markus; Boeck, Sebastian; Einzmann, Kathrin; Vuolo, Francesco; Atzberger, Clement] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna BOKU, Inst Surveying Remote Sensing & Land Informat, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.

Therefore, ice velocity is an essential parameter for the assessment of mass balance. In this paper, we propose an approach for the multi-track extraction of two-dimensional ice surface velocity by the combined use of multiple-aperture interferometry (MAI) and differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR). The azimuth and ground range ice movements of each individual track are first estimated by the use of MAI and DInSAR, respectively. A seamless two-dimensional ice velocity map is then achieved by calibration andmosaicking of the estimated velocity of the multi-temporal and multi-track measurements over a large area. Finally, the dynamic behavior of the Amery Ice Shelf is analyzed by formulating a long-term series of ice flow velocities consisting of historical surface velocities (1968-1990), the estimated surface velocity by the proposed method with ERS-1/2 data (1996), existing surface velocity products such as the Radarsat-1 Antarctic Mapping Project (RAMP) velocities (1997-2000) and Rignot\'s results (2007-2010), as well as the estimated velocities obtained by the use of the offset tracking method from Landsat 8 images (2013-2014). The results show that the estimated velocity obtained by the use of the proposed method is superior to the other methods, and the long-term series of ice velocity measurements shows that the ice velocity in the Amery Ice Shelf has hardly changed over the past 45 years (1968-2014). We conclude that the ice flow velocity of the Amery Ice Shelf has showed a slight deceleration over the past 45 years.', '[Tong, Xiaohua; Liu, Shuang; Li, Rongxing; Xie, Huan; Liu, Shijie; Qiao, Gang; Feng, Tiantian; Tian, Yixiang; Ye, Zhen] Tongji Univ, Coll Surveying & Geoinformat, 1239 Siping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.

GCMs can take advantage of land surface models (LSMs), which aim to resolve surface energy, water and carbon budgets and hence these LSMs present important boundary conditions at the land-atmosphere interface. Pertinently, satellite data assimilation approaches are essential for improved land surface modelling for northern high latitudes ecosystems where permafrost degradation is reported to be ongoing. Permafrost, however, is an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) that cannot directly be monitored from space.   Here, we advocate that CDRs, such as those compiled under the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) programme, may be used in combination with permafrost models to improve our understanding of permafrost extent and degradation in a changing climate system. We describe the current types of remotely-sensed surface feature products that are widely used as indicators for permafrost related features. Furthermore, we highlight issues of using these site-specific permafrost proxies related to spatial scale, as well as the uncertainties in establishing present-day permafrost extent itself.   Our assessment of the key ECVs that impact on permafrost, demonstrates how models that incorporate EO CDRs have the potential to boost our knowledge of permafrost conditions through better parametrisation of the thermal regime of permafrost soils.

There is considerable interest in the potential of microrefugia to provide climate change resilience to landscapes and to biodiversity conservation. Although attractive conceptually, there is yet little guidance on how to identify climate change microrefugia in order to study and protect them, and the data required to do so are often lacking. This study demonstrates how time series remote sensing, using all available Landsat images of a study area, can be used to directly detect microrefugia maintained by water subsidies in a semi-arid landscape in southwest Western Australia.   Microrefugia were identified as pixels with abundant vegetation and consistent vegetation dynamics between wet and dry years. At every pixel, a harmonic model was fit to the intra-annual time series of vegetation index values compiled from the wettest years in the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) archive. This model was then used to predict the phenological cycle of the driest years at that pixel. Candidate microrefugia were defined to be those pixels with (1) high vegetation activity in dry years and (2) highly predictable phenologies that are consistent regardless of the weather conditions experienced in a given year. Spatial relationships between candidate microrefugia and landscape features associated with elevated moisture availability (thought to drive climate microrefugia in these semi-arid landscapes) were assessed. The candidate microrefugia show great promise. Evaluations against high-resolution imagery reveal that candidate microrefugia most likely buffer against drought, although refugia from other disturbances, especially fire, were also detected. In contrast, spatial proxies of the physical features expected to maintain microrefugia failed to adequately represent the distribution of microrefugia across the landscape, likely due to data quality and the heterogeneity of microrefugia. Direct detection of microrefugia with Earth observation data is a promising solution in data limited regions. Landsat time series analyses are well suited to this application as they can characterize both the habitat quality and stability aspects of microrefugia.', '[Andrew, Margaret E.; Warrener, Haylea] Murdoch Univ, Sch Vet & Life Sci, Environm & Conservat Sci, Murdoch, WA, Australia.', 'Murdoch UniversityRP Andrew, ME (通讯作者)，Murdoch Univ, Sch Vet & Life Sci, 90 South St, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia.', 'm.andrew@murdoch.edu.au', 'Andrew, Margaret/0000-0003-3285-3684', 'Gunduwa Regional Conservation Association', 'This research was funded by a Gunduwa Regional Conservation Association   grant to Conservation Council of Western Australia Citizen Science   Program and MEA, \'Do climate refugia exist on the conservation   stations?\' Special thanks are owed to collaborator Nic Dunlop (CCWA) for   contributions throughout the project and to Bush Heritage for   encouraging this research and field surveys at Charles Darwin Reserve.', 84, 12, 12, 0, 37, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Synergetic analysis of SMAP, SMOS and Argo data allows us to identify and exclude erroneous jumps or drift in some real-time buoy data from the assessment of the satellite data.

Comparison with individual Argo floats suggests the SMAP retrieval algorithm performs better in the Western Mediterranean region, but suffers from radio-frequency interference (RFI) and land contamination in the Eastern Mediterranean region and Adriatic Sea.', '[Tang, Wenqing; Fore, Alexander; Yueh, Simon; Lee, Tong; Hayashi, Akiko; Baranowski, Dariusz] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.

The products used have been developed by the Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) and are one geostationary climate dataset (SARAH-JRC), one polar-orbiting climate dataset (CLARA-A2) and one geostationary operational product. Further, the ERA-Interim reanalysis is also included in the comparison. The main objective is to determine the quality level of the daily means of CM SAF datasets, identifying their limitations, as well as analyzing the different factors that can interfere in the adequate validation of the products.   The quality of the pyranometer was the most critical source of uncertainty identified. In this respect, the use of records from Second Class pyranometers and silicon-based photodiodes increased the absolute error and the bias, as well as the dispersion of both metrics, preventing an adequate validation of the daily means. The best spatial estimates for the three datasets were obtained in Central Europe with a Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) within 8-13 W/m(2), whereas the MAD always increased at high-latitudes, snow-covered surfaces, high mountain ranges and coastal areas. Overall, the SARAH-JRC\'s accuracy was demonstrated over a dense network of stations making it the most consistent dataset for climate monitoring applications. The operational dataset was comparable to SARAH-JRC in Central Europe, but lacked of the temporal stability of climate datasets, while CLARA-A2 did not achieve the same level of accuracy despite predictions obtained showed high uniformity with a small negative bias. The ERA-Interim reanalysis shows the by-far largest deviations from the surface reference measurements. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Changes in tree-water relationships in the biodiversity hotspot of the tropical Andes in southern Ecuador might be potentially observed at the level of individual trees, thus providing an efficient ecosystem monitoring method with applications in forest management and conservation at the tree and landscape levels. In this study, we combine area-average measurements from a laser scintillometer above the forest with optical satellite data at high spatial resolution to obtain area-wide evapotranspiration data. The processing of field data includes the calculation of energy storage in forest biomass and the partitioning of evapotranspiration into transpiration and evaporation. Satellite-based estimates are calibrated by using tower flux measurements and meteorological data within periods of humid and less-humid atmosphere. The annual evapotranspiration was 1316 mm, of which 1086 mm per year corresponds to the forest transpiration at the study site. Average values of 4.7 and 4.1 mm d(-1) per tree crown are observed under humid and less-humid atmospheric conditions, respectively, when applying high-resolution area-wide evapotranspiration in individual crown analysis. Approximately 24% of the observed crowns show a positive monthly change in ET, and 51% of the crowns show a significant change in the daily ET, which can be considered sensitive individuals concerning water relationships. The limitations in the area-wide evapotranspiration at the crown level can be explained by considering the spectral responses of the crown individuals. The presented method can be robustly deployed in the ecological monitoring of mountain forests. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

While many studies in West Africa are conducted with coarse resolution earth observation data, few have tried to relate vegetation trends to explanatory factors, as is generally done in land use and land cover change (LULCC) studies at finer scales. In this study we proposed to make a bridge between vegetation trend analysis and LULCC studies to improve the understanding of the various factors that influence the biomass production changes observed in satellite time series (using integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI] as a proxy). The study was conducted in two steps. In the first step we analyzed MODIS NDVI linear trends together with TRMM growing season rainfall over the Sahel region from 2000 to 2015. A classification scheme was proposed that enables better specification of the relative role of the main drivers of biomass production dynamics. We found that 16% of the Sahel is re-greening-but found strong evidence that rainfall is not the only important driver of biomass increase. Moreover, a decrease found in 5% of the Sahel can be chiefly attributed to factors other than rainfall (88%). In the second step, we focused on the \"Degre Carre de Niamey\" site in Niger. Here, the observed biomass trends were analyzed in relation to land cover changes and a set of potential drivers of LULCC using the Random Forest algorithm. We observed negative trends (29% of the Niger site area) mainly in tiger bush areas located on lateritic plateaus, which are particularly prone to pressures from overgrazing and overlogging. The significant role of accessibility factors in biomass production trends was also highlighted. Our methodological framework may be used to highlight changing areas and their major drivers to identify target areas for more detailed studies. Finer-scale assessments of the long-term vulnerability of populations can then be made to substantiate food security management policies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Although a variety of remote sensing based approaches have been developed and applied to Landsat mission imagery to infer burn severity at 30 m spatial resolution, forest burn severity have still been seldom assessed at fine spatial scales (5 m) from very-high-resolution (VHR) data. We assessed a 432 ha forest fire that occurred in April 2012 on Long Island, New York, within the Pine Barrens region, a unique but imperiled fire-dependent ecosystem in the northeastern United States. The mapping of forest burn severity was explored here at fine spatial scales, for the first time using remotely sensed spectral indices and a set of Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) fraction images from bi-temporal pre- and post-fire event - WorldView-2 (WV-2) imagery at 2 m spatial resolution. We first evaluated our approach using 1 m by 1 m validation points at the sub-crown scale per severity class (i.e. unburned, low, moderate, and high severity) from the post-fire 0.10 m color aerial ortho-photos; then, we validated the burn severity mapping of geo-referenced dominant tree crowns (crown scale) and 15 m by 15 m fixed-area plots (inter-crown scale) with the post-fire 0.10 m aerial ortho-photos and measured crown information of twenty forest inventory plots. Our approach can accurately assess forest burn severity at the sub-crown (overall accuracy is 84% with a Kappa value of 0.77), crown (overall accuracy is 82% with a Kappa value of 0.76), and inter-crown scales (89% of the variation in estimated burn severity ratings (i.e. Geo-Composite Burn Index (CBI)). This work highlights that forest burn severity mapping from VHR data can capture heterogeneous fire patterns at fine spatial scales over the large spatial extents. This is important since most ecological processes associated with fire effects vary at the <30 m scale and VHR approaches could significantly advance our ability to characterize fire effects on forest ecosystems.

The eddy co-variance technique was used to measure net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 between paddy rice croplands and the atmosphere, and the resultant NEE data then partitioned into GPP (GPP(Ec)) and ecosystem respiration. In this study, we first used the GPP(Ec) data from four paddy rice flux tower sites in South Korea, Japan and the USA to evaluate the biophysical performance of three vegetation indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) in terms of phenology (crop growing seasons) and GPP(Ec), which are derived from images taken by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors. We also ran the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), which is driven by EVI, LSWI, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and air temperature, to estimate GPP over multiple years at these four sites (GPP(VPM)). The 14 site-years of simulations show that the seasonal dynamics of GPP(VPM) successfully tracked the seasonal dynamics of GPPEc (R-2 > 0.88 or higher). The cross-site comparison also shows that GPP(VPM) agreed reasonably well with the variations of GPP(Ec) across both years and sites. The simulation results clearly demonstrate the potential of the VPM model and MODIS images for estimating GPP of paddy rice croplands in the monsoon climates of South Korea and Japan and the Mediterranean climate in California, USA. The application of VPM to regional simulations in the near future may provide crucial GPP data to support the studies of food security and cropland carbon cycle around the world.

Here, we present our observations of MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)derived Land Surface Temperature (LST) anomaly for earthquakes in the largest tectonically active Himalayan and Andean mountain belts. We report the appearance of fairly detectable pre-earthquake Snow Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies. We use 16 years (2000-2015) of MODIS CST time-series data to robustly conclude our findings for three of the most destructive earthquakes that occurred in 2015 in the high mountains of Nepal, Chile, and Afghanistan. We propose the physical basis behind higher sensitivity of snow towards geothermal emissions. Although the preliminary appearance of SST anomalies and their amplitudes vary, we propose employing a global-scale monitoring system for detecting and studying such spatio-temporal geophysical signals. With the advent of improved remote sensors, we anticipate that such efforts can be another step towards improved earthquake predictions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We found a general positive relationship between the inter-annual NDVI variability and the annual tree growth in most of the analyzed forests. Nevertheless, there were strong differences in the tree growth responses to NDVI, given that the annual tree-ring records in each forest responded in a different way to the magnitude, seasonality and accumulation period of the NDVI values. Thus, we found eight main patterns of tree-ring response to the NDVI, which were related to the forest type and climate conditions of each corresponding site. The identified patterns may be useful for determining early-warning signals of changes in forest growth over large areas based on remote sensing information. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Particularly, tropical deforestation is a major driver of biodiversity decline and substantial carbon emissions. Regrowth of secondary vegetation may help to restore habitat for many threatened species and improve ecosystem services that deteriorated due to deforestation. However, spatial-temporal patterns of regrowing secondary vegetation in the tropics remain weakly understood. We therefore analyze regrowth dynamics across two different land use systems in southern Amazonia: the extensive pastoralism in Para and the capital-intensive agriculture in Mato Grosso. Both systems are connected by the BR-163 highway, which represents a major axis of deforestation and agricultural development in the Brazilian Amazon since decades. We used a 29 year time series of Landsat images to extract regrowth extent, duration, lag time between deforestation and regrowth, and frequency of regrowth cycles. Our results reached an overall accuracy of 89% and showed regrowth on up to 50% of the deforested area in Para and a maximum of 25% in Mato Grosso. In both states, annual regrowth rates drastically dropped after 1996, which coincided with socioeconomic transformations and drought events. The majority of regrowth was concentrated within 60 m distance to forest edges and cleared again after an average of 5 years. Our approach bears great potential for mapping post deforestation regrowth dynamics within and beyond the Brazilian Amazon based on long-term and freely accessible remote sensing data collections, such as the Landsat and the forthcoming Sentinel-2 archives.

Several bio-optical inversion models have been developed for this purpose. However, care must be taken when they are applied to waters where optical properties significantly differ from model assumptions, which is the case in the Mediterranean Sea. Algorithm testing and validation are thus required before routine use. Here, in situ radiometric measurements collected in the NW Mediterranean Sea (BOUSSOLE site) are used to evaluate three bio-optical inversion models that retrieve the CDM light absorption coefficients at 443 nm (a(cdm)(443)). Although all methods reproduced the CDM seasonal cycles at the surface, comparisons of predicted and in situ acdm(443) coefficients showed that the Quasi-Analytical Algorithm version 6 (QAAv6) and a locally-adapted version of the Garver-Siegel-Maritorena model (GSM-Med) were the two best algorithms. Applying these two models to SeaWiFS remote sensing reflectances, collected between 2003 and 2010, reproduced with good accuracy the acdm(443) coefficients retrieved from field radiometric measurements at the BOUSSOLE site, with seasonal patterns consistent with previous observations. Finally, bio-optical relationships derived from satellite-retrieved a(cdm)(443) and chlorophyll values confirmed the higher-than-average CDM contribution for a given chlorophyll concentration in the Mediterranean Sea as compared to many oceanic regions.

Remote sensing tools are capable of assessing dynamics in wildlife-habitat associations over a wide range of spatial scales and in a variety of ecosystems. As already well-established in other ecosystems, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDaR) technology has the potential to greatly expand our understanding of tundra wildlife-habitat associations because unlike the most commonly used spectral vegetation index - the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) - LiDaR directly quantifies three-dimensional (3-D) vegetation structure. Only recently has airborne laser scanning (ALS) technology evolved to having vertical resolution and point densities high enough to quantify small differences in vegetation structure, such as characterize arctic tundra ecosystems. Our objective was to employ ALS metrics, airborne spectral data (for NDVI), and Landsat 7 ETM + data (for snow cover) to determine the relative importance of a suite of ecological characteristics - considered at multiple spatial scales - on habitat use and reproductive success of two of the most common migratory songbird species breeding in northern Alaska. Our most important findings are that (1) combining ALS metrics, but not NDVI, with Landsat derived snow cover data provided useful information, revealing that while Gambel\'s white-crowned sparrows use breeding territories in areas with high canopy volume and large snow-free areas, Lapland longspurs will establish territories in areas with low canopy volume, small patches of snow-free tundra, and minimal surface wetness and; (2) while habitat characteristics were important determinants of habitat use for both species at the territory scale, those in the immediate vicinity of nest sites were not important. Contrary to expectation, we also found that the reproductive success of both species was unaffected by variation in our hypothesized metrics of shelter and food availability (canopy volume, standard deviation of micro-terrain height) at both the nest-site or territory scales. Our study is the first arctic demonstration of how ALS yields novel insights into wildlife-habitat associations, suggesting it has great potential in other ecosystems with similarly small - yet often ecologically important - ranges in 3-D vegetation structure.

Monitoring subsequent change in marsh plant community distributions is critical to assess ecosystem impacts and to establish future coastal management priorities. Strategically deployed airborne imaging spectrometers, like the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), offer the spectral and spatial resolution needed to differentiate plant species. However, obtaining satisfactory and consistent classification accuracies over time is a major challenge, particularly in dynamic intertidal landscapes.   Here, we develop and evaluate an image classification system for a time series of AVIRIS data for mapping dominant species in a heavily oiled salt marsh ecosystem. Using field-referenced image endmembers and canonical discriminant analysis (CDA), we classified 21 AVIRIS images acquired during the fall of 2010, 2011 and 2012. Classification results were evaluated using ground surveys that were conducted contemporaneously to AVIRIS collection dates. We analyzed changes in dominant species cover from 2010 to 2012 for oiled and non-oiled shorelines.   CDA discriminated dominant species with a high level of accuracy (overall accuracy = 82%, kappa = 0.78) and consistency over three imaging dates (overall(2010) = 82%, overall(2011) = 82%, overall(2012) = 88%). Marshes dominated by Spartina alterniflora were the most spatially abundant in shoreline zones (<= 28 m from shore) for all three dates (2010 = 79%, 2011 = 61%, 2012 = 63%), followed by Juncus roemerianus (2010 = 11%, 2011 = 19%, 2012 = 17%) and Distichlis spicata (2010 = 4%, 2011 = 10%, 2012 = 7%).   Marshes that were heavily contaminated with oil exhibited variable responses from 2010 to 2012. Marsh vegetation classes converted to a subtidal, open water class along oiled and non-oiled shorelines that were similarly situated in the landscape. However, marsh loss along oil-contaminated shorelines doubled that of non-oiled shorelines. Only S. alterniflora dominated marshes were extensively degraded, losing 15% (354,604 m(2)) cover in oiled shoreline zones, suggesting that S. alterniflora marshes may be more vulnerable to shoreline erosion following hydrocarbon stress, due to their landscape position.

ESA\'s Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and NASA\'s Aquarius/SAC-D salinity missions can provide such data, but it remains unclear if the accuracy of these sensors is high enough to properly study this dynamic region. To address this issue, this study validates both SMOS and Aquarius against monthly in situ data from Argo floats. All available, corresponding data points over a three year period have root mean square differences less than 0.2 pss and correlation coefficients greater than 0.9. Additionally, over 80% of differences between the products fall between +/- 0.5 pss. Surface salt transports were calculated to see how well the satellite products estimate SSS advection in the Agulhas region. Zonal and meridional surface salt transports have annual maxima in austral winter and minima in austral summer, although the seasonal range is small. Using Argo, SMOS, and Aquarius SSS for this calculation produces statistically identical results, suggesting the utility of using the satellites to monitor regional salinity advection at higher frequencies and horizontal resolutions than previously possible using only sparse in situ data. SSS gradients along the subtropical front reveal that SMOS and Aquarius are much more effective tools for observing small-scale structure prevalent in the meandering of the Agulhas Return Current. Finally, we conclude that when compared to Argo floats in situ observations SMOS and Aquarius are statistically accurate and may yet prove powerful tools for observing Agulhas salinity processes on smaller time and spatial scales.

This research effort is particularly focused on establishing the effective spatial resolution of the global MODIS and VIIRS Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) and Albedo products. The standard MODIS Products (MCD43) are created by fitting a kernel-driven, semi-empirical BRDF model to multi-date, multi-angular surface reflectance data to establish the surface reflectance anisotropy of a location. Emphasis on a particular date within the rolling multi-date period has resulted in a daily product reported on a 500 m Sinusoidal grid tiling system. While anecdotal and theoretical experiences have suggested that this product would be representative of a larger surface area than the 500 m grid, this research both quantifies that effect, and verifies that the spatial effective resolution is consistently less than 1 km for MODIS. Results for 500 m VIIRS NBAR product show an improvement of approximately 250 m in spatial effective resolution along the scan direction. In addition to their use in modeling, the MODIS BRDF/Albedo/NBAR products (and into the future with the analogous VIIRS products) are increasingly being relied upon to monitor vegetation phenology, identify land cover and land cover disturbance, track snow fall and melt, and establish surface energy balance variability. Thus, this research provides the quantification both for MODIS and VIIRS necessary for the effective use of these products by the global modeling and monitoring communities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

These metrics represent critical habitat components for various wildlife species of conservation concern, including the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), which is strongly associated with recently burned conifer forest. We assessed the potential of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) to detect and characterize conifer snags and identify Black-backed Woodpecker habitat using previously derived empirical thresholds of conifer snag basal area. Over the footprint of the Rim Fire, a megafire that extended (similar to 104,000 ha) through a heterogeneous mosaic of conifer forests, oak woodlands, and meadows in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, we identified conifer snags and estimated their basal area from single-tree ALS-derived metrics using Gaussian processes in four major steps. First, individual trees were mapped using the Watershed Segmentation algorithm, resulting in 87% detection of trees with stem diameter larger than 30 cm. Second, the snag/live classification model identified snags with an overall accuracy of 91.8%, using the coefficient of variation of height and intensity together with maximum intensity and fractional cover as the most relevant metrics. Third, the conifer/hardwood snag classification model utilizing the maximum height, median height, minimum intensity, and area metrics separated snag forest types with an overall accuracy of 84.8%. Finally, a Gaussian process regression model reliably estimated conifer snag stem diameter (R-2 = 0.81) using height and crown area, thus significantly outperforming regionally calibrated conifer-specific allometric equations. As a result,-80% of the snag basal area have been mapped. Optimal and potential habitat for Black-backed Woodpecker comprise 53.7 km(2) and 58.4 km(2), respectively, representing 5.1 and 5.6% of the footprint of the Rim Fire. Our study illustrates the utility of high-density ALS data for characterizing recently burned forests, which, in conjunction with information about the habitat needs of particular snag-dependent wildlife species, can be used to assess habitat characteristics, and thus contribute greatly to forest management and biodiversity conservation.

To mitigate these effects, we developed a by-pixel filtering algorithm to produce relatively cloud-free SCA products from 16 days of MODIS imagery. The algorithm uses previous days\' data to estimate the current SCA value of each pixel and uses a simple persistence test to reduce the effects of spurious SCA/cloud classifications in the input products. To be positively identified as SCA, a pixel must be snow-covered in the two most recent, cloud-free scenes of the 16-day period. We applied this time-domain-filtering (TDF) methodology to two single-day MODIS fractional snow cover products (MOD10A1 and MODSCAG) over the MODIS period of record (2000-present) and compared the outputs to the unfiltered products, to filtered maps generated using the cloud-gap-filled algorithm (CGF, Hall et al., 2010), and to historical snow assessment reports from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL). The CRREL reports were manually generated and quality-controlled by an analyst and are treated as ground truth. We find that, when applied to MODSCAG, the TDF algorithm successfully fills in gap pixels and limits the effects of snow/cloud confusion and produces a filtered product that is more consistent and accurate than the MODSCAG CGF product and comparable to the MOD10A1 CGF product.

In this study, we present an improvement on the parameterization equations in the inverse scheme of the 2Seacolor model. The improved model is then validated with three in-situ datasets and compared with the Zhang model (Zhang & Fell, 2007) and the Lee model (Lee, Darecki et al., 2005). Validation with radiometric data shows that the 2SeaColor model provides the best estimates of K-d for the full range of observations, with the largest determination coefficient (R-2 = 0.935) and the smallest root mean squared error (RMSE = 0.078 m(-1)). For clear waters, where K-d(490) < 0.2, the Zhang model provides the most accurate K-d estimations, but results from the Lee model and the 2SeaColor are rather comparable. For turbid waters, where K-d(490) > 0.2 m(-1), the 2SeaColor model is found to be more accurate, with an RMSE of 0.186 m(-1), compared to RMSEs of 0279 m(-1) and 0388 m(-1) for the Zhang model and the Lee model, respectively.   The 2SeaColor model is finally applied to the GOCI (Geostationary Ocean Color Imager) level 2 product (L2P) to produce K-d maps over the Yangtze Estuary, resulting in a reasonable distribution and expected range of K-d, as for example K-d(490) was varying from 0.04 to 9.82 m(-1) for the image acquired at 02:16 UTC, on March 8th 2013. The analytical 2SeaColor model is able to provide consistently stable and fairly accurate K-d estimates in both clear and turbid waters without the need of tuning empirical coefficients from field measurements, and thus has great potential for estimating K-d over optically complex waters.

We elaborated on a dataset of volcanic ash measurements made by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) onboard the Aqua satellite. The measured brightness temperatures in the ash cloud data revealed silicate absorption features at around 10 pm. By applying atmospheric profiles from results of a global data assimilation system and using ash cloud properties (ash optical depth, effective radius, and ash cloud height) as parameters for radiative transfer calculations, least squares analyses for the observed and calculated brightness temperatures were conducted using AIRS channels in the wavenumber range of 700-1100 cm(-1), except for the 03 absorption channels in the range of 980-1070 cm(-1). Using the Ms for typical volcanic rocks in the ascending order of SiO2 content, basalt, andesite, and rhyolite, a mixture of basalt and rhyolite and a mixture of andesite and rhyolite for the ash material were considered. The volume fraction of the mixture was used as a retrieval parameter and as the ash cloud parameter. Using the estimated ash cloud parameters as fixed values, and under the assumption that the RI from the estimated volume fraction had some accuracy in the wavenumber ranges of 850-980 cm(-1) and 1070-1100 cm(-1), the RI imaginary part of each eruptive ash cloud captured by AIRS was then determined from iterative calculations at wavenumbers between 750 cm(-1) and 980 cm(-1). In the wavenumber range of 850-980 cm(-1), the observed brightness temperatures could be approximately simulated using the reported Ms from Pollack, Toon, and Khare (1973) for andesite, basalt, and rhyolite, and their combinations. Furthermore, some estimated Ms were consistent with the reported rock types of the volcanoes, which had been previously classified by compositional analyses in the literature. Our analysis also identified weak absorptions around 750-850 cm(-1), which could not be reproduced by the reported Ms. These weak absorptions were likely due to Si-O and/or Al-O vibrations, which have been proposed in reports from previous laboratory experiments for some silicate glass samples. Our results suggest that the detailed RI of volcanic ash can be determined from an analysis of satellite infrared sounder data. The RI of the ash material estimated from satellite infrared sounder data can be used to improve the ash retrieval algorithms of other satellite measurements. Furthermore, an RI retrieved by sounder measurements may provide diagnostic information regarding volcanic activity from comparisons with the ash Ms from past eruptions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Examples are forest management inventories, where a linking model is used in combination with airborne laser scanning data to estimate stand-level forest parameters where no or too few observations are collected within the stand. This paper focuses on different approaches to estimating the variances of those estimates. We compared a variance estimator which is based on the estimation of superpopulation parameters with variance estimators which are based on predictions of finite population values. One of the latter variance estimators considered the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals whereas the other one did not. The estimators were applied using timber volume on stand level as the variable of interest and photogrammetric image matching data as auxiliary information. Norwegian National Forest Inventory (NFI) data were used for model calibration and independent data clustered within stands were used for validation. The empirical coverage proportion (ECP) of confidence intervals (CIs) of the variance estimators which are based on predictions of finite population values was considerably higher than the ECP of the CI of the variance estimator which is based on the estimation of superpopulation parameters. The ECP further increased when considering the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals. The study also explores the link between confidence intervals that are based on variance estimates as well as the well-known confidence and prediction intervals of regression models. 2015 The Authors.

Volcanic ash (VA) plumes from those eruptions affected the population near the volcano and posed a significant threat to aviation. Since its launch on June 27, 2010, the Meteorological Imager (MI) onboard Korea\'s first geostationary meteorological satellite, the Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS), has provided time-resolved images (less than 27-minute intervals for the full disk) at 1 km spatial resolution for the visible (VIS) channel and 4 km spatial resolution for the four infrared (IR) channels. In this study, MI operational data with one broadband VIS channel (centered at 0.68 mu m) and three IR channels (centered at 3.7,10.8, and 12.0 mu m) for eruption events occurring at Shinmoedake were analyzed using the formerly developed hybrid VA detection and retrieval algorithm. We analyzed time-resolved VA plumes produced during three subplinian eruptions and found that spatio-temporal distributions of VA pixels determined by this analysis agreed with the source-receptor regions in meteorological trajectory modeling as well as with the operational products from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2), Scanning Imaging Absorption spectrometer for Atmospheric Cartography (SCIAMACHY), and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). For the three subplinian eruptions, VA retrieval results revealed that the maximum total ash mass loadings were 115.1, 1309.7, and 513 t, and the maximum height reached by the ash clouds were 5.6 +/- 0.7, 10.2 +/- 2.4, and 5.6 +/- 0.8 km, respectively. These values imply that the second eruption emitted the largest amount of VA into the atmosphere. Overall, this is the first study that has been conducted to detect VA using the COMS/MI observations, which have been determined to provide reliable estimates of VA.

Detailed reconstructions based on real tree geometry are, however, hard to obtain based on conventional field measurements and sampling. We describe and evaluate an alternative approach to reconstruct the forest canopy from sparse, leaf-off airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with a wall-to-wall coverage. The approach employs computational geometry and topological connectivity to generate filtrations, i.e., ordered sets of simplices belonging to the three-dimensional (3D) triangulations of the point data, and numerical optimization to select the set of simplices with a quasi-optimal relationship with field measured forest biophysical attributes. The approach was evaluated by predicting the quantities and spatial patterns of biomass-related forest attributes according to the characteristics of the filtration. When the filtration parameters were optimized for 245 sample plots of 300 m(2) located in southern boreal forest in Finland, the coefficients of determination (R-2) between total volumes of the filtrations and basal area, stem volume, total above-ground biomass, and canopy biomass were 0.93, 0.87, 0.87, and 0.62, respectively. Considerably less accurate results (R-2 = 0.44-0.64) were obtained when the filtration parameters were predicted with a limited number of the calibration field plots. However, these accuracies could be obtained with modest field training data of 20-30 plots. The proposed approach is a compromise between the parameterization of the forest scene by artificial tree/crown level turbid media and realistic 3D models. The results particularly suggest that obtaining coarse wall-to-wall descriptions does not require separate data acquisitions, but may be based on data existing due to previous practical inventories.

Here we use total DMSP (DMSPt) and ancillary measurements from a global database to develop a remote sensing algorithm for DMSPt in the upper mixed layer (UML). Over 55% of total DMSPt variability (log(10) scale) is explained by in situ chlorophyll a (Chl) after dividing the database into two subsets, according to \"stratified\" and \"mixed\" water column criteria, based on the ratio between euphotic layer depth (Z(eu)) and mixed layer depth (MLD). Up to 70% of the variability is explained when adding sea surface temperature (SST) and log(10)(Z(eu)/MLD) as predictors for the stratified and mixed subsets, respectively. Independent validation on satellite Chl match-ups indicates that the algorithm predicts DMSPt across three orders of magnitude with a root-mean-squared error spanning from 0.20 to 0.26 (log(10) space) and mean absolute error typically around 45% (linear space). An additional submodel based on remotely sensed particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) is used to predict DMSPt in coccolithophore blooms if satellite Chl is not available. We use the algorithm to produce a monthly global DMSPt climatology, and estimate that DMSP synthesis amounts to 5-9% of oceanic phytoplankton gross carbon production. Our algorithm provides a new remote sensing tool for resolving temporal and spatial variations in DMSPt concentration, and represents a step forward toward improved diagnosis of contemporary DMS emission based on satellite Earth observation.

Satellite-derived growing season time-integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GSN) has been used as a proxy for vegetation biomass productivity. A 250-m grassland biomass productivity map for the Greater Platte River Basin had been developed based on the relationship between Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GSN and Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) annual grassland productivity. However, the 250-m MODIS grassland biomass productivity map does not capture detailed ecological features (or patterns) and may result in only generalized estimation of the regional total productivity. Developing a high or moderate spatial resolution (e.g., 30-m) productivity map to better understand the regional detailed vegetation condition and ecosystem services is preferred. The 30-m Landsat data provide spatial detail for characterizing human-scale processes and have been successfully used for land cover and land change studies. The main goal of this study is to develop a 30-m grassland biomass productivity estimation map for central Nebraska, leveraging 250-m MODIS GSN and 30-m Landsat data. A rule-based piecewise regression GSN model based on MODIS and Landsat (r = 0.91) was developed, and a 30-m MODIS equivalent GSN map was generated. Finally, a 30-m grassland biomass productivity estimation map, which provides spatially detailed ecological features and conditions for central Nebraska, was produced. The resulting 30-m grassland productivity map was generally supported by the SSURGO biomass production map and will be useful for regional ecosystem study and local land management practices.

Regression equations developed for three distinct geomorphological environments suggest a positive linear relationship between the rate of diffuse SGD and the spatial extent of the observed coastal TIR anomalies; such a relationship provides quantitative evidence of the ability to use TIR remote sensing as a tool to remotely identify and measure SGD. Landsat TIR scenes were unable to resolve any of the 18 TIR anomalies identified during the various airborne overflights. Two locations were studied in greater detail via Rn-222 time series and manual seepage meters in order to understand why specific shoreline segments did not exhibit a TIR anomaly. SGD at the first site, located within a large, diffuse TIR anomaly, was composed of a mixture of fresh groundwater and circulated seawater with elevated levels of nitrate. In contrast, SGD at the second site, where no coastal TIR anomaly was observed, was composed of circulated seawater with negligible nitrate. Despite the compositional differences in seepage, both sites were similar in discharge magnitude, with average time series Rn-222 derived SGD rates equal to 18 and 8 cm d(-1) for the TIR site and non-TIR site, respectively. Results suggest that TIR remote sensing has the ability to identify locations of a mixture between diffuse fresh and circulated seawater SGD. If TIR anomalies can be demonstrated to represent a mixture between fresh and circulated seawater SGD, then the cumulative area of the TIR anomalies may be used to estimate the fresh fraction of SGD relative to the cumulative area of the seepage face, and thus allows for improved SGD derived nutrient flux calculations on a regional scale.

Notwithstanding their widespread diffusion in temperate to subtropical shallow lakes, little effort has been performed so far in extensively mapping macrophyte communities at regional to continental scale. A rule-based classification scheme was implemented for mapping four macrophyte community types (helophyte, emergent rhizophyte, floating, and submerged-floating association). Input features were selected among multi-spectral reflectance and multi-temporal vegetation indices, based on Landsat data acquired over four test sites: Lake Taihu (China), Kis-Balaton wetland (Hungary), Lake Trasimeno and Mantua Lakes system (Italy). The best performing features were derived from Water Adjusted Vegetation Index (WAVI) computed at: early spring, maximum growth, and late autumn conditions. Overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient (k) of macrophyte maps produced with our approach over the ensemble of four sites were 90.1% and 0.865, respectively, with best performance in European temperate areas (OA = 93.6-94.2%, k = 0.887-0.916), and lower scores for subtropical Lake Taihu (OA = 82.8%, k = 0.762). Per-class accuracies were higher than 80% for all target classes, except for the submerged-floating association, with misclassifications concentrated in Taihu site. The robustness of the approach was tested over two independent validation cases: a different site (i.e. Lake Varese, Italy), and a different input dataset (i.e. AVNIR-2 data, for Mantua Lakes system). Consistent accuracy results were achieved: OA = 94.3% (k = 0.922) and OA = 85.6% (k = 0.766), with some misclassification due to spatial resolution of AVNIR-2 data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, the conventional DInSAR can measure only the one-dimensional (1D) ground displacement along the radar line of sight (LOS), and the crucial displacement measurements, e.g., near the epicenter and along the surface ruptures, are usually not available or degraded in quality due to the significant deformation gradients. With availability of satellite SAR images acquired along ascending and descending orbits, this paper proposes an integrated method to map the three-dimensional (3D) coseismic deformation field by combining DInSAR for detecting LOS displacements, the multiple aperture interferometry (MAI) for detecting along-track displacements, and the displacement gradient tensor (DGT) model for characterizing spatial correlation of ground displacements. The proposed method (termed as InSAR-DGT) was first tested through an experiment of recovering 3D displacements from a simulated coseismic deformation field. We then applied the proposed method to map the 3D coseismic deformation field related to the 2011 Tarlay earthquake (Myanmar) by using the ascending and descending ALOS PALSAR images. Both the results derived for the simulated experiment and the 2011 Tarlay earthquake show that the quality of the 3D coseismic displacements can be raised efficiently by the InSAR-DGT method, and the precisions in the east-west (E-W), north-south (N-S) and up-down (U-D) displacements for the 2011 Tarlay earthquake are increased 22%, 36% and 24%, respectively. The validation indicates that the improved coseismic deformation field for the 2011 Tarlay earthquake is in good agreement with the deformation field simulated from the existing optimized fault model. The number of the missing data points in the 3D coseismic deformation field can be reduced significantly by the InSAR-DGT method. It is revealed that the causative fault (i.e., the west part of the Nam Ma Fault) for the Tarlay earthquake generated a left-lateral slip that was accompanied by a minor normal dip-slip component. The careful interpretation demonstrates that the causative fault structures include the determined main fault segment and the two suspected branched segments at east of the Tarlay town.

In this paper we seek to quantify the inevitable under-reporting of dust events in Quick-Look imagery, via a three-year case study over the Lake Eyre Basin (LEB), the largest dust source in Australia and the southern hemisphere. Dust event identification from MODIS imagery is compared with the level of dust mobilization inferred from measurements of near-surface aerosol made by a continuously-operating integrating nephelometer, located at the AeroSpan/AERONET station at Tinga Tingana in the Strzelecki Desert, adjacent to major dust sources in the LEB. The analysis indicates a major upward revision in the overall dust event frequency by -72%, including a doubling of the incidence of major dust outbreaks. The intensity of missed events increases toward late afternoon and evening, although without a net day-night bias. These factors suggest the potential of new geostationary sensors and the analysis of night-time polar orbiting imagery in improving the reporting of dust mobilization over active dust-source regions. For the LEB, the corrections are crucial in understanding not only the seasonal distribution of dust mobilization, but its interannual variability and climatology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Accurate estimates of snow cover spatial distribution and temporal dynamics are important at regional and local scales as snow cover is projected to decrease due to global climate change. We examined regional-scale temporal trends in snow distribution across central and northern Arizona using two tiles of 2928 daily images of MOD10 snow product. The analysis included the entire MODIS archive time period, October 1,2003-June 1, 2014, and a 245,041 km(2) area of 51 HUC8 watersheds. We also examined the effects of a regional forest restoration effort, known as the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI), aimed at enhancing snow accumulation and retention for increased groundwater recharge through forest thinning and burning treatments. We analyzed 66 Landsat TM/ETM + images spanning 26 years between 1988 and 2014 at five sites and one hyperspectral image from 2014 at two sites. The MOD10 snow product performs well in estimating Arizona\'s thin and discontinuous snow distribution. Mann-Kendall time-series analysis indicate significantly increasing trends in the annual number of snow cover days (SCD) over the 12-year period in 1.6% of the region at elevation transitions such as the Mogollon Rim in central Arizona, while significantly decreasing trends are observed at a few locations of lower elevations leading to the desert margins in eastern Arizona. The observed temporal trends are mostly consistent with ground-based SNOTEL snow measurements. An Arizona specific, Landsat sensor-derived binary classification model, similar to the MOD10 product, was developed at a local scale. It performs better than commonly-used simple threshold-based approaches, but demonstrates the continued challenges associated with Landsat sensor-derived snow classification in Arizona likely due to its coarse temporal resolution. Landsat-derived multi-temporal Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) analysis indicate that treated (thinned and thinned-and-burned) forest sites had significantly greater NDSI values than untreated control sites. Snowpack at treated sites also appeared to persist longer into the spring season with potentially greater contributions to groundwater recharge in this semi-arid region. The high-resolution hyperspectral data analysis indicate that sites treated to approximately 24% forest canopy cover appear to have an optimum threshold for accumulating and maintaining snowpack. It balances canopy cover versus canopy gap, which reduces snow interception and sublimation by canopy, while providing enough shade. These results are encouraging for the 4FRI, the first and largest forest restoration effort in the US history, aimed at improving watershed health and function in the face of changing climate.

Efficient wind energy projects rely on accurate wind resource estimates, which are complex to obtain offshore due to the temporal and spatial sparseness of observations, and the potential for temporal data gaps introduced by the formation of ice during winter months, especially in freshwater lakes. For this study, in situ observations from 70 coastal stations and 20 buoys provide diurnal, seasonal, and interannual wind variability information, with time series that range from 3 to 11 years in duration. Remotely-sensed equivalent neutral winds provide spatial information on the wind climate. NASA QuikSCAT winds are temporally consistent at a 25 km resolution. ESA Synthetic Aperture Radar winds are temporally sparse but at a resolution of 500 m. As an initial step, each data set is processed independently to create a map of 90 m wind speeds. Buoy data are corrected for ice season gaps using ratios of the mean and mean cubed of the Weibull distribution, and reference temporally-complete time series from the North American Regional Reanalysis. Generalized wind climates are obtained for each buoy and coastal site with the wind model WAsP, and combined into a single wind speed estimate for the Great Lakes region. The method of classes is used to account for the temporal sparseness in the SAR data set and combine all scenes into one wind speed map. QuikSCAT winds undergo a seasonal correction due to lack of data during the cold season that is based on its ratio relative to buoy time series. All processing steps reduce the biases of the individual maps relative to the buoy observed wind climates. The remote sensing maps are combined by using QuikSCAT to scale the magnitude of the SAR map. Finally, the in situ predicted wind speeds are incorporated. The mean spatial bias of the final map when compared to buoy time series is 0.1 ms(-1) and the RMSE 03 ms(-1), which represents an uncertainty reduction of 50% relative to using only SAR, and of 40% to using only SAR and QuikSCAT without in situ observations.

The ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite) elevation data in combination with the DEM is then employed to investigate glacier thickness changes. The WKM region consists of 537 glaciers (>0.02 km(2)) with a total area of 3137 km(2) in 2013. Out of these, 16 groups of glaciers covering an area about 1234 km(2) (2013) showed varying surface elevation trends ranging from -0.4 +/- 020 m/a to 0.7 +/- 24 m/a over 2003-2008, except the serious thinning trend (-1.15 +/- 0.41 m/a) detected at a surging glacier. The surging glacier (the Zhongfeng glacier) is characterized by drastic elevation variations (up to -80 m) and contrasting trends over the accumulation areas due to cavein and rapid transfer of ice to the downstream. The heterogeneous glacier behavior in the WKM region was not only exemplified in the varying mass balances of individual glaciers but also the spatial variability of elevation trends over different glacier parts (accumulation\\ ablation areas). Analysis of the heterogeneity shows that such glacier dynamics were probably associated with local glacier parameters including altitude, aspect, glacier hypsometry and ice flow. The mechanisms for the mass gain and glacier surging in the WKM region require further studies with more observations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

A key concern for the CryoSat-2 orbit has been its long repeat period of 369 days, which is usually undesirable for river and lake monitoring. However, the results from the method developed in this study involving virtual stations show that the CryoSat-2 data can indeed be used for such monitoring by utilizing the high spatial coverage and the sub-cycle period of 30 days. The results show that it is possible to capture the peak flow occurring during late summer due to monsoonal precipitation and the melting of snow in the Himalayas. The evaluation of ClyoSat-2 river levels is performed by comparing with Envisat data in terms of annual signals and amplitudes. The obtained annual amplitudes agree well with the Envisat data, although CryoSat-2 exhibit larger differences. For five virtual stations in the Brahmaputra River, the mean difference between the obtained amplitudes is similar to 10 cm, whereas the mean phase difference is less than 2.7 days. A virtual station in the Ganges River shows a phase difference of around 5 days and a difference in amplitude of 2 cm. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Phenological variability through space and over time can result in misclassification when spectra from non-representative areas or times are used as training data. Vegetation classification at the species level could benefit from introducing phenological information to spectral libraries, but utilization of this information across multiple dates of imagery will require new approaches to building spectral libraries and to classification. This paper explores an automated method for selecting a single multi-temporal spectral library that can be used to classify vegetation species across multiple dates within an image time series. Iterative Endmember Selection (IES) was used to select spectra from Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data acquired on five dates in the same year. IES selected spectra to maximize species classification accuracy (as measured by Kappa) within a multi-temporal spectral library that included spectra from all image dates. The resulting multi-temporal endmember library was applied using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) to classify vegetation species and land cover across all five images. Results indicate that multi-temporal, seasonally-mixed spectral libraries achieved similar overall classification accuracy compared to single-date libraries, and in some cases, resulted in improved classification accuracy. Several species had increased Producer\'s or User\'s accuracy using a multi-temporal library, while others had reduced accuracy compared to same-date classifications. The image dates of endmembers used to map species in each image were examined to determine if this information could improve our understanding of phenological spectral differences for specific species. Multi-temporal endmember libraries could provide a means for mapping species in data where phenology, climatic variability, or spatial gradients are not known in advance or may not be easily accounted for by endmembers from a single date. New missions, such as the proposed Hysperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission, will provide greatly improved access to multi-temporal spectral datasets and new opportunities for mapping vegetation spectral variability on regional-to-global scales.

The US National Research Council\'s guidance to NASA regarding missions for the coming decade includes a polar orbiting, global mapping hyperspectral satellite remote sensing mission, the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI), to make quantitative measurements of ecosystem change. Traditionally, freshwater ecosystems have been challenging to measure with satellite remote sensing because they are small and spatially complex, require high fidelity spectroradiometry, and are best described with biophysical variables derived from high spectral resolution data. In this study, we evaluate the contribution of a hyperspectral global mapping satellite mission to measuring freshwater ecosystems. We demonstrate the need for such a mission, and evaluate the suitability and gaps, through an examination of the measurement resolution issues impacting freshwater ecosystem measurements (spatial, temporal, spectral and radiometric). These are exemplified through three case studies that use remote sensing to characterize a component of freshwater ecosystems that drive primary productivity. The high radiometric quality proposed for the HyspIRI mission makes it uniquely well designed for measuring freshwater ecosystems accurately at moderate to high spatial resolutions. The spatial and spectral resolutions of the HyspIRI mission are well suited for the retrieval of multiple biophysical variables, such as phycocyanin and chlorophyll-a. The effective temporal resolution is suitable for characterizing growing season wetland phenology in temperate regions, but may not be appropriate for tracking algal bloom dynamics, or ecosystem responses to extreme events in monsoonal regions. Global mapping missions provide the systematic, repeated measurements necessary to measure the drivers of freshwater biodiversity change. Archival global mapping missions with open access and free data policies increase end user uptake globally. Overall, an archival, hyperspectral global mapping mission uniquely meets the measurement requirements of multiple end users for freshwater ecosystem science and management. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This model was generated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS-Aqua) medium-resolution (250 m) data gathered from 2003 to 2013 and in situ data collected from a number of cruise surveys. A strong significant correlate relationship between the in situ TSM data and the atmospherically corrected MODIS-Aqua remote sensing reflectance at the 645 nm band (R-rs(645)) was found (R-2 = 0.70, p < 0.001, n = 150). From these data, a local TSM model was developed for Lake Taihu. Long-term TSM distribution maps retrieved from the MODIS-Aqua data demonstrated marked temporal and spatial variations. Temporally, significant lower TSM was found in summer and autumn than in winter and spring (p < 0.005, t-test). The significant seasonal variability could be attributed to sediment resuspension due to changes in the wind speed between different seasons. Lake Taihu also experiences large inter-annual variations that are primarily caused by changes in wind force over the region. In particular, the TSM in Lake Taihu from 2006 to 2008 was relatively lower than in other years, which could be explained by the lower mean wind speed during these years compared to the other years. Spatially, the TSM in the Open area, especially in the southern part of this region, was consistently higher than in other sub-regions of Lake Taihu. The coverage of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) generally characterized East Lake Taihu as a region with a relatively lower TSM. Lake topographic conditions, SAV, and runoff discharge jointly contributed to the spatial variations in TSM. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Because the retrieved SM data can be quite noisy, post-retrieval processing such as de-noising can play an important role to aid interpretation of the observed dynamics or enhance their utility for data assimilation. To date, the merits of such techniques have not yet been fully evaluated. Here we consider the applications of Fourier-based de-noising filters of Su et al. (2013a) for improving SM retrieved by AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System) and ASCAT (Advanced Scatterometer of MetOp-A) sensors. The filters are calibrated in the frequency domain based on a water-balance model, without the need for ancillary data. The evaluation of the de-noising methods was conducted globally against in situ data distributed via the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) at 277 AMSR-E and 385 ASCAT pixels. Systematic improvements were found for all considered metrics, namely root-mean-square deviation, linear correlation and signal-to-noise ratio, for both SM products, with improvements more striking for AMSR-E. However, the originally proposed implementation of the filters can induce undesirable over-smoothing and distortion of SM timeseries. To overcome this, based on a simple heuristic argument, we propose the use of ancillary precipitation data in the filtering process, although at some expense of overall agreements with the in situ data.

The soil moisture products were retrieved by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) algorithm and the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) developed by the VU University Amsterdam, in collaboration with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The two products are compared at the global scale. In addition, the products are evaluated against field measurements from 47 stations from the COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS) network which are located in the United States (36 stations), Australia (7 stations), Europe (2 stations) and Africa (2 stations).   After examining the retrieval algorithms, it is hypothesized that four factors, namely, physical surface temperatures, surface roughness, vegetation and ground soil wetness conditions, may affect the quality of soil moisture retrievals. From the inter-comparisons at the global scale, the correlations of the two products highlight differences in the representation of the,seasonal cycle of soil moisture, with negative correlations found for several regions. Correlations of the anomaly time series were generally strong (R > 0.6) as a result of soil moisture sensitivity to external meteorological forcing and possibly also random noise in the satellite observations. Due to the inherent differences in spatial coverage and measurement scale of the COSMOS and satellite data, the comparisons in terms of correlation coefficients are the most reliable. It was found that both products show rapid decreases in correlation coefficients under low mean temperature (<290 K), high mean EVI (>0.3) and highly wetted conditions. These findings are further supported by the bias and RMSE estimates which show that JAXA has relatively better performance under dry conditions while the bias and RMSE of LPRM are generally smaller than JAXA, when considered against the four variables. These results provide information on appropriate parameterizations and model selection for the retrieval algorithms and a future research direction to improve the quality by leveraging the strengths of-the JAXA and LPRM algorithms. With these, when a multi-year dataset is available, there will be more confidence in defining the seasonal cycle and the data can be decomposed to identify the anomalies where the bias is not relevant.

However, the recently developed VIIRS 375 m active fire detection product offers enhanced spatial resolution and temporal revisit cycle, and high sensitivity to small active fires. In this study, we apply that product and assess its performance for direct burned area estimation. Consecutive VIIRS 375 m active fire detections were aggregated to produce the VIIRS 375 m burned area (BA) estimation over ten ecologically diverse study areas. The accuracy of the burned area estimations was assessed by comparison with Landsat-8 supervised burned area classification. The performance of the VIIRS 375 m BA estimates was dependent on the ecosystem characteristics and fire behavior. Higher accuracy was observed in forested areas characterized by large long-duration fires, while grasslands, savannas and agricultural areas showed the highest omission and commission errors. VIIRS 375 m data proved to have higher sensitivity to small fires and higher fire detection rates compared to previous studies, indicating good potential as a complementary dataset for use in routine burned area mapping systems based on cumulative fire count or seeding of spectral signature approaches. Results from the application of VIIRS 375 m fire data to directly monitor the growth of long-lasting wildfires using the 2013 Rim Fire example in California showed high agreement with available fine-resolution airborne data, therefore serving as an alternative source of information for near real-time mapping of fire-affected areas.

This problem is acute in remote tropical regions, where information on plant functional traits is difficult to ascertain. We used Carnegie Airborne Observatory visible-to-shortwave infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectroscopy with light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to assess the foliar traits of Amazonian and Andean tropical forest canopies. We calibrated and validated the retrieval of 15 canopy foliar chemicals and leaf mass per area (LMA) across a network of 79 1-hectare field plots using a new VSWIR-LiDAR fusion approach designed to accommodate the enormous scale mismatch between field and remote sensing studies. The results indicate that sparse and highly variable field sampling can be integrated with VSWIR-LiDAR data to yield demonstrably accurate estimates of canopy foliar chemical traits. This new airborne approach addresses the inherent limitations and sampling biases associated with field-based studies of forest functional traits, particularly in structurally and floristically complex tropical canopies.

Wind sheltering is caused by slower winds in the wake of topography and shoreline obstacles (e.g. forest canopy) and influences heat loss and the flux of wind-driven mixing energy into lakes, which control lake temperatures and indirectly structure lake ecosystem processes, including carbon cycling and thermal habitat partitioning. Lakeshore wind sheltering has often been parameterized by lake surface area but such empirical relationships are only based on forested lakeshores and overlook the contributions of local land cover and terrain to wind sheltering. This study is the first to examine the utility of satellite imagery-derived broad-scale estimates of wind sheltering across a diversity of land covers. Using 30 m spatial resolution ASTER GDEM2 elevation data, the mean sheltering height, h(s), being the combination of local topographic rise and canopy height above the lake surface, is calculated within 100 m-wide buffers surrounding 76,000 lakes in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. Uncertainty of GDEM2-derived h(s) was compared to SRTM-, high-resolution G-LiHT lidar-, and ICESat-derived estimates of h(s), respective influences of land cover type and buffer width on h(s), are examined; and the effect of including satellite-based h, on the accuracy of a statewide lake hydrodynamic model was discussed. Though GDEM2 h(s), uncertainty was comparable to or better than other satellite-based measures of h(s), its higher spatial resolution and broader spatial coverage allowed more lakes to be included in modeling efforts. GDEM2 was shown to offer superior utility for estimating h(s), compared to other satellite-derived data, but was limited by its consistent underestimation of h(s), inability to detect within-buffer h(s), variability, and differing accuracy across land cover types. Nonetheless, considering a GDEM2 h(s)-derived wind sheltering potential improved the modeled lake temperature root mean square error for non-forested lakes by 0.72 degrees C compared to a commonly used wind sheltering model based on lake area alone. While results from this study show promise, the liinitations of near-global GDEM2 data in timeliness, temporal and spatial resolution, and vertical accuracy were apparent. As hydrodynamic modeling and high-resolution topographic mapping efforts both expand, future remote sensing-derived vegetation structure data must be improved to meet wind sheltering accuracy requirements to expand our understanding of lake processes.

The algorithm synergistically uses 3 km Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter (sigma) to downscale a 36 km radiometer Tb to 9 km. While the algorithm has already been tested using experimental datasets from field campaigns in the USA, it is imperative that it is tested for a comprehensive range of land surface conditions (i.e. in different hydro-climatic regions) before global application. Consequently, this study evaluates the algorithm using data collected from the Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiments (SMAPEx) in south-eastern Australia, that closely simulate the SMAP data stream for a single SMAP radiometer pixel over a 3-week interval, with repeat coverage every 2-3 days. The results suggest that the average root-mean-square error (RMSE) in downscaled Tb is 3.1 K and 2.6 K for h- and v-polarizations respectively, when downscaled to 9 km resolution. This increases to 8.2 K and 6.6 K when applied at 1 km resolution. Downscaling over the relatively homogeneous grassland areas resulted in 2 K lower RMSE than for the heterogeneous cropping area. Overall, the downscaling error was around 2.4 K when applied at 9 km resolution for five of the nine days, which meets the 2.4 K error target of the SMAP mission. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The systematic error based on median ratio between QAA-derived and measured a(lambda) varied from about 1% to +/- 10% depending on light wavelength and the oceanic region. The QAA typically overestimated b(b)(lambda) from 3% to 14% compared with field measurements. These results were obtained with a correction for Raman-scattering contribution to R-rs and separate parameterization of molecular and particulate backscattering in the R-rs vs. b(b)/a relationship. Without these features the earlier versions of the QAA can overestimate b(b)(lambda) by as much as 35% in clear waters. The use of pure seawater backscattering coefficients accounting for water temperature and salinity improved the accuracy of QAA-derived a(lambda) in Arctic waters. The absorption-partitioning component of the QAA significantly underestimated phytoplankton absorption and overestimated non-phytoplankton absorption in both Arctic and lower-latitude waters.

This study correlates long-term water chemistry in mangrove environments, located in Everglades National Park, with mangrove spectral reflectance measurements made at both the leaf and canopy scales. Spectral reflectance measurements were collected using a handheld spectrometer for leaf-level measurements and Landsat 5TM data for regional coverage. Leaf-level reflectance data were collected from three mangrove species (i.e., red, black and white mangroves) across two regions; a tall mangrove (similar to 18 m) and dwarf mangrove (1-2 m) region. The reflectance data were then used to calculate a wide variety of biophysical reflectance indices (e.g., NDVI, EVI, SAVI) to determine signs of stress. Discrete, quarterly water samples from the surface water, groundwater, and pore water (20 and 85 cm depths) and daily autonomous surface water samples were collected at each site and analyzed for major anions (Cl- and SO42-), cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). Mangrove sites that exhibited the highest salinity and ionic concentrations in the surface and subsurface water also had the lowest near-infrared reflectance at both the leaf and satellite levels. Seasonal reflectance responses were measured in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths at both the leaf and canopy scales and were strongly correlated with nutrient and ionic concentrations in the surface and subsurface water, even though there was no significant separability between the three mangrove species. Study sites that experienced the greatest variability in surface and subsurface water ionic concentrations also exhibited the greatest fluctuations in NIR spectral reflectance. Landsat 5TM images were able to detect tall and dwarf mangroves by the differences in spectral indices (e.g., NDVI, NDWI, and EVI) because of the variability in the background conditions amongst the environments. In addition, Landsat 5TM images spanning 16 years (1993-2009) were successfully used to estimate the seasonal variability in ionic concentrations in the surface water across the Florida Coastal mangrove ecotone. This study has shown that water chemistry can be estimated indirectly by measuring the change in spectral response at the leaf- or satellite-scale. Furthermore, the results of this research may be extrapolated to similar coastal mangrove systems throughout the Caribbean and world-wide wherever red, black, and white mangroves occur.

The triangle method, in particular, estimates the evaporative fraction (EF), defined as the ratio of latent heat flux (LE) to available energy, based on the relationship between satellite observations of land surface temperature and a vegetation index. Among other methodologies, this approach has been commonly used as an approximation to estimate LE, mainly over large semi-arid areas with uniform landscape features. In this study, an interpretation of the triangular space has been applied over a heterogeneous area in central Spain, using Landsat5-TM, Envisat-AATSR/MERIS and MSG-SEVIRI images. Some aspects affecting the model performance such as spatial resolution, terrain conditions, vegetation index applied and method for deriving the triangle edges have been assessed. The derived EF estimations have been validated against ground measurements obtained with scintillometer on a winter crop field during 2010-2011. When working with large spatial windows, removing areas with different topographic characteristics (altitude and slope) improved the performance of the methods. In addition, replacing the typically used NDVI with Leaf Area Index enhances the performance of the triangle method allowing a better characterization of the wet edge. Finally, results showed a relatively good performance for the EF estimates, with an RMSE of 0.11, 0.15 and 0.23 and R-2 of 0.77, 0.41, and 0.24 for Landsat, Envisat and MSG satellites respectively, showing a scale dependency on the accuracy.

Remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) measurements computed from in-water radiometry profiles along with a(CDOM)(lambda) data are applied to develop several types of algorithms for the SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua ocean color satellite sensors, which involve least squares linear regression of a(CDOM)(X) with (1)R-rs band ratios, (2) quasi-analytical algorithm-based (QAA-based) products of total absorption coefficients, (3) multiple R-rs bands within a multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis, and (4) diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d). The relative error (mean absolute percent difference; MAPD) for the MLR retrievals of a(CDOM)(275), a(CDOM)(355), a(CDOM)(380), a(CDOM)(412) and a(CDOM)(443) for our study region range from 20.4 to 23.9% for MODIS-Aqua and 27.3-30% for SeaWiFS. Because of the narrower range of CDOM spectral slope values, the MAPD for the MLR S-275:295 and S-300:600 algorithms are much lower ranging from 9.9% and 9.1% for SeaWiFS, respectively, and 8.7% and 9.7% for MODIS, respectively. Multi-year, seasonal and spatial MODIS-Aqua and SeaWiFS distributions of Claw, S-275:295 and S-300:600 processed with these algorithms are consistent with field measurements and the processes that impact CDOM levels along the continental shelf of the northeastern U.S. Several satellite data processing factors correlate with higher uncertainty in satellite retrievals of a(CDOM), S-275:295 and S-300.600 within the coastal ocean, including solar zenith angle, sensor viewing angle, and atmospheric products applied for atmospheric corrections. Algorithms that include ultraviolet R-rs bands provide a better fit to field measurements than algorithms without the ultraviolet R-rs bands. This suggests that satellite sensors with ultraviolet capability could provide better retrievals of CDOM. Because of the strong correlations between CDOM parameters and DOM constituents in the coastal ocean, satellite observations of CDOM parameters can be applied to study the distributions, sources and sinks of DOM, which are relevant for understanding the carbon cycle, modeling the Earth system, and to discern how the Earth is changing.

This approach, however, presents relevant limitations when applied in mixed, water stressed ecosystems. The current paper addresses these issues by introducing two innovations. First, fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is derived from NDVI and utilized to split evaporating and transpiring surfaces, whose behavior is simulated under fully watered conditions by the use of generalized Kc. Next, the short term effect of water shortage is taken into account by means of downregulating factors which are based on meteorological observations (potential evapotranspiration and rainfall) and act differently for vegetated and not vegetated surfaces. The new method is tested against latent heat of evaporation (LE) measurements taken by the eddy covariance technique in six sites of Central Italy representative of various forest and herbaceous ecosystems. In this experiment the method is driven by 1-km meteorological data obtained from a pan-European archive and by 250 m MODIS NDVI imagery. Satisfactory accuracies are obtained in all experimental situations, which encourages the application of the method for the operational monitoring of ETA on regional scale. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we examined occurrence and abundance-habitat relationships for moose (Alces alces), a species of economic and ecological importance, across its range in southern and central Ontario. We (1) evaluated and tested competing hypotheses for predicting moose distribution and abundance, and (2) examined the ability of remotely derived environmental indicators to characterize and extrapolate moose habitat throughout the Ontario moose range. To do so, remotely sensed environmental indicators - including vegetation productivity calculated using the Dynamic Habitat Index (DHI), land cover, topography, snow cover, and natural and anthropogenic disturbances - were used to estimate moose occurrence and abundance derived from moose aerial survey data. A 2-step Hurdle model was used to accommodate for zero-inflated data, separately modeling moose occurrence and abundance in a common model framework. Our results indicate that remotely sensed indicators are able to estimate moose occurrence with a moderate degree of certainty; however, these environmental indicators did not successfully estimate moose abundance. The approach outlined in this paper provides a useful framework for hypothesis testing of remote sensing environmental drivers at broad scales, as well as for estimating moose occurrence at the regional level.

The growth and vitality condition of mangroves may be negatively influenced by various anthropogenic and natural disturbances and stresses, such as cold weather events. This paper represents the first attempt to map the cold damage to mangroves in the tropical zone of Southern China using high resolution multispectral satellite imagery. In this study, the spatial distribution of severity level of cold damage to mangroves imposed by a rare blizzard in Southern China during early 2008 has been mapped and analyzed using IKONOS image. An object-oriented classification applied to the images achieved an overall accuracy of 90.9% for classifying mangroves into three categories: undamaged, damaged, and dead. Of the total 287.30 ha of mapped mangroves, approximately 51.1% were damaged or died due to the cold stress of the blizzard. These results have been verified by more recent WorldView-II images. Furthermore, we explored the associations between the cold damage severity level of mangroves and climate and landscape factors, including elevation, surface slope, aspect, wind direction and velocity, wind shadow effect, and tree height. The surface topographical variables are derived from the ASTER Global DEM. The analysis results suggest that wind direction, terrain topography, and proximity to ocean are important local environmental factors controlling the vulnerability of mangroves to cold damage. Most damaged mangroves were located near the open sea, as a result of a possible edge exposure effect. The damage to the mangroves on the leeward side of a hill was also minimal. Such knowledge of climate and landscape controls can offer insight on how to better restore and protect the mangrove forest in the future.

Either via sudden collapse sinkholes, or by eroding the support of building foundations, a migrating cavity can cause the collapse of buildings, water defense systems, or transport infrastructure. The main problem for risk assessment is the lack of a priori knowledge on the location of a potentially hazardous cavity. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of satellite radar interferometry to detect a migrating cavity under the city of Heerlen, the Netherlands, leading to foundation instability and the near-collapse of a part of a shopping mall in December 2011. We exploit the data archives of four imaging radar satellites, between 1992 and 2011, to investigate the dynamics of the area and detect shear strain within the structure of the building. Time series analysis shows localized differential vertical deformation rates of similar to 3 mm/yr during 18 years, followed by a dramatic increase of up to similar to 15 mm/yr in the last few years. These results imply that the driving mechanism of the 2011 near-collapse event had a very long lead time and was likely due to a long-lasting gradual process, such as the upward migration of a cavity.

Several methods were developed in the past years for detecting phytoplankton functional types from satellite observations. In this paper, we present an automatic classification method based on a neural network clustering algorithm in order to classify the anomalies of water leaving radiance spectra (Ra), introduced in the PHYSAT method by Alvain et al. (2005), and analyze their variability at the global scale. The use of an unsupervised classification aims at improving the characterization of the spectral variability of Ra in terms of shape and amplitude as well as the expansion of its potential use to larger in situ datasets for global phytoplankton remote sensing. The Self-Organizing Map algorithm (SOM, Kohonen, 1984) aggregates similar spectra into a reduced set of pertinent groups, allowing the characterization of the Ra variability, which is known to be linked with phytoplanlcton community composition (Alvain et al., 2012).   Based on the same sample of Ra spectra, a comparison between the previous version of PHYSAT (Alvain et al., 2005, 2008) and the new one using SOM shows that it is now possible to take into consideration all the types of spectra. This was not possible with the previous approach, based on thresholds, defined in order to avoid overlaps between the spectral signatures of each phytoplankton group. The SOM-based method is relevant for characterizing a wide variety of Ra spectra through its ability to handle large amounts of data, in addition to its statistical reliability and processing speed compared to the previous PHYSAT. The former approach might have introduced potential biases and thus, its extension to larger databases was very restricted. This is not the case with the new statistical design presented in this work.   In the second step, some new Ra spectra have been related to phytoplankton groups using collocated field pigment inventories from a large in situ database. Phytoplankton groups were identified based on biomarker pigment ratio thresholds taken from the literature. SOM was then applied to the global daily SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor) imagery archive between 1997 and 2010. Global distributions of major phytoplankton groups were analyzed and validated against in situ data. Thanks to its ability to capture a wide range of spectra and to manage a larger in situ pigment dataset, the neural network tool allows to classify a much higher number of pixels (2 times more) than the previous PHYSAT method for the five phytoplankton groups taken into account in this study (Synechococcus-like-cyanobacteria, diatoms, Prochlorococcus, Nanoeucaryotes and Phaeocystis-like). In addition, different Ra spectral signatures have been associated to diatoms.

This paper describes a snow data assimilation system that employs the ensemble Kalman filter to directly assimilate passive microwave brightness temperature data into a snow process model. In the system, the Common Land Model coupled with a snow grain size growth algorithm was adopted to predict layered snow state variables. The forcing data were derived from the Japan Meteorological Administration-Global Spectral Model (JMA-GSM) operational global data assimilation system. The Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS) was used to convert the snow state variables to brightness temperatures. The snow data assimilation system was one-dimensionally tested at a Siberian cold region reference site of the Coordinated Enhanced Observation Project (CEOP). The validation experiment indicates that the data assimilation system can improve depth estimates during the accumulation period but not the ablation period. The assimilation method proposed herein can be easily applied to an operational weather forecasting system to improve snow depth estimations.

Nearest-neighbor (NN) imputation maps were developed for 539,000 ha in the central Oregon Cascades, USA. Mapped explanatory data included tasseled-cap indices and disturbance history metrics (year, magnitude, and duration of disturbance) from LTS imagery, lidar-derived vegetation metrics, climate, topography, and soil parent material. Vegetation data from USDA Forest Service forest inventory plots was summarized at two plot sizes (plot and subplot) and geographically located with two levels of accuracy (standard and improved). Maps of vegetation composition and structure were developed with the Gradient Nearest Neighbor (GNN) method of NN imputation using different combinations of explanatory variables, plot spatial resolution, and plot positional accuracy. Lidar vegetation indices greatly improved predictions of live tree structure, moderately improved predictions of snag density and down wood volume, but did not consistently improve species predictions. LTS disturbance metrics improved predictions of forest structure, but not to the degree of lidar indices, while also improving predictions of many species. Absence of disturbance attribution (i.e. disturbance type such as fire or timber harvest) in LTS disturbance metrics may have limited our ability to predict forest structure. Absence of corrected lidar intensity values may also have lowered accuracy of snag and species predictions. However, LTS disturbance attribution and lidar corrected intensity values may not be able to overcome fundamental limitations of remote sensing for predicting snags and down wood that are obscured by the forest canopy. Improved GPS plot locations had little influence on map accuracy, and we suggest under what conditions improved GPS plot locations may or may not improve the accuracy of predictive maps that link remote sensing with forest inventory plots. Subplot NN imputation maps had much lower accuracy compared to maps generated using response variables from larger whole plots. No single map had optimal results for every mapped variable, suggesting map users and developers need to prioritize what forest vegetation attributes are most important for any given map application.

The properties of these classes are used for a range of glaciological applications including mass balance measurements, glacial hydrology, and melt modelling. However, it is not immediately evident that multispectral data should be optimal for imaging glaciers and ice caps. Thus, this investigation takes an inverse perspective. Taking into account spectral and radiometric properties, in situ spectral reflectance data were used to simulate glacier surface response for a suite of multispectral sensors. Sensor-simulated data were classified and compared. In addition, airborne multispectral imagery was classified for a range of spatial resolutions and intercompared in three different ways. In these analyses, the most important property which determined the suitability of a multispectral imager for glacier surface classification was its radiometric range (i.e. gain settings). Low resolution imagery (250 m pixels) is too coarse to represent the true complexity present on a glacier while medium resolution imagery (60 m, 30 m, or 20 m) accurately represented the results derived from high resolution airborne imagery. Of those studied here, the satellite imagers currently in use that are most suitable for glacier surface classification are Landsat TM/ETM+ and ASTER (each with particular gain settings). Both Sentinel-2 and the OLI on Landsat 8 are also expected to be similarly qualified. Landsat MSS is also found to be radiometrically well-suited for glacier surface classification, but its lower spatial resolution makes it a secondary selection. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The model is based on a fully physical radiative transfer model simulating the coupling between a realistic atmosphere and a spectral surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model parameterised by 4 free parameters. At first, the model is \'calibrated\' on 4 years of MERIS observations by inverting the 4 free parameters of the surface BRDF model that provide the best fit to the MERIS observations. The model mimics the MERIS TOA observations with a precision of approximately 1% RMSE outside water vapour and O-2 absorption features. The inverted BRDF model parameters obtained at MERIS spectral bands are then spectrally interpolated and used as input to the radiative transfer model to simulate observations from ATSR-2, AATSR, A-MODIS, MERIS, POLDER-3 and VEGETATION-2 over the 2002 to 2012 period. Depending on the spectral band considered, AATSR radiometry appears 2% to 3% above the model \'calibrated\' on MERIS radiometry, A-MODIS is 0% to 3% below, POLDER-3 is 2% to 4% below and VEGETATION-2 about 4% below. ATSR-2 data during the 2002 to early 2003 period are almost 10% below their simulations. Temporal trends between simulations and observations are also measured for all sensors. The smallest linear trends are observed for the MERIS 3rd reprocessing data (below 1%/decade). The temporal trends obtained from all sensors against the coupled surface-atmosphere model are in line with expected residual errors of instrument degradation model used in temporal extrapolation: larger in blue than in the NIR. The combined temporal trends from all sensors tend to demonstrate that the Libia-4 site is radiometrically stable in the visible to the NIR to better than 1%/decade for the 2002-2012 period, thus quantitatively confirming that it is a terrestrial target particularly adequate for the assessment of the temporal stability of Earth Observation sensors.

Whereas satellite products usually provide total surface albedo, land surface models often require a separation of snow-free surface albedos of the vegetation canopy and the underlying bare soil. In this paper, visible (0.3-0.7 mu m) and near infrared (0.7-5.0 mu m) vegetation and bare soil albedos are retrieved from a decade of MODIS data at global scale by using a Kalman Filter-based method. The retrieved quantities show good agreement with those derived in previous studies. The main advantage of the proposed method over other approaches is that it provides albedo components efficiently throughout the year, thus allowing the seasonal cycles to be captured. This study also exploits the relationship linking the retrieved bare soil albedo to soil moisture in order to reinforce indirectly the quality of the albedo splitting. The proposed method makes it possible to update the bare soil and vegetation albedo fields in the ECOCLIMAP land cover map, the database of physiographic parameters used by Meteo-France for climate and NWP modelling. The mean relative difference between the new and the old ECOCLIMAP shortwave albedos (0.3-5.0 mu m) is 8.5% at the global scale if only albedos lower than 0.5 are considered, and 41.2% otherwise.

Change in snow albedo values associated with changing climate conditions can be monitored remotely from satellite platforms viewing the entire Greenland ice sheet, yet comparisons to high quality surface measurements are necessary to assess the accuracy of satellite measurements as new snow albedo algorithms are developed with higher spatial and temporal resolution.   During May, June, and July 2011, we obtained daily measurements of spectral albedo at Summit, Greenland with an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) spectroradiometer, scanning at 350-2200 nm. We compare our spectral albedo field measurements to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), using both the Version 005 Direct Broadcast daily albedo product and the recently developed Version 006 MCD43A daily albedo product. The spectral field measurements allow calculation of weighted integrals to compare to seven MODIS narrow bandwidths ranging the UV through Infrared, as well as a broadband integration to compare to the MODIS shortwave albedo. We additionally compare our field measurements to albedo measured at the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) station at Summit.   Using the MODIS Version 005 Direct Broadcast product, high-quality retrievals only, comparison to field measurements results in root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.033 for the MODIS shortwave product, and RMSE for the MODIS narrow bandwidths ranging 0.022-0.077. The new MODIS Version 006 product shows considerable improvement, with shortwave RMSE of 0.026, and narrow bandwidths ranging 0.020-0.048.

In this study, differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) was used to:   estimate the boundaries of the subsidence in order to optimize ground-based monitoring networks (levelling and geophysical measurements)   estimate the maximum deformation and highlight the evolution of the phenomenon (previously unknown due to insufficient historical ground-based data).   The study was based both on L-band ALOS/PALSAR SAR data and C-band Envisat/ASAR data. The interest in PALSAR data lies in its better performance for InSAR with respect to C-band data on the affected non-urban areas (such as fields and farmlands) where, in addition, conventional techniques such as topographical survey information were limited, and had often not been carried out before the first damage was observed. Conventional DInSAR based on PALSAR data processing for the 2008-2010 period identified the boundary of the subsidence area and estimated its maximum magnitude. The PSI technique in the ASAR archive gave information regarding the beginning of the subsidence. The precision of the DInSAR results was consistent with the topographical data (in locations where this information was known) and therefore favours the SAR interferometric techniques in this context. Combined with the knowledge of the regional geological and structural setting, together with results from ground-based electrosounding, the results of the study established a basis for an increased understanding of the subsidence phenomenon, which was revealed to affect an elliptical bowl-shaped area due to salt dissolution.

During 2004-2009, the temporal trends in sea surface salinity varied between sites. Salinity in most parts of the Bohai Sea was increasing. The Yellow River discharge was found to have the greatest influence on sea surface salinity near the river estuary, whereas it had only a weak impact on the salinity far from river mouth.

This method uses the relationship that is captured at the hot edge pixels in the feature space between the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the land surface temperature (LST) at a coarse resolution to disaggregate the LST to a finer resolution. The residuals that are generated at the coarse resolution are modelled using an Artificial Neural Network model (ANN), and the resulting residuals are added to the disaggregated LST at a fine resolution. The ANN model was built using the NDVI from the neighbourhood pixels. The hypothesis is that the LST of a pixel will not only be affected by the vegetation within the pixel but also by the vegetation of surrounding pixels. The performance of this hybrid model NL-DisTrad (Hot edge model + ANN model) is assessed by comparing the results to the existing disaggregation method, TsHARP, and the observed Landsat LST. The NL-DisTrad disaggregation results were comparable to the observed Landsat I.ST even for pixels with non-uniform vegetation. The statistical analysis indicated that the proposed model disaggregates the LST better than TsHARP, based on, the high Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE > 0.80) and low root mean square error value (RMSE < 0.96 K). Furthermore, using SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land), it was found that the estimates of daily evapotranspiration (ET) from the LST that were disaggregated using NL-DisTrad were comparable to the ET estimates from the observed Landsat LST data. As the disaggregation method NL-DisTrad only needs the LST-NDVI relationship at the coarse resolution, the model could be used to disaggregate the coarse resolution MODIS temperature data to the fine resolution of satellites such as IRS-P6 or SPOT-5 that do not carry any thermal sensors.

Land degradation is, however, widespread and improved targeting of land management interventions is needed, taking into account the variability of soil properties that affect agricultural productivity and land degradation risk across landscapes.

The approaches presented allow for the development of maps at spatial scales that are appropriate for making spatially explicit management recommendations. Field data and soil samples collected from 38 sites, each 100 km(2), were used to develop predictive models that were applied as part of a case study to an independent dataset from four sites in Ethiopia. The predictions based on Landsat reflectance were robust, with R-squared values of 0.86 for pH and 0.79 for soil organic carbon (SOC), and were used to create predicted surfaces (maps) for these soil properties. Further, models were developed for the mapping of the occurrence of soil erosion and root depth restrictions within 50 cm of the soil surface (RDR50), with an accuracy of about 80% for both variables. The maps generated from these models were used to assess the spatial distribution of soil pH and SOC, which are important indicators of soil condition, and land degradation risk factors in order to target relevant management options.

Using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from both field and satellite measurements as an indicator of vegetation phenology and productivity, we monitored spatial and temporal patterns of vegetation growth for a coastal wet sedge tundra site near Barrow, Alaska over three growing seasons (2000-2002). Contrary to expectation, earlier snowmelt did not lead to increased productivity. Instead, productivity was associated primarily with precipitation and soil moisture, and secondarily with growing degree days, which, during this period, led to reduced growth in years with earlier snowmelt. Additional moisture effects on productivity and species distribution, operating over a longer time scale, were evident in spatial NDVI patterns associated with microtopography. Lower, wetter regions dominated by graminoids were more productive than higher, drier locations having a higher percentage of lichens and mosses, despite the earlier snowmelt at the more elevated sites. These results call into question the oft-stated hypothesis that earlier arctic growing seasons will lead to greater vegetation productivity. Rather, they agree with an emerging body of evidence from recent field studies indicating that early-season, local environmental conditions, notably moisture and temperature, are primary factors determining arctic vegetation productivity. For this coastal arctic site, early growing season conditions are strongly influenced by microtopography, hydrology, and regional sea ice dynamics, and may not be easily predicted from snowmelt date or seasonal average air temperatures alone. Our comparison of field to satellite NDVI also highlights the value of in-situ monitoring of actual vegetation responses using field optical sampling to obtain detailed information on surface conditions not possible from satellite observations alone.

To effectively quantify the severity and extent of these events, tools that allow for rapid assessment at the landscape scale are required. Past studies using high spatial resolution satellite imagery have primarily focused on detecting green, red, and gray tree canopies during and shortly after tree damage or mortality has occurred. However, detecting trees in various stages of death is not always possible due to limited availability of archived satellite imagery. Here we assess the capability of high spatial resolution satellite imagery for tree mortality detection in a southwestern U.S. mixed species woodland using archived satellite images acquired prior to mortality and well after dead trees had dropped their leaves. We developed a multistep classification approach that uses: supervised masking of non-tree image elements: bi-temporal ( pre- and post-mortality) differencing of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and red:green ratio (RGI): and unsupervised multivariate clustering of pixels into live and dead tree classes using a Gaussian mixture model. Classification accuracies were improved in a final step by tuning the rules of pixel classification using the posterior probabilities of class membership obtained from the Gaussian mixture model. Classifications were produced for two images acquired post-mortality with overall accuracies of 97.9% and 98.5%, respectively. Classified images were combined with land cover data to characterize the spatiotemporal characteristics of tree mortality across areas with differences in tree species composition. We found that 38% of tree crown area was lost during the drought period between 2002 and 2006. The majority of tree mortality during this period was concentrated in pinon-juniper (Pinus edulis-Juniperus monosperma) woodlands. An additional 20% of the tree canopy died or was removed between 2006 and 2011, primarily in areas experiencing wildfire and management activity. -Our results demonstrate that unsupervised clustering of bi-temporal NDVI and RGI differences can be used to detect tree mortality resulting from numerous causes and in several forest cover types.

Many validation results have revealed that the accuracy of the retrieved LAI is often affected by the cloud cover of imagery, instrument problems, and inversion algorithms. Ground meteorological station data, characterized by relatively high accuracy and time continuity compared with remote sensing data, can provide complementary information to remote sensing observations. In this paper, we combine the potential advantages of both types of data in order to improve LAI retrievals in the Heihe River Basin, an arid and semi-arid area in northwest China where Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI values are significantly underestimated. A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) is used to integrate these two data types for time series LAI estimation. Results show that the square of correlation coefficient between LAI values estimated by our DBN method (referred to as DBN LAI) and field measured LAI values is 0.76, with a root mean square error of 0.78. The DBN LAI are closer to field measurements than the MODIS LAI standard product values. Moreover, by introducing ground meteorological station data using a dynamic process model, DBN LAI show better temporal consistency than the MODIS LAI. It is concluded that the quality of LAI retrievals can be improved by combining remote sensing data and ground meteorological station data using a filtering inference algorithm in a DBN framework. More importantly, the study provides a basis and method for utilizing ground meteorological station network data to estimate land surface parameters on a regional scale. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The maximum peak-height algorithm (MPH) uses a baseline subtraction procedure to calculate the height of the dominant peak across the red and near-infrared MERIS bands between 664 and 885 nm caused by sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SICF) and particulate backscatter. Atmospheric correction of the MERIS TOA reflectance data for gaseous absorption and Rayleigh scattering proved adequate given the spectral proximity of the relevant bands and the sufficiently large differential spectral signal. This avoided the need to correct for atmospheric aerosols, a procedure which is typically prone to large errors in turbid and high-biomass waters. A combination of switching algorithms for estimating chl-a were derived from coincident in situ chl-a and MERIS bottom-of-Rayleigh reflectance measurements. These algorithms are designed to cover a wide trophic range, from oligotrophic/mesotrophic waters (chl-a<20 mg m(-3)), to eutrophic/hypertrophic waters (chl-a>20 mg m(-3)) and surface scums or dry floating algae or vegetation. Cyanobacteria-dominant waters were differentiated from those dominated by eukaryote algal species (dinoflagellates/diatoms) on the basis of the magnitude of the MPH variable. This is supported by evidence that vacuolate cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa) possess enhanced chl-a specific backscatter which is an important bio-optical distinguishing feature. This enables these phytoplankton groups to be distinguished from space. An algorithm derived from cyanobacteria-dominant waters had a r(2) value of 0.58 for chl-a between 33 and 362 mg m(-3) and an error of 33.7% (N=17). The operational algorithm for eukaryote-dominant algal assemblages gave a coefficient of determination of 0.71 and a mean absolute percentage error of 60% for chl-a in the range 0.5-350 mg m(-3) (N=48). A flag based on cyanobacteria-specific spectral pigmentation and fluorescence features was used to identify cyanobacterial-dominance in eutrophic waters. Global applications demonstrate how the MPH algorithm can offer rapid and effective assessment of trophic status, cyanobacterial-dominance, surface scums and floating vegetation in inland and coastal waters.

National and international organizations require timely and accurate land cover information for reporting and management actions. The North American Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS) is an international cooperation of organizations and entities of Canada. the United States, and Mexico to map land cover change of North America\'s changing environment. This paper presents the methodology to derive the land cover map of Mexico for the year 2005 which was integrated in the NALCMS continental map. Based on a time series of 250 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MOD\'S) data and an extensive sample data base the complexity of the Mexican landscape required a specific approach to reflect land cover heterogeneity. To estimate the proportion of each land cover class for every pixel several decision tree classifications were combined to obtain class membership maps which were finally converted to a discrete map accompanied by a confidence estimate. The map yielded an overall accuracy of 82.5% (Kappa of 0.79) for pixels with at least 50% map confidence (71.3% of the data). An additional assessment with 780 randomly stratified samples and primary and alternative calls in the reference data to account for ambiguity indicated 83.4% overall accuracy (Kappa of 0.80). A high agreement of 83.6% for all pixels and 92.6% for pixels with a map confidence of more than 50% was found for the comparison between the land cover maps of 2005 and 2006. Further wall-to-wall comparisons to related land cover maps resulted in 56.6% agreement with the MODIS land cover product and a congruence of 49.5 with Globcover. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In addition to fire, nearly one quarter of Canada\'s boreal forest is also managed for industrial wood production. Post-fire logging (or salvage harvesting) is increasingly used to minimize economic losses from fire, notwithstanding that the ecological impacts of successive disturbance events remain poorly understood. Improved monitoring and management of post-fire environments will require new information regarding the location and timing of past operations. In this paper we present and evaluate a data integration approach for detecting spatial and temporal trends in post-fire logging. Here we utilize a series of maps relating timing and extent of burned area (from the Canadian Large Fire Database) and year of harvest (from Landsat change detection) to identify occurrences of post-fire logging between 1987 and 2008 for a portion of boreal forest located in central Saskatchewan, Canada. Using a design-based, stratified random sampling framework we found that 68% (95% confidence interval (CI) [53 to 84%]) of the detected post-fire logging was correctly classified, such that both fire and clearcutting disturbances were positively verified by the reference data. The majority of map error resulted from spectral confusion between harvested areas and rock outcroppings exposed by fire and from mislabeling harvested unburned islands as post-fire logging. To add further confidence to our classification accuracy, we also found that mapped post-fire logging displayed similar temporal trends over a ten year period as salvage volume reported for a forest management area partially contained within the study area. Based upon the significant relationship between these estimates (r = 0.97, p<0.001) and the good degree of observed map accuracy, we believe that the presented approach offers a viable and flexible option for characterizing the spatial and temporal dynamics of post-fire logging in boreal forests. Maps which reliably identify areas of post-fire logging stand to improve our capacity to manage and model the ecological impacts associated with multiple disturbance events.

Its variability in time and space can be globally retrieved through the use of remote sensing products. To evaluate and improve the quality of satellite retrievals, careful intercomparisons with in situ measurements of surface albedo are crucial. For this purpose we compared MODIS albedo retrievals with surface measurements taken at 53 FLUXNET sites that met strict conditions of land cover homogeneity. A good agreement between mean yearly values of satellite retrievals and in situ measurements was found (r(2) = 0.82). The mismatch is correlated with the spatial heterogeneity of surface albedo, stressing the relevance of land cover homogeneity when comparing point to pixel data. When the seasonal patterns of MODIS albedo are considered for different plant functional types, the match,. with surface observations is extremely good at all forest sites. On the contrary, satellite retrievals at non-forested sites (grasslands, savannas, croplands) underestimate in situ measurements across the seasonal cycle. The mismatch observed at grassland and cropland sites is likely due to the extreme fragmentation of these landscapes, as confirmed by geostatistical attributes derived from high resolution scenes.

Five different types of geostatistical textural measure for three different window sizes and three different lags were applied creating a total of 972 potential input variables. Madograms, rodograms and direct variograms for the univariate case and cross- and pseudo-cross variograms for the multivariate case, together with multi-seasonal spectral information, were used in a RF classifier to map the land cover types. The pseudo-cross and cross variograms were used specifically to incorporate important seasonal/temporal information. Incorporating multi-scale textural features into the RF models led to an increase in the overall index of 10.71% and, for the most accurate classification, the increase was up to 30% in some classes. The differences in the kappa coefficient for the textural classification models were evaluated statistically using a pairwise Z-test, revealing a significant increase in per-class classification accuracy compared to GLCM-based texture measures. The pseudo-cross variogram between the visible and near-infrared bands was the most important textural features for general classification, and the multi-seasonal pseudo-cross variogram had an outstanding importance for agricultural classes. Overall, the RF classifier applied to a reduced subset of input variables composed of the most informative textural features led to the highest accuracy. Highly reliable classification results were obtained when the 16 most important textural features calculated at single scales (window sizes) were selected and used in the classification. The proposed methodology significantly increased the classification accuracy achieved with a spectral maximum likelihood classifier (ML). The kappa values for the textural RF and ML classifications were equal to 0.92 and 0.83, respectively. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Rodriguez-Galiano, V.

In clear sky conditions, the shape of the open water area of the polynya (i.e. the portion of the ocean free of sea-ice) is revealed by the skin sea-ice temperatures close to the water freezing point provided by the MODIS-derived IST product. The swaths of the MODIS sensors onboard Terra and Aqua satellites over the Terra Nova Bay consist of about 5500 scenes per year, useful to estimate the cloud cover too. The open water area was extracted from clear sky scenes and from scenes affected by fog but providing continuity of the shape of the polynya. Using about 40% of the available swaths, the polynya was detected for more than 80% of the sea-ice period with a revisit time below 24 h and for more than 50% with a revisit time below 3 h. The open water area was extracted using thresholds of IST based on the IST values detected within the open water area and within the band of sea-ice surrounding the polynya, obtained scene by scene. An ice free area larger than 100 km(2) was observed near the Nansen Ice Shelf for more than 70% of time (larger than 500 km2 for 50% of time). The mean annual open water area, around 900 km(2), was close to the lower limit of the reported range except during 2006, around 600 km(2), due to the limited activity in the second half of the cold season. The largest extents, between 6000 and 8500 km(2), occurred in different periods of the Antarctic winter and exceeded maxima estimated in previous studies by thermal infrared data. Polynya openings developed from a few hours to several days, in the latter case sustained by subsequent katabatic events visible in the IST sequence. Peaks of growing rate above 300 km(2)/h were observed during intense katabatic events with gusts of 50 m/s. The fluctuations of the open water area resulted well correlated with wind records available from local Automatic Weather Stations within the main katabatic routes, and followed katabatic events at intervals between 0 and 6 h. The analysis of the IST data set derived from the thermal infrared bands of MODIS provides new polynya observations of high horizontal resolution (1 km) and frequent revisit time during the winter season, complementing previously available observations with passive microwave imagery.

Remote sensing provides the only feasible option for mapping LAI continuously over landscapes, but existing methodologies have significant limitations. There is a tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolutions inherent in remotely sensed images, i.e. high spatial resolution images may only be collected infrequently, whereas imagery with fine temporal resolution has necessarily coarser spatial resolution. LAI products created using a single sensor inherit the spatial and temporal characteristics of that sensor. Moreover, the majority of developed algorithms in the literature use spectral information alone, which suffers from the serious limitation of signal saturation at moderately high LAI. We developed a novel approach for mapping effective LAI (L-e) using spectral information from Landsat, spatial information from IKONOS, and temporal information from MODIS, which overcomes these limitations. The approach is based on an empirical model developed between L-e measured on the ground and spectral and spatial information from remotely sensed images to map annual maximum and minimum L-e. A phenological model was fit to a time series of MODIS vegetation indices which was used to model the trajectory between annual minimum and maximum L-e. This approach was able to generate maps of L-e at Landsat spatial resolution with daily temporal resolution. We tested the approach in the North Carolina Piedmont and generated daily maps of L-e for a 100 km(2) area. Modeled L-e compared well with time series of LAI estimates from two AmeriFlux sites within the study area. A comparison of the MODIS LAI product with spatially averaged L-e estimates from our model showed general agreement in forested areas, but large differences in developed areas. This model takes advantage of multidimensional information available from multiple remote sensors and offers significant improvements for mapping leaf area index, particularly for forested areas where spectral indices tend to saturate.

S2 and S3 will deliver near real-time operational products with a high accuracy for land monitoring. This unprecedented data availability leads to an urgent need for developing robust and accurate retrieval methods. Machine learning regression algorithms may be powerful candidates for the estimation of biophysical parameters from satellite reflectance measurements because of their ability to perform adaptive, nonlinear data fitting.   By using data from the ESA-led field campaign SPARC (Barrax, Spain) we have compared the utility of four state-of-the-art machine learning regression algorithms and four different S2 and S3 band settings to assess three important biophysical parameters: leaf chlorophyll content (Chl), leaf area index (LAI) and fractional vegetation cover (FVC). The tested Sentinel configurations were: S2-10 m (4 bands), S2-20 m (8 bands), 52-60 m (10 bands) and S3-300 m (19 bands), and the tested methods were: neural networks (NN), support vector regression (SVR), kernel ridge regression (KRR), and Gaussian processes regression (GPR).   GPR outperformed the other retrieval methods for the majority of tested configurations and was the only method that reached the 10% precision required by end users in the estimation of Chl. Also, although validated with an RMSE accuracy around 20%, GPR yielded optimal LAI and FVC estimates at highest S2 spatial resolution of 10 m with only four bands. In addition to high accuracy values, GPR also provided confidence intervals of the estimates and insight in relevant bands, which are key advantages over the other methods. Given all this, GPR proved to be a fast and accurate nonlinear retrieval algorithm that can be potentially implemented for operational monitoring applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

As part of the analysis, the Data INterpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions (DINEOF) technique was successfully applied to CHL images. Results from the single EOFs, along with a cross-correlation analysis, identified physical-biological interactions at both short (weeks to months) and long (years) temporal scales, and from meso- to basin-scales. Phytoplankton biomass abundance and the sea surface thermal stratification show a strong inverse relationship at seasonal and sub-basin scales. At a regional scale, the spring bloom space-time variability is related to the intensity and spatial extent of the deep water formation process and especially to its pre-conditioning phase. At interannual and sub-basin scales, a gradual decline of the phytoplankton biomass in the whole central Mediterranean occurs with a delay of one year relative to the decrease of the cyclonic circulation in the eastern basin, and the northward displacement of the Algerian current. Regionally, the phytoplankton biomass and the surface heat content anomalies associated with extreme atmospheric anomalies (such as the cold 1998-1999 winter and the summer 2003 heat wave) show a significant correlation with a similar to 5-month time lag.

To monitor spatial and temporal dynamic forest stress conditions, timely, accurate, and cost-effective information is needed that could be provided by remote sensing. Recently, satellite imagery has become available via the RapidEye satellite constellation to provide spectral information in five broad bands, including the red-edge region (690-730 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum. We tested the hypothesis that broadband, red-edge satellite information improves early detection of stress (as manifest by shifts in foliar chlorophyll a + b) in a woodland ecosystem relative to other more commonly utilized band combinations of red, green, blue, and near infrared band reflectance spectra. We analyzed a temporally dense time series of 22 RapidEye scenes of a pinon-juniper woodland in central New Mexico acquired before and after stress was induced by girdling. We found that the Normalized Difference Red-Edge index (NDRE) allowed stress to be detected 13 days after girdling between and 16 days earlier than broadband spectral indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green NDVI traditionally used for satellite based forest health monitoring. We conclude that red-edge information has the potential to considerably improve forest stress monitoring from satellites and warrants further investigation in other forested ecosystems.

Model adjustment was performed after dynamic injection of a background contribution predicted via the kernel weights of a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model. Accuracy was assessed with respect to similar maps obtained with data from the NASA Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) and to contemporaneous US Forest Service (USFS) maps based partly on Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data. MODIS and MISR retrievals of forest fractional cover and mean height both showed compatibility with the USFS maps, with MODIS mean absolute errors (MAE) of 0.09 and 8.4 m respectively, compared with MISR MAE of 0.10 and 2.2 m, respectively. The respective MAE for aboveground woody biomass was similar to 10 Mg ha(-1), the same as that from MISR, although the MODIS retrievals showed a much weaker correlation, noting that these statistics do not represent evaluation with respect to ground survey data. Good height retrieval accuracies with respect to averages from high resolution discrete return lidar data and matches between mean crown aspect ratio and mean crown radius maps and known vegetation type distributions both support the contention that the GO model results are not spurious when adjusted against MISR bidirectional reflectance factor data. These results highlight an alternative to empirical methods for the exploitation of moderate resolution remote sensing data in the mapping of woody plant canopies and assessment of woody biomass loss and recovery from disturbance in the southwestern United States and in parts of the world where similar environmental conditions prevail.

Large footprint lidar makes a direct measurement of the heights of scatterers in the illuminated footprint and can yield accurate information about the vertical profile of the canopy within lidar footprint samples. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is known to sense the canopy volume, especially at longer wavelengths and provides image data. Methods for biomass mapping by a combination of lidar sampling and radar mapping need to be developed.   In this study, several issues in this respect were investigated using aircraft borne lidar and SAR data in Howland, Maine, USA. The stepwise regression selected the height indices rh50 and rh75 of the Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) data for predicting field measured biomass with a R-2 of 0.71 and RMSE of 3133 Mg/ha. The above-ground biomass map generated from this regression model was considered to represent the true biomass of the area and was used as a reference map since no better biomass map exists for the area. Random samples were taken from the biomass map and the correlation between the sampled biomass and co-located SAR signature was studied. The best models were used to extend the biomass from lidar samples into all forested areas in the study area, which mimics a procedure that could be used for the future DESDYnI mission. It was found that depending on the data types used (quad-pol or dual-pol) the SAR data can predict the lidar biomass samples with R-2 of 0.63-0.71. RMSE of 32.0-28.2 Mg/ha up to biomass levels of 200-250 Mg/ha. The mean biomass of the study area calculated from the biomass maps generated by lidar-SAR synergy was within 10% of the reference biomass map derived from LVIS data. The results from this study are preliminary, but do show the potential of the combined use of lidar samples and radar imagery for forest biomass mapping. Various issues regarding lidar/radar data synergies for biomass mapping are discussed in the paper. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Suited space- and airborne SAR data over several agricultural sites together with related in-situ information were collected for this purpose. Directional scattering was identified by comparison of backscattering acquired with only slightly different aspect angles as available from ERS-ENVISAT pairs with significantly different Doppler Centroids or by comparing azimuth spectrum sub-bands with slightly different Doppler Centroid. Major progress achieved in this work includes the much improved experimental evidence available and significant improvements in the understanding of the scatter phenomenon through the developed scatter model.

The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) has been demonstrated as a physiological index sensitive to the epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle pigments and to photosynthetic efficiency, serving as a proxy for short-term changes in photosynthetic activity, stress condition, and pigment absorption, but highly affected by illumination conditions, viewing geometry and canopy structure. In this study, a diurnal airborne campaign was conducted over Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra forest areas with the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) to evaluate the effects of canopy structure on PRI when used as an indicator of stress in a conifer forest. The AHS airborne sensor was flown at two times (8:00 GMT and 12:00 GMT) over forest areas under varying field-measured stress levels, acquiring 2 m spatial resolution imagery in 80 spectral bands in the 0.43-12.5 mu m spectral range. Five formulations of PRI (based on R-531 as a xanthophyll-sensitive spectral band) were calculated using different reference wavelengths, such as PRI570 (reference band R-REF = R-570), and the PRI modifications PRIm1 (R-REF = R-512). PRIm2 (R-REF = R-600), PRIm3 (R-REF = R-670). and PRIm4 (R-REF = R-570, R-670), along with other structural indices such as NDVI, SR, OSAVI, MSAVI and MTVI2. In addition, thermal bands were used for the retrieval of the land surface temperature. A radiative transfer modeling method was conducted using the LIBERTY and INFORM models to assess the structural effects on the PRI formulations proposed, studying the sensitivity of PRIm indices to detect stress levels while minimizing the effects caused by the conifer architecture. The PRI indices were related to stomatal conductance, xanthophyll epoxidation state (EPS) and crown temperature. The modeling analysis showed that the coefficient of variation (CV) for PRI was 50%. whereas the CV for PRIm1 (band R512 as a reference) was only 20%. Simulation and experimental results demonstrated that PRIm1 (R-REF = R-512) was less sensitive than PRI (R-REF = R-570) to changes in Leaf Area Index (LAI) and tree densities. PRI512 was demonstrated to be sensitive to EPS at both leaf (r(2) = 0.59) and canopy level (r(2) = 0.40), yielding superior performance than PRI570 (r(2) = 0.21) at the canopy level. In addition, PRI512 was significantly related to water stress indicators such as stomatal conductance (Gs; r(2) = 0.45) and water potential (Psi; r(2) = 0.48), yielding better results than PRI570 (Gs, r(2) = 0.21; Psi, r(2) = 0.21) due to the structural effects found on the PRI570 index at the canopy level.

In this research we explore the potential of spectral trajectories generated from a 35-year (1973-2008) time-series of Landsat imagery to characterize change processes in a dynamic forest environment in northwestern Alberta, Canada. We propose a method of hierarchical spatio-temporal segmentation that enables the characterization of change processes that are spatially diffuse and temporally imprecise. Calibrated imagery from Landsat sensors are radiometrically normalized and two metrics derived from the Tasseled Cap Transformation components, greenness and brightness, are used to generate the Tasseled Cap Angle (TCA). The TCA is a measure of the proportion of vegetation to non-vegetation (the occupation state), and its derivative, the Process Indicator (PI), is a measure of change in this proportion through time. These indices condense information from the visible and near-infrared wavelengths, and facilitate lengthy time series analysis of forest landscape change using data from all Landsat sensors.   A combination of the original TCA and its derivative sequence are input to a three level hierarchical segmentation process with the highest and lowest levels defining homogeneous objects at the initial and final date, and the intermediate level identifying trajectories with similar change processes. The development through time of the TCA and PI are described, and the spatial and temporal associations of processes are statistically assessed using the Moran\'s Index.   A full range of change types were identified on the landscape, from stand replacing disturbances to more subtle growth and succession processes. Results indicate that the study area is in a constant state of change, and maintains a high average proportion of vegetation to non-vegetation. The amount of total landscape modified per decade increased from 18% and 14% in the 1970s and 1980s respectively, to more than 30% and 33% in the 1990s and 2000s. On average, the proportion of vegetation to non-vegetation was increasing prior to 1981, decreasing between 1981 and 1997, and increasing post-1997. There was a high degree of spatial autocorrelation amongst change processes, with a maximum Moran\'s 1 of 0.79 in 1973; landscape change became more spatially disperse and widespread after 1981. Temporal correlation of change processes was observed locally, with the period 1990-1995 having the most persistent change. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.

We analyzed global phenology cycles over a six year record (2003-2008) using satellite passive microwave remote sensing based Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) retrievals derived from daily time series brightness temperature (T-b) measurements from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on EOS (AMSR-E) and other ancillary data inputs. The VOD parameter derives vegetation canopy attenuation at a given microwave frequency (18.7 GHz) and varies with canopy height, density, structure and water content. An error sensitivity analysis indicates that the retrieval algorithm can resolve the VOD seasonal cycle over a majority of global vegetated land areas. The VOD results corresponded favorably (p < 0.01) with vegetation indices (VIs) and leaf area index (lid) information from satellite optical-infrared (MODIS) remote sensing, and phenology cycles determined from a simple bioclimatic growing season index (GSI) for over 82% of the global domain. Lower biomass land cover classes (e.g. savannas) show the highest correlations (R=0.66), with reduced correspondence at higher biomass levels (0.03 < R < 0.51) and higher correlations for homogeneous land cover areas (0.41 < R < 0.83). The VOD results display a unique end-of-season signal relative to VI and LAI series, and may reflect microwave sensitivity to the timing of vegetation biomass depletion (e.g. leaf abscission) and associated changes in canopy water content (e.g. dormancy preparation). The VOD parameter is independent of and synergistic with optical-infrared remote sensing based vegetation metrics, and contributes to a more comprehensive view of land surface phenology.

Seasonality and serial auto-correlation in the data have previously been dealt with by integrating the data to annual values; as an alternative to reducing the temporal resolution, we apply harmonic analyses and non-parametric trend tests to the GIMMS NDVI dataset (1981-2006). Using the complete dataset, greening and browning trends were analyzed using a linear model corrected for seasonality by subtracting the seasonal component, and a seasonal non-parametric model. In a third approach, phenological shift and variation in length of growing season were accounted for by analyzing the time-series using vegetation development stages rather than calendar days. Results differed substantially between the models, even though the input data were the same. Prominent regional greening trends identified by several other studies were confirmed but the models were inconsistent in areas with weak trends. The linear model using data corrected for seasonality showed similar trend slopes to those described in previous work using linear models on yearly mean values. The non-parametric models demonstrated the significant influence of variations in phenology; accounting for these variations should yield more robust trend analyses and better understanding of vegetation trends.

In this case study, we have investigated the feasibility and potential of detecting the land subsidence accompanying coal fires by means of satellite InSAR observations. Three groups of small-baseline InSAR approaches (PSI, stacking and 2-passDInSAR) were applied to the Wuda coalfield (Northern China) to reveal the spatial and temporal signals of the land subsidence in the areas affected by the coal fires. The interferometric results agree well with GPS observations and coal fire data obtained by field investigation, which demonstrates that the small-baseline InSAR techniques have remarkable potential to detect this land subsidence of interest. In particular, our results show that the development of coal fires can lead to new subsiding areas and also accelerate the ongoing surface subsidence, typically within the areas of mature coal fires, through a comparison of the interferometric observations and the multi-temporal coal fire maps. This timely and reliable information on land subsidence will be useful for the detection and mapping of the coal fire affected regions and thereby assist in fighting and controlling coal seam burning.

This study proposes a novel method for calculating the empirical probability of having a significant proportion of the total agricultural area affected by drought at sub-national level. First, we used the per-pixel Vegetation Health Index (VHI) from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) averaged over the crop season as main drought indicator. A phenological model based on NDVI was employed for defining the start of season (SOS) and end of the grain filling stage (GFS) dates. Second, the per-pixel average VHI was aggregated for agricultural areas at sub-national level in order to obtain a drought intensity indicator. Seasonal VHI averaging according to the phenological model proved to be a valid drought indicator for the African continent, and is highly correlated with the drought events recorded during the period (1981-2009). The final results express the empirical probability of drought occurrence over both the temporal and the spatial domain, representing a promising tool for future drought monitoring.

While the highest resolutions of other satellite SST products are about 1 km, the ASTER thermal-infrared channels provide 90-m spatial resolution. To develop the ASTER algorithm, we employed statistical methods in which SSTs retrieved from the thermal-infrared measurements were tuned against the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) SST product with a 1-km spatial resolution. Terra also carries a MODIS sensor, which observed the same area as the ASTER sensor at the same time. The MODIS SST was validated around Sendai Bay, revealing a bias of -0.15 degrees C and root mean-square difference (RMSD) of 0.67 degrees C against in situ SSTs. Taking into account the spatial-resolution difference between ASTER and MODIS, match-up was generated only if the variability of ASTER brightness temperatures (T-13) was small in a pixel of MODIS SST (MP). The T-13 within one MP was about 121 pixels. The standard deviation (sigma(13)) of T-13 was calculated for each cloud-free MP, and the threshold of sigma(13) for choosing match-up MPs was decided by analyzing the sigma(13) histogram of one ASTER image. The 15 synchronous pairs of ASTER/MODIS images are separated into two groups of 8 pairs called set (A) and 7 pairs called set (B). Using the common procedure, the match-ups are generated for set (A) and set (B). The former is used for developing the ASTER Multi-Channel SST (MCSST) algorithm, and the latter for validation of the developed ASTER SST. Analysis of the whole 15 pairs indicated that ASTER SST does not depend on the satellite zenith angle. We concluded that, using Akaike\'s information criterion with set (A) match-ups, the multiple regression formula with all five thermal-infrared channels was adequate for the ASTER SST retrieval. Validation of ASTER SST using match-up set (B) indicated a bias of 0.101 degrees C and RMSD of 0.455 degrees C. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This paper develops a new inversion method for the real-time estimation of the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of land surfaces from MODIS time series reflectance data (MOD09A1). It consists of a series of procedures, including time series data smoothing, data quality control and real-time estimation of LAI. After the historical LAI time series is smoothed by a multi-step Savitzky-Golay filter to determine the upper LAI envelope, a Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model is used to derive the LAI climatology. Based on the climatology from the SARIMA model to evolve in time, a dynamic model is then constructed and used to provide the short-range forecast of LAI. Predictions from this model are used with Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) techniques to recursively update biophysical variables as new observations arrive. The validation results produced using MODIS surface reflectance data and field-measured LAI data at eight BELMANIP sites show that the real-time inversion method is able to efficiently produce a relatively smooth LAI product. In addition, the accuracy is significantly improved over the MODIS LAI product. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

These communities have large intra- and inter-annual variability, and characterization of this variability is necessary to quantify the role of macrophytes in the ecology and biogeochemistry of the floodplain. A novel approach for mapping the temporal evolution of aquatic vegetation in the Amazon floodplain, which could be adapted to other spatially and temporally changing environments, is presented Macrophyte cover varied seasonally and Inter-annually, ranging between 104 and 198 km(2) for the floodplain examined (total area, 984 km(2)). The observed evolution of plant distribution indicated a spatial and temporal partition of macrophyte communities into short-lived and annual groups. A simulation of macrophyte net primary production (NPP) based on the mapping results indicated that at least 3% of NPP could be attributed to the short-lived communities. The present results suggest that significant changes in the macrophyte\'s contribution to carbon cycling in the Amazon floodplain could occur as a result of the predicted increase in frequency of drought years for the Amazon system due to climate change.

Much effort has been devoted to better understand the water cycle and its role in global climate regulation. This is one of the objectives of the European Space Agency (ESA) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, approved in May 1999 and successfully launched in November 2nd 2009. Collecting brightness temperature measurements by means of a new type of instrument, a synthetic aperture radiometer operating at L-Band (MIRAS: Microwave Imaging Radiometer by Aperture Synthesis), the SMOS mission will provide regular and global maps of sea surface salinity (SSS) and soil moisture (SM), two key parameters to describe the water cycle. Synthetic aperture brightness temperatures have been simulated since the early 90s, during the MIRAS technological studies, and both SSS and SM retrievals have been tested with simulated data first, and later with real data to assess and improve the instrument performance. Nevertheless, except for the processing of the data collected by the SMOSillo (MIRAS Demonstrator) on June 20th, 2006, Duffo et al. (2007) and Camps et al. (2008b), these outcomes have never been validated using sea surface brightness temperatures coming from a real synthetic aperture radiometer. The aim of this study is thus to test some of the techniques proposed in previous years to improve the SSS retrieval, in particular only Level 2 techniques (i.e. converting calibrated and geo-located brightness temperature into SSS maps) will be investigated. To do so, brightness temperatures resulting from the SMOS Salinity Demonstrator Campaign held in August 2007 will be used. In that campaign the Helsinki University of Technology-2 Dimensional (HUT-2D) radiometer flown over both over land and sea. The part of the campaign conducted over the sea consisted of two series of flights over a very fresh water plume characterized by a strong SSS gradient (from 0 to 4 psu) in the Gulf of Finland. In-situ auxiliary data was collected simultaneously with the radiometer measurements. The positive outcomes in these very challenging conditions (due to the very low brightness temperature sensitivity to SSS, the lack of accurate models of the sea water dielectric constant at low SSS (Klein & Swift (1977)), and the weak radiometric sensitivity of the HUT-2D radiometer) demonstrate the importance of data pre- and post-processing to improve the results. Removing both brightness temperature biases and salinity retrieval biases and further averaging of the results, permits estimating SSS with an rms error on the order of 1 psu, which is comparable to the SMOS Level 2 expected accuracy.

The phenology of these natural vegetation types is often controlled by climatic condition. Estimating phenological variables will help in understanding the response of tropical and subtropical vegetation to climate change. The study investigated the annual and inter-annual variation in vegetation phenology in India using satellite remote sensing. The study used time-series data of the only available satellite measured index of terrestrial chlorophyll content (MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index) from 2003 to 2007 at 4.6 km spatial resolution. A strong coincidence was observed with expected phenological pattern, in particular, in inter-annual and latitudinal variability of key phenological variables. For major natural vegetation type the onset of greenness had greater latitudinal variation compared to the end of senescence and there was a small or no leafless period. In the 2003-04 growing season a late start for the onset of greenness was detected at low-to-mid latitudes and it was attributed to the extreme cold weather during the early part of 2003. The length of growing season varied from east to west for the major cropping areas in the Indo-Gangetic plain, for both the first and second crops. For the first time, this study attempted to establish a broad regional phenological pattern for India using remotely sensed estimation of canopy chlorophyll content using five years of data. The overall patterns of phenological variables detected from this study broadly coincide with the pattern of natural vegetation phenology revealed in earlier community level studies. The results of this study suggest the need for an organised network combining ground and space observation which is at presently missing in India. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

One of the main causes of these errors is the spatial variability of fuel consumption within burned areas. This paper studies whether burn severity (BS) maps can be used to improve BE assessment. A burn severity map of two large fires in California was obtained by inverting a simulation model constrained by post-fire observations from Landsat TM imagery. Model output values of BS were validated against field measurements, obtaining a high correlation (R-2=0.85) and low errors (Root Mean Square Error, RMSE=0.14) throughout a wide range of BS levels. The BS map obtained was then used to adjust BE reference values per vegetation type found in the area before the fire. The adjusted burning efficiency (BEadj) was compared to the burned biomass, which was estimated by subtracting vegetation indices from pre- and post-fire images. Results showed a high correlation for conifers (R-2=0.75) and hardwoods (R-2=0.73), and a moderate correlation (R-2 similar to 0.5) for shrubs and grasslands. In general, for all vegetation types BEadj performed better (R-2=0.4-0.75) than literature-based BE (R-2<0.0001). This study demonstrates: (i) the consistency of the simulation model inversion for BS estimation in temperate ecosystems, and (ii) the improvement of BE estimation when the spatial variability of the combustion was quantified in terms of BS.

Uncertainties may arise from similar spectral signatures of different plant species as well as from variable influences of prevailing plant states (e.g., growth stages, vigor, or stress levels). Despite these uncertainties, empirical approaches may often be able to take up the challenge. However, their performance is likely to be affected by the temporal variability of empirical relations between reflectance and plant species composition. To assess some aspects of this temporal variability, we performed a greenhouse study. Three mixed stands of grassland species were planted with defined spatial variation in species proportions. The canopy reflectance of these mixed stands was measured with a field spectrometer over a period of three months. Confounding external influences on plant states apart from maturation were minimized.   The suitability of canopy reflectance and derivative reflectance to draw conclusions on differences in qualitative species mixtures between the stands was tested with a classification approach (Spectral Angle Mapper, SAM). Procrustean randomization test (PROTEST), which is to our knowledge new to the field of remote sensing, was applied in combination with Isometric Feature Mapping to quantify the spectral variation caused by within-stand spatial variation in species proportions. Model fits in both analyses increased with progressing plant development; further, utilization of derivative reflectance improved the model fits. Regardless of the within-stand variation, SAM enabled a successful discrimination of the three stands with an average overall accuracy of 85% (reflectance) and 92% (derivative reflectance). In PROTEST analysis, spatial variation in reflectance was successfully related to within-stand variation in species proportions. However, observed influences of variable growth stages and health states on these relations were considerable. The temporal variation of these relations (r=0.27-0.73 for reflectance and 0.48-0.73 for derivative reflectance) was quantified for the first time under controlled conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

However, only a few have estimated the combined impacts of those anthropogenic activities. We conducted a detailed analysis of selective logging and forest fire impacts on natural forests in the southern Brazilian Amazon state of Mato Grosso, one of the key logging centers in the country. To achieve this goal a 13-year series of annual Landsat images (1992-2004) was used to test different remote sensing techniques for measuring the extent of selective logging and forest fires, and to estimate their impact and interaction with other land use types occurring in the study region. Forest canopy regeneration following these disturbances was also assessed. Field measurements and visual observations were conducted to validate remote sensing techniques. Our results indicated that the Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index aerosol free (MSAVI(af)) is a reliable estimator of fractional coverage under both clear sky and under smoky conditions in this study region. During the period of analysis, selective logging was responsible for disturbing the largest proportion (31%) of natural forest in the study area, immediately followed by deforestation (29%). Altogether, forest disturbances by selective logging and forest fires affected approximately 40% of the study site area. Once disturbed by selective logging activities, forests became more susceptible to fire in the study site. However, our results showed that fires may also occur in undisturbed forests. This indicates that there are further factors that may increase forest fire susceptibility in the study area. Those factors need to be better understood. Although selective logging affected the largest amount of natural forest in the study period, 35% and 28% of the observed losses of forest canopy cover were due to forest fire and selective logging combined and to forest fire only, respectively. Moreover, forest areas degraded by selective logging and forest fire is an addition to outright deforestation estimates and has yet to be accounted for by land use and land cover change assessments in tropical regions. Assuming that this observed trend of land use and land cover conversion continues, we predict that there will be no undisturbed forests remaining by 2011 in this study site. Finally, we estimated that 70% of the total forest area disturbed by logging and fire had sufficiently recovered to become undetectable using satellite data in 2004. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

One of the main obstacles for operational applications of ITC is biased results often experienced due to segmentation errors. In this article, we propose a new method, called \"semi-ITC\" that overcomes the main problems related to ITC by imputing ground truth data within crown segments from the nearest neighboring segment. This may be none, one, or several trees. The distances between segments were derived based on a set of explanatory variables using two nonparametric methods, i.e., most similar neighbor inference (MSN) and random forest (RF). RF favored the imputation of common observations in the data set which resulted in significant biases. Main conclusions are therefore based on MSN. The explanatory variables were calculated by means of small footprint ALS and multispectral data. When testing with empirical data the new method compared favorably to the well-known ABA. Another advantage of the new method over the ABA is that it allowed for the modeling of rare tree species. The results of predicting timber volume with the semi-ITC method were unbiased and the root mean squared error (RMSE) on plot level was smaller than the standard deviation of the observed response variables. The relative RMSEs after cross validation using semi-ITC for total volume and volume of the individual species pine, spruce, birch, and aspen on plot level were 17, 38, 40, 101, and 222%, respectively. Due to the unbiasedness of the estimation, this study is a showcase for how to use crown segments resulting from ITC algorithms in a forest inventory context. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

High spatial resolution multispectral and thermal airborne imagery were used to monitor crown temperature and the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) over three commercial orchards comprising peach, nectarine and orange fruit trees during 2008. Irrigation regimes included sustained and regulated deficit irrigation strategies, leading to high variability of fruit quality at harvest. Stem water potential was used to monitor individual tree water status on each study site. Leaf samples were collected for destructive sampling of xanthophyll pigments to assess the relationship between the xanthophyll epoxidation state (EPS) and PRI at leaf and airborne-canopy level. At harvest, fruit size, Total Soluble Solids (TSS) and Tritatable Acidity (TA) were measured to characterize fruit quality. A statistically significant relationship between EPS and PRI was found at the leaf (r(2) = 0.81) and canopy level (r(2) = 0.41). Airborne-derived crown PRI calculated from the imagery acquired during the fruit growth was related to the ratio of the total soluble solids normalized by the tritatable acidity (TSS/TA), an indicator of fruit quality measured on the same trees, yielding a coefficient of determination of r(2) = 0.50. The relationship between the integral of PRI time-series and TSS/TA yielded a coefficient of determination of r(2) = 0.72 (peach) and r(2) = 0.61 (nectarines). On the contrary, the relation between TSS/TA and the time-series of crown thermal imagery was very weak (r(2) = 0.21 and 0.25 respectively). These results suggest that a physiological remote sensing indicator related to photosynthesis, such as PRI, is more appropriate for fruit quality assessment than crown temperature, the established method of water stress detection, which is more related to crown transpiration. A radiative transfer modelling study was conducted to assess the potential validity of this methodology for fruit quality assessment when using medium spatial resolution imagery. The analysis shows important effects of soil and shadows on the PRI vs EPS relationship used for fruit quality assessment if non-pure crown reflectance was extracted from the imagery.

International Journal of Remote Sensing] has been substantially enhanced to investigate the impact of Hurricane Frances on total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations in Apalachicola Bay, Florida, USA. The remote sensing model uses 250-m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to map TSS concentrations in the Bay. Eleven additional satellite imageries of MODIS were used in the model improvement and calibration. TSS concentration computation in the present model has been substantially improved by using a two-step process: firstly producing atmospheric correction intercept by an approach of in-water reflectance regression, and then building the regression model (R-2 = 0.8534, n = 25) between 250-m MODIS reflectance and observed TSS concentrations, which includes an extreme high TSS concentration data of 208 mg/L for severe storm or hurricane condition. Also, we carried out the validation of model (RMSE = 5.5 mg/L, n = 21). MODIS-derived TSS maps show substantial increases of TSS concentrations in the Bay during the passage of Hurricane Frances (the average TSS and maximum concentration about 54.3 mg/L and 165 mg/L in the Bay respectively) compared to under no-storm or -hurricane condition ( the average TSS and maximum concentration were approximately 24-27 mg/L and 58-64 mg/L. In comparison to those before and 5-days after the passage of the hurricane, the average TSS concentration in the Bay was twice higher while the maximum TSS concentration increased almost three times during the hurricane. This indicates that strong winds during the hurricane have caused strong sediment re-suspension. The spatial variations of TSS concentrations were analyzed by applying the hydrodynamic characteristics of wind-induced flow and tidal currents as described by Huang [Huang, W., Jones, K., & Wu, T. (2002). Modeling surface wind effects on subtidal salinity in Apalachicola Bay. Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, 55(1), 33-46; Huang, W., Sun, H. Nnaji, S., & Jones, K (2002). Tidal hydrodynamics in a multiple inlet estuary: Apalachicola Bay. International Journal of Coastal Research, 18 (4), 674-684], which show westward currents in the Bay under westward wind condition. Therefore, the southwestward wind (about 50 degrees from the north) during the hurricane induced southwestward currents and transport that resulted in the high TSS concentrations near West Pass in the Bay and the Gulf. Within the Bay, TSS concentrations were generally higher in the southern portion of the Bay, which was due mainly to transport by the combination of southwestward wind and southward residual flow from the Apalachicola River.

Landscapes dominated by deciduous broad-leaved trees in Germany are analysed. While ground observations generally record the onset of bud break, remote sensing refers to a detectable change of surface reflectance, which accounts for the unfolding of the majority of the leaves. The satellite detects, even in a homogeneous stand, two signals: the green-up of the understorey and, shortly after, the green-up of the canopy (overstorey). Results of comparisons indicate an earlier, although not consistently, satellite-derived green-up than bud break derived from ground observations.   We hypothesise that this is due to heterogeneous ground cover and a detection of the greening of non-tree vegetation by the satellite. This hypothesis is tested by analysing the difference between satellite-derived green-up dates (d(GU)) and budburst observed on the ground (d(BB)) in function of the proportion of non-deciduous-forest (ndf) land use types in satellite scenes. The satellite data (a daily 1-km resolution AVHRR product) are analysed with progressively more restricted selection criteria regarding the land surface elements. The two sets of observations are compared using Gaussian Mixture Models to evaluate the statistical properties of the probability density functions (pdf) as produced by the two sets rather than comparisons of geographically coincident data. It is shown that a heterogeneous vegetation cover is likely to be the main factor determining the difference between the computed green-up date and date of budburst of the dominating tree species.

The soil-understory background contribution was partly isolated prior to inversion using regression relationships with the isotropic, geometric, and volume scattering kernel weights of a Li-Ross kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model. The height retrievals were assessed using discrete return lidar data acquired over sites in Colorado as part of the Cold Land Processes Experiment (CLPX) and used with fractional crown cover retrievals to obtain aboveground woody biomass estimates. For all model runs with reasonable backgrounds and initial b/r (vertical to horizontal crown radii) values <2.0, root mean square error (RMSE) distributions were centered between 2.5 and 3.7 m while R-2 distributions were centered between 0.4 and 0.7. The MISR/GO aboveground biomass estimates predicted via regression on fractional cover and mean canopy height for the CLPX sites showed good agreement with U.S. Forest Service Interior West map data (adjusted R-2 = 0.84). The implication is that multiangle sensors such as MISR can provide spatially contiguous retrievals of forest canopy height, cover, and aboveground woody biomass that are potentially useful in mapping distributions of aboveground carbon stocks, tracking disturbance, and in initializing, constraining, and validating ecosystem models. This is important because the MISR record is spatially comprehensive and extends back to the year 2000 and the launch of the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra satellite; it might thus provide a similar to 10-year baseline record that would enhance exploitation of data from the NASA Deformation, Ecosystem Structure and Dynamics of Ice (DESDynl) mission, as well as furthering realization of synergies with active instruments.

The reason is assuming of zero water leaving signal at near infrared (NIR) wavelengths. This assumption is not valid in very shallow waters, but also in areas where aquatic vegetation reaches water surface and in case of phytoplankton blooms that reach very high biomass or form surface scum. We propose an alternative method that can be used for successful glint removal even if the sensor does not have spectral bands beyond 800 nm. The proposed method utilises the presence and depth of the oxygen absorption feature near 760 nm as an indicator of glint contamination. This method allows removing sun glint from hyperspectral imagery preserving shape and magnitude of reflectance spectra in the cases where the negligible water leaving NIR signal is not valid.

The statistical basis of the analysis has to date been from a frequentist point of view. An alternative Bayesian approach, described here, has a number of attractive features. Perhaps most importantly. it allows us to combine prior information in our analyses. The interpretation of the Bayesian estimates and intervals is also more intuitive, and because our inferences revolve around a posterior distribution, we are able to summarise estimates even after complicated transformations. Two novel plots summarising the accuracy of a map are also introduced. The approach is illustrated by analysing accuracy data from a land use map for the Baffle catchment in Queensland. Australia. Analysis is carried out using a non-informative prior and an informative prior based on data previously collected for a neighbouring catchment. The use of the informative prior tended to increase the precision of key accuracy parameters. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Unfortunately, current fire products from MODIS and other sensors leave large uncertainties in measurements of fire sizes and temperatures, which strongly influence how fires spread, the amount and chemistry of their gas and aerosol emissions, and their impacts on ecosystems. In this study, we use Multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) to retrieve subpixel fire sizes and temperatures from MODIS, possibly overcoming some limitations of existing methods for characterizing fire intensities such as estimating the fire radiative power (FRP). MESMA is evaluated using data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) to assess the performance of FRP and MESMA retrievals of fire properties from a simultaneously acquired MODIS image, for a complex of fires in Ukraine from August 21, 2002. The MESMA retrievals of fire size described in this paper show a slightly stronger correlation than FRP does to fire pixel counts from the coincident ASTER image. Prior to this work, few studies, if any, had used MESMA for retrieving fire properties from a broad-band sensor like MODIS, or compared MESMA to higher-resolution fire data or other measures of fire properties like FRP. In the future, MESMA retrievals could be useful for fire spread modeling and forecasting, reducing hazards that fires pose to property and health, and enhancing scientific understanding of fires and their effects oil ecosystems and atmospheric composition.

These parameters are useful inputs for forest ecosystem simulations at landscape scale. The method is based on the determination of the best vegetation indices (index form and wavelengths) using the radiative transfer model PROSAIL (formed by the newly-calibrated leaf reflectance model PROSPECT coupled with the multi-layer version of the canopy radiative transfer model SAIL). The results are tested on experimental measurements at both leaf and canopy scales. At the leaf scale, it is possible to estimate CHL with high precision using a two wavelength vegetation index after a simulation based calibration. At the leaf scale, the LMA is more difficult to estimate with indices. At the canopy scale, efficient indices were determined on a generic simulated database to estimate CHL, LMA, LAI and Bleaf in a general way. These indices were then applied to two Hyperion images (50 plots) on the Fontainebleau and Fougeres forests and portable spectroradiometer measurements. They showed good results with an RMSE of 8.2 mu g cm(-2) for CHL, 9.1 g m(-2) for LMA, 1.7 m(2) m(-2) for LAI and 50.6 g m(-2) for Bleaf. However, at the canopy scale, even if the wavelengths of the calibrated indices were accurately determined with the simulated database, the regressions between the indices and the biophysical characteristics still had to be calibrated on measurements. At the canopy scale, the best indices were: for leaf chlorophyll content: NDchl (rho(925)-rho(710))/(rho(925)+rho(710)), for leafmass per area: NDLMA = (rho(2260)-rho(1490))/(rho(2260)+rho(1490)), for leaf area index: DLAI=rho(1725)-rho(970), and for canopy leaf biomass: NDBleaf = (rho(2160)-rho(1540))/(rho(2160)+rho(1540)).

Space borne altimeters have been Successfully used in the last decade to measure lakes, rivers and wetland stages. This study presents the first analysis of Lake Izabal - the biggest lake of Guatemala (Central America) - water level fluctuations using altimetry, data and in-situ measurements. Water level variations were obtained from Envisat Radar Altimeter (RA-2) Geophysical Data Records Coupled with in-situ measurements. The analysis period included three complete years (2004 to 2006). The rainfall and temperature records over the catchment were analyzed considering that the amount of water feeding the lake, either by the tributaries and/or the groundwater, is driven by the climatic conditions over the lake\'s catchment. The results obtained show a good agreement between both, altimeter and in-situ datasets (correlation coefficient: 0.83 and rms error: 0.09 m). Lake Izabal water level fluctuations have a seasonal signal forced by the rainy and dry climate seasons in the region. An abrupt lake level rise was found in July 2006 which is correlated to abnormal precipitations in June. We found a connection between the higher/lower extreme values in the lake level variations with rainfall anomalies produced by regional climate changes forced by El Nino Southern Oscillation and the Tropical North Atlantic anomaly.

The algorithm relies on temporal comparisons of several spectral indices (GEMI, BAI), as well as near infrared reflectance.

Airborne campaigns over two years were conducted with the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) over an orchard field to investigate changes in PRI, in the Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index (TCARI) normalized by the Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) (TCARI/OSAVI), and in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as function of field-measured physiological indicators of water stress, such as stomatal conductance, stem water potential, steady-state fluorescence, and crown temperature. The AHS sensor was flown at three times on each 2004 and 2005 years, collecting 2 m spatial resolution imagery in 80 spectral bands in the 0.43-12.5 mu m spectral range. Indices PRI, TCARI/OSAVI, and NDVI were calculated from reflectance bands, and thermal bands were assessed for the retrieval of land surface. temperature, separating pure crowns from shadows and sunlit soil pixels. The Photochemical Reflectance Index, originally developed for xanthophyll cycle pigment change detection was calculated to assess its relationship with water stress at a canopy level, and more important, to assess canopy structural and viewing geometry effects for water stress detection in diurnal airborne experiments. The FLIGHT 3D canopy reflectance model was used to simulate the bi-directional reflectance changes as function of the viewing geometry, background and canopy structure. This manuscript demonstrates that the airborne-level PRI index is sensitive to the de-epoxidation of the xanthophyll pigment cycle caused by water stress levels, but affected diurnally by the confounding effects of BRDF. Among the three vegetation indices calculated, only airborne PRI demonstrated sensitivity to diurnal changes in physiological indicators of water stress, such as canopy temperature minus air temperature (Tc-Ta), stomatal conductance (G), and stem water potential (psi) measured in the field at the time of each image acquisition. No relationships were found from the diurnal experiments between NDVI and TCARI/OSAVI with the tree-measured physiological measures. FLIGHT model simulations of PRI demonstrated that PRI is highly affected by the canopy structure and background. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Suarez, L.; Zarco-Tejada, P.

Growing awareness of the role of tundra and taiga ecosystems and their transition zone in the climate change process has resulted in a recent increase in remote sensing studies focusing on the Arctic latitudes. Remote sensing of biophysical properties of the canopy layer in the forested part of the region is often, however, challenged by the dominating role of the understory in the spectral signal. In this paper, we examine the influence of understory vegetation on forest reflectance in the Arctic region of Finland during no-snow conditions. The study is based on SPOT HRVIR images, field goniospectrometry, 300 ground reference plots and a physically-based forest reflectance model (PARAS). The results indicate that lichen-dominated forest site types can be distinguished from sites dominated by dwarf shrubs.

These include normalized water leaving radiance spectra L-WN, absorption spectra due to phytoplankton, non-pigmented particles and chromophoric dissolved organic matter, back-scattering spectra, concentrations of chlorophyll a, Chla, and total suspended matter, TSM, and diffuse attenuation coefficients, K-d, obtained with a diverse set of algorithms. A total of 81 and 21 match-ups are found for SeaWiFS and MODIS L-WN, respectively. For both sensor products, the match-ups show mean absolute percentage differences of approximately 30% at 412 nm, 20% at 443 nm, and 14% from 490 to 555 nm. Some dependence of these differences has been found with respect to the aerosol optical thickness and the single scattering albedo associated with the in-water constituents. However, the performance of the atmospheric correction scheme appears relatively robust with respect to angular and environmental conditions. The different Chla products generally show quite large uncertainties whereas a TSM product shows encouraging results. Three algorithms produce Kd (490) with a RMS uncertainty of 0.13 for log-transformed data. The comparison between in situ data and satellite derived absorption values yields varying levels of uncertainties for the three bio-optical algorithms considered here and for the different wavelengths. Preliminary improvements could be reached by reducing biases affecting the total absorption coefficient at various wavelengths. Another general result is that the bio-optical models are able to represent a larger part of the observed variability for phytoplankton absorption than for the absorption by dissolved and non-pigmented particulate matter. The assumed spectral shape of the latter absorption term appears logically as a strong determinant of the partition of the total absorption. The three sets of satellite derived back-scattering spectra compare favorably with in situ optical measurements, with mean RMS differences between 0.12 and 0.18. Importantly, the uncertainties obtained here for satellite match-ups of absorption coefficients are comparable to published estimates of the inherent uncertainties associated with the bio-optical algorithms.

Change detection techniques that use optical remotely sensed data to capture disturbance related changes are established and commonly applied; however, approaches for the capture of continuous forest changes are less mature. Optical remotely sensed imagery is well suited for capturing horizontally distributed conditions, structures, and changes, while Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) data are more appropriate for capturing vertically distributed elements of forest structure and change. The integration of optical remotely sensed imagery and LIDAR data provides improved opportunities to fully characterize forest canopy attributes and dynamics. The study described in this paper captures forest conditions along a corridor approximately 600 km long through the boreal forest of Canada. Two coincident LIDAR transects, representing 1997 and 2002 forest conditions respectively, are compared using image segments generated from Landsat ETM+ imagery. The image segments are used to provide a spatial framework within which the attributes and temporal dynamics of the forest canopy are estimated and compared. Segmented and classified Landsat imagery provides a context for the comparison of sufficiently spatially related LIDAR profiles and for the provision of categories to aid in the application of empirical models requiring knowledge of land cover. Global and local approaches were employed for characterizing changes in forest attributes over time. The global approach, emphasized the overall trend in forest change along the length of the entire transect, and indicated that key canopy attributes were stable, and transect characteristics, including forest canopy height, did not change significantly over the five-year period of this study (two sample t-test, p=0.08). The local approach analyzed segment-based changes in canopy attributes, providing spatially explicit indications of forest growth and depletion. The local approach identified that 84% of the Landsat segments intercepted by both LIDAR transects either have no change, or have a small average increase in canopy height (0.7 m), while the other 16% of segments have an average decrease in canopy height of 1.6 m. As expected, the difference in the magnitude of the changes was markedly greater for depletions than it was for growth, but was less spatially extensive. Growth tends to occur incrementally over broad areas; whereas, depletions are dramatic and spatially constrained. The approach presented holds potential for investigating the impacts of climate change across a latitudinal gradient of boreal forest. Crown Copyright (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Recently a conceptual model containing reflectance in three spectral bands in the red and near infra-red range of the spectrum was suggested for retrieving chla concentrations in turbid productive waters; it was calibrated and validated in lakes and reservoirs in Nebraska and Iowa. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the performance of this three band model as well as its special case, the two-band model to estimate chla concentration in Chesapeake Bay, as representative of estuarine Case II waters, and to assess the accuracy of chla retrieval. To evaluate the model performance, dual spectroradiometers were used to measure subsurface spectral radiance reflectance in the visible and near infra-red range of the spectrum. Water samples were collected concurrently and contained widely variable chla (9 to 77.4 mg/m(3)) and total suspended solids (7-65 mg/L dry wt). Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption at 440 nm was 0.20 to 2.50 m(-1); Secchi disk transparency ranged from 0.28 to 1.5 m. The two- and three-band models were spectrally tuned to select the spectral bands for most accurate chla estimation. Strong linear relationships were established between analytically measured chla and both the three-band model [R-1(675)-R-1(695)] x R(730) and the two-band model R(720)/R(670), where R(lambda) is reflectance at wavelength lambda. The three-band model accounted for 81% of variation in chla and allowed estimation of chla with a root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 7.9 mg/m(3), whereas the two-band model accounted for 79% of chla variability and RMSE of chla estimation was below 8.4 mg/m(3). The three-band model with MERIS spectral bands allows accurate chla estimation with RMSE below 9.1 mg/m(3). Two-band model with SeaWiFS bands and MODIS 667 nm and 748 nm bands can estimate chla with RMSE below 11 mg/m(3). The findings underlined the rationale behind the conceptual model and demonstrated the robustness of this algorithm for chla retrieval in turbid, productive estuarine waters. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Imputation and smoothing with standard algorithms like inverse distance weighted nearest neighbour interpolation (IDW) and interpolation on triangulated irregular networks (TIN/IP) fail to incorporate the spatial structure and ignore information beyond the neighbourhood. Multiresolution spatial models (MRSM) or approximate kriging methods adapted to handling massive data sets can be expected to do better than IDW and TIN/IP in terms of mean square errors of prediction (MSEP). We illustrate a MRSM that is efficient, computationally fast, and easy to implement. In two forestry examples with imputation of LiDAR range values the MRSM achieved a lower MSEP than IDW, TIN/IP, and fixed ranked kriging. MRSM appear as especially attractive for the construction of a DTM from last return LiDAR pulses. A third example demonstrates MRSM for efficient smoothing.

SDD was computed using a two-step process, first estimating the diffuse light attenuation coefficient at 490 nm, KJ490), using a semi-analytical algorithm and then SDD using an empirical relationship with K-d(490). The empirical SDD algorithm (SDD = 1.04 x K-d(490)(-0.82), 0.9<SDD<8.0 M, r(2) =0.67, n=80) is based on historical SDD observations collected by the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County (EPCHC) in Tampa Bay. SeaWiFS derived SDD showed distinctive seasonal variability, attributed primarily to chlorophyll concentrations and color in the rainy season and to turbidity in the dry season, which are in turn controlled by river runoff and winds or wind-induced sediment resuspension, respectively. The Bay also experienced strong interannual variability, mainly related to river runoff variability. As compared to in situ single measurements, the SeaWiFS data provide improved estimates of the \"mean\" water clarity conditions in this estuary because of the robust, frequent, and synoptic coverage. Therefore we recommend incorporation of this technique for routine monitoring of water quality in coastal and large estuarine waters like Tarnpa Bay. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Stability of the time series was addressed for the input variables in the burned area algorithm, reflectance and temperature channels.   A Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving-Average (SARIMA) model was developed for forecasting potential burned area. The SARIMA model identified an autoregressive regular term with 1-month lag and an autoregressive 12-month seasonal term, with one season (12 months) component. A cross-correlation between Southern Oscillation Index (Sol) and burned area was statistically significant predictor variable in a time series with 20-month lag. Results show that the SARIMA model with this predictor improved both, fitting and forecasting, residual variance, by 4.1% and 5.6%, respectively, thereby, demonstrating potential relationship between SOI and burned area for the study region. Forecasting was estimated by considering only the first 16 years of the monthly burned area in the time series, from July 1981 to June 1997. The prediction for the following 24 months (from July 1997 to June 1999) was within the 95% confidence level indicating that the forecast was a valid characterization of the modeled process.

As a result, preexisting data are often used for validation. Temporal, spatial, and attribute differences between the land cover product and pre-existing validation data can result in inconclusive depictions of map accuracy. This approach may therefore misrepresent the true accuracy of the land cover product, as well as the accuracy of the validation data, which is not assumed to be without error. Hence, purpose-acquired validation data is preferred; however, logistical constraints often preclude its use - especially for large area land cover products. Airborne digital video provides a cost-effective tool for collecting purpose-acquired validation data over large areas. An operational trial was conducted, involving the collection of airborne video for the validation of a 31,000 km(2) sub-sample of the Canadian large area Earth Observation for Sustainable Development of Forests (EOSD) land cover map (Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada). In this trial, one form of agreement between the EOSD product and the airborne video data was defined as a match between the mode land cover class of a 3 by 3 pixel neighbourhood surrounding the sample pixel and the primary or secondary choice of land cover for the interpreted video. This scenario produced the highest level of overall accuracy at 77% for level 4 of classification hierarchy (13 classes). The coniferous treed class, which represented 71% of Vancouver Island, had an estimated user\'s accuracy of 86%. Purpose acquired video was found to be a useful and cost-effective data source for validation of the EOSD land cover product. The impact of using multiple interpreters was also tested and documented. Improvements to the sampling and response designs that emerged from this trial will benefit a full-scale accuracy assessment of the EOSD product and also provides insights for other regional and global land cover mapping programs.

The correction of these effects becomes indispensable when quantitative image analysis is performed with respect to the derivation of geo- and biophysical parameters. The paper presents a rigorous approach for geometric and radiometric correction of SAR images. Using a digital elevation model, the imaging geometry is reconstructed and is used to perform geometric and radiometric correction of terrain induced distortions. The importance of a stringent radiometric correction based on the integration of the image brightness is emphasized. The approach guarantees that the energy contained in the image data is preserved throughout the geocoding process. The resulting backscattering images are fully terrain corrected and can be used for further quantitative investigations and may also improve qualitative studies as e.g. land cover classifications. The technique is applicable for different sensor types and image products, including already geocoded SAR images. The effect of different resolutions of digital elevation models used for the correction of the backscattering coefficient is investigated. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Firstly, the direct emissivity is obtained by ignoring SESR emission. Next, the first order SESR emissivity is obtained by using the direct emission as a radiation source. Finally, the ith order SESR emissivity is iteratively obtained by using the i-1st order SESR emission.   Computational results are in good agreement with a Monte Carlo calculation, where the SESR emissivity increases from an emission angle of 50 degrees showing a maximum value of about 0.03 at an emission angle of 80 degrees. The direct emissivity is smaller than the measured emissivity by 0.02 similar to 0.03 around a wavelength of 10 mu m at an emission angle of 73.5 degrees. By incorporating the SESR emission into the emissivity model, the discrepancy between the computed and the measured emissivity is significantly reduced.   The advantage of the present method over the previous works is that we need not to specify a cutoff angle to differentiate the radiation from the sea and that from the sky for calculating SESR emission. Instead of using a cutoff angle, the probability that radiation originates from the sea is derived from the probability distribution function of sea surface slope. As a result, the uncertainty in the computation of sea surface emissivity attributed to the uncertainty in cutoff angle could be effectively suppressed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

This paper presents a comparison of five atmospheric correction methods (2 relative, 3 absolute) used to correct a nearly continuous 20-year Landsat TM/ETM+ image data set (19-images) covering western Oregon (path/row 46/29). In theory, full absolute correction of individual images in a time-series should effectively minimize atmospheric effects resulting in a series of images that appears more similar in spectral response than the same set of uncorrected images. Contradicting this theory, evidence is presented that demonstrates how absolute correction methods such as Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6 s), Modified Dense Dark Vegetation (MDDV), and Dark Object Subtraction (DOS) actually make images in a time-series somewhat less spectrally similar to one another. Since the development of meaningful spectral reflectance trajectories is more dependant on consistent measurement of surface reflectance rather than on accurate estimation of true surface reflectance, correction using image pairs is also tested. The relative methods tested are variants of an approach referred to as \"absolute-normalization\", which matches images in a time-series to an atmospherically corrected reference image using pseudo-invariant features and reduced major axis (RMA) regression. An advantage of \"absolute-normalization\" is that all images in the time-series are converted to units of surface reflectance while simultaneously being corrected for atmospheric effects. Of the two relative correction methods used for \"absolute-normalization\", the first employed an automated ordination algorithm called multivariate alteration detection (MAD) to statistically locate pseudo-invariant pixels between each subject and reference image, while the second used analyst selected pseudo-invariant features (PIF) common to the entire image set. Overall, relative correction employed in the \"absolute-normalization\" context produced the most consistent temporal reflectance response, with the automated MAD algorithm performing equally as well as the handpicked PIFs. Although both relative methods performed nearly equally in terms of observed errors, several reasons emerged for preferring the MAD algorithm. The paper concludes by demonstrating how \"absolute-normalization\" improves (i.e., reduces scatter in) spectral reflectance trajectory models used for characterizing patterns of early forest succession.

Our dataset consists of 99 cloud-free matchups, 25 of which are two-channel SST retrievals (daytime) and 74 three-channel SST retrievals (nighttime). Validation results for both dual- and nadir-view SSTs for these matchups are presented. We demonstrate that the dual-nadir SST measurement difference (D-N) can be used to classify matchups and attribute the likely cause of a particularly high D-N to outbreaks of Saharan dust. Under conditions of \'normal\' D-N, the bias and standard deviation of the two- and three-channel dual-view retrievals is -0.05 K and 0.26 K, and 0.02 K and 0.25 K, respectively. Dual-view SSTs obtained when the D-N is high over the Caribbean exhibit significant warm biases of 0.60 K and 0.32 K for two- and three-channel retrievals, respectively. Cool biases, with respect to the bias for \'normal\' D-N, are observed in the nadir three-channel (N3) SSTs; for matchups with high D-N, the bias and standard deviation are - 0.16 K and 0.31 K, compared with 0.14 K and 0.24 K for \'normal\' D-N. The distribution of the nadir two-channel retrievals is non-Gaussian and the apparent accuracy is comparatively poor, demonstrating clearly the advantages of using a sensor with dual-viewing capabilities to obtain a superior atmospheric correction, particularly when data from an additional short-wave infrared channel (e.g. at 3.7 mu m) is not available.

However, separation of woody regrowth following agricultural clearing cannot be undertaken with confidence, and is therefore not mapped routinely by State Agencies. Using fully polarimetric C-, L- and P-band NASA AIRSAR and Landsat FPC data for forests and agricultural land near Injune, central Queensland, we corroborate that woody regrowth dominated by Brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) cannot be discriminated using either FPC or indeed C-band data alone, because the rapid attainment of a canopy cover leads to similarities in both reflectance and backscatter with remnant forest. We also show that regrowth cannot be discriminated from non-forest areas using either L-band or P-band data alone. However, mapping can be achieved by thresholding and intersecting these layers, as regrowth is unique in supporting both a high FPC (> similar to 12%) and C-band SAR backscatter (>similar to -18 dB at HV polarisation) and low L-band and P-band SAR backscatter (e.g. <= similar to 14 dB at L-band HH polarisation). To provide a theoretical explanation, a wave scattering model based on that of Durden et al. [Durden, S.L., Van Zyl, J.J. & Zebker, H.A. (1989). Modelling and observation of radar polarization signature of forested areas. IEEE Trans. Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 27, 290-301.] was used to demonstrate that volume scattering from leaves and small branches in the upper canopy leads to increases in C-band backscattering, (particularly HV polatisations) from regrowth, which increases proportionally with FPC, By contrast, low L-band and P-band backscatter occurs because of the lack of double bounce interactions at co-polarisations (particularly HH) and volume scattering at HV polarisation from the stems and branches, respectively, when their dimensions are smaller than the wavelength. Regrowth maps generated by applying simple thresholds to both FPC and AIRSAR L-band data showed a very close correspondence with those mapped using same-date 2.5 m Hymap data and an average 73.7% overlap with those mapped through time-series comparison of Landsat-derived land cover classifications. Regrowth mapped using Landsat-derived FPC from 1995 and JER-1 SAR data from 1994 - 1995 also corresponded with areas identified within the time-series classification and true colour stereo photographs for the same period, The integration of Landsat FPC and L-band SAR data is therefore expected to facilitate regrowth mapping across Queensland and other regions of Australia, particularly as Japan\'s Advanced Land Observing System (ALOS) Phase Arrayed L-band SAR (PALSAR), to be launched in 2006, will observe at both L-band HH and HV polarisations.

TIR image data from the MASTER multispectral spectrometer and the SEBASS hyperspectral spectrometer were acquired over Steamboat Springs, Nevada, USA, in September 1999. Spectral emissivity information was extracted from the data and used to generate mineral maps. Using the MASTER data it was possible to map the extent of the active geothermal area as well as silica-rich vs. clay-rich areas. Using the SEBASS data the same areas could be mapped and additionally the presence of several minerals, including opal, quartz, alunite, anorthite, albite, and kaolinite could be identified. The SEBASS data also detected previously unidentified hydrous sulfate minerals (tamarugite and alunogen) forming around active fumaroles. Laboratory spectral data and XRD analyses of field samples confirmed the dominant mineral phases identified remotely. The airborne, field and laboratory data together with temperature anomaly and fumarole location data from other studies were synthesized and linked to the surface geology to determine the diagnostic surface mineral expression that could be mapped with TIR remotely sensed data for future exploration for similar geothermal systems. Opaline sinter deposits are the most diagnostic surface expression of hot spring activity at Steamboat Springs because they represent areas of the recent geyser activity. The differentiation between opal and chalcedony deposits and the identification of hydrous sulfate minerals forming around active fumaroles are also important because chalcedony represents ancient sinter deposits and hydrous sulfate minerals indicate locations of fumaroles that may be venting diffusely with no geyser activity. The surface expression of the geothermal system at Steamboat Springs is small, which emphasizes the need for high spatial resolution airborne imagers. The 90-m pixels of ASTER TIR data over the same area were only capable of resolving the area of past and recent sinter deposits together. MASTER multispectral TIR data covered the entire area (similar to 12 km(2)) at 5-m spatial resolution and were capable of defining the extent of the sinter deposits and zones of hydrothermally altered rocks. The SEBASS image swath was too narrow (256 in) to add significant spatial information to the overall map, but the high spectral content identified several important minerals related to the local geology and the mineralogic surface expression of the geothermal system.

Radiometric consistency among collocated multi-temporal imagery is difficult to maintain, however, due to variations in sensor characteristics, atmospheric conditions, solar angle, and sensor view angle that can obscure surface change detection. To detect accurate landscape change using multitemporal images, we developed a variation of the pseudoinvariant feature (PIF) normalization scheme: the temporally invariant cluster (TIC) method. Image data were acquired on June 9, 1990 (Landsat 4), June 20, 2000 (Landsat 7), and August 26, 2001 (Landsat 7) to analyze boreal forests near the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and reduced simple ratio (RSR). The temporally invariant cluster (TIC) centers were identified via a point density map of collocated pixel VIs from the base image and the target image, and a normalization regression line was created to intersect all TIC centers. Target image VI values were then recalculated using the regression function so that these two images could be compared using the resulting common radiometric scale. We found that EVI was very indicative of vegetation structure because of its sensitivity to shadowing effects and could thus be used to separate conifer forests from deciduous forests and grass/crop lands. Conversely, because NDVI reduced the radiometric influence of shadow, it did not allow for distinctions among these vegetation types. After normalization, correlations of NDVI and EVI with forest leaf area index (LAI) field measurements combined for 2000 and 2001 were significantly improved; the r(2) values in these regressions rose from 0.49 to 0.69 and from 0.46 to 0.61, respectively. An EVI \"cancellation effect\" where EVI was positively related to understory greenness but negatively related to forest canopy coverage was evident across a post fire chrono sequence with normalized data. These findings indicate that the TIC method provides a simple, effective and repeatable method to create radiometrically comparable data sets for remote detection of landscape change. Compared to some previous relative radiometric normalization methods, this new method does not require high level programming and statistical skills, yet remains sensitive to landscape changes occurring over seasonal and inter-annual time scales. In addition, the TIC method maintains sensitivity to subtle changes in vegetation phenology and enables normalization even when invariant features are rare.

For example, a recently developed semi-empirical SWE retrieval algorithm accounts for systematic and random error caused by forest cover and snow morphology (crystal size - a function of location and time of year). However, we have found that climate and land surface complexities lead to significant systematic and random error uncertainties in remotely sensed SWE retrievals that are not included in current SWE estimation algorithms. Joint analysis of independent meteorological records, ground SWE measurements, remotely sensed SWE estimates, and land surface characteristics have provided a unique look at the error structure of these recently developed satellite SWE products. We considered satellite-derived SWE errors associated with the snow pack mass itself, the distance to significant open water bodies, liquid water in the snow pack and/or morphology change due to melt and refreeze, forest cover, snow class, and topographic factors such as large scale root mean square roughness and dominant aspect. Analysis of the nine-year Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) SWE data set was undertaken for Canada where many in-situ measurements are available. It was found that for SMMR pixels with 5 or more ground stations available, the remote sensing product was generally unbiased with a seasonal maximum 20 mm average root mean square error for SWE values less than 100 mm. For snow packs above 100 mm, the SWE estimate bias was linearly related to the snow pack mass and the root mean square error increased to around 150 mm. Both the distance to open water and average monthly mean air temperature were found to significantly influence the retrieved SWE product uncertainty. Apart from maritime snow class, which had the greatest snow class affect on root mean square error and bias, all other factors showed little relation to observed uncertainties. Eliminating the drop-in-the-bucket averaged gridded remote sensing SWE data within 200 km of open water bodies, for monthly mean temperatures greater than -2 degrees C, and for snow packs greater than 100 mm, has resulted in a remotely sensed SWE product that is useful for practical applications.

Using both a radiative transfer simulation and an analysis of a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image, we examined the ability of satellite remote sensing to detect and map biological soil crusts. Our simulation indicated that Landsat ETM+ data could be used, after atmospheric correction, to detect biological soil crusts if 33% or more of any pixel was accounted for by biological soil crusts. When the proposed BSCI was applied to the detection of biological soil crusts in the Gurbantonggut Desert, Xingjiang, China, a Kappa coefficient of 0.82 and an overall accuracy of 94.7% were achieved.

However, traditionally used rain gauge data are sparse and do not always provide adequate spatial representation of rainfall. In this study, we evaluated the daily I-degree resolution remotely-sensed atmospheric precipitation data provided by Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) as an alternative to rain gauge-measured data. We analyzed data from the watersheds of southern California during the period of 1996-2003, focusing on the comparison of patterns of spatial, seasonal, and interannual rainfall dynamics, We used Empirical Orthogonal Functions to discern the patterns of precipitation and atmospheric circulation at different time scales, from synoptic to interannual. The correlation between the daily rain gauge-measured and remotely-sensed precipitation wits poor and the resulting patterns of remotely-sensed precipitation are different than the temporal patterns of precipitation accumulated by rain gauges. These differences likely result from the fact that the precipitable water concentration measured by satellites is not always highly correlated to rainfall reaching the earth surface. Differences in the spatial resolution and coverage of the two methods and the differential influence of orographic effects and wind patterns on each also contribute to low correlations, We conclude that daily remotely-sensed precipitation produced at GPCP is not currently appropriate for use in assessing fine-scale hydrological processes in arid zones like southern California, and would not be a recommended surrogate for event-based hydrologic modeling. At the same time, the interannual variabilities of remotely-sensed and gauge-measured precipitation were highly correlated and the regional patterns of gauge-measured and remotely-sensed precipitation variability were similar; though the total precipitation estimated from satellite data was substantially lower than the gauge-measured data. Therefore, remotely-sensed precipitation data may be appropriate for use in long-term regional hydrologic or climate modeling focused on trends and patterns of rainfall in southern California. Both data sets showed that precipitation generally decreases from the northern to the southern watersheds. At interannual time-scale, the rainfall is related to the ENSO cycle. At synoptic time-scales, the rainfall patterns in southern California result from atmospheric moisture transport from the south-southwest. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Using the a function, comparisons between radar measurements for high incidence angles and simulations based on the numerical backscattering model (moment method) show a good agreement for soil surfaces with an rms height smaller than 2 cm with medium and high soil moisture.

Here, we report on an under-appreciated complexity in the analysis of land cover change important in and and semi-arid environments. In these environments, some land cover types show a high degree of inter-annual variability in productivity. In this study, we show that ecosystems dominated by non-native cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) show an inter-annual amplified response to rainfall distinct from native shrub/bunch grass in the Great Basin, US. This response is apparent in time series of Landsat and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) that encompass enough time to include years with high and low rainfall. Based oil areas showing a similar amplified response elsewhere in the Great Basin, 20,000 km 2, or 7% of land cover, are currently dominated by cheatgrass. Inter-annual patterns, like the high variability seen in cheatgrass-dominated areas, should be considered for more accurate land cover classification. Land cover change science should be aware that high inter-annual variability is inherent in annual dominated ecosystems and does not necessarily correspond to active land cover change.

These models are developed empirically as functions of the surface and cloud properties provided by coincident high-resolution imager measurements over CERES field-of-view. However, approximately 5.6% of the CERES/Terra footprints lack sufficient imager information for a reliable scene identification. To avoid any systematic biases in regional mean radiative fluxes, it is important to provide TOA fluxes for these footprints. For this put-pose, we apply a feedforward error-backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique to reproduce CERES/Terra ADMs relying only on CERES measurements. All-sky ANN-based angular distribution models are developed for 10 surface types separately for shortwave, longwave and window TOA flux retrievals. To optimize the ANN performance, we use a partially connected first hidden neuron layer and compact training sets with reduced data noise. We demonstrate the performance of the ANN-based ADMs by comparing TOA fluxes inferred from ANN and CERES anisotropic factors. The global annual average bias in ANN-derived fluxes relative to CERES is less than 0.5% for all ANN scene types. The maximum bias occurs over sea ice and permanent snow surfaces. For all surface types, instantaneous ANN-derived TOA fluxes are self-consistent in viewing zenith angle to within 9% for shortwave, 3.5% and 3% longwave daytime and nighttime, respectively.

A 12-channel GPS navigation receiver, modified to perform bistatic radar measurements, was mounted on the NCAR C- 130 aircraft to make co-located measurements with other instruments. Narrow pulse returns and comparison of the reflected GPS signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurements to digital imagery and cover maps indicated that the scattering was most likely quasi-specular, originating from a small footprint on the order of the first Fresnel zone (similar to 30 in). Temporal changes were observed in the measured signals and were expected to be proportional to varying soil moisture content. To investigate this effect, the bistatic signal measurements were interpolated to a spatial grid to produce daily maps of relative change of surface soil moisture over the study region. The maps of the study region showed a transition from dry surface soil moisture conditions to wet conditions following precipitation events occurring in the middle of the study period. Additionally, the maps showed the scattered power increased in areas with localized rainfall relative to areas without precipitation. Comparing the GPS-reflected SNR measurements with L-band brightness temperatures measured coincidently by the PALS radiometer showed good agreement in the trend measured by the two sensors. The scattered signal measurements were also compared with in situ soil moisture measurements and found to follow the general soil moisture trend as a function of time. These initial results from the first controlled experiment of GPS bistatic radar for soil moisture remote sensing indicate that the technique is sensitive to temporal and spatial variations in soil moisture.

These measurements must still contend with fundamental nonlinearities in the SAR image processing (i.e., azimuth direction \"velocity bunching\") that are due to wave velocity and acceleration effects.   NASA/JPL/AIRSAR L-, and P-band data from California coastal waters were used in the studies. Wave parameters measured using the new methods are compared with those developed using both conventional SAR intensity based methods, and with in situ NOAA National Data Center buoy measurement products.

Radar remote sensing measurements of the initiation and length of the growing season corresponded closely with both site measurements and ecosystem process model (BIOME-BGC) simulations of these parameters because of the sensitivity of the K.-band scatterometer to snow cover freeze-thaw dynamics and associated linkages between growing season initiation and the timing of seasonal snowmelt. In contrast, remote sensing estimates of the timing of growing season termination were either weakly or not significantly associated with site measurements and model simulation results, due to the relative importance of light availability and other environmental controls on stand phenology in the fall. Regional patterns of estimated annual net primary production (NPP) and component photosynthetic and autotrophic respiration rates for the evergreen forest sites also corresponded favorably with remote sensing estimates of the seasonal timing of spring thaw and associated growing season length, indicating the importance of these parameters in determining spatial and temporal patterns of NPP and the potential utility of satellite radar remote sensing for regional monitoring of the terrestrial biosphere.

For this purpose, Hyperion, ALI, IKONOS, and ETM+ data were acquired for southern Cameroon, a region considered to be a representative area for tropical moist evergreen and semi-deciduous forests. Field data, collected in near-real time to coincide with satellite sensor overpass, were used to (1) quantify and model the biomass of tree, shrub, and weed species; and (2) characterize forest land use/land cover (LULC) classes.   The study established that even the most advanced broadband sensors (i.e., ETM+, IKONOS, and ALI) bad serious limitations in modeling biomass and in classifying forest LULC classes. The broadband models explained only 13-60% of the variability in biomass across primary forests, secondary forests, and fallows. The overall accuracies were between 42% and 51% for classifying nine complex rainforest LULC classes using the broadband data of these sensors. Within individual vegetation types (e.g., primary or secondary forest), the overall accuracies increased slightly, but followed a similar trend. Among the broadband sensors, ALI sensor performed better than the IKONOS and ETM+ sensors.   When compared to the three broadband sensors, Hyperion narrowband data produced (1) models that explained 36-83% more of the variability in rainforest biomass, and (2) LULC classifications with 45-52% higher overall accuracies. Twenty-three Hyperion narrowbands that were most sensitive in modeling forest biomass and in classifying forest LULC classes were identified and discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Damage classification accuracy was compared among four methods: multiple regression, linear discriminant analysis, maximum likelihood, and neural networks. Using the best classifier, various stratification methods were assessed for potential inflationary effects on classification accuracy due to spatial proximity between training and reference data. Of the classifiers that were evaluated, neural networks performed best. Neural networks \'learn\' training data accurately (94% overall), but classify proximate reference data less accurately (65%), and distant, spatially independent reference data least accurately (55%).

An important step in the delivery of highly accurate images for farm managers is the within-image correction for viewing geometry effects. Reflected light on an imaging sensor is influenced by properties of view zenith angle, solar zenith angle, and relative azimuth. There are a number of models that describe this effect termed the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) or more generically \"viewing geometry effects.\" In this paper, we compared three BRDF models (Roujean, Shibayama-Wiegand, and Dymond-Qi) with a fuzzy inference system (FIS) for three data sets for correction of geometric effects. One data set consisted of ground data collected at different viewing angles of a cotton crop. Another data set included six aircraft images of a corn plot in a different part of each image. The final data set was an aerial image of a planting density experiment of cotton. All the models performed reasonably well, but the FIS was the most consistent predictor of BRDF for all three data sets. For the ground data set, R-2 statistics for predicting the reflectance based on the trained models ranged from 0.53 to 0.93 for the BRDF models and from 0.94 to 0.97 for the FIS.

While limited numbers of U.S. soldiers in high-risk areas use chloroquine/primaquine chemoprophylaxis to prevent malaria, control of mosquito larvae through larviciding also can be used to reduce the risk of malaria transmission. In order to estimate the cost of larviciding, accurate estimates of the spatial extent of mosquito larval habitats are necessary. The purpose of this study was to determine whether an accurate estimate of the area covered by mosquito larval habitats can be obtained using Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ (ETM+) and/or IKONOS data for the Korean test site.   To estimate the area covered by larval habitats near Camp Greaves [Paekyeon-Ri, near Tongil-Chon (village)] in the ROK, an IKONOS and a Landsat 7 ETM+ image were classified using a parallelepiped classification. In a comparison with rice paddy field sites, 24 (92%) of the sites were classified correctly on the IKONOS image and 17 (65%) were classified correctly on the Landsat image. Comparing the classifications on a pixel-by-pixel basis, the agreement between the two classifications was 79%. Part of the disagreement was due to the difference in resolution of the two images. In spite of local differences, the two classifications produced similar area estimates.   Although either Landsat or IKONOS could be used in Korea for a reasonable estimate of habitat area, only IKONOS can resolve small irrigation ponds. While ponds represent a small portion of the total larval habitat, they are an important source for mosquito breeding during the late rice-growing season in the ROK since they contain higher larval densities. High-resolution imagery, such as IKONOS, would be necessary for planning and implementing treatment of these smaller habitats. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

However, the complexity of vegetation stand structure, abundant vegetation species, and the smooth transition between different SS stages make vegetation classification difficult when using traditional approaches such as the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC). Most of the time, classification distinguishes only between forest/non-forest. It has been difficult to accurately distinguish stages of SS. In this paper, a linear mixture model (LMM) approach is applied to classify successional and mature forests using Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery in the Rondonia region of the Brazilian Amazon. Three endmembers (i.e., shade, soil, and green vegetation or GV) were identified based on the image itself and a constrained least-squares solution was used to unmix the image. This study indicates that the LMM approach is a promising method for distinguishing successional and mature forests in the Amazon basin using TM data. It improved vegetation classification accuracy over that of the MLC. Initial, intermediate, and advanced successional and mature forests were classified with overall accuracy of 78.2% using a threshold method on the ratio of shade to GV fractions, a 7.4% increase over the MLC. The GV and shade fractions are sensitive to the change of vegetation stand structures and better capture biophysical structure information. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

This allows retrieving the land surface emissivity and temperature from satellite microwave brightness temperatures after atmospheric corrections. Over the Canadian sub-arctic continental area, we show that the main factor modifying the emissivity is the fraction of water surface (FWS) within a pixel. Accordingly, a map of the fraction of water surface across the Canadian landmass is derived, given a correspondence within 6% as compared to the I km 2 Canadian National Topographic Database of water-covered areas. The microwave-derived surface temperatures are compared to synchronous in situ air and ground surface temperatures and also with independent satellite IR measurements over areas without snow or ice. Root mean square differences range between 2degrees and 3.5degrees, with mean bias error of the order of 1-3degrees. Better results are always obtained with the 37 GHz channel rather than with the 19 GHz channel. Over dense vegetation, the microwave-derived surface temperature is closer to the air temperature (at surface level) than to the ground temperature. The proposed simple retrieval algorithm, not sensitive to cloud cover, appears very useful for monitoring summer interannual or seasonal trends of the fraction of surface water, as well as the daily land surface temperature variation, which are very important parameters in environmental change analysis.

Much work has shown that changes in leaf pigments (chlorophyll a and b, carotenoids) and biomass as a result of water and nutrient deficiencies and other environmental influences can be detected through spectral reflectance characteristics of leaves. This paper presents the results of a reconnaissance study showing that spectral reflectance measurements can also be used to detect the effect of radionuclide contamination on the vegetation in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Through laboratory and in situ spectroradiometry of silver birch and Scots pine, we demonstrate that the chlorophyll red edge and the Three Channel Vegetation Index (TCHVI) correlate well with specific activities of Sr-90 and Cs-137 in leaves, gamma-dose rates and Cs-137 inventories in soil. The results show that remote sensing has the potential of providing a valuable monitoring technique for assessing the ecological impact of radionuclide contamination. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

While many useful insights have been gained from analyses based on AVHRR data, the availability of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data with greatly improved spectral, spatial, geometric, and radiometric attributes provides significant new opportunities and challenges for remote sensing-based land cover mapping research. In this paper, we describe the algorithms and databases being used to produce the MODIS global land cover product. This product provides maps of global land cover at 1-km spatial resolution using several classification systems, principally that of the IGBP. To generate these maps, a supervised classification methodology is used that exploits a global database of training sites interpreted from high-resolution imagery in association with ancillary data. In addition to the IGBP class at each pixel, the MODIS land cover product provides several other parameters including estimates for the classification confidence associated with the IGBP label, a prediction for the most likely alternative class, and class labels for several other classification schemes that are used by the global modeling community. Initial results based on 5 months of MODIS data are encouraging. At global scales, the distribution of vegetation and land cover types is qualitatively realistic. At regional scales, comparisons among heritage AVHRR products, Landsat TM data, and results from MODIS show that the algorithm is performing well. As a longer time series of data is added to the processing stream and the representation of global land cover in the site database is refined, the quality of the MODIS land cover product will improve accordingly.

Improved spatial resolution for land observation at 250 and 500 m and improved spectral band placement provide new remote sensing opportunities. NASA has invested in the development of improved algorithms for MODIS, which will provide new data sets for global change research. Surface reflectance is one of the key products from MODIS and is used in developing several higher-order land products. The surface reflectance algorithm builds on the heritage of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and SeaWiFS algorithms, taking advantage of the new sensing capabilities of MODIS. Atmospheric correction by the removal of water vapor and aerosol effects provides improvements over previous coarse resolution products and the basis for a new time-series, which will extend through to the NPOESS generation imagers. This paper summarizes the first evaluation of the MODIS surface reflectance product accuracy, in comparison with other data products and in the context of the MODIS instrument performance since launch.

A data set containing in situ chlorophyll-a profiles and optical measurements of in-water and above-water radiances was used to evaluate the performances of several ocean color algorithms in the Mediterranean Sea. The analysis revealed a systematic overestimation of chlorophyll-a concentration by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) global algorithms (OC2v4 and OC4v4). The error appears to be correlated with chlorophyll-a concentration. by exhibiting marked differences at low values (C<0.15 mg/m(3)). In particular at low concentration, the bias observed for OC2v4 is about twice that observed for OC4v4. The same analysis made using the Gitelson et al. [J. Mar. Syst. 9 (1996) 283.] Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) regional algorithm (GIT) revealed that this model underestimates the pigments concentration but it does not exhibit a correlation between the error and the measures. On the other hand, when the NASA standard algorithms are applied to remotely sensed data, the behavior appears reversed: the OC2v4 algorithm exhibits better estimates than OC4v4, which is probably more affected by atmospheric correction problems. When applied to satellite data, the GIT algorithm performs better than the NASA global algorithms, although the estimates are very poor in the high chlorophyll-a range. Two new Mediterranean algorithms are then proposed by fitting our Mediterranean bio-optical data set with linear and OC2-like functional forms. The new algorithms perform well when applied either to the bio-optical measurements or to satellite data. The different behavior of the same algorithm when applied to bio-optical measurements or to remotely sensed data demonstrates that the atmospheric correction is still the main source of error in ocean color data. Due to the relatively small number of available in situ data, the algorithms that we generated have to be considered very preliminary. Discussion was carried out on the reasons of the global algorithm misfit, providing possible explanations and some preliminary result. The influence of coccolithophores and of the yellow substance on the optical response of the Mediterranean waters is investigated, showing that they can at least partially explain the systematic misfit. All the above shows that a region like the Mediterranean Sea requires an independent treatment of the atmospheric and of the in-water bio-optical term to obtain reliable estimates of phytoplankton activity.

However, the difference in Tasseled Cap classification more accurately separated deciduous shrubs and harvested stands from closed canopy forest. Our results indicate that phenological change of forest is most accurately captured by combining image differencing and Tasseled Cap indices. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

As the spatial resolution of satellite sensors increases, the effects from spatially inhomogeneous cloud fields become more important. Clouds affect the distribution of radiation in a region larger than the resolution of an individual pixel and IPA is no longer justified. The objective of this study is to identify effects of clouds and find corrections for IPA to compensate for these effects. For this Purpose. cloud fields are generated with the mesoscale model MM5 at high resolution. A shallow and a convective cloud field are then used as input for a 3-D Monte Carlo radiation model that computes the radiance distribution at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface. Surface irradiance is computed from the upwelling radiance with a method that simulates IPA retrieval. The retrieved irradiance is compared against the one computed with the 3-D model. Two effects of clouds are related to the solar and viewing geometry. noted as a shift of the apparent position of clouds and their shadows. Another cloud effect is the diffusion of radiation: Scattering removes part of the radiation from an atmospheric column and distributes it to neighboring columns. Corrections for these effects are suggested, which can improve the IPA-based retrieval of I-SFC. All corrections depend upon the cloud altitude. which may be difficult to obtain in operational applications. A sensitivity analysis suggests that a coarse estimate of the cloud top altitude is sufficient for the corrections. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Considerable research has been directed at the various components of the mapping process, including the assessment of accuracy. This paper briefly reviews the background and methods of classification accuracy assessment that are commonly used and recommended in the research literature. It is, however, evident that the research community does not universally adopt the approaches that are often recommended to it, perhaps a reflection of the problems associated with accuracy assessment, and typically fails to achieve the accuracy targets commonly specified. The community often tends to use, unquestioningly, techniques based on the confusion matrix for which the correct application and interpretation requires the satisfaction of often untenable assumptions (e.g., perfect coregistration of data sets) and the provision of rarely conveyed information (e.g., sampling design for ground data acquisition). Eight broad problem areas that currently limit the ability to appropriately assess, document, and use the accuracy of thematic maps derived from remote sensing are explored. The implications of these problems are that it is unlikely that a single standardized method of accuracy assessment and reporting can be identified, but some possible directions for future research that may facilitate accuracy assessment are highlighted.

In 14 cases of subarea sites with a size of 10 lines by 16 pixels each line, where the brightness temperature in band 31 changes within +/-0.1 K, average and standard deviation values of brightness temperatures in 10 channels (consisting a 10-element linear detector array) of 16 MODIS TIR bands show the channel-dependent noise and systematic errors. A method is presented to separate the channel-dependent systematic error from noise due to variations in surface and atmospheric conditions. This case study shows that in the total 160 MODIS TIR channels, three channels are too noisy to use, 10 channels have significant channel-dependent noise. and all other channels met the specification of noise equivalent temperature difference (NEDT). After correcting the channel-dependent systematic errors. the quality of the MODIS TIR data is significantly improved in bands 22-25 and 27-30. More uniform sites in the brightness temperatures of bands 33-36 are needed to accurately estimate the values of channel-dependent systematic errors because the effects of spatial variations in atmospheric conditions are often larger in these four bands.

In this research, habitat suitability models derived from Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) imagery for 1975 and Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery for 1997 were developed to represent the landscape for the study area in a past (1975) and more recent condition (1997). A Hybrid Decision Tree (HDT) Classifier was used to combine maximum likelihood decision rules, a brightness differencing technique, and a spatial/contextual rule base. Verified by field samples and aerial photographs, the accuracy of the resulting habitat unit maps was determined to be 91.8% overall in the 1997 TM classification and 89.5% overall in the 1975 MSS classification. Based on a comparative analysis of selected spatial landscape metrics calculated for each time period, changes in the composition and spatial configuration of early winter habitat were quantified. Overall, the amount of suitable winter habitat available in 1997 represented a decrease of approximately 832.88 ha (8.53%) from 1975 levels. In the observed disturbance pattern, early winter habitat patches in 1997 were smaller and more uniform in size than in 1975. as suggested by decreases in mean patch size and patch size coefficient of variation indices. Spatial pattern analysis results indicated a reduction in geometric complexity, interior core area, and mean proximity between 1975 and 1997, while patch density and edge density had increased over time. The interpretation of changes in landscape structure are consistent with those reported in the literature for other regions, and indicate that fragmentation of early winter caribou habitat has occurred in the study area.

We propose multiple criteria for assessing algorithms for this task. In addition to standard classification accuracy measures, we propose criteria to account for computational resources requires by the algorithms, stability of the algorithms, and robustness to noise in the training data. We also propose that classification accuracy take account, through estimation of misclassification costs, of unequal consequences to the user depending on which cover types are confused. In this article, we apply these criteria to three variants of decision tree classifiers, a standard decision tree implemented in C5.0 and two techniques recently proposed in the machine learning literature known as \"bagging\" and \"boosting.\" Each of these algorithms are applied to two data sets, a global land cover classification from 8 km AVHRR data and a Landsat Thematic Mapper scene in Peru. Results indicate comparable accuracy of the three variants of the decision tree algorithms on the two data sets, with boosting providing marginally higher accuracies. The bagging and boosting algorithms, however, are both substantially more stable and more robust to noise in the training data compared with the standard C5.0 decision tree. The bagging algorithm is most costly in terms of computational resources while the standard decision tree is least costly. The results illustrate that the choice of the most suitable algorithm requires consideration of a suite of criteria in additions to the traditional accuracy measures and that there are likely to be trade-offs between algorithm performance and required computational resources.

During the May 1997 NASA Earth Observing System Jornada Prototype Validation Exercise, we calculated plot-level plant area index leaf area index, total fractional cover, and green fractional cover with data from four instruments: (1) a Dycam Agricultural Digital Camera (ADC), (2) a LI-COR LAI-2000 plant canopy analyser, (3) a Decagon sunfleck Ceptometer, and (4) a laser altimeter. Estimates from the LAI-2000 and Ceptometer were very similar (plant area index 0.3, leaf area index 0.22, total fractional cover 0.19, green fractional cover 0.14), while the ADC produced values 5% to 10% higher. Laser altimeter values, depending on the height cutoff used to establish total fractional cover were either higher or lower than the other instruments\' values: a 10-cm cutoff produced values similar to 80% higher, while a 20-cm cutoff produced values similar to 30% lower The LAI-2000 and Ceptometer are designed to operate in hamogenons canopies, not the sparse and irregular vegetation found at Jornada. Thus, these instruments were primarily useful for relative within-site plant area index monitoring. Calculation of some parameters required destructive sampling, a relatively slow and labor-intensive activity that limits spatial and temporal applicability. Validation/monitoring campaigns therefore should be guided by consideration of the amount of time and resources required to obtain measurements of the desired variables. Our results suggest that the ADC is both efficient and accurate for long-term or large-scale monitoring of arid ecosystems.

Rather than applying a hot spot correction term to the independent events, the mean probability between the independent and the dependent events is estimated. The problem is solved graphically by analogy with the physical processes of light extinction by finite objects. Then a parametric hot spot model is derived which performs rather well when compared with airborne hot spot measurements over a conifer forest target and shows that the hot spot phenomenon is only a feature of the observed directional signature in the backscattering region. The findings suggest the requirement of a hot spot kernel in a host bidirectional reflectance model. Bearing in mind its simplicity, the hot spot model of this study is clearly not designed for inversion but will serve to improve albedo calculation from multiangular measurements from the new generation of remote sensing sensor system.

The MVC method selects the highest NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) oner a certain time interval. The MODIS Til compositing algorithm emphasizes a global and operational view angle standardization approach: a reflectance-based BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) model, succeeded by a back-up MV algorithm that includes a view angle constraint. A year\'s worth of daily global AVHRR data tons used to prototype the MODIS vegetation index compositing algorithm. The composite scenarios were evaluated with respect to: 1) temporal evolution of the VI for different continents and vegetation types, 2) spatial continuity of the VI, 3) quality flags related to data integrity, cloud cover, and composite method and 4) view angle distribution of the composited data. On a continental scale, the composited NDVI values from the MODIS algorithm were as much as 30% lower than the mostly, off-nadir NDVI results based on the MVC criterion. The temporal evolution of the NDVI values derived with the MODIS algorithm were similar to the NDVI values derived from the MVC algorithm. A simple BRDF model was adequate to produce nadir equivalent reflectance values from which the NDVI could be computed. Application of the BRDF and \"back-up\" components in the MODIS algorithm were dependent on geographic location and season, for example, the BRDF interpolation was most frequently applied in arid and semiarid regions, and during the dry season over humid climate vegetation types. Examples of a MODIS-like global NDVI map and associated quality flags were displayed using a pseudo color bit mapping scheme.

Current ice concentration algorithms perform poorly in regions of predominantly thin or highly fragmented ice, which constitute a significant proportion of the pack in East Antarctica. The impact of the sea ice cover on high latitude air-sea interactions and marine ecology depends not only on ice extent and concentration but also on the ice-type composition of the pack. An unsupervised ice classification scheme, using data from four channels of the SSM/I, is presented and tested as a means of gaining important additional, complementary information on surface type. Class interpretation is by comparison with AVHRR, ERS-1 SAR, and near-coincident digital aerial photography and in situ data. The classification does a reasonable job at consistently differentiating the large-scale constituent regimes, including the outer marginal ice zone, the interior pack, and a transition zone separating the two. Given the short period of data analyzed, the cluster maps appear to be generally coherent and consistent through time as the pack changes in response to synoptic-scale atmospheric forcing, although the robustness of the technique needs further testing over longer time periods. An observed crossover int he meridional brightness temperature profiles is a dominant and consistent feature which marks the transition from unconsolidated and wet ice in the marginal ice zone to more consolidated ice with a thicker and drier snow cover in the interior pack. Ambiguities occur at the boundaries of some of these regimes due to sensor resolution limitations and the mixing of different ice types and open water. Also, some ice classes (like brash ice) cannot be distinguished from forming pancake ice. Furthermore, although the signature of the inner pack is usually distinct from that of the outer pack, we observed one extraordinary swell propagation event which led to ice fracturing and surface wetting, and significantly altered the surface classification. The results of this multiparameter study underline the importance of using multisensor systems synergistically to improve interpretation of passive microwave data and better characterize the complex Antarctic pack.

The method uses the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model of Kuusk (1995), which simultaneously predicts the spectral and directional behavior of reflectances, as a function of LAI, chlorophyll concentration, ratio of leaf size to canopy height, and other optical or structural parameters of the soil and vegetation. The same model is used irrespective of surface type, and no ancillary data is needed. This approach is evaluated with field and airborne data acquired over three different types of surfaces: Sahelian vegetation in the HAPEX-Sahel (1992) experiment, boreal forest in the BOREAS (1994) experiment, and cultivated nr-eas in the Alpilles (1996) experiment. The results shore that the LAI is restituted with a fair accuracy [root-mean-square (rms) difference between model results and observations of 0.70], better than that obtained with a semiempirical relation LAI-vegetation index. The daily fAPAR is restituted accurately, with a rms difference between measured and modeled fAPAR of 0.097. In the example of HAPEX, the model reproduces to some extent the temporal evolution of measured LAI and fAPAR. Reflectances reconstructed with the model are in acceptable agreement with observed reflectances, with a rms difference between observed and measured values of 0.017 on average. It is concluded that the retrieval of biophysical parameters from inversion of a BRDF model is promising from the perspective of a quantitative characterization of the terrestrial biosphere from space.

In this article, zee present a method for using airborne laser altimetry data to determine surface velocities in portions of the Jakobshavn drainage basin that have distinct elevation features. By examining correlations between repeat elevation surveys, the motion of these features, the most distinct of which are crevasses, is tracked. Results show that for areas with a standard deviation in elevation in excess of 1 m, displacement of features can be tracked to a precision of 1-2 m, and the corresponding velocities can be retrieved. The maximum velocity of the Jakobshavn Isbrae, at its calving front, is found to be nearly 7 km yr(-1). Ice stream boundaries and flow patterns can also be observed in the derived velocity data.

Classification of these same data using a neural network architecture called fuzzy ARTMAP indicate the following: i) When fuzzy ARTMAP is trained using 80% of the data and tested on the remaining (unseen) 20% of the data, classification accuracy is more than 85% compared with 78% using the maximum likelihood classifier; ii) classification accuracies for various splits of training/testing data show that an increase in the size of training data does not result in improved accuracies; iii) classification results vary depending on the use of latitude as an input variable similar to the results of DeFries and Townshed; and iv) fuzzy ARTMAP dynamics including a voting procedure and the numbrer of internal nodes can be used to describe uncertainty in classification.

Spatial variation in accuracy may be attributable to factors such as terrain, landscape complexity, and land use patterns. There may be serious consequences in the construction and application of thematic maps when the pattern and degree of spatial variation of map accuracy is not understood. Classification error matrices, the usual summary of thematic map accuracy, are not a natural tool for analysing spatial variation in accuracy. This article presents a method of mapping spatially based estimates of map accuracy. We formulate a concept of misclassification probability and present a method of estimating misclassification probabilities at training observation locations. Misclassification probability estimates are then interpolated from the training locations to a lattice of points via Kriging. The last step uses the lattice to construct a contour accuracy map. We illustrate the method by constructing an accuracy map for a full Landsat Thematic Mapper scene covering a portion of central Idaho and western Montana, and a finer resolution accuracy map for a small area within that scene. The method is found to provide valuable information on the spatial distribution and variation of map accuracy for both decision-makers and GIS analysts.

The 3.75-mu m reflectivity is computed by subtracting the thermal contribution from the total signal and dividing the remaining signal component by atmospheric transmission and solar irradiance. The thermal contribution is estimated by using thermal infrared Channels 4 and 5 as well as NDVI to estimate infrared surface emissivities. The atmospheric transmission is computed with MODTRAN2 and uses integrated water vapor derived from the Split Window Technique. The formula derived are validated over ocean using sun glint observations and land using the FIFE-87 data set.

The procedure begins with a classification of the high resolution TM data which yield land use references. These are degraded to low spatial resolution in order to procedure abundance images comparable with the AVHRR data. Linear regressions are then applied between the AVHRR NDVI data and the abundance images to estimate the profiles of the pure classes, which are then merged to the high spatial resolution classification outputs to generate an integrated data set. Experiments carried out in an area of Tuscany (Central Italy) intercomparing different strategies for each methodological step (hard and fuzzy classification, mean and Gaussian degradation, uni- and multivariate regression) identified an optimum methodology composed of fuzzy classification, mean degradation, and multivariate regression procedures.

In recent years, the damage from droughts to the environment and economies of some countries was extensive, and the death toll of livestock and wildlife was unprecedented. Weather data often come from a very sparse meteorological network, incomplete and/or not always available in good time to enable relatively accurate and timely large scale drought detection and monitoring. Therefore, data obtained from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor on board the NOAA polar-orbiting satellites have been studied as a tool for drought monitoring and climate impact assessment in southern Africa. The AVHRR-based vegetation condition index (VCI) and temperature condition index (TCI) developed recently were used in this study because in other parts of the globe they showed goon results when used for drought detection and tracking, monitoring excessive soil wetness, assessment of weather impacts on vegetation, and evaluation of vegetation health and productivity. The results clearly show that temporal and spatial characteristics of drought in southern Africa can be detected, tracked, and mapped by the VCI and TCI indices. These results were numerically validated by in situ data such as precipitation, atmospheric anomaly fields, and agricultural crop yield. In the later case, it lans found that usable corn yield scenarios can be constructed from the VCI and TCI at approximately 6 (in some regions up to 13) weeks prior to harvest time. These indices can be especially beneficial when used together with ground data. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.', 'NOAA, Satellite Res Lab, Camp Springs, MD 20746 USA.

The investigation was based on laboratory spectra of air-dried samples from soil profiles from southeastern Brazil, an experiment for the chemical removal of organic mater, and on a wetting process of the soil samples. The relationships were evaluated for a general soil line and for the individual lines of some soil types, under air-dried condition, through the determination of the line parameters, dispersion statistics, and principal components analysis (PCA). Soil lines obtained with broad or narrow NIR bands positioned at shorter wavelengths, and consequently at smaller distance differences between the pair of bands, presented better fitted lines than the ones obtained with NIR bands located at longer wavelengths and at larger distances. compared with the broad bands, spectrally better positioned narrow NIR/R bands produced closely similar results because of the propitious effect of the larger bandwidth. However, unconventional NIR/NIR bands presented better fitted lines than the R/NIR bands. The inherent interplay between organic matter and iron oxides is accountable for the variability in th linear parameters of the individual lines. The general line for the samples considered is composed of nonparallel segments of the different soil types, with a tendency for a increased obliquity in the low albedo soils. Soil types with very low albedo present line slope values below 1, poor correlations, but small root mean square (RMS) values, whereas soil types with moderate and high albedo present line slope values above 1, strong correlations,and large RMS values. The former is rich in organic matter and iron oxides whereas the latter has more transparent components, such as quarts, or less opaque substances. However, in soil types with a lesser content of organic matter, the iron spectral features are enhanced and variations in the shape of the spectra are produced because of the larger reflectance increase in the R band than in the NIR interval. The maximum spectral contrast resulting from this compositional interplay is assessed when the NIR band is positioned at longer wavelengths. Similarly, soil wetting introduces nonlinear spectral changes that also affect the characteristics of the soil lines. The analysis of field measured reflectance spectra derived from an experiment designed to monitor the growth of a bean crop indicates hat the shift of the NIR band towards shorter wavelengths produces not only better fitted soil lines but also stronger vegetation signals. The enhancement of the vegetation signal obtained with the displacement of the NIR band results from the steeper descending slope towards longer wavelengths of the NIR plateau observed in the vegetation spectra. The results place constraints on a unsupported choice of bands to derive vegetation indices, especially those of the advanced hyperspectral imaging sensors. the most recommended pair of NIR-R bands for crop vegetation indices is the one from LANDSAT-TM, closely followed by JERS-OPS and SPOT-HRV, or from narrow NIR-R bands positioned within these ranges at spectral intervals not affected by atmospheric attenuation.

In the inverse mode, LEAFMOD computes the total within-leaf absorption and scattering coefficient profiles from measured reflectance, transmittance,and leaf thickness. Inversions with simulated data demonstrate that the model appropriately decouples scattering and adsorption within the leaf, producing fresh leaf absorption profiles with peaks at locations corresponding to the major absorption feature for water and chlorophyll. Experiments with empirical input data demonstrate that the amplitude of the fresh leaf absorption coefficient profile in the visible wavebands is correlated with pigment concentrations as determined by wet chemical analyses,and that absorption features in the near-infrared wavebands related to various other biochemical constituents can be identified in a dry-leaf absorption profile.

This study is one of the first to develop separate passive microwave snow algorithms for North American and Eurasia by including parameters that consider the effects of variations in forest cover sand crystal size on microwave brightness temperature. A new algorithm (GSFC 1996) is compared to a prototype algorithm (Chang et al., 1987) and to a snow depth climatology (SDC), which for this study is considered to be a standard reference or baseline. It is shown that the GSFC 1996 algorithm compares much more favorably to the SDC than does the Chang et al. (1987) algorithm. For example, in North American in February there is a 15% difference between the GSFC 1996 algorithm and the SDC, but with the Chang et al. (1987) algorithm the difference is greater than 50%. In Eurasia, also in February, there is only a 1.3% difference between the GSFC 1996 algorithm and the SDC, whereas with the Chang et al. (1987) algorithm the difference is about 20%. As expected, differences tend to be less when the snow cover extent is greater, particularly for Eurasia. The GSFC 1996 algorithm performs better in North America in each month than does the Chang et al. (1987) algorithm. This is also the case in Eurasia, except in April and May when the Chang et al. (1987) algorithm is in closer accord to the SDC than is the GSFC 1996 algorithm.

To correctly determine the peak center and to evaluate the relative contributions of the bands in the total fluorescence spectrum, the steady state LICF spectra were analyzed with a nonlinear iterative procedure using Gaussian, Lorentzian, Pearson, Voigt, and exponential Gaussian spectral functions. It was observed that curve fitting performed by using two Gaussian peaks centered at 690 and 730 nm usually fits well to the chlorophyll fluorescence spectra. After curve fitting, the mean peak centers of the red and far-red chlorophyll bands of control plants were observed at 688.2 and 725.4 nm, respectively. A blue shift of as much as 9 nm in the peak position of the far-red band was observed with nutrient stress, whereas the shift in position of the red band was only of the order of a few nanometers. Further, the width at half maximum of the far-red band was found to increase by as much as 20 nm with nutrient stress. Curve fitting could thus separate out the red and far-red fluorescence spectra from a pair of normally distributed curves centered at 690 and 730 nm wavelengths, thereby differentiating the effects due to reabsorption from those due directly to changes in photosynthetic electron transport. The F690/F730 fluorescence intensity ratio obtained from curve-fitted parameters was found to be more sensitive to plant stress than were fluorescence values alone. Results indicate that a curve-fitting analysis of LICF spectra using Gaussian spectral functions is a very useful and sensitive method of evaluating spectral features from a statistically point of view and for accurate determination of contributions from constituent bands in the whole leaf fluorescence spectrum.

Biases occur whenever there is a correlation between the viewing angle and the temperatures of subpixel mountainsides, such as when the satellite\'s view directly faces the most brightly sunlit slopes. This paper reports simulations of this satellite-view bias effect for mountain terrain in central and southwestern Colorado and the southern Sierra Nevada in California. Surface temperatures for the simulations were computed by using a mesoscale numerical weather prediction model with a parameterization for terrain features that are at a scale finer than the model grid resolution. The representation of terrain in the simulations was based on elevation data with high resolution (30 m) from U.S. Geological Survey Digital Elevation Map data sets. Biases as large as 9 C degrees were found while assuming a satellite sensor resolution of 14 km. Even larger biases were found with finer sensor resolutions. These biases are substantially larger than those that had previously been found from modeling with terrain data at about 90 m resolution (3\'\' latitude/longitude) from the Defense Mapping Agency. The simulations suggest that satellite-view biases could cause substantial local errors when surface temperature retrievals are used for climate diagnosis, weather analysis, soil moisture estimation, or geologic mapping.

A previously developed simple surface bidirectional reflectance model was expanded for use in this inversion process. In the inversion process, a multidimensional optimization scheme is used to obtain a set of model parameters that minimizes the difference between modeled and observed reflectances. The effect of the slumber of data points used in the inversion on the accuracy of the model inversion was investigated with ground based hemispheric scan measurements of surface spectral reflectances over a tallgrass prairie in Kansas. The result shows that the total inversion error consists of minimum or systematic error and ambiguity error The former result from uncertainties in the accuracies of the model and measurements, whereas the latter is caused by the ambiguity of the model inversion when a limited number of data points are used The systematic error is independent of the number of data points, whereas the ambiguity error decreases sharply with increasing data points when the num ber of data points is small (fewer than about seven). An inversion method with appropriate data grouping applied to the reflectance data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer is shown to improve estimates of surface parameters over the grassland site.

System design and polarized bidirectional reflectance measurements from a soil sample and SiO2 spherical particles are discussed in this work. It is shown that polarization information in the plane of incidence is useful for identifying certain scattering mechanisms associated with soil reflectance. This is because the like-polarized intensity, I(VV), is influenced by single-scattered light and the cross-polarized intensity, I(HV), is strongly influenced by multiple-scattered light. For example, comparable levels of I(VV) and I(HV), indicated that the reflectance of soils, especially those made up of translucent particles, is dominated by significant multiple scattering because single scattering causes minimal depolarization in the plane of incidence. Furthermore, I(HV) is less dependent on the illumination angle (hence, more Lambertian) than I(VV), indicating that the scattering mechanisms which caused them are not the same.', 'HOUSTON ADV RES CTR,THE WOODLANDS,TX.

Acceptable results, approximately +/0.02 reflectance (1-sigma-RMS), were achieved based on an RTC with appropriate simulated atmospheres.

Two hybrid approaches, which combined the image-based nature of DOS with the precision of an RTC, provided sufficient accuracy and simplicity to warrant consideration for use on an operational basis.

The spatial variability of the broad (8-14-mu-m) emissivity was measured over an overall homogeneous area with a movable measuring system. Spectral ground radiances were also measured at many places, the spatial average of which is assumed to represent the effective spectral ground radiance. The effective surface temperature is obtained through renormalization of the effective emissivity signature over the RMS broad band emissivity previously measured. The method is shown to produce the effective surface temperature with an accuracy better than 1 K, without any direct temperature measurement. From the effective signature, the channel emissivities pertaining to a given instrument can be calculated. This has been done for NOAA-11/AVHRR Channels 4 and 5. A preliminary test was made to try and validate nighttime satellite-derived surface temperature by comparison with field effective temperature. The image was acquired during the field experiment. The first result of this attempt is encouraging, although only qualitative because of standard atmospheric corrections. Orientation of future work for better accuracy and reliability is discussed as well.RP LABED, J (通讯作者)，ECOLE NATL SUPER PHYS STRASBOURG, LSIT, GRTR, SCI TELEDETECT SPATIALE GRP, 7 RUE UNIV, F-6700 STRASBOURG, FRANCE.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 14, 57, 62, 0, 5, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Experimental values of bihemispherical reflectance can be obtained by exitance and irradiance measurements performed with 2-pi steradian radiometers provided that the noncosine response of optics, which could strongly affect the retrieved bihemispherical reflectance as a function of the sun zenith, is accounted for in data analysis.  By modeling exitance and irradiance measurable by a 2-pi steradian radiometer, accounting for the angular transmission function of optics and sky radiance nonisotropy, theoretical factors have been computed to correct the bihemispherical reflectance obtained from exitance and irradiance measurements.  Simulation of measurements related to different Antarctic field conditions shows the low sensitivity of the computed correcting factors to the atmospheric optical thickness at sun zenith less than 75-degrees.  This fact suggests the use of climatological data in computations, avoiding additional in situ measurements, which could reduce the operational use of the correction methodology.  Multispectral measurements taken in Victoria Land, with a radiometer working in the same bands as the Landsat MultiSpectral Scanner (MSS), have been elaborated following the proposed correction scheme.  Bihemispherical reflectance of fresh snow, which could have an unreliable value higher than 1.0 at high sun zenith angles when computed with exitance and irradiance taken by noncosine collector optics, has shown good agreement with published data.RP ZIBORDI, G (通讯作者)，NATL RES COUNCIL,INST STUDY GEOPHYS & ENVIRONM METHODOL,VIA EMILIA EST 770,I-41100 MODENA,ITALY.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 15, 3, 3, 0, 2, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

One radiometer was located within the shadow of the conifer tree; the other was placed outside of the shadow.  The path length associated with each radiometric measurement was calculated by fitting a simple conical geometric model to each tree from measurements of tree height and width.  The radiometric measurements are best fit by a binomial model in which sunlight is either unobstructed or fully attenuated, and analysis shows that the gap probability, which is taken as the mean of the binomial, fits a negative exponential function of path length quite well.

This, the so-called mixed pixel problem, has always been a property of scanner-type imaging, but its effect on the image classification process is arguably still a major problem to deriving accurate land cover maps, in spite of the increasing spatial resolution of sensors.  This paper explores use of a fuzzy classifier to determine the constituent land cover components of pixels in a suburban environment.  The classifier derives a measure of the fuzzy membership of a pixel belonging to each land cover class.  For some land cover types including water, wetland, and woodland, a high correlation is shown between the fuzzy membership values for a pixel and the portion of the area of that pixel which belongs to a particular land cover type.  The correlation for other land cover types is statistically significant but qualitatively poorer, and may indicate a lack of signature purity.  The results show that the fuzzy classifier may enable the extraction of information about individual pixels and about subpixel phenomena not addressed by other classifiers.RP FISHER, PF (通讯作者)，KENT STATE UNIV,DEPT GEOG,KENT,OH 44242, USA.RI Fisher, Peter F/K-1735-2013', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 26, 124, 126, 0, 10, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Globally, increasing industrial agriculture is driving crop productivity, with increasing surface water and groundwater being withdrawn for irrigation. This study mapped center pivot irrigation systems (CPIS), which are indicators of intensified industrial agriculture and large-scale investment in agriculture, with satellite data using a convolutional neural network in global arid areas. A cascade instance segmentation network was adopted, and both the convolutional block attention module technique and PointRend technique were used to increase the performance of off-the-shelf algorithms. Geospatial analysis methods were used to derive the relationships between CPIS and freshwater resources. Overall there were about 10.26 million hectares (Mha) of irrigated areas equipped with CPIS in global arid areas in 2021, and there were 4.41 Mha of CPISequipped irrigated fields added in the past twenty years at a relative increase of 75% compared with those at the beginning of this century. Although the largest extent of increased CPIS-equipped irrigated fields was in North America, the other five continents had higher relative increases, with Africa having the highest relative growth of 253%. The analysis of spatial relationships between CPIS and freshwater resources indicates that the stress on freshwater resources from industrial agriculture is intensifying in arid areas globally. Overall, the world\'s arid regions with the highest water stress from CPIS are mostly located in western North America, northern Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula. The results facilitate a better understanding of the current status of freshwater stress and ecosystem sustainability in relation to the development of agricultural intensification in global arid areas. The outcomes support governments to judge better the environmental consequences of agricultural modernization and further help them make balanced agriculture and water management policies.', '[Chen, Fen; Zhao, Haojie; Fan, Tao; Xu, Wenbo] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Resources & Environm, Chengdu, Peoples R China.

Despite its importance, global SWE measurements that are accurate, consistent, and at sufficiently high spatiotemporal resolutions are not currently available. L-band interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques have been used to measure SWE at local to regional scales, and two upcoming L-band SAR satellite missions have renewed interest in these techniques to provide regular SWE measurements at the global scale. However, previous research demonstrating the capabilities of L-band InSAR-SWE measurement has been limited to mountain or tundra snowpack regimes. Here we examine the feasibility of applying the same techniques over a prairie snowpack, which are typically characterized by shallow snow depths (mean snow depth of 0.22 m in this study), exposed agricultural vegetation, and high spatial variability over short distances. Our study area in central Montana, USA (47.060,-109.951) was a validation site for NASA SnowEx 2021, as part of the UAVSAR snow timeseries. Airborne L-band SAR imagery was acquired by the UAVSAR platform while concurrent snow measurements were collected using uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)-based LiDAR, UAV-based photogrammetry, and ground-based manual techniques. This validation dataset enables an investigation of the effects of sub-pixel snow cover heterogeneity and exposed agricultural vegetation stubble on SAR data and the resulting SWE estimations. Results based on repeated application of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test show that UAVSAR VV phase change is sensitive to differences in snow cover but relatively unaffected by differences in agricultural stubble height. However, we did not find similarly definitive results when we used the same phase change data to estimate SWE. Although broad spatial patterns were similar in both LiDAR-derived and InSAR-derived SWE estimates, considerable differences in the two estimates were apparent in areas with large sub-pixel snow depth variability. Our results indicate that additional work is necessary to derive accurate SWE estimates in prairie environments. Regular measurements from L-band SAR satellites will provide an excellent opportunity to refine InSAR-based snow estimation techniques over shallow, heterogeneous snowpacks.', '[Palomaki, Ross T.; Sproles, Eric A.] Montana State Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.

Demonstrations with measurements from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua further confirm the robustness of NN eta, where reasonable spatial distribution and seasonality of eta in the global oceans can be acquired by NN eta. High and low eta values are observed in the oligotrophic gyres and the coastal zones, respectively, which are consistent with the current understanding of eta distribution concluded from theoretic analysis and repeated field measurements in the global ocean. Implementation of NN eta to 19-year MODIS monthly composite measurements from 2003 to 2021 reveals strong seasonal variations of eta in most of the global ocean, but the decadal changes of eta are insignificant in the majority (similar to 82.2%) of the global ocean.

Our study reveals that the global mean I-s growth rate is 0.156 degrees C/decade. We further examine I-s change associated with per 1% impervious land growth (denoted as beta) in each city throughout the research period and during different periods. The global mean beta is 0.018 +/- 0.025 degrees C/% (mean +/- 1 standard deviation) for the whole period, with greater values in humid than in arid climates; and the beta may change during different periods, e.g., it has more than tripled when urban impervious land exceeds 30%, indicating the spatiotemporally divergent impacts of urbanization on I-s trends across global cities. The spatial variations in beta across global cities are well correlated with rural vegetation abundance and precipitation but not with urban population. Among these three factors, rural vegetation abundance possesses the greatest standardized regression coefficient of partial least-squares model, signifying the critical role of biome background in regulating beta. The finding implies that future urbanization over densely vegetated regions should be more carefully and strategically planned due to the greater urbanization-induced surface warming effect.', '[Li, Long; Zhan, Wenfeng; Wang, Dazhong; Huang, Fan; Fu, Huyan; Li, Jiufeng; Liu, Zihan; Du, Huilin; Wang, Shasha] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Geog Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

As a result, the systematic generation of annual regional, national, and global LULC map products derived from the classification of satellite imagery data have become critical inputs for multiple scientific disciplines. The importance of quantifying pixel-level uncertainty to improve the robustness of downstream analyses has long been acknowledged but this practice is still not widely adopted in the generation of these LULC products. The lack of uncertainty quantification is likely due to the fact that most approaches that have been put forward for this task are too computationally intensive for large-scale analysis (e.g., bootstrapping). In this article, we describe how conformal statistics can be used to quantify pixel-level uncertainty in a way that is not computationally intensive, is statistically rigorous despite relying on few assumptions, and can be used together with any classification algorithm that produces class probabilities. Our simulation results show how the size of the predictive sets created by conformal statistics can be used as an indicator of classification uncertainty at the pixel level. Our analysis based on data from the Brazilian Amazon reveals that both forest and water have high certainty whereas pasture and the \"natural (other)\" category have substantial uncertainty. This information can guide additional ground-truth data collection and the resulting raster combining the LULC classification with the uncertainty results can be used to communicate in a transparent way to downstream users which classified pixels have high or low uncertainty. Given the importance of systematic LULC maps and uncertainty quantification, we believe that this approach will find wide use in the remote sensing community.', '[Valle, Denis] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Fisheries & Geomatics Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.

This is because spectral signals detected from space are mainly from cloud tops and contain minimal information on cloud vertical structures owing to limited penetration. This paper presents a new algorithm for retrieving CBH from radiometer mea-surements, utilizing an improved characterization for mutable cloud water contents (CWCs). This was achieved by introducing a variable named effective CWC (ECWC) to represent the vertically varying CWC; and subse-quently investigating the sensitivity of ECWC to both cloud and environmental properties. Considering these characteristics, a systematic ECWC lookup table (LUT) was created based on collocated active and passive sat-ellite observations. We then converted the existing cloud water path (CWP; kg/m2) to cloud geometric thickness (CGT; km) via the developed LUT, and calculated CBH by subtracting the CGT estimates from conventional cloud top height (CTH) retrievals. The algorithm was tested using observations from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) as examples, and was evaluated using active measurements from the CloudSat and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CAL -IPSO) satellites and a ground-based Ka-band radar. Overall, our CBH results agreed closely with the active ob-servations, with mean biases of 0.11 & PLUSMN; 1.93 km for MODIS and -0.12 & PLUSMN; 2.34 km for AHI in single-layer cloud cases. Despite the natural limitations on retrieving CBHs using passive radiometers, the proposed algorithm achieves retrieval accuracies comparable to those of operational CTH products. Moreover, this algorithm works for both single-layer and overlapping clouds, and can be extended to other passive radiometers by reconstructing the LUT. Such accurate CBH information derived from high-resolution passive radiometers would greatly improve our understanding of cloud vertical distributions; and could play an important role in studies of cloud radiative effects and the aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions.', '[Tan, Zhonghui; Ma, Shuo; Ai, Weihua] Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Meteorol & Oceanog, Changsha 410073, Peoples R China.

Although various prognostic models relying on environmental variables of temperature and photoperiod have been developed for spring phenology, comprehensive ecosystem-scale evaluations over large landscapes and long-time periods remain lacking. Further, environmental variables other than temperature and photoperiod might also importantly constrain spring phenology modelling but remain under-investigation. To address these issues, we leveraged around 20-years datasets of environmental variables (from Daymet and GLDAS products) and the spring phenology metric (i.e., the greenup date) respectively derived from MODIS and PhenoCams across 108 sites in the Northern and Eastern United States. We firstly cross-compared MODIS-derived greenup date with official PhenoCams product with high accuracy (R2 = 0.70). Then, we evaluated the three prognostic models (i.e., Growing Degree Date (GDD), Sequential (SEQ) and optimality-based (OPT)) with MODIS-derived spring phenology, assessed the model residuals and their associations with soil moisture, rainfall, and solar radiation, and revised the two photoperiod-relevant models (SEQ, OPT) by replacing the daylength variable with solar radiation, which was found to contribute the most to model residuals. We found that 1) all models demonstrated good capability in characterizing spring phenology, with OPT performing the best (RMSE = 8.04 +/- 5.05 days), followed by SEQ (RMSE = 10.57 +/- 7.77 days) and GDD (RMSE = 10.84 +/- 8.42 days), 2) all models displayed high model residuals showing tight correlation with solar radiation (r = 0.45-0.75), and 3) the revised models that included solar radiation significantly performed better with an RMSE reduction by 22.08%. Such results are likely because solar radiation better constrains early growing season plant photosynthesis than photoperiod, supporting the hypothesis of spring phenology as an adaptive strategy to maximize photosynthetic carbon gain (approximated by solar radiation) while minimizing frost damage risk (captured by temperature). Collectively, our study reveals the underappreciated importance of solar radiation in constraining spring phenology of temperate ecosystems, and suggests ways to improve spring phenology modelling and other phenology-related ecological processes.', '[Gu, Yating; Zhao, Yingyi; Guo, Zhengfei; Zhang, Kun; Wang, Jing; Lee, Calvin K.

In the extended SW-TES algorithm with considering urban geometry effect, the brightness temperature at ground level was obtained using the SW algorithm, and the LST and LSE were retrieved simultaneously by using the TES algorithm. The results indicate that LST (LSE) retrieved by the extended SW-TES algorithm with urban geometry effect correction has generally lower (higher) values than that without urban geometry effect correction. The LST differences mostly vary from 0.3 K to 1.2 K, whereas the LSE differences are mainly concentrated between-0.01 and -0.06. Furthermore, the root mean squared error (RMSE) between LST/LSE retrieved by the extended SW-TES algorithm with urban geometry effect correction and LST/LSE obtained from the ECOSTRESS level-2 LST/LSE product decrease with the increase of sky view factor (SVF). The largest RMSE is approximately 1.6 K for LST and 0.03 for LSE in the SVF of 0.1, which represents an urban pixel surrounded by high buildings within its adjacent pixels. There are no evident differ-ences between LST/LSE retrieved by the extended SW-TES algorithm with urban geometry effect correction using five and three ECOSTRESS TIR bands. The LST differences are mainly concentrated between-0.2 K and 0.2 K, whereas the LSE differences mostly range from 0.001 to 0.004.

Nighttime mea-surements from spaceborne lidar increase knowledge of the diurnal variability of ocean optical properties, while measurements in polar regions fill the gaps that passive measurements of ocean color may leave in these areas. However, due to non-ideal instrumental characteristics, errors may occur during retrieval of the ocean optical properties that are derived directly from CALIOP\'s measured signals. These errors are caused by the transient response (TR) function of the detectors and the polarization crosstalk (CT) between the polarization beam splitters. However, there is no study that integrates and explicitly describes both the required corrections. In addition, the published physics-based methods for retrieving the particulate backscatter coefficient (bbp) from CALIOP use an empirical linear relationship between bbp and the backscatter coefficient at 180 degrees b(pi) without considering the spatial and temporal variability associated with the conversion coefficient. In this study, after both effects are eliminated through TR deconvolution and CT correction, an innovative deep neural network (DNN) approach is proposed to retrieve bbp and particulate organic carbon (POC) from CALIOP. The DNN is trained with the CALIOP total ocean column-integrated depolarization ratio and subsurface column-integrated perpendicular backscatter data, which are combined with the collocated daytime MODIS bbp and POC prod-ucts. Once the DNN has been trained with the daytime MODIS product, measurements can be derived from CALIOP in conditions not covered by MODIS data, such as at night or in polar regions. Compared to published physics-based methods, this approach does not require diffuse attenuation coefficients, nor are additional as-sumptions regarding the conversion coefficient between bbp and the backscatter coefficient at 180 degrees b(pi) neces-sary. A comparison of global total depolarization ratios, which are calculated before and after TR deconvolution and CT correction, indicates the necessity and efficacy of correction, and the preliminary results show that the oceanic properties derived from CALIOP via this DNN-based approach agree better with the MODIS products than those derived with the traditional physics-based methods. The use of lidar measurements to derive bbp and POC without relying on passively acquired data is of great interest to the ocean color community.', '[Zhang, Zhenhua; Chen, Peng; Pan, Delu] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Guangzhou, 1119 Haibin Rd, Guangzhou 511458, Peoples R China.

Here, we present an improved SBAS-type algorithm suitable for processing a large stack of SAR images at an arbitrary resolution. We develop a new pair selection strategy that applies dyadic downsampling combined with widely used Delaunay Triangulation to identify an optimal set of interferometric pairs that minimize systematic errors due to short-lived signals and closure errors. We develop and apply a novel statistical framework that selects elite pixels accounting for distributed and permanent scatterers. Also, we implement a new tropospheric error correction that takes advantage of smooth 2D splines to identify and remove error components with fractal-like structures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms by applying them to 3 large datasets of Sentinel-1 SAR images measuring non-linear surface deformation over various terrains.

Efficient and easy-to-use 3D radiative transfer models are required by remote sensing inversion and many validation applications. Extensive efforts have been made to improve the computational effi-ciency, accuracy, and useability of 3D radiative transfer models. This study focuses on the abstraction of canopies for 3D radiative transfer simulations by proposing a lightweight boundary-based description of leaf clusters (B-cluster) to ease the creation of 3D scenes while keeping the simulation as accurate as possible. B -cluster partitions a tree crown into sub-crown leaf clusters and abstracts each of them into a turbid medium enclosed by a complex and tight boundary, while terrain and branches are described with precise mesh surfaces. The radiative transfer simulation within B-cluster has been developed based on an efficient Monte Carlo path-tracing algorithm and implemented in the LargE-Scale remote sensing data and image Simulation framework (LESS) model by considering the presence of both turbid medium and surface scattering. The performance of the model was assessed by comparing with original LESS version, which describes all landscape elements with mesh surfaces (here called M-surface approach), and with a uniform voxel-based approach (U-voxel) in terms of the multiangle bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) as well as with pixel -wise images. Results show that B-cluster is highly consistent with M-surface in abstract canopies (mean normalized absolute BRF differences delta) < 2%) and in realistic forest stand (delta) < 5% at 5-m resolution) with considerably reduced requirements for computational memory. Compared with U-voxel, B-cluster is also more robust and better at describing canopy structures with different levels of detail. B-cluster enables to quickly construct accurate 3D scenes with reduced requirements of computational resources. It is also a unified and scale-adaptive approach that can describe crowns as simple as geometric primitives and as complex as explicitly described meshes.

This study investigates the potential of simulating the Sentinel-1A observations and constraining the coefficients of the water cloud model (WCM) at the regional scale based on a theoretical microwave scattering model named Tor Vergata model. The Tor Vergata discrete scattering model is firstly calibrated at both site-and regional-scale to find a single set of model parameters for capturing the Sentinel-1A observations at the regional scale. Sub-sequently, the coupled WCM and Oh model is calibrated at the regional scale based on three strategies, i.e., using either the calibrated Tor Vergata simulations or the Sentinel-1A observations, or with the assumption that the sigma o only comes from the vegetation contribution during the peak growth period. The investigation is conducted in a Tibetan meadow ecosystem configured with a long-term regional-scale soil moisture monitoring network. The results show the optimized parameter values obtained for the Tor Vergata model are consistent with each other based on both calibration methods, leading to comparable performances in simulating well the Sentinel-1A observations and scattering components. These results demonstrate the transferability of model parameters under similar land condition and the feasibility of simulating the regional-scale sigma o based on a single set of model parameters using the Tor Vergata model. The sigma o simulated by the coupled WCM and Oh model based on the three calibration strategies are comparable to each other and well agree with the calibrated Tor Vergata simulations as well as Sentinel-1A observations. However, the traditional calibration method using the Sentinel-1A observations tends to produce unreasonable WCM coefficients and thus unrealistic simulation of vegetation transmissivity. Above deficiencies are largely addressed by other two calibration strategies, whereby the first one preserves the physical mechanism of the Tor Vergata model and reduces the computation cost, and the assumption made by the other strategy may provide a new sight to solve the unknown WCM coefficients. These positive results warrant further investigation for developing new parameterization of WCM to improve soil moisture retrieval at the regional scale based on active microwave remote sensing.', '[Bai, Xiaojing] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.

Wheat and barley are two major cereal crops cultivated as the first and fourth largest grain crops across the globe. The variations in spectral temporal profile of both crops are generally insignificant at small scales and therefore the two crops are phenologically fairly clearly separated; however, at large scale areas the variance of phenological parameters increases for both crops due to the effects of various climatic and orographic factors which adversely influences discrimination of wheat and barley. Additionally, wheat and barley are usually cultivated as both spring and winter or early and late season crops in some areas, making it more difficult to distinguish them. Therefore, developing a new method based on remote sensing data for effective discrimination of wheat and barley is an important necessity in the field of precision agriculture. To this end, this research presents a new phenology-based method to discriminate barley from wheat. In this study, Sentinel-2 (S2) time-series data of a study site in Iran (Markazi) and two sites in the USA (Idaho and North California), are employed. Spectral reflectance values of wheat and barley are examined during the growing season and a new spectral-temporal feature is successfully developed for automatic identification of the barley heading date. The Relief-f algorithm is then employed to select appropriate spectral features of S2 to distinguish wheat from barley at the heading date. Finally, generated spectral features at the heading date are used as input to Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) to produce barley and wheat maps.

However, validation studies employing syn-chronous and independent in-situ instantaneous shorelines at scale are limited. Thanks to a unique dataset of 47 synchronous UAV photogrammetric surveys in 15 coastal locations in Victoria, Australia, over 3 years, we validated Sentinel-2 instantaneous subpixel shorelines extracted using the most common water indices, CoastSat and a tidal-balanced convolutional neural network (Unet+++). We assessed the accuracy of the water level estimation using 9 wave run-up models and wave data sourced from a nearshore wave buoy network, a regional hindcast model and a global altimeter wave dataset. This paper also presents the first validation of Deep Learning-derived shorelines using synchronous independent in-situ data. We found the best overall performance and least threshold-sensitive shoreline extraction approach to be the WI index, whilst NDWI had the poorest performances despite being the most utilized across the literature. We found that the thresholdless Unet+++ solution coupled with an ensemble wave run-up model and the altimeter wave data is an adequate trade-off in terms of accuracy, adaptability and wave data access for global scale shoreline studies.Moreover, we highlighted the very high spatial variability of beach-scale shoreline extraction performances and found that generally, the best SDS extractor only performs best along 30-40% of a coastline. Our results suggest that future satellite-derived shoreline approaches should investigate the relationships between scene -dependent variables and shoreline accuracies in order to better understand the causes of beach-scale perfor-mance variations and increase the accuracy of satellite-derived shorelines.', '[Pucino, Nicolas; Young, Mary; Ierodiaconou, Daniel] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Warrnambool, Vic 3280, Australia.

However, existing fusion methods usually generate multispectral band products by predicting each spectral band separately, so the useful information of spectral autocorrelation within the spectrum has been ignored and waits to be exploited. To address this issue, we propose a novel spatiotemporal fusion method, the spatiotemporal Fusion Incorrporting Spectral autocorrelaTion (FIRST) model, to fully utilize the multiple spectral bands of surface reflectance products. Compared with other fusion methods, the model has three distinct ad-vantages: (1) it utilizes spectral autocorrelation in a many-to-many regression framework that simultaneously inputs and predicts multispectral bands without the collinearity effect; (2) it maintains high fusion accuracy when the spatiotemporal variation is large with acceptable computational efficiency; and (3) it can produce robust results even with input images contaminated by haze and thin clouds. We tested the FIRST model at several experimental sites and compared it with four typical methods, the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) model, the regression model Fitting, spatial Filtering and residual Compensation (Fit-FC) model and the enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM). The results demonstrate that FIRST yields better overall performance for its simple and effective technical principles.

However, whether TLs change water sources and alleviate water stress for plants is unknown, and previous knowledge about regional TL effects on surrounding vegetation greenness is rare. Here, we synthesized field investigations, stable isotopes, and remote sensing images from an unmanned aerial vehicle and Sentinel-2 to determine the effects of over 160,000 TLs on their surrounding growing-season normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The results are as follows: 1) With the largest water source shifting from 0 to 10 cm soil water to lake water, TL-affected plants can grow better than TL-unaffected plants, which is associated with soil texture and the development stage of the lake. 2) Overall, the median affecting distances of TLs on surrounding surface moisture (tasseled cap wetness, TCW) and NDVI were 50 m with their 25th-75th percentiles of 40-70 m and 40-60 m, respectively; compared with the unaffected areas, TLs increased peripheral TCW but reduced NDVI with their median change rates of 19.84% and -10.42%, respectively. 3) However, the nonlinear response of NDVI to the TCW gradient was dominant, which was featured by a local peak NDVI due to the coexistence of the physical destruction and improved water availability, and both TCW and NDVI at the peak area were explicitly larger than those at the unaffected area. 4) Along southeast-northwest environmental gradients (topographic, climatic, and edaphic factors), the affected range and degradation ratio of NDVI were greater under drier climate, larger lake area, sand-richer soil, fewer soil nutrients, and worse vegetation type (e.g., alpine desert). Briefly, the net adverse consequence on NDVI suggests that TLs primarily represent permafrost-supported ecosystems deteriorating, but the clear nonlinear effects advance the knowledge of this landscape; additionally, these local vegetation changes can help interpret the regional greening/browning and promote the research on the biogeochemical interaction among TL, soil, and plants under climate warming and permafrost thawing.', '[Deng, Yuanhong; Li, Xiaoyan; Shi, Fangzhong; Chai, Linna; Zhao, Shaojie; Ding, Mengkai; Liao, Qiwen] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

Here, we developed a novel inversion algorithm for deriving POC in inland water based on remote sensing and geochemical isotopes, which is summarized as follows. First, we developed empirical relationships between the phytoplankton absorption coefficient and endogenous POC concentration (CendPOC) and between the nonalgal particulate absorption coefficient and terrestrial POC concentration (CterPOC). Second, based on the valid re-lationships, semianalytical retrieval models were established to estimate CendPOC and CterPOC. Third, the pro-portions of endogenous POC (RendPOC) and terrestrial POC (RterPOC) to the total POC concentration (CPOC) were derived using a three-band empirical model. Finally, CPOC was obtained by dividing CendPOC by RendPOC (RendPOC & GE; 0.5) or dividing CterPOC by RterPOC (RendPOC < 0.5). Validation with field data shows that our proposed algo-rithm can accurately derive CPOC (0-20 mg/L), with a root mean square deviation (RMSD), median bias (MB), median absolute percent difference (MAPD), and median ratio (MR) of 1.15 mg/L,-0.05 mg/L, 24%, and 0.98, respectively.

At the same time, surface melt can form surface types that are spectrally similar to blue ice, especially at low elevations. These are termed melt -induced blue ice areas. Both types of blue ice are sensitive indicators of climate change. Satellite remote sensing is a powerful technique to retrieve the spatial extent of blue ice areas and their variation in time. Yet, existing satellite-derived blue ice area products are either mono-temporal for the entire Antarctic ice sheet, or multi-temporal for a limited area. Here, we present FABIAN, a product of blue ice fraction over Antarctica, derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) archive covering the period 2000-2021. A spectral mixture analysis (SMA) in Google Earth Engine, based on a careful selection of end -member spectra, accurately reconstructs the reflectance observed by MODIS in blue ice areas. Based on a vali-dation with contemporaneous Sentinel-2 images, FABIAN has a root mean square error in blue ice fraction of approximately 10% -20% in wind-induced blue ice areas, and 20% -30% in melt-induced blue ice areas across six selected test sites in the coastal East Antarctic ice sheet. FABIAN is challenged in regions with shallow melt streams and lakes, since their spectral profiles are similar to those from blue ice areas in MODIS bands. For further analyses and applications, FABIAN holds the potential for (1) deriving annual blue ice area maps, (2) distinguishing between wind-and melt-induced blue ice types, (3) evaluating and correcting (regional) climate models, and (4) analyzing temporal variations in blue ice abundance and exposure.', '[Hu, Zhongyang; Munneke, Peter Kuipers; Broeke, Michiel van den] Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res Utrecht IMAU, Princetonplein 5, NL-3584 CC Utrecht, Netherlands.

However, cloud contamination and the tradeoff between the spatial and temporal resolutions greatly impede the access to highquality thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing data. Despite the massive efforts made to solve these dilemmas, it is still difficult to generate LST estimates with concurrent spatial completeness and a high spatio-temporal resolution. Land surface models (LSMs) can be used to simulate gapless LST with a high temporal resolution, but this usually comes with a low spatial resolution. In this paper, we present an integrated temperature fusion framework for satellite-observed and LSM-simulated LST data to map gapless LST at a 60-m spatial resolution and halfhourly temporal resolution. The global linear model (GloLM) model and the diurnal land surface temperature cycle (DTC) model are respectively performed as preprocessing steps for sensor and temporal normalization between the different LST data. The Landsat LST, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST, and Community Land Model Version 5.0 (CLM 5.0)-simulated LST are then fused using a filter-based spatiotemporal integrated fusion model. Evaluations were implemented in an urban-dominated region (the city of Wuhan in China) and a natural-dominated region (the Heihe River Basin in China), in terms of accuracy, spatial variability, and diurnal temporal dynamics. Results indicate that the fused LST under all-weather conditions is highly consistent with actual Landsat LST data (in situ LST measurements), in terms of a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.94 (0.96-0.99), a mean absolute error of 0.71-0.98 K (0.82-3.34 K), and a root-mean-square error of 0.97-1.26 K (1.09-4.36 K).

Among existing methods, statistical algorithms are suitable for integrating auxiliary spatial data with station-based Ta data to produce gridded Ta over large areas. However, existing statistical algorithms (e.g., Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)) cannot always correctly capture and preserve relationships between Ta and explanatory variables, which may increase un-certainties of relevant applications based on the estimated Ta with abnormal spatial patterns. This issue is mainly caused by the lack of enough observations due to the limited spatial coverage of weather stations, leading to abnormal relationships between Ta and explanatory variables. In order to address this issue, in this study, we introduced a new method named the Spatially Varying Coefficient Models with Sign Preservation (SVCM-SP) to estimate gridded Ta using gridded land surface temperature (LST) and elevation as explanatory variables with presetting positive and negative signs for coefficients, respectively. Using this method, first, we calculated the preset parameters of the bivariate spline surface. Second, we used the input data at weather stations and con-strained least squares regression to obtain the coefficient surface for both the explanatory variables (i.e., elevation and LST) and the intercept. Third, we calculated the gridded Ta using the 1 km gridded LST and elevation data, and the estimated spatially varying coefficient surfaces. We evaluated the model performance for estimating 1 km gridded daily maximum and minimum Ta (i.e., Tmax and Tmin) data in mainland China from 2003 to 2016 using 10-fold cross-validation and compared its performance with the GWR model. The average root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) based on the SVCM-SP are 1.75 C and 1.22 C for Tmax, and 1.82 C and 1.30 C for Tmin, respectively. The SVCM-SP method showed better performance than the GWR in terms of accuracy, computing efficiency, and has more interpretable coefficients for explanatory variables to get more realistic spatial pattern of gridded Ta. More important, the sign preservation of the SVCM-SP method can mitigate the issue of abnormal relationships between Ta and explanatory variables in the traditional methods such as GWR, and therefore will contribute to future studies in developing better gridded air temperature or relevant data products.', '[Zhang, Tao; Zhou, Yuyu] Iowa State Univ, Dept Geol & Atmospher Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA.

In this study, an image-based deep neural network (DNN) model for cloud identification and simultaneous retrieval of CTH and ice-COT is developed for Himawari-8 satellite infrared measurements. The DNN model is trained with brightness temperature data from four months in 2016 as the input, and cloud properties of an active remote sensing product from CloudSat and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) as the target truth. Supplementary variables, including the vertical temperature profile, the surface elevation, and the geometrical parameters, are added as the input data. DNN model performance is first tested with an independent dataset, and then cases over a CloudSat track and a Himawari-8 granule (85?E-205?E, 60?S-60?N) are selected for further validation of the model by comparing its results with those from two physics-based models. For both the water-and ice-CTH estimates, the DNN model shows high consistency with the target values, with an overall CTH correlation coefficient of 0.90 for high ice clouds with COT >= 0.3. Notably, as an infrared method in nature, the DNN extends the predictable ice-COT to similar to 200, with relative biases of similar to 20% for high ice clouds with COT > 1. The strong accuracy of the DNN model is primarily derived from its ability to learn from the spatial features imprinted on the input brightness temperature image, and its integration of information from neighboring pixels in a three-dimensional space. A single full disk estimation with the DNN model takes about 20 min using one processor; therefore, near-real-time cloud property retrieval that is uniformly available over 24 h can be obtained for severe weather monitoring and mesoscale cloud-system studies.', '[Wang, Xinyue; Iwabuchi, Hironobu; Yamashita, Takaya] Tohoku Univ, Ctr Atmospher & Ocean Studies, Grad Sch Sci, Sendai, Japan.

This study presents a satellite-based approach at quantifying the distribution of sediment-laden ice that allows for more extensive observations in both time and space to monitor spatiotemporal variations in sediment-laden ice. A structural-optical model coupled with a four-stream multilayer discrete ordinates method radiative transfer model was used to examine surface spectral albedo for four surface types: clean ice, sediment-laden ice with 15 different sediment loadings from 25 to 1000 g m(-3), ponded ice, and ice-free open water. Based on the fact that the spectral characteristics of sediment-laden ice differ from those other surface types, fractions of sediment-laden ice were estimated from the remotely-sensed surface reflectance by a spectral unmixing algorithm using a least square method. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that a combination of sediment loads of 50 and 500 g m(-3) effectively represents the areal fraction of sediment-laden ice with a wide range of sediment loads. The estimated fractions of each surface type and corresponding remotely-sensed surface reflectances were used to train an artificial neural network to speed up processing relative to the least squares method. Comparing the fractions of sediment-laden ice derived from these two approaches yielded good agreements for areal fractions of sediment-laden ice, highlighting the superior performance of the neural network for processing large datasets. Although our approach contains potential uncertainties associated with methodological limitations, spatiotemporal variations in sediment-laden ice exhibited reasonable agreement with spatial patterns and seasonal variations reported in the literature on in situ observations of sediment-laden ice. Systematic satellite-based monitoring of sediment-laden ice distribution can provide extensive, sustained, and cost-effective observations to foster our under-standing of the role of sediment-laden ice in a wide variety of research fields including sediment transport and biogeochemical cycling.', '[Waga, Hisatomo; Eicken, Hajo] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Int Arctic Res Ctr, 2160 Koyukuk Dr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.

It has been applied primarily for studying the quality of satellite observations for several variables, including sea surface temperature (SST) among others. Different algorithms have been developed in the literature to calculate the random uncertainties with sometimes distinct assumptions of the underlying error model or different equations. Four of the available triple collocation (TC) algorithms have been examined here in order to clarify the assumptions behind them and investigate their mathematical equivalence. In addition, triple collocations of SST observations from drifting buoys, and satellite observations from the ATSRs and microwave (MW) imagers have been used to examine the divergence among the TC algorithms with real data. It has been found that the maximum absolute difference is less than 0.009 K for the data considered here, indicating that the choice of TC algorithm is not significant to first order. This result permitted the investigation of the impact of the number of collocations by performing statistical experiments with real observations selecting them randomly without replacement. It is established that the ideal number is at least 500. Numbers below 200 on average would underestimate the true value of random uncertainties, while for numbers of about 100 or below numerical instabilities appear preventing the convergence to a solution with this issue becoming more acute as the number becomes smaller. For the SST instruments considered, the dependence of the random uncertainty on the sample number is described adequately by a theoretical equation given by Zwieback et al. (2012). This theoretical equation has been used to study the robustness of the differences in AMSR-E random uncertainties between day and night. The differences are mainly due to wind speed dependence, manifested also as latitudinal dependence. This is further confirmed when examining the variability of the random uncertainties with wind speed and SST. The AATSR random uncertainty slightly decreases linearly with wind speed, while AMSR-E increases by up to 50% between low and high wind speeds. A non-negligible dependence with SST has been found for both AATSR and drifting buoys with higher random uncertainty for SST in the range 10 degrees-15 degrees C. The AMSR-E random uncertainty decreases linearly with SST, when SST is above about 15 degrees C. Obviously, the dependence of the random uncertainty with the geophysical variable, here SST, violates one of the assumptions behind TC. Nevertheless, this can be mitigated through the application of TC into intervals of the geophysical variable for which the independence from the random uncertainty holds. These practical results unveil the real power of TC which based on the use of three collocated datasets is able to characterise their random uncertainties in a robust way, something extremely difficult to achieve by employing only two datasets without prior knowledge.', '[Tsamalis, Christoforos] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Fitzroy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.', 'Met Office - UK; Hadley CentreRP Tsamalis, C (通讯作者)，Met Off Hadley Ctr, Fitzroy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.', 'christoforos.tsamalis@gmail.com', 'Tsamalis, Christoforos/0000-0002-3753-6402', 'NASA Earth Science MEaSUREs DISCOVER Project; Met Office Hadley Centre   Climate Programme - BEIS; Defra', 'TMI and AMSR-E data are produced by Remote Sensing Systems and sponsored   by the NASA Earth Science MEaSUREs DISCOVER Project.

Here, we investigated if integrating land surface temperature (T-R)-based evapotranspiration (ET) or latent heat flux (lambda E) into a Remote sensing-driven approach to Coupling Ecosystem Evapotranspiration and Photosynthesis (RCEEP) model, which is modified from the underlying water use efficiency method, can better characterize GPP under dry conditions as compared to the light use efficiency (LUE)-based models. We developed the new GPP model, termed STIC-RCEEP, by combining an ET model, called STIC (Surface Temperature Initiated Closure), and RCEEP. We compared the performance of STIC-RCEEP against four conventional LUE-based models (Vegetation Photosynthesis Model, MOD17, STIC-MOD17, STIC-LUE), using tower-based daily GPP data from different cropland flux sites across the globe. An evaluation of the five GPP models, all optimized using available 170 site-years data from the 22 flux sites, revealed the relatively better performance of the STIC-RCEEP (R-2 = 0.78 and RMSE = 2.5 gC m(-2) d(-1)) with respect to the other four LUE models. Error analysis revealed substantially less error of STICRCEEP particularly under the dry conditions and RMSE of STIC-RCEEP was 9%-14% less than the other models. This finding highlights the enhanced ability of thermal sensors to capture the water stress signals in ET and GPP, which is also evidenced by the substantially better performance of STIC than another widely-regarded nonthermal ET model (the Priestly Taylor - Jet Propulsion Laboratory model), under dry conditions. The improved GPP estimates from STIC-RCEEP under water-stressed environment opens avenues for further research and applications using existing and new TR-based sensors in coupled crop water use-productivity modeling.', '[Bai, Yun; Zhang, Sha; Zhang, Jiahua] Qingdao Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Space Informat & Big Earth Data Res Ctr, Qingdao, Peoples R China.

To date, studies have used DAP data acquired with a range of spatial resolutions and image overlaps. The systematic benchmarking of DAP acquisition parameters remains an outstanding research and operational gap for forest applications. While the impact of along-track overlap on point cloud metrics and areabased attribute estimates can be readily simulated, the impact of image resolution or across-track overlap requires purpose-acquired data. Moreover, although increases in along-track overlap are enabled by digital camera systems, costs for increasing across-track overlap can be substantial and may negate the cost-effectiveness of DAP for forest inventory. Hence, determining the impacts of varying acquisition parameters is of practical value for inventory programs. Researchers and practitioners have often assumed that more overlap will result in better DAP data, and that minimal overlaps often associated with historic airborne image campaigns are inadequate to support DAP processing. In our study, we found no marked difference among 15 and 20 cm spatial resolutions and overlap scenarios unless across-track overlap was reduced to 40%. Mean differences between DAP metrics and the ALS reference generally increased with decreasing overlap, and mean differences were larger for lower height percentiles (p10). Estimates of canopy height using the p90 metric varied by a root mean squared difference (RMSD) of approximately 5% between 15 cm and 20 cm datasets when along-track overlap was greater than 40%. Lower height percentiles were more strongly impacted by overlaps and resolution. Cover metrics varied by 2% RMSD across all overlap scenarios and resolutions. Comparisons between forest types (conifer, deciduous, mixed), terrain slope and aspect, and ALS-derived canopy cover were conducted to determine whether significant mean differences existed between DAP and the ALS reference. Although some significant differences were found by forest type and terrain variables, significant differences were most commonly associated with canopy cover. Based on the results reported herein, along and across-track overlaps >= 60% result in DAP metrics that were more similar to ALS. Increasing across-track overlap from 60% to 80% did not consistently improve the level of agreement between DAP metrics and ALS reference metrics. Conversely, DAP metrics generated using across-track overlaps <60% resulted in metrics with greater differences from the ALS reference, and a greater range of variability in DAP metric values. Image acquisitions for forest inventory must consider a broad range of factors and herein we have quantified that increasing along- or across-track overlap beyond 60% does not improve agreement with ALS area-based point cloud metrics commonly used to model forest inventory attributes. Likewise, overlap that is <60% does result in greater differences with ALS reference. Other applications beyond forest inventory may have different overlap requirements.', '[Goodbody, Tristan R.

However, limited by the coarse resolution and other confounding factors, there is often a data gap in nearshore waters, and the uncertainties in the estimated Sargassum abundance in offshore waters are also unclear. Higher-resolution satellite data may overcome these limitations, yet such a potential is hindered by the lack of reliable methods to accurately detect and quantify Sargassum in an automatic fashion. Here, we address this challenge by combining large quantities of high-resolution satellite data with deep learning. Specifically, data from the Multispectral Instrument (MSI, 10-20 m), Operational Land Imager (OLI, 30 m), WorldView-II (WV-2, 2 m), and PlanetScope/Dove (3 m) are used with a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) to extract Sargassum features and quantify Sargassum biomass density or areal coverage. By utilizing the U-net architecture and the pre-trained weights from the VGG16 model, the DCNN (i.e., the VGGUnet model) can extract Sargassum features while discarding other confusing features (waves, currents, phytoplankton blooms, clouds, cloud shadows, or striping noise). For Sargassum biomass estimated from OLI and MSI images, results indicate an accuracy of -92% and 90%, respectively, when evaluated using images from the same sensor. When Sargassum areal coverage is estimated from WV-2 and Dove images, there is an accuracy of -98% and 82%, respectively. When different sensors are cross-compared, OLI reveals -30% more Sargassum biomass than MODIS from 14 OLI images collected in the Caribbean Sea (path/row: 001/050) for their commonly viewed observable areas, and - 180% more Sargassum biomass than MSI (N = 15, path/row: 001/050); such differences appear systematic (R2 = 0.98 and 0.73, respectively). Compared to the quasi-simultaneous MSI, OLI, and MODIS images, Dove shows higher Sargassum coverage. Higher-resolution sensors tend to observe more Sargassum because they can detect smaller-scale features that are missed by the coarser-resolution sensors, although the difference varies with time and location. The morphological characteristics of Sargassum features from these high-resolution data are also reported to facilitate management actions. The findings here not only fill the knowledge gaps and coverage gaps from previous studies, but more importantly pave the road toward operational monitoring and tracking Sargassum features in nearshore waters.', '[Wang, Mengqiu; Hu, Chuanmin] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, 140 Seventh Ave South, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.', 'State University System of Florida; University of South FloridaRP Hu, CM (通讯作者)，Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, 140 Seventh Ave South, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.', 'huc@usf.edu', NULL, 'U.S. NASA Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry program [NNX16AR74G,   80NSSC20M0264]; Ecological Forecast program [NNX17AF57G, 80NSSC21K0422];   Water Resources program [80NSSC19K1200]; NOAA RESTORE Science Program   [NA17NOS4510099]; JPSS/NOAA Cal/Val project [NA15OAR4320064]; NASA   [NNX16AR74G, 894870] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER', 'This work was supported by the U.S. NASA Ocean Biology and   Biogeochemistry program NNX16AR74G, 80NSSC20M0264) , Ecolog-ical   Forecast program (NNX17AF57G, 80NSSC21K0422) , Water Re-sources program   (80NSSC19K1200) , NOAA RESTORE Science Program (NA17NOS4510099) , and   the JPSS/NOAA Cal/Val project (NA15OAR4320064) .

A total of 16 UBSM were collected at different locations of the study area and spectra were generated using ASD Field spec 3 Spectro radiometer operated at VNIR and SWIR regions (0.35 mu m to 2.5 mu m). The collected spectra were then resampled with the spectral range of 0.3-2.5 mu m and used for classifying dimensionally reduced AVIRIS-NG (Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer - Next Generation) dataset through Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classifier for understanding spatial and spectral characteristics of heat inducing UBSM in the study area. The classification shows that concrete, basalt stones and asbestos are the dominant UBSM in the study area and its spectral reflectance are comparatively low in the VNIR and SWIR regions. The land surface temperature (LST) of the study area was retrieved from the Landsat-8 TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor), and compared with the ECOSTRESS (ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station) LST data product and Fluke Infrared thermometer measurements operated at LWIR (8-14 mu m). All these LST estimation and comparison processes were synchronized at the most possible manner (+/- 7 days). Additionally, emissivity of collected UBSM were determined using FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Radiometer) emissivity in the laboratory. The amalgamation of results shows that barren land (mostly basaltic), basalt stones and concrete surfaces cover dominantly the high LST region of the study area. The FTIR measurements reveal that, among 16 dominant UBSM, basalt stones had recorded high spectral radiance (0.0309 Wm(-1)mu m(-1)sr(-1)) and emissivity (0.98) followed by concrete (emissivity = 0.94). Whereas marble had the lowest spectral radiance (0.0246 Wm(-1)mu m(-1)sr(-1)) and emissivity (0.49).

A total of five lidar flight experiments were conducted between 2017 and 2019 in the SCS, and approximately 2.5 terabytes of data were obtained. A hybrid retrieval method combining the Klett method for klidar and the perturbation method for beta pi was developed. The lidar-retrieved chlorophyll-a concentrations and in situ data show good agreement (R2 greater than 0.8). The mean absolute percentage error for the lidar-retrieved chlorophyll-a concentrations is less than 15%. SPLs were observed both in Sanya Bay and in the open sea near Lingshui city, Hainan Province, China. The SPLs were observed at depths between 50 and 70 m in the open sea near Lingshui city, and between 5 and 30 m in Sanya Bay. The SPL depths have spatiotemporal variability, and we analyzed the possible factors (monsoon, seafloor depth, and sea surface temperature) that influence this spatiotemporal variability.

Thermal infrared remote sensing-derived land surface temperature (LST) is a critical variable for ET estimation using energy balance-based models. However, missing LST information under cloudy conditions remains a long-standing barrier for spatiotemporally continuous monitoring of daily ET at regional scales. In this study, LST data of 1 km spatial resolution at 11:00 local solar time under allweather conditions across the North China Plain (NCP) were first generated using a data fusion approach developed previously. Second, combined with the generated LST data, MODIS products, and meteorological forcing from the China Land Data Assimilation System, the Two-Source Energy Balance model (TSEB) and a temporal upscaling method were jointly used to estimate daily ET at 1 km spatial resolution across the NCP for a decade from 2008 to 2017. In particular, to better incorporate the impact of crop phenology on ET and improve the ET estimation, the fraction of greenness in TSEB was determined in terms of a leaf area index threshold during the crop growth period. Compared with observed instantaneous latent heat flux (LE) corrected for energy balance closure, the estimated LE reasonably captures inter- and intra-annual variations in LE measured at the Huailai, Daxing, Weishan, and Guantao flux towers, with R2 of 0.63-0.79. Estimated daily ET against in situ ET measurements with energy balance closure at the Huailai, Daxing, and Guantao sites showed good performance in terms of R2 greater than 0.70 and RMSE below 0.91 mm/d. These accuracies are comparable with published results, with our ET data set validated by many more observations than previous studies and featuring spatiotemporal continuity and high spatial resolution across the entire NCP for a decade. Furthermore, seasonal ET variations reflected by our product outperform two widely used global products in capturing water consumption characteristics in the winter wheat-summer maize rotation system. In terms of temporal trends, annual ET estimates across the NCP show a decreasing and then increasing trend over the past decade, which is attributed to the increased cropping intensity over the recent years reflected by an increase in leaf area index.', '[Zhang, Caijin; Long, Di] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydroscience & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.

It covers six main crop types including rice, corn, wheat and barley, sunflower, soybean and other types of crops. Ground measurements were completed using either digital hemispherical cameras, LAI-2000 or AccuPAR devices over sites representative of a decametric pixel. Sites were spread over the globe and the data collected at several growth stages concurrently to the acquisition of Landsat-8 images. Several machine learning techniques were investigated to retrieve GAI and fAPAR from the Landsat-8 top of canopy reflectance values, either using empirical or simulated calibration databases and generic or crop-type specific algorithms.   Results show that using the six Landsat-8 bands together provided the best estimates of GAI and fAPAR. Machine learning techniques trained over a dataset simulated by the PROSAIL model provided less accurate estimates of GAI and fAPAR as compared to machine learning techniques trained over the ground data collected and applied over a similar dataset (best-case scenario). All machine learning techniques performed similarly when calibrated on PROSAIL simulations. The Gaussian process regression (GPR) was the best performing machine learning technique as compared to artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine regression (SVM) and as compared to NDVI simple model when calibrated over the ground dataset in the best-case scenario. However, the performance of the GPR trained over ground data is notably degraded when applied to crop types excluded from the calibration (worst-case scenario), and models based on simulations performs similarly of even better. Furthermore, training the GPR over specific crop types was performing slightly better than training over all the crop types together if at least 100 well distributed data points were available in the training dataset. Similar conclusions were obtained for the other machine learning techniques, with crop specific empirical models providing slightly better performances with a few exceptions. Finally, GAI was estimated by GPR with a RMSE varying between 0.45 and 1.19 and fAPAR with RMSE varying between 0.07 and 0.15 depending on the crop type.', '[Camacho, Fernando; Fuster, Beatriz] Parc Cient Univ Valencia, EOLAB, C Catedrat Agustin Escardino 9, Valencia 46980, Spain.

Recent research suggests, however, that a fundamental assumption in satellite ocean color data processing concerning the calibration of the long near infrared band (i.e., 865 nm for MODIS) may introduce sensor-specific biases in space and/or time, which may also contribute to cross-sensor inconsistency in the derived reflectance data products. As such, it is necessary to assess the calibration of this band across sensors - performed here for MODIS/Aqua and VIIRS/SNPP using \'simultaneous same view\' matchups (SSV; similar to simultaneous nadir overpass, but allowing for non-nadir measurements). Towards that end, we assess geometric, temporal, and spatial homogeneity metrics to identify SSVs, and develop a band-shifting approach applicable within standard satellite data processing routines to resolve expected spectral differences in the radiometry. We find top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance data from VIIRS/SNPP long near infrared band to be approximately 3% higher than the corresponding MODIS/A data. With the expectation that cross-calibrating the NIRL should improve cross-sensor continuity of downstream geophysical products (e.g., chlorophyll-a), we reprocessed VIIRS data using updated calibration coefficients. While we noticed many minor improvements in cross-sensor continuity in such data products, large-scale geographic and temporal biases between these two datasets still remain. These discontinuities may be the result of disparate errors in polarization correction or atmospheric correction, both of which are modulated by radiant path geometry.', '[Barnes, Brian B.; Hu, Chuanmin] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.

To obtain more reliable land cover information than traditional hard classification, spectral unmixing methods have been developed to estimate the composition of the mixed pixels, in terms of the proportions of land cover classes. The existing spectral unmixing methods usually require pure spectra (i.e., endmembers) of each land cover class. However, in areas dominated by mixed pixels (e.g., highly heterogeneous areas), it can be a great challenge to extract a large number of pure endmembers, especially for long time-series data. Meanwhile, intra-class spectral variation remains a long-standing issue in spectral unmixing. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal spectral unmixing (STSU) approach to address these issues. The proposed method extends spectral unmixing from the traditional spatial domain to the spatio-temporal domain. It exploits fully the multi-scale spatio-temporal information, by using temporally neighboring fine spatial resolution images to detect land cover changes and, further, extracts the proportion information of unchanged mixed pixels required for training. The STSU method is free of the need for endmember extraction, using directly the extracted mixed training samples to construct a learning model, and it accounts for intra-class spectral variation. Therefore, it is a fully automatic method suitable for dynamic monitoring of land cover changes. The effectiveness of the STSU method was validated through experiments on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data in five different areas. The proposed STSU method provides a new solution for spectral unmixing of time-series data based on the goal of continuous monitoring at the global scale.', '[Wang, Qunming; Ding, Xinyu; Tong, Xiaohua] Tongji Univ, Coll Surveying & Geoinformat, 1239 Siping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.

As such, the development of optical remote sensing techniques to measure snow-covered area (SCA) has enabled progress in a wide variety of research domains. However, in many cases, the spatial and temporal resolutions of currently available remotely sensed SCA products are insufficient to capture SCA evolution at spatial and temporal resolutions relevant to the study of fine-scale spatially heterogeneous phenomena. We developed a convolutional neural network-based method to identify snow covered area using the similar to 3 m, 4-band PlanetScope optical satellite image dataset with similar to daily, near-global coverage. By comparing our model performance to snow extent derived from high-resolution airborne lidar differential depth measurements and satellite platforms in two North American sites (Sierra Nevada, CA, USA and Rocky Mountains, CO, USA), we show that these emerging image archives have great potential to accurately observe snow-covered area at high spatial and temporal resolutions despite limited radiometric bandwidth and band placement. We achieve average snow classification F-Scores of 0.73 in our training basin and 0.67 in a climatically-distinct out-of-sample basin, suggesting opportunities for model transferability.

The Atmospheric Correction Intercomparison Exercise (ACIX-Aqua), a joint NASA - ESA activity, was initiated to enable a thorough evaluation of eight state-of-the-art atmospheric correction (AC) processors available for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data processing. Over 1000 radiometric matchups from both freshwaters (rivers, lakes, reservoirs) and coastal waters were utilized to examine the quality of derived aquatic reflectances ((rho) over cap (w)). This dataset originated from two sources: Data gathered from the international scientific community (henceforth called Community Validation Database, CVD), which captured predominantly inland water observations, and the Ocean Color component of AERONET measurements (AERONET-OC), representing primarily coastal ocean environments. This volume of data permitted the evaluation of the AC processors individually (using all the matchups) and comparatively (across seven different Optical Water Types, OWTs) using common matchups. We found that the performance of the AC processors differed for CVD and AERONET-OC matchups, likely reflecting inherent variability in aquatic and atmospheric properties between the two datasets. For the former, the median errors in (rho) over cap (w)(560) and (rho) over cap (w)(664) were found to range from 20 to 30% for best-performing processors. Using the AERONET-OC matchups, our performance assessments showed that median errors within the 15-30% range in these spectral bands may be achieved. The largest uncertainties were associated with the blue bands (25 to 60%) for best-performing processors considering both CVD and AERONET-OC assessments. We further assessed uncertainty propagation to the downstream products such as near-surface concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chla) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS). Using satellite matchups from the CVD along with in situ Chla and TSS, we found that 20-30% uncertainties in (rho) over cap (w)(490 <= lambda <= 743 nm) yielded 25-70% uncertainties in derived Chla and TSS products for top-performing AC processors. We summarize our results using performance matrices guiding the satellite user community through the OWT-specific relative performance of AC processors. Our analysis stresses the need for better representation of aerosols, particularly absorbing ones, and improvements in corrections for sky- (or sun-) glint and adjacency effects, in order to achieve higher quality downstream products in freshwater and coastal ecosystems.', '[Pahlevan, Nima; Smith, Brandon] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.

These methods tend to focus on economically significant components of forests, thus leaving out many factors vital for forest biodiversity, such as the occurrence of species with low economical but high ecological values. Airborne hyperspectral imagery has shown significant potential for tree species classification, but the most common analysis methods, such as random forest and support vector machines, require manual feature engineering in order to utilize both spatial and spectral features, whereas deep learning methods are able to extract these features from the raw data.   Our research focused on the classification of the major tree species Scots pine, Norway spruce and birch, together with an ecologically valuable keystone species, European aspen, which has a sparse and scattered occurrence in boreal forests. We compared the performance of three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) with the support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting machine and artificial neural network in individual tree species classification from hyperspectral data with high spatial and spectral resolution. We collected hyperspectral and LiDAR data along with extensive ground reference data measurements of tree species from the 83 km(2) study area located in the southern boreal zone in Finland. A LiDAR-derived canopy height model was used to match ground reference data to aerial imagery. The best performing 3D-CNN, utilizing 4 m image patches, was able to achieve an F1-score of 0.91 for aspen, an overall F1-score of 0.86 and an overall accuracy of 87%, while the lowest performing 3D-CNN utilizing 10 m image patches achieved an F1-score of 0.83 and an accuracy of 85%. In comparison, the support-vector machine achieved an F1-score of 0.82 and an accuracy of 82.4% and the artificial neural network achieved an F1-score of 0.82 and an accuracy of 81.7%. Compared to the reference models, 3D-CNNs were more efficient in distinguishing coniferous species from each other, with a concurrent high accuracy for aspen classification.   Deep neural networks, being black box models, hide the information about how they reach their decision. We used both occlusion and saliency maps to interpret our models. Finally, we used the best performing 3D-CNN to produce a wall-to-wall tree species map for the full study area that can later be used as a reference prediction in, for instance, tree species mapping from multispectral satellite images. The improved tree species classification demonstrated by our study can benefit both sustainable forestry and biodiversity conservation.', '[Mayra, Janne; Kivinen, Sonja; Hurskainen, Pekka; Kullberg, Peter; Vihervaara, Petteri] Biodivers Ctr, Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, Latokartanonkaari 11, FI-00790 Helsinki, Finland.

The method employs deep residual network (ResNet), a variant of Convolutional Neural Network, to obtain high resolution (2 km by 2 km) aliased wind direction fields. Forty-seven SAR images of the European Space Agency satellites Sentinel-1 have been processed with ResNet, previously trained with other fifteen images. The areas of interest are the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf, two regional seas where the SAR images often present complex patterns associated to the wind field spatial structure reporting traces of the interaction with coastal orography, hence valuable test sites to evaluate the performance of the methodology here proposed. Statistical analysis was carried out comparing the SAR-derived wind directions with those from ECMWF atmospheric model, ASCAT scatterometer and in-situ gauges. It reports biases beta of -1.1 degrees, 2.4 degrees and -4.6 degrees respectively, and centered root mean square difference cRMSd<21 degrees, consistent with the benchmark obtained comparing scatterometer with ECMWF wind directions over the areas imaged by SAR (beta 2.1 degrees, cRMSd=19 degrees). These results are relevant because they include the coastal data not accounted in the benchmark. Analysis of selected cases showed that SAR-derived wind fields reproduce meteorological situations characterized by strong divergence. Notably, our ResNet is able to estimate the wind direction even in the absence of wind streaks on the SAR images and in presence of convective turbulence structures, atmospheric lee waves, and ships. Furthermore, the model is also able to derive the wind field over small areas, as the example of Venice lagoon has shown. Detailed analysis of selected cases raised the issue of the lack of data with true spatial resolution of approximate to 2 km and within half hour from the satellite pass time necessary for exhaustive comparisons.', '[Zanchetta, Andrea] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Mus, Kowloon Tong, Sing Tao Bldg, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

In this paper, we developed a laboratory measurement set-up for a large goniometer (LAGOS) and measured multiangular spectra (350-2500 nm) of 18 small trees, composed of three common European tree species: Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst), sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.). For all trees, we measured tree spectra in 47 view angles in the upper hemisphere. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting multi-angular reflectance spectra of single trees. We also measured the reflectance and transmittance spectra of needles and leaves, as well as reflectance spectra of bark of the sample trees. We analyzed the spectro-directional characteristics of the trees, and the inter- and intraspecific variations of these characteristics. The anisotropy of trees was shown to be strongly asymmetrical and characteristic to species: while pine and spruce exhibited strong hotspot effects, oak showed a strong specular component. Our results indicate that simultaneous measurements of both spectral and directional characteristics of trees may enhance the discrimination of species and thus, support the retrieval of information of their biophysical properties.', '[Forsstrom, Petri R.; Hovi, Aarne; Rautiainen, Miina] Aalto Univ, Dept Built Environm, POB 14100, Aalto 00076, Finland.

However, combining remote sensing products over any major river basin will result in a residual error in the overall water balance. Previous studies have either quantified this error without correcting it, or have merged observations together with land surface models (LSMs) to produce a single \"best\" estimate of the water balance. Here, we present a new approach in which combinations of remote sensing and in situ observations are constrained to enforce water balance closure. Rather than a single estimate, this produces an ensemble of unique water balance estimates intended to characterize uncertainty and to avoid biases implicit in LSMs. We evaluate three techniques of varying complexity to enforce water balance closure for individual ensemble members over 24 global basins from Oct. 2002 Dec. 2014, resulting in as many as 60 realizations of the monthly water budget, contingent upon data availability. Compared with a published climate data record, the ensemble shows strong agreement for precipitation, evapotranspiration and changes in storage (R-2: 0.91-0.95), with less agreement for streamflow (R-2: 0.42-0.47), which may be indicative of LSM biases in the climate data record. Water balance residual errors resulting from combinations of raw products vary significantly (p < 0.001) with latitude, with a tendency for positive biases for lowand mid latitude basins, and negative biases elsewhere. Overall, residual errors are equivalent to 15% of total precipitation when averaged across all data products and basins. This study shows that closure constraints provide additional value outside of closing the water budget, including reduction of uncertainty and transfer of closure constraints in time to provide skillful estimates of mean annual basin discharge. We also showed that a simpler closure technique, proportional redistribution, performed better than more complex ones in decreasing uncertainty and for transfer through time to estimate basin discharge when a rigorous analysis of errors for each data product is not accounted for. This observation-based dataset is distinct from modeled estimates and therefore has the potential to preserve important information of anthropogenic effects on the water balance.', '[Abolafia-Rosenzweig, R.; Zeng, J.

With 98% of emerged land covered by forests, French Guiana is the area with the highest proportion of forest cover in the world. These forests are home to an exceptionally rich and diverse wealth of biodiversity that is both vulnerable and under threat due to high levels of pressure from human activity. As part of the French territory, French Guiana benefits from determined and continuous national efforts in the preservation of biodiversity and the environmental functionalities of ecosystems. The loss and fragmentation of forest cover caused by gold mining (legal and illegal), smallholder agriculture and forest exploitation, are considered as small-scale disturbances, although representing strong effects to vulnerable natural habitats, landscapes, and local populations. To monitor forest management programs and combat illegal deforestation and forest opening near-real time alerts system based on remote sensing data are required. For this large territory under frequent cloud cover, Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) data appear to be the best adapted. In this paper, a method for forest alerts in a near-real time context based on Sentinel-1 data over the whole of French Guiana (83,534 km2) was developed and evaluated. The assessment was conducted for 2 years between 2016 and 2018 and includes comparisons with reference data provided by French Guiana forest organizations and comparisons with the existing University of Maryland Global Land Analysis and Discovery Forest Alerts datasets based on Landsat data. The reference datasets include 1,867 plots covering 2,124.5 ha of gold mining, smallholder agriculture and forest exploitation. The validation results showed high user accuracies (96.2%) and producer accuracies (81.5%) for forest loss detection, with the latter much higher than for optical forest alerts (36.4%). The forest alerts maps were also compared in terms of detection timing, showing systematic temporal delays of up to one year in the optical method compared to the SAR method. These results highlight the benefits of SAR over optical imagery for forest alerts detection in French Guiana. Finally, the potential of the SAR method applied to tropical forests is discussed.

Many studies report global and regional indicators of spatial and temporal accuracy to evaluate the quality of burned area products, but tend to rely on relatively sparse validation data. In this paper, an extensive validation data set covering 223 million ha over the Brazilian Cerrado for the 2015 fire season is used to thoroughly evaluate how the accuracy of burned area products relying on distinct spectral channels (SWIR+NIR versus NIR) and spatial resolution (250 m, 500 m, and both) depends on fire size.   Toward this end, we consider publicly available burned area products MCD64A1 (v006) at 500 m and FireCCI51 at 250 m and use a recently proposed graph-based patch algorithm, which is flexible enough to combine 250-500 m bands.   he trade-off between spatial resolution and spectral channels for the problem at hand reveals that better spatial resolution (NIR at 250 m) is preferable to a broader range of spectral channels (NIR + SWIR at 500 m) for small burns ( 250 ha), but that this relation is not preserved for large burns ( 1000 ha). Also, this study shows that combining both spectral indices into a single classifier leads to the most accurate burned area map. The analysis by land cover type indicates that overall accuracy is highest for grasslands and savannas, with grasslands benefiting the most from the use of SWIR bands. Results also indicate that burned areas can be classified with accuracy measured by the Dice Coefficient close to 80% for fire sizes larger than 500 ha, which corresponds to 60% of the total burned area, but accuracy lower than 36% for fire sizes smaller than 250 ha. In particular, our analysis suggests that the validation of burned area products always should be linked to the description of fire size distribution since it is a fundamental driver of accuracy.   Results show that MODIS daily burned area mapping at 250-500 m spatial resolution can exhibit high temporal accuracy, with almost unbiased estimates and standard deviation close to 1.5 days, indicating an accurate characterization of the spread of large fires.', '[Campagnolo, M.

A quick and accurate mapping of the extent of paddy rice is of critical importance for ensuring food security, studying climate change and monitoring water resources. Based on Sentinel-1A data and rice flooding features, we proposed a rice mapping method called the Automated Rice Mapping using Synthetic Aperture Radar Flooding Signals (ARM-SARFS), in which the key \"V\" shaped feature in the Sentinel-1A VH backscatter time series rising from the flooding before and after rice transplanting was used for rice mapping. The ARM-SARFS was validated at three study sites in Hubei, Liaoning and Guangdong provinces in China under different rice cropping systems and different geographical and climate conditions. The results showed that even without any training samples, the ARM-SARFS was able to provide a satisfying classification result with an overall accuracy of over 86% and an F-1 score of over 0.85 at all three study sites. With the aid of training samples, the classification performance increased further. When compared with the previously proposed Sentinel-1-based rice mapping methods, the ARM-SARFS improved the overall accuracy by 13.3-37.2%, and the most significant improvement was in the producer\'s accuracy. The sensitivity test showed that the ARM-SARFS is not sensitive to thresholding, and a high classification accuracy can be achieved at thresholds ranging from -0.025 to 0.

Since structure strongly influences the functioning and resilience of forest communities and ecosystems, it is important to quantify it at fine spatial scales.   Here, we propose a new simulation-based approach, the \"Canopy Constructor\", with which we quantified forest structure and biomass at two tropical forest sites, one in French Guiana, the other in Gabon. In a first step, the Canopy Constructor combines field inventories and airborne lidar scans to create virtual 3D representations of forest canopies that best fit the data. From those, it infers the forests\' structure, including crown packing densities and allometric scaling relationships between tree dimensions. In a second step, the results of the first step are extrapolated to create virtual tree inventories over the whole lidar-scanned area.   Across the French Guiana and Gabon plots, we reconstructed empirical canopies with a mean absolute error of 3.98 m [95% credibility interval: 3.02, 4.98], or 14.4%, and a small upwards bias of 0.66 m [-0.41, 1.8], or 2.7%. Height-stem diameter allometries were inferred with more precision than crown-stem diameter allometries, with generally larger heights at the Amazonian than the African site, but similar crown-stem diameter allometries. Plot-based aboveground biomass was inferred to be larger in French Guiana with 400.8 t ha(-1) [366.2-437.9], compared to 302.2 t ha(-1) in Gabon [267.8-336.8] and decreased to 299.8 t ha(-1) [275.9-333.9] and 251.8 t ha(-1) [206.7-291.7] at the landscape scale, respectively. Predictive accuracy of the extrapolation procedure had an RMSE of 53.7 t ha(-1) (14.9%) at the 1 ha scale and 87.6 t ha(-1) (24.2%) at the 0.25 ha scale, with a bias of -17.1 t ha(-1) (-4.7%). This accuracy was similar to regression-based approaches, but the Canopy Constructor improved the representation of natural heterogeneity considerably, with its range of biomass estimates larger by 54% than regression-based estimates.   The Canopy Constructor is a comprehensive inference procedure that provides fine-scale and individual-based reconstructions even in dense tropical forests. It may thus prove vital in the assessment and monitoring of those forests, and has the potential for a wider applicability, for example in the exploration of ecological and physiological relationships in space or the initialisation and calibration of forest growth models.', '[Fischer, Fabian Jorg; Labriere, Nicolas; Chave, Jerome] UMR 5174 CNRS IRD UPS, Lab Evolut & Diversite Biol, 118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France.

In this study, the C-band Sentinel-1 time series including the backscattering coefficients u(0) at VV and VH polarization, the polarization ratio (PR) and the interferometric coherence p are first analyzed with the support of experimental data gathered on three plots of irrigated winter wheat located in the Haouz plain in the center of Morocco covering five growing seasons. The results showed that p and PR are tightly related to the canopy development. p is also sensitive to soil preparation. By contrast, u(0) was found to be widely linked to changes in surface soil moisture (SSM) during the first growth stages when Leaf Area Index remains moderate (< 1.5 m(2)/m(2)). In addition, drastic changes in the crop geometry associated to heading had a strong impact on the C-band u(0), in particular for VH polarization. The coupled water cloud and Oh models (WCM) were then calibrated and validated on the study sites. The comparison between the predicted and observed u0 yielded a root mean square error (RMSE) values ranging from 1.50 dB to 2.02 dB for VV and between 1.74 dB to 2.52 dB for VH with significant differences occurring in the second part of the season after heading. Finally, new approaches based on the inversion of the WCM for SSM retrieval over wheat fields were proposed using Sentinel-1 radar data only. To this objective, the dry above-ground biomass (AGB) and the vegetation water content (VWC) were retrieved from the interferometric coherence and the PR. The relationships were then used as the vegetation descriptor in the WCM. The best retrieval results were obtained using the relationship between pVV and the AGB (R and RMSE of 0.82, 0.05 m3/m3 respectively and no bias). The new retrieval approaches were then applied to a large database covering a rainfed field in Morocco and 18 plots of rainfed and irrigated wheat of the Kairouan plain (Tunisia) and compared to other classical techniques of SSM retrieval including simple linear relationships between SSM and u0. The method based on the WCM and the pVV-AGB relationships also provided with slightly better results than the others on the validation database (r = 0.75, RMSE = 0.06 m(3)/m(3) and bias = 0.01 m(3)/m(3) over the 18 plots of Tunisia) but the simple linear relationships performed also reasonably well (r = 0.62, RMSE = 0.07, bias = -0.01 in Tunisia for instance).

In the literature, the off-the-shelf cloud detection methods either require various hand-crafted features or utilize data -driven features using deep networks. Overall, deep networks achieve much better performance than traditional methods using hand-crafted features. However, the current deep networks used for cloud detection depend on massive pixel-level annotation labels, which require a great deal of manual annotation labor. To reduce the labor needed for annotating the pixel-level labels, this paper proposes a weakly supervised deep learning-based cloud detection (WDCD) method using block-level labels indicating only the presence or the absence of cloud in one RS image block. In the training phase, a new global convolutional pooling (GCP) operation is proposed to enhance the ability of the feature map to represent useful information (e.g., spatial variance). In the testing phase, the trained deep networks are modified to generate the cloud activation map (CAM) via the local pooling pruning (LPP) strategy, which prunes the local pooling layers of the deep networks that are trained in the training phase to improve the quality (e.g., spatial resolution) of CAM. One large RS image is cropped into multiple overlapping blocks by a sliding window, and then the CAM of each block is generated by the modified deep networks. Based on the correspondence between the image blocks and CAMs, multiple corresponding CAMs are collected to mosaic the CAM of the large image. By segmenting the CAM using a statistical threshold against a clear-sky surface, the pixel-level cloud mask of the testing image can be obtained. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed WDCD method, we collected a new global dataset, for which the training dataset contains over 200,000 RS image blocks with block-level labels from 622 large GaoFen-1 images from all over the world; the validation dataset contains 5 large GaoFen-1 images with pixel-level annotation labels, and the testing dataset contains 25 large GaoFen-1 and ZiYuan-3 images with pixel-level annotation labels. Even under the extremely weak supervision, our proposed WDCD method could achieve excellent cloud detection performance with an overall accuracy (OA) as high as 96.66%. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed WDCD method obviously outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The collected datasets have been made publicly available online (https://github.com/weichenrs/WDCD).', '[Li, Yansheng; Chen, Wei; Zhang, Yongjun; Xiao, Rui] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

In so doing, Landsat has provided a critical reference for assessing long-term changes to Earth\'s land environment due to both natural and human forcing. Poised for launch in mid-2021, the joint NASA-USGS Landsat 9 mission will continue this important data record. In many respects Landsat 9 is a clone of Landsat-8. The Operational Land Imager-2 (OLI-2) is largely identical to Landsat 8 OLI, providing calibrated imagery covering the solar reflected wavelengths. The Thermal Infrared Sensor-2 (TIRS-2) improves upon Landsat 8 TIRS, addressing known issues including stray light incursion and a malfunction of the instrument scene select mirror. In addition, Landsat 9 adds redundancy to TIRS-2, thus upgrading the instrument to a 5-year design life commensurate with other elements of the mission. Initial performance testing of OLI-2 and TIRS-2 indicate that the instruments are of excellent quality and expected to match or improve on Landsat 8 data quality. Landsat-9 will maintain the current data acquisition rate of up to 740 scenes per day, with these scenes available from the Landsat archive at no cost to users.

Up to present, the diurnal dynamics of city light during the night, which are important to understand the nature of human activity and the underlying variables explaining night-time brightness, have hardly been investigated by remote sensing techniques due to limitation of the revisit time and spatial resolution of available satellites. In this study, we employed a consumer-grade unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to monitor city light in a study area located in Wuhan City, China, from 8:08 PM, April 15, 2019 to 5:08 AM, April 16, 2019, with an hourly temporal resolution. By using three ground-based Sky Quality Meters (SQMs), we found that the UAV-recorded light brightness was consistent with the ground luminous intensity measured by the SQMs in both the spatial (R-2 = 0.72) and temporal dimensions (R-2 > 0.94), and that the average city light brightness was consistent with the sky brightness in the temporal dimension (R-2 = 0.98), indicating that UAV images can reliably monitor the city\'s night-time brightness. The temporal analysis showed that different locations had different patterns of temporal changes in their night-time brightness, implying that inter-calibration of two kinds of satellite images with different overpass times would be a challenge. Combining an urban function map of 18 classes and the hourly UAV images, we found that urban functions differed in their temporal light dynamics. For example, the outdoor sports field lost 97.28% of its measured brightness between 8: 08 PM - 4:05 AM, while an administrative building only lost 4.56%, and the entire study area lost 61.86% of its total brightness. Within our study area, the period between 9:06 PM and 10:05 PM was the period with largest amount of light loss. The spectral analysis we conducted showed that city light colors were different in some urban functions, with the major road being the reddest region at 8:08 PM and becoming even redder at 4:05 AM. This preliminary study indicates that UAVs are a good tool to investigate city light at night, and that city light is very complex in both of the temporal and spatial dimensions, requiring comprehensive investigation using more advanced UAV techniques, and emphasizing the need for geostationary platforms for night-time light sensors.', '[Li, Xi; Xie, Jinlong; Li, Deren] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan, Peoples R China.

Conservation and maintenance of these landscapes requires accurate observations of both present and historic conditions capable of spanning millions of hectares. Decameter optical satellite image time series have the observational coverage to meet this need, with almost 40 years of intercalibrated global observations from the Landsat program alone. However, the optimal approach to leverage these observations for oak ecosystem monitoring remains elusive. Temporal mixture models (TMMs) may offer a solution. TMMs use a linear inverse model based on temporal endmembers (tEMs) chosen to optimize both parsimony and information content by 1) possessing clear biophysical meaning, and 2) accurately representing the variance structure of the observations in the temporal feature space (TFS) composed of low-order Principal Components. We apply this approach to oak woodlands of the California Sierra Nevada foothills. Low-order TFS structure across the approximate to 1200 km(2) study area is consistently bounded by 4 tEM phenologies: annual grasses, evergreen perennials, deciduous perennials + shadow, and unvegetated areas. Satellite-based tEM phenologies correspond to ground-based PhenoCam time series (correlations 0.8 to 0.9). Systematic temporal decimation is conducted to simulate years with varying numbers of cloud free measurements. Fractional cover of temporal endmembers is observed to scale linearly using as few as 6 images per year and coarse feature space topology is retained with as few as 4 well-timed images per year. In comparing 10 m versus 30 m pixel resolution, linear scaling is observed with correlations of 0.78-0.95. Comparison of 10 m Sentinel-2 and LiDAR-derived tree cover estimates at San Joaquin Experimental Range shows a correlation of 0.74. Visual orthophoto validation shows accuracies of annual, deciduous, and evergreen cover fractions of 74-88% (n = 102). Multi-year analysis of August imagery at Sequoia National Park to investigate dynamics associated with the 2012-2016 drought reveals 5 tEMs corresponding to: steady growth, steady decline, early decline then regrowth, persistent vegetation, and no vegetation. Validation images are sparse, but where available show accuracies in the 88 to 91% range for decrease, growth, and persistently vegetated multiyear endmembers (n = 102). Decreases are observed in areas with oak mortality documented in a recent field-based study.

Local extrema and breakpoints were detected in the locally smoothed time series data in wheat fields for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019.

However, altimeters face an undersampling problem in estimating wind and wave climate because of their sparse sampling pattern and the changing number of in-orbit satellites. In this study, the undersampling error of altimeters was studied by sampling the oceanic wind speed and wave height data from the ERA5 and the Integrated Ocean Waves for Geophysical and other Applications datasets using the track information of multiplatform altimeters. Comparisons were made between the statistics (mean, 90th and 99th percentiles, and long-term trends of them) of the original reanalysis/hindcast data and the gridded along-track sampling of the reanalysis/hindcast data. The results show a large discrepancy with respect to the extreme values (90th and 99th percentiles). The undersampling of altimeters can lead to significant underestimations of monthly extreme values of oceanic wind speed and wave height. Meanwhile, this underestimation is alleviated with the increase of the number of in-orbit altimeters, leading to very large overestimations of long-term trends of these extreme values over the period 1985-2018. In contrast, the annual extreme values of oceanic wind speed and wave height and their long-term trends are more reliable, although slight aforementioned biases of extreme values still exist and the data from GEOSAT are not suitable for computing annual statistics. For altimeter data, the annual values are a better option to compute long-term trends than the monthly data. This study also presents a correction scheme of using model data to compensate for the wind and wave events missed by altimeter tracks. After the correction, the global trends in oceanic wind speed and wave height over 1992-2017 are recomputed using annual statistics. The results show a clear discrepancy between the trends of wind speed and wave height during this period: the wind speed increased, while the wave height decreased. However, uncertainty still exists in the results and the reason for this discrepancy is unknown at this stage.', '[Jiang, Haoyu] China Univ Geosci, Hubei Key Lab Marine Geol Resources, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.

Accurately quantifying regional standing dead tree (SDT) pools, as conducted by the U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, remains a prominent challenge. Little empirical work has been done accounting for structural changes in SDT volume across decay classes due to measurement and sampling challenges associated with SDT. Light-detection-and-ranging (LiDAR) represents a remote sensing technology with the potential to improve sampling efficacy and provide volume estimates of SDT via non-destructive sampling. Following this, the goal of this study was to explore the feasibility of empirically quantifying and assessing structural volume in southern pine SDT by decay class using terrestrial LiDAR. To meet this goal, we addressed three objectives, 1) construct empirical volume estimates of SDT by decay class using terrestrial LiDAR and a voxel-based, volume calculation algorithm capable of accounting for occlusion and point cloud quality, 2) develop allometric relationships of aboveground SDT component volumes by decay class and assess error in models and predictions, and 3) quantify proportion-remaining volume of SDT components from terrestrial LiDAR-derived volumes relative to predicted intact tree volumes. This study represents the first to develop empirically-based, terrestrial LiDAR-derived allometric volume relationships and proportion-remaining volume of SDT by decay class. Results indicate that terrestrial LiDAR-derived volumes of SDT produced robust allometric equations by decay class for total above-stump and stem-plus-bark components (adjusted R-2 = 0.94-0.98). Allometric relationships for tops-and-branches comprised more variability, likely impacted by scan quality, having adjusted R-2 values of similar to 0.52-0.59. Notably, the inclusion of height in allometric relationships for total above-stump volume precluded the need for decay class as a covariate, accounting for the variability inherent in each decay class. Importantly, this means that total above-stump allometric equations could be effective under different decay class systems or, more broadly, where no decay classes were measured, thus providing broad utility. Empirically-derived proportion-remaining volume of SDT components followed expected decreasing trends by decay class. Interestingly, proportion-remaining volume for tops-and-branches closely matched theoretically-derived values from a previous FIA-related study. Ultimately, terrestrial LiDAR was critical for efficiently measuring volume of southern pine SDT by decay class and for developing SDT-specific allometric relationships of volume and estimates of structural change by decay class. This study showcases the feasibility of LiDAR-derived, SDT-specific tools for improved accounting of SDT resources in FIA and other inventories.', '[Klockow, Paul A.; Moore, Georgianne W.; Popescu, Sorin C.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, 495 Hort Rd, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.

However, the information of urban building height over large areas is still limited due to the lack of available data. In this study, we developed an approach to estimate building height using the Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected data. First, we proposed an indicator of VVH that integrates the dual-polarization information (i.e., VV and VH) from the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data. Second, we developed a building height model using the indicator of VVH and the reference building height from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) images in seven cities in the United States (US). Third, we estimated building height of major cities with area larger than 500 km(2) in the US using the developed model. The root mean square error between estimated and reference height is 1.5 m in seven study cities in the US. The comparison with the Laser observations from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite data in available footprints also indicates that the estimated building height from Sentinel-1 data is reliable. The estimated building height from Sentinel-1 data shows a better agreement with the reference data compared to the Advanced Land Observing Satellite data in seven US cities. Our results of building height in major US cities indicate that there are more cities with tall buildings in the Northeastern US compared to the Western and Southern US, with more aggregated tall buildings in central business districts of cities. The information of building height from this study is of great value in urban studies, such as estimating energy consumption and carbon emissions in urban areas.', '[Li, Xuecao; Zhou, Yuyu] Iowa State Univ, Dept Geol & Atmospher Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA.

The application of conventional methods for snow density retrieval using fully polarimetric SAR data is constrained by the properties of snow primarily due to the melt and frost cycles, as compared to fresh dry snow. The surface component of backscatter is significant in case of melt and frost. In the conventional decomposition based methods, the surface component is not considered for the inversion of permittivity, as proposed in this study. In this paper, we also propose a methodology for the estimation of snow density using bi-temporal fully polarimetric C-band RADARSAT-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. We utilize the relation between the differential modified Mueller matrix components, the attenuation constants, and the Fresnel transmission coefficients. The permittivity of snow is derived using the inversion of the Fresnel transmission coefficients which is used to determine the snow density using a state of the art empirical relation. The snow density estimates from the proposed method are compared with other methods based on coherency matrix decomposition and evaluated against in-situ measurements collected during a field campaign carried out in Dhundi in the state of Himachal Pradesh in India.

In mountainous regions, the transition zone from continuous closed-canopy montane forests to treeless alpine tundra areas at higher elevations is commonly referred to as the \"alpine treeline ecotone\" (ATE). Globally, warming climate is expected to drive ATEs upslope, which could lead to negative impacts on local biodiversity and changes in ecosystem function. However, existing studies rely primarily on field-based data which are difficult and time consuming to collect. In this study, we define an ATE-detection index (ATEI) to automatically identify the ATE positions from 2009 to 2011 in the western United States using geospatial tools and remotely sensed datasets provided by Google Earth Engine. A binomial logistic regression model was fitted between standardized ATEI components and a binary variable of pixel status of 141 sampled Landsat pixels manually classified with high-resolution imagery in Google Earth. The average model accuracy was around 0.713 (+/- 0.111) and the average Kappa coefficient was approximately 0.426 (+/- 0.221) based on a 100-time repeated 10-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, the ATEI-estimated elevation is highly correlated (Pearson\'s r = 0.98) with a published set of field-collected ATE elevations at 22 sampling sites across the region. The detection metric developed in this study facilitates monitoring the geographic location and potential shifts of ATEs as well as the general impact of climate change in mountainous areas during recent decades.

This is particularly crucial in the emerging frontiers of Southern Africa, where there is a paucity of LULCC studies relative to the humid tropics. This study focuses on Gurue District (5606 km2) of Zambezia province of Mozambique, one of many countries in the region that has experienced a recent growth in foreign investments in agriculture through large-scale land acquisitions, often resulting in land use conversions and modifications. Previous LULCC assessments covering Mozambique have focused on dynamics between natural and anthropogenic land categories, with limited efforts to distinguish the different land use agents associated with these changes, and relating this with social, economic and technological processes. In this study we built a new LULC assessment methodology that leverages the power of open remote sensing data and tools to integrate categorical and continuous training and validation data obtained from field surveys and Collect Earth software within Google Earth Engine. We then examined the suitability of five pixel-based compositing techniques for generating cloud-free Landsat images that can support analysis of land use dynamics in persistently cloudy, mosaic landscapes with more limited Landsat archives. Drawing upon the spectral and textural features of Landsat data in pixel-based composites, we classified land use over three time periods, 2006, 2012 and 2016, and characterized land use change, focusing on changes between small-scale cropland, large-scale mechanized cropland, and other land uses.

Besides conventional small footprint station data, in-situ time-series of snow water equivalent (SWE) of a Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensor (CRNS) having a footprint of several hectares is additionally used. For including these data the model now provides respective outputs such as fractional snow cover, wet/dry snow surface and SWE areal means equivalent to the CRNS sensor footprint. By means of 40,000 model runs the high complementary value of representative SWE data and remote sensing information was assessed with most promising results achieved by combining high resolution fractional snow covered area maps with CRNS-SWE data. Regarding mean SWE or mean snow covered area in the catchment the ensemble spreads are reduced by two thirds compared to the results of a benchmark simulation based only on runoff for model calibration. Wet snow covered area maps have a high potential for simulating SWE at Weisssee Snow Research Site but introduce additional uncertainties for runoff simulations likely caused by the uncertain detection of the snow covered area from Sentinel-1 backscatter. The approach has high potential for water resources management in gauged and ungauged mountain basin and gives guidance for efficient data assimilation schemes.', '[Schattan, Paul] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Geog, Innrain 52f, Innsbruck, Austria.

To avoid the need for a Priestley-Taylor based transpiration formulation, this study applies the TSEB model using radiometric land surface temperature observations at multiple view angles from an airborne sensor for estimating soil and canopy temperatures directly. This direct partitioning between soil and canopy temperatures applied with the TSEB formulation improved the agreement between observed and modeled surface heat fluxes, reducing mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in latent heat fluxes (LE) with flux tower observations from nearly 20% using the original Priestley-Taylor based TSEB model (TSEB-PT) to 15% using TSEB with thermal infrared observations from two substantially different view angles (TSEB-2AG) to nearly 5% using multiple (similar to 6) view angles (TSEB-6AG). Moreover, TSEB-6AG is shown to compute physically realistic spatially-distributed LE for a range of vegetation cover and environmental conditions over the imaged domain. Values of MAPE for sensible heat (H) tended to be larger for all three models due to the fact that tower measurements tended to be located in well irrigated and densely vegetated sites having relatively low H values. This increased accuracy of soil and vegetation component temperature separation using multiangle radiometric temperature observations is useful for evaluating the utility of single and dual view angle thermal radiometer measurements currently available for applying the TSEB model.', '[Song, Lisheng; Han, Xujun] Southwest Univ, Sch Geog Sci,Minist Nat Resources, Chongqing Engn Res Ctr Remote Sensing Big Data Ap, State Cultivat Base Ecoagr Southwest Mountainous, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.

The Caatinga is located in the semi-arid region of Brazil and its vegetation phenology is highly dependent on precipitation, which has a high spatial and temporal variability. Under these circumstances, satellite image-based methods are valued due to their ability to uncover human-induced changes from climate effects on land cover. In this study, a time series stack of 670 Landsat images over a period of 31 years (1985-2015) was used to investigate spatial and temporal patterns of landcover clearing (LCC) due to vegetation removal in an area of the Caatinga. We compared the LCC detection accuracy of three spectral indices, i.e., the surface albedo (SA), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We applied a residual trend analysis (TSS-RESTREND) to attenuate seasonal climate effects on the vegetation time series signal and to detect only significant structural changes (breakpoints) from monthly Landsat time series. Our results show that SA was able to identify the general occurrence of LCC and the year that it occurred with a higher accuracy (89 and 62%, respectively) compared to EVI (44 and 22%) and NDVI (46 and 22%). The overall outcome of the study shows the benefits of using Landsat time series and a spectral index that incorporates the short-wave infrared range, such as the SA, compared to visible and near-infrared vegetation indices for monitoring LCC in seasonally dry forests such as the Caatinga.', '[Cunha, John] Univ Fed Campina Grande, Ctr Sustainable Dev Semiarid, Sume, Brazil.

However, accurate annual maps of coastal tidal flats over the last few decades are unavailable and their spatio-temporal changes in China are unknown. In this study, we analyzed all the available Landsat TM/ETM +/OLI imagery (-44,528 images) using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform and a robust decision tree algorithm to generate annual frequency maps of open surface water body and vegetation to produce annual maps of coastal tidal flats in eastern China from 1986 to 2016 at 30-m spatial resolution. The resulting map of coastal tidal flats in 2016 was evaluated using very high-resolution images available in Google Earth. The total area of coastal tidal flats in China in 2016 was about 731,170 ha, mostly distributed in the provinces around Yellow River Delta and Pearl River Delta. The interannual dynamics of coastal tidal flats area in China over the last three decades can be divided into three periods: a stable period during 1986-1992, an increasing period during 1993-2001 and a decreasing period during 2002-2016.

The Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) provides Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at high temporal (daily) and spatial (1 km) resolution, making it particularly useful to infer and characterize spatiotemporal variability of aerosols at a fine spatial scale for exposure assessment and health studies. However, clouds and conditions of high surface reflectance result in a significant proportion of missing MAIAC AOD. To fill these gaps, we present an imputation approach using deep learning with downscaling. Using a baseline autoencoder, we leverage residual connections in deep neural networks to boost learning and parameter sharing to reduce overfitting, and conduct bagging to reduce error variance in the imputations. Downscaled through a similar auto-encoder based deep residual network, Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2) GMI Replay Simulation (M2GMI) data were introduced to the network as an important gap-filling feature that varies in space to be used for missingness imputations.

However, further exploration of the numerous metrics available for quantifying canopy complexity could improve models of forest wildlife habitat while simultaneously increasing understanding of wildlife-habitat relationships. We used the full set of metrics available in the LiDAR-processing software FUSION, including several structural metrics that have not previously been used in published habitat models, to identify those that best quantify structural attributes associated with nest site occupancy by the Northern Spotted Owl (NSO; Strix occidentalis caurina). We identified the best subset of predictor variables for building a parsimonious predictive model using an objective selection process of alternative MaxEnt models. The simple metric maximum canopy height was the single best predictor of NSO occupancy, but three rarely used structural metrics included in our final model provided a novel means of describing the distribution of vegetation throughout the canopy height profile. These metrics critically contributed to the model\'s ability to distinguish small patches of structurally complex suitable habitat within a matrix of structurally simple intermediate-aged forest.

In 2013, a drone-based airborne fluid lensing campaign conducted over the coral reef of Ofu Island, American Samoa, revealed complex 3D morphological, ecological, and bathymetric diversity at the cm-scale over a regional area. In this paper, we develop and validate supervised machine learning algorithm products tailored for accurate automated segmentation of coral reefs using airborne fluid lensing multispectral 3D imagery. Results show that airborne fluid lensing can significantly improve the accuracy of coral habitat mapping using remote sensing.   The machine learning algorithm is based on multidimensional naive-Bayes maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Provided a user-selected training subset of 3D multispectral images, comprising -1% of the total dataset, the algorithm separates living structure from nonliving structure and segments the coral reef into four distinct morphological classes - branching coral, mounding coral, basalt rock, and sand. The user-selected training data and algorithm classification results are created and verified, respectively, with sub-cm-resolution ground-truth maps, manually generated from extensive in-situ mapping, underwater gigapixel photogrammetry, and visual inspection of the 3D dataset with subject matter experts.   The algorithm generates 3D cm-resolution data products such as living structure and morphology distribution for the Ofu Island coral reef ecosystem with 95% and 92% accuracy, respectively. By comparison, classification of m-resolution remote sensing imagery, representative of the effective spatial resolution of commonly-used airborne and spaceborne aquatic remote sensing instruments subject to ocean wave distortion, typically produces data products with 68% accuracy. These results suggest existing methodologies may not resolve coral reef ecosystems in sufficient detail for accurate determination of percent cover of living structure and morphology breakdown.   The methods presented here offer a new remote sensing approach enabling repeatable quantitative ecosystem assessment of aquatic systems, independent of ocean wave distortion and sea state. Aquatic remote sensing imagery, free from refractive distortion, appears necessary for accurate and quantitative health assessment capabilities for coral reef ecosystems at the cm-scale, over regional areas. The accurate and automated determination of percent cover and morphology distribution at cm-resolution may lead to a significantly improved understanding of reef ecosystem dynamics and responses in a rapidly-changing global climate.', '[Chirayath, Ved; Instrella, Ron] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Earth Sci Div, Lab Adv Sensing, Moffett Field, CA 94305 USA.', 'National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Ames Research   CenterRP Chirayath, V (通讯作者)，NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Mailstop 232-22, Moffett Field, CA 94305 USA.', 'ved.c@nasa.govRI Chirayath, Ved/AAM-4019-2020', 'Chirayath, Ved/0000-0003-1699-1921', 'NASA Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) grant [ATI-QRS-16-403728];   NASA ESTO [AIST160046]', 'This work was supported in part by NASA Earth Science Technology Office   (ESTO) grant ATI-QRS-16-403728 and NASA ESTO AIST160046.

Most of our knowledge about the occurrence of snow liquid water (OLW) stems from satellite observations and model simulations. However, the relative performances of OLW products derived from these measurements have never been evaluated due to the lack of in-situ snow wetness measurements. We ranked the OLW determined by the radiometer (i.e., Special Sensor Microwave Imager), scatterometer (i.e., Quick Scatterometer and Advanced Scatterometer) and the Regional Atmospheric Circulation Model (RACMO2) based on categorical triple collocation (CTC) which can identify the most accurate observation with unknown true values.

Up to now, radar remote sensing was hardly possible in the treeline zone due to spatial resolution and/or temporal decorrelation constraints of preceding satellite missions. The unique constellation of the TanDEM-X satellites with its bistatic mode and very high spatial resolution opens up opportunities for monitoring small (>= 0.01 km(2)) and isolated patches of very sparse forest which are typical for the transitional zone. We focused on an area at the northern edge of the treeline zone in the Northwest Territories, Canada, and evaluated the potential of TanDEM-X bistatic data to characterize the tree height in the forest patches in this region. TanDEM-X data were acquired during the TanDEM-X Science Phase in 2015, when the perpendicular baseline was large (corresponding to the height of ambiguity of approximately 14.6 m) and kept constant. We employed TanDEM-X backscatter, bistatic coherence, and interferometric height from the stack of seven multitemporal bistatic pairs and compared them to maximum vegetation height obtained from full-waveform airborne LiDAR data. We found strong linear relationships between all TanDEM-X metrics and LiDAR vegetation height within the forest patches with r = 0.67, r = -0.69, and r = 0.78 for the backscatter, coherence, and interferometric height, respectively. Furthermore, we extracted the position of individual trees from the LiDAR data and estimated tree density as the number of trees per unit area. The linear relationships between all TanDEM-X metrics and the tree density were very weak. The relationships between all TanDEM-X metrics and tree height differentiated for three tree density classes (low, medium, and high) remained strong. Random forests regression using all three TanDEM-X metrics predicted the tree height with a mean absolute error of 0.7 m (mean forest height in the study area was 2.5 m). CoSSC pairs were generally consistent with each other and the multitemporal averaging slightly improved the performance compared to single pairs. Taking into account the global coverage of bistatic TanDEM-X data acquired for the global digital elevation model, our results show a potential for quantifying the tree height in small forest patches along the circum-Arctic treeline zone.', '[Antonova, Sofia; Hoefle, Bernhard; Anders, Katharina; Marx, Sabrina] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Geog, 3D Geospatial Data Proc Grp, Neuenheimer Feld 368, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.

Here we consider Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), which can be employed to detect surface deformation with a strong statistical link to eruption. Recent developments in technology as well as improved computational power have resulted in unprecedented quantities of monitoring data, which can no longer be inspected manually. The ability of machine learning to automatically identify signals of interest in these large InSAR datasets has already been demonstrated, but data-driven techniques, such as convolutional neutral networks (CNN) require balanced training datasets of positive and negative signals to effectively differentiate between real deformation and noise. As only a small proportion of volcanoes are deforming and atmospheric noise is ubiquitous, the use of machine learning for detecting volcanic unrest is more challenging than many other applications. In this paper, we address this problem using synthetic interferograms to train the AlexNet CNN. The synthetic interferograms are composed of 3 parts: 1) deformation patterns based on a Monte Carlo selection of parameters for analytic forward models, 2) stratified atmospheric effects derived from weather models and 3) turbulent atmospheric effects based on statistical simulations of correlated noise. The AlexNet architecture trained with synthetic data outperforms that trained using real interferograms alone, based on classification accuracy and positive predictive value (PPV). However, the models used to generate the synthetic signals are a simplification of the natural processes, so we retrain the CNN with a combined dataset consisting of synthetic models and selected real examples, achieving a final PPV of 82%. Although applying atmospheric corrections to the entire dataset is computationally expensive, it is relatively simple to apply them to the small subset of positive results. This further improves the detection performance without a significant increase in computational burden (PPV of 100%). Thus, we demonstrate that training with synthetic examples can improve the ability of CNNs to detect volcano deformation in satellite images, and propose an efficient workflow for the development of automated systems.', '[Anantrasirichai, N.; Bull, D.] Univ Bristol, Visual Informat Lab, Bristol, Avon, England.

Despite recent advances, assessments of cultural services still lack an explicit temporal dimension, which is relevant for developing monitoring systems. Here, we evaluate the spatiotemporal contributions of non-native trees to landscape aesthetics and nature recreation in a National Park in Portugal. We use a multimodel framework to understand how those cultural services (evaluated from social media photos) relate to the environmental context (physical and visual accessibility, and wilderness; derived from ancillary GIS data) and landscape visual-sensory features (colour diversity, landscape heterogeneity, and vegetation functioning). The latter were computed from satellite imagery (MODIS and Sentinel-2 MSI sensors) for the four seasons of the year: Winter, Spring, Summer and Autumn. We found that, during Autumn, contributions of non-native trees prevailed mostly in landscapes with greater colour diversity (green-band, Sentinel 2). During Spring, their contributions prevailed in landscapes with lower wilderness and heterogeneous levels. In Winter, those contributions were less evident in more remote areas. As for Summer, no significant relations were found for those cultural contributions. These results are congruent with the phenology of dominant tree species: deciduous natives occurring with coniferous non-natives and evergreen invaders, leading to higher colour diversity in Autumn, versus the dominance of blooming invaders in accessible areas during Spring. Results also seem to match the seasonal dynamics of touristic demand in the National Park: the pursuit of wilder areas for ecotourism in Winter, versus the experience of popular recreational activities in Summer. We discuss the usefulness of Earth observations in the research of cultural services and, particularly, for supporting SDG targets 15.8 (on invasive species), 8.9 (touristic revenues) and 12.8 (nature awareness).', '[Vaz, Ana Sofia; Goncalves, Joao F.; Pereira, Paulo; Santarem, Frederico; Vicente, Joana R.; Honrado, Joao P.] Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources InBIO CIBIO, Res Network Biodivers & Evolutionary Biol, Campus Agr Vairao,Rua Padre Armando Quintas, PT-4485661 Vairao, Portugal.

Terrestrial ecosystem and biosphere models, which are used to predict how ecosystems are expected to respond to changes in climate, atmospheric CO2, and land-use change, require accurate representations of plant canopy composition at large spatial scales. The ability to accurately specify plant canopy composition is important because it determines the physiological and ecological properties of plants (such as leaf photosynthetic capacity, patterns of plant carbon allocation and tissue turnover, and the resulting dynamics of plant demography) that govern the biophysical and biogeochemical functioning of ecosystems. Traditionally, plant canopy composition has been represented in a coarse-grained manner within terrestrial biosphere models, with ecosystems being comprised of a single plant functional type (PFT). However, models are increasingly seeking to represent fine-scale spatial variation in plant functional diversity. In this study, we show how imaging spectrometry measurements can provide spatially-comprehensive estimates of within-biome heterogeneity in PFT composition across a functionally diverse and topographically heterogeneous similar to 710 km(2) area in the Southern Sierra Mountains of California. AVIRIS (Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) data at 18 m resolution from the recent HyspIRI Preparatory Mission (Hyperspectral InfraRed Imager) were used to estimate the sub-pixel fractions of seven PFTs represented in the ED2 terrestrial biosphere model: Shrub, Oak, Western Hardwood, Western Pine, Cedar/Fir, and High-elevation Pine, plus a Grass/NPV (Non-Photosynthetic Vegetation) fraction using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA). ED2 is an individual-based terrestrial biosphere model capable of representing fine-scale sub-pixel ecosystem heterogeneity. Our results show that this methodology captures important elevation-related shifts in canopy composition that occur within the study area that are not resolved by existing multi-spectral land-cover products. These estimates modestly improved when the putative PFT endmembers considered in the mixture analysis were constrained using available geospatial data about the presence and absence of the PFTs in particular areas: the average RMSEs (root-mean-square errors) with the geospatially-constrained versus conventional method were 11.3% and 11.9% respectively, with larger reductions in the bias (i.e. mean error) in the abundances of Oak, Cedar/Fir, and Western Hardwood PFTs (ranging from 2.0% to 7.8%). At the hectare scale around four flux towers in the Southern Sierra Mountains, the overall composition improved from an RMSE of 18.2% (5.0-24.2% for individual PFTs) to an RMSE of 9.5% (3.3-13.2% for individual PFTs). Downgrading AVIRIS to 30 m resolution resulted in a reduction in accuracy of the constrained method to an RMSE of 12.7% (0-23.7%) with < 1% change in the bias for all tree and shrub PFTs. Our results demonstrate that imaging spectrometry measurements from planned satellite missions such as HyspIRI, EnMAP (Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program), and HISUI (Hyper-spectral Imager SUIte) can provide important and much-needed information about fine-scale heterogeneity in the composition of plant canopies for constraining and improving terrestrial ecosystem and biosphere model simulations of regional- and global-scale vegetation dynamics and function.', '[Bogan, Stacy A.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Geog Anal, 1737 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.

Different from traditional machine learning methods, deep CNN-based methods convolve the entire input image to extract multi-level spatial and spectral features, and then deconvolve these features to produce the detailed segmentation. In this way, multi-level features from the whole image and all the bands are utilized to label each pixel as cloud, thin cloud, cloud shadow or clear. An adaption of SegNet with 13 convolutional layers and 13 deconvolution layers is proposed in this study. The method is applied to 38 Landsat 7 images and 32 Landsat 8 images which are globally distributed and have pixel-wise cloud and cloud shadow reference masks provided by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). In order to process such large images using the adapted SegNet model on a desktop computer, the Landsat Collection 1 scenes are split into non-overlapping 512 * 512 30 m pixel image blocks. 60% of these blocks are used to train the model using the backpropagation algorithm, 10% of the blocks are used to validate the model and tune its parameters, and the remaining 30% of the blocks are used for performance evaluation.

The proposed method benefits from the multi-level spatial and spectral features, and results in more than a 40% increase in user\'s accuracy and in more than a 20% increase in producer\'s accuracy for cloud shadow detection in Landsat 8 imagery.

Landsat image data is a valuable 30-meter resolution source of spatial information to assess forest conditions over time. Together both operational Landsat satellites-7 and 8 provide a revisit frequency of 8 days at the equator. This moderate temporal frequency provides essential information to detect annual large area abrupt land cover changes. However, the ability to measure subtle and short lived intraseasonal changes is challenged by gaps in Landsat imagery at key points in time. The first Sentinel-2 satellite mission was launched by the European Space Agency in 2015. This moderate resolution data stream provides an opportunity to supplement the Landsat data record. The objective of this study is to assess the potential for integrating top of atmosphere Landsat and Sentinel 2 image data archived in the Google Earth Engine compute environment. In this paper we assess absolute and proportional differences in near-contemporaneous observations for six bands with comparable spectral response functions and spatial resolution between the Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Instrument and Landsat Operational Land Imager and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus imagery. We assessed differences using absolute difference metrics and major axis linear regression between over 10,000 image pairs across the conterminous United States and present cross sensor transformation models. Major axis linear regression results indicate that Sentinel MSI data are as spectrally comparable to the two types of Landsat image data as the Landsat sensors are with each other. Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values ranging from 0.0121 to 0.0398 were obtained between MSI and Landsat spectral values, and RMSD values ranging from 0.0124 and 0.0372 were obtained between OLI and ETM +.

Satellite altimetry has provided data for inland water bodies. The height that is derived from altimetry measurement is ellipsoidal height. In order to convert the ellipsoidal height to orthometric height, which has physical meaning, accurate estimates of the geoid are needed. This paper evaluates the suitability of geodetic altimetric measurements for improvement of global geoid models over a large lake in the Tibetan Plateau. CryoSat-2 and SARAL/AltiKa are used to derive the high-frequency geoid correction. A validation of the local geoid correction is performed with data from in-situ observations, a laser altimetry satellite (ICESat), a Ka-band radar altimetry satellite (SARAL) and a SAR radar altimetry satellite (Sentinel-3). Results indicate that the geodetic altimetric dataset can capture the high-resolution geoid information. By applying local geoid correction, the precision of ICESat, SARAL and Sentinel-3 retrievals are significantly improved. We conclude that using geodetic altimetry to correct for local geoid residual over large lakes significantly decreases the uncertainty of WSE estimates. These results also indicate the potential of geodetic altimetry missions to determine local geoid residual with centimeter-level accuracy, which can be used to improve global and regional geopotential models.', '[Jiang, Liguang; Bauer-Gottwein, Peter] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.

The extent of plantation forests and management dynamics can be difficult to ascertain from periodic forest inventories, yet short-rotation tree plantations also present challenges for remote sensing. Here, we integrated spectral, temporal, and structural information from airborne and satellite platforms to distinguish pine plantations from natural forests and evaluate the contribution from planted forests to regional forest cover in the southeastern U.S. Within flight lines from NASA Goddard\'s Lidar, Hyperspectral, and Thermal (G-LiHT) Airborne Imager, lidar metrics of forest structure had the highest overall accuracy for pine plantations among single-source classifications (90%), but the combination of spectral and temporal metrics from Landsat generated comparable accuracy (91%). Combined structural, temporal, and spectral information from G-LiHT and Landsat had the highest accuracy for plantations (92%) and natural forests (88%). At a regional scale, classifications using Landsat spectral and temporal metrics had between 74 and 82% mean class accuracy for plantations. Regionally, plantations accounted for 28% of forest cover in the southeastern U.S., a result similar to plot-based estimates, albeit with greater spatial detail. Regional maps of plantation forests differed from existing map products, including the National Land Cover Database. Combining plantation extent in 2011 with Landsat-based forest change data identified strong regional gradients in plantation dynamics since 1985, with distinct spatial patterns of rotation age (east-west) and plantation expansion (interior). Our analysis demonstrates the potential to improve the characterization of dynamic land cover classes, including economically important timber plantations, by integrating diverse remote sensing datasets.

The area is primarily an agricultural region where dependence on groundwater is documented. Such a reliance on ground water resources in a region which is characterized by very low precipitation can lead to significant land subsidence as was observed in this study which identified fast and localized deformation trends. The quantification of ground deformations of large magnitude and small amplitude in this area with SAR Interferometry is a challenging task using moderate resolution data due to the incoherent surface background. Even though SAR acquisitions were sparse over this region, the available ENVISAT, ALOS and Sentinel-1A imagery was analysed with differential interferometry and the Small Baseline Subset technique in order to provide estimates about the evolution of the deformation pattern in a limited area. A clear evidence of subsidence phenomena has been identified in the study area. During the period 2003-2010 the subsidence was estimated to reach 18 cm/year as observed in the DInSAR processing results of data from ENVISAT and ALOS Satellites. However it appears to be slightly more stable during the recent past (Dec/2016-March/2018) as observed in the results with recent Sentinel-1 data where a maximum localized subsidence in the order of 10 cm was estimated.

Local anomalies of wind, waves, currents or surfactants appear on the images as local anomalies of brightness. A quantitative interpretation of those brightness anomalies must relate them to slope properties of the wave field, which are to the lowest order described by the mean square slope (mss).   The prevailing paradigm for such interpretation is that of the critical zenith angle. It states that, for subcritical zenith view angle, brightness and mss anomalies have opposite signs, and this defines the so-called inversion region. This prevailing paradigm implicitly builds on the assumption that the mss decomposition between upwind and crosswind components is conserved. The mss anomalies are then isotropic and can be reduced to a scalar (i.e. one-dimensional) quantity. In such a case, one single sunglint image would be sufficient to retrieve the mss anomaly. This isotropic case likely applies for surface wave changes induced by varying wind speed or by surfactants.   Yet, satellite and airborne observations at multiple view angles recently revealed anisotropic mss anomalies, e.g. with mss increase in the upwind direction and decrease in the crosswind direction. This anisotropic behavior likely characterizes wave modulations by anisotropic surface current gradients. This paper details the expected properties of such anisotropic mss modulations. It is shown that: 1) The classical concept of critical angle does not systematically hold, neither for frontal current shear nor for internal wave divergence. 2) At least two sunglint images at different zenith and azimuth angles are needed to retrieve the mss anomalies, and a single observation is not sufficient. 3) A satellite with radiometers looking at multiple zenith angles is capable of providing a geometry favorable to retrieve mss anomalies. An illustration is discussed with internal waves observed by the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), where the upwind and crosswind components of the retrieved mss anomalies are anisotropic.

This study used Shenzhen, a southern coastal city in China, as an example to explore the relationship between spatial variation of LST in different seasons and the influencing factors in five dimensions, integrating the methods of ordinary least-squares regression, stepwise regression, all-subsets regression, and hierarchical partitioning analysis. The results showed that the most important factor affecting spatial heterogeneity of LST in summer was the normalized difference build-up index (53.62%, for contributing rate), whereas in the transition season the most important factor was the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (47.84%). In winter the construction land percentage and NDVI (26.84% and 25.56%, respectively) were the most influential. Artificial surface and green space had a dominant effect on LST spatial differentiation. Landscape configuration and diversity were not the dominant influencing factors in summer or in the transition season. Furthermore, the independent contribution rate of the Shannon diversity index (SHDI) reached 8.79% in the transition season, while in winter, the independent contribution rates of SHDI and the landscape shape index were 8.52% and 3.45%, respectively. The influence of landscape diversity and configuration factors tended to increase as LST reduced, while the contribution rate of the important factors such as artificial surface and green space decreased significantly. These relationships indicate that the influence of landscape configuration and diversity factors on LST is relatively weak, and can be easily concealed by the influence of landscape components, especially when the spatial variation of LST is not strong.

This DTM-independent approach was developed to avoid the need for a detailed DTM, which is instead required in traditional photogrammetry to obtain relative heights above the terrain. The method, following an Area Based Approach (ABA), was tested in a boreal forest on a flat area in Norway and in a temperate mixed forest in a mountain steep terrain in Italy, on the basis of aerial images acquired with a SenseFly eBee Ag fixed-wing UAV.   The plot level predictive performance of the models based on the DTM-independent metrics were evaluated against the results based on two more traditional approaches based on: (i) metrics from UAV photogrammetric data normalized using a DTM from airborne laser scanning (ALS), and (ii) metrics from ALS data. Percent root mean square error of predictions against measured values (RMSE % ) was used for quantifying the performance of the different tests.   Results revealed that the DTM-independent approach produced comparable results with both the traditional photogrammetric and ALS methods (the RMSE % ranged between 15.9% and 16.7% in Italy, and between 16.3% and 17.9% in Norway).

Spatially explicit crop-type information can be used to estimate crop areas for a variety of monitoring and decision-making applications such as crop insurance, land rental, supply-chain logistics, and financial market forecasting. However, there is no publically available spatially explicit in-season crop-type classification information for the U.S. Corn Belt (a landscape predominated by corn and soybean). Instead, researchers and decision-makers have to wait until four to six months after harvest to have such information from the previous year. The state-of-the-art research on crop-type classification has been shifted from relying on only spectral features of single static images to combining together spectral and time-series information. While Landsat data have a desirable spatial resolution for field-level crop-type classification, the ability to extract temporal phenology information based on Landsat data remains a challenge due to low temporal revisiting frequency and inevitable cloud contamination. To address this challenge and generate accurate, cost-effective, and in-season crop-type classification, this research uses the USDA\'s Common Land Units (CLUs) to aggregate spectral information for each field based on a time-series Landsat image data stack to largely overcome the cloud contamination issue while exploiting a machine learning model based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) and high-performance computing for intelligent and scalable computation of classification processes. Experiments were designed to evaluate what information is most useful for training the machine learning model for crop-type classification, and how various spatial and temporal factors affect the crop-type classification performance in order to derive timely crop type information. All experiments were conducted over Champaign County located in central Illinois, and a total of 1322 Landsat multi-temporal scenes including all the six optical spectral bands spanning from 2000 to 2015 were used. Computational experiments show the inclusion of temporal phenology information and evenly distributed spatial training samples in the study domain improves classification performance. The shortwave infrared bands show notably better performance than the widely used visible and near-infrared bands for classifying corn and soybean. In comparison with USDA\'s Crop Data Layer (CDL), this study found a relatively high Overall Accuracy (i.e. the number of the corrected classified fields divided by the number of the total fields) of 96% for classifying corn and soybean across all CLU fields in the Champaign County from 2000 to 2015. Furthermore, our approach achieved 95% Overall Accuracy by late July of the concurrent year for classifying corn and soybean. The findings suggest the methodology presented in this paper is promising for accurate, cost-effective, and in-season classification of field-level crop types, which may be scaled up to large geographic extents such as the U.S. Corn Belt.', '[Cai, Yaping; Wang, Shaowen] Univ Illinois, Dept Geog & Geog Informat Sci, CyberGIS Ctr Adv Digital & Spatial Studies, Urbana, IL USA.

This is introduced by assessing the total product error of optical, satellite data-based, Fractional Snow Cover (FSC) estimates. Here the FSC estimation is based on an algorithm allowing the consideration of the effect of different error sources; a semi-empirical reflectance model describing the relationship of the observed reflectance and FSC through several variables and parameters. We assume that after the statistical error analysis, the remaining portion of total product error arises due to systematic factors. Hence, first we define a statistical error component through the theory of error propagation, and then estimate the total product error (PE) by using in situ observations on FSC, and finally derive the systematic error from these two error components. The experimental approach for estimating PE is conducted through an analysis of the observed estimation errors (i.e. residuals) in the GlobSnow Snow Extent (SE) v2.1 products on FSC. In practice, independent in situ snow course observations from Finland on FSC are compared to corresponding satellite FSC estimates to quantify the residuals. The approach is then illustrated for an extended region of corresponding European boreal forest. Our results show that the total PE in the GlobSnow FSC product is significantly higher than the originally provided statistical error. This is due to deficiencies in the parameterization of the applied forward modelling approach, in particular in the consideration of the forest canopy effects.', '[Salminen, Miia; Pulliainen, Jouni; Ikonen, Jaakko; Luojus, Kari] Finnish Meteorol Inst, POB 503, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland.

Therefore, it is important to accurately measure the strain of fast ice and its seasonal variations, and to identify the cause of stresses on the ice. In this paper, we separate the strains from glacial stress and tidal stress of fast ice near the Campbell Glacier Tongue (CGT) in Terra Nova Bay, East Antarctica. This was done using observations from a series of one-day tandem COSMO-SkyMed Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) images obtained from December 2010 to January 2012. Firstly, we discriminated fast ice from pack ice and open water by analyzing the interferometric coherence values. We then identified the characteristics of the strains by investigating the equidisplacement lines of fringes in weekly InSAR and double-differential InSAR (DDInSAR) images. The weekly InSAR images predominantly showed glacial shear strain of the fast ice with fringes parallel to the sides of the CGT. This was due to the cumulative flow of the CGT for a week, while oscillating tidal signals were relatively small. The DDInSAR images, which cancelled glacial strain rates in two one-day InSAR images, showed a deformation of the fast ice by tidal sea surface tilt, with the fringes parallel to the coastline. Based on the unique characteristics of these strains, we separated them from the one-day InSAR images by decomposing the fringe patterns into glacial and tidal strain. Glacial shear strain rates of fast ice attached to the east of the CGT decreased from May to August owing to ice thickening and then stabilized until December. Those to the west of the CGT increased from May to July. This was possibly due to bottom melting of the ice by the increased ocean circulation during the expansion period of the nearby polynya. The glacial strain then decreased until December because of reduced polynya activity. The fast ice near the Jang Bogo Station (JBS) only showed tidal strain as it was isolated from the CGT by cracks and leads. Tidal strain rates of the fast ice were strongly correlated with the magnitude of tidal variations in all these regions, which represents shows that the tidal strain represents tidal sea surface tilt. The tidal response of fast ice to the west of the CGT and near the JBS was stronger than that to the east of the CGT, probably owing to thinner ice thickness there.', '[Han, Hyangsun] Korea Polar Res Inst, Unit Arctic Sea Ice Predict, Incheon 21990, South Korea.

SIC has been used as a primary data source for climate change prediction and ship navigation. However, the accuracy of PM SIC is typically low and biased in summer. To provide more accurate information for climatic research and ship navigation, it is necessary to evaluate quantitatively the accuracy of PM SIC and to account for its errors. In this research, we evaluated the SIC data derived from PM measurements using four representative sea ice algorithms: NASA Team (NT), Bootstrap (BT), Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSISAF) hybrid, and Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction STudy (ARTIST) Sea Ice (ASI). Analyses were performed for the Chukchi Sea in summer using KOrean Multi-Purpose SATellite-5 (KOMPSAT-5) Enhanced Wide-swath synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Ice/water maps were generated by binary classification of texture features in the SAR images based on Random Forest, a rule-based machine learning approach. SIC values estimated from the sea ice algorithms showed good correlation with those calculated from the KOMPSAT-5 ice/water maps, but the root mean square error was larger than 10%. SIC values estimated from the algorithms showed different error trends according to the KOMPSAT-5 SIC range. All algorithms overestimated SIC values in open drift ice zones (KOMPSAT-5 SICs ranged from 0% to 15%). In marginal ice zones (SICs ranged from 15% to 80%), the OSISAF SIC values were the least biased compared to those from KOMPSAT-5. The NT algorithm largely underestimated SIC values in marginal ice zones, while the BT and ASI algorithms overestimated them considerably. All algorithms, except for BT, underestimated SIC in consolidated pack ice zones (SICs ranged from 80% to 100%). By analyzing the correlations of biases of SIC from the algorithms with the numerical weather prediction (NWP) data from the European Reanalysis Agency Interim reanalysis, it was found that the overestimation of NT and ASI SICs was largely influenced by atmospheric water vapor content, while the underestimation of NT and OSISAF SICs was owing to ice surface melting. The overestimation of BT SICs was not significantly correlated with the NWP data. The underestimated SIC from the BT and ASI algorithms for high SIC regions might be compensated by the atmospheric water vapor content. The differences in SIC values estimated from each algorithm were due to different sensitivities to atmospheric water vapor content in the regions with KOMPSAT-5 SIC lower than 40% and to ice surface melting in the regions with higher KOMPSAT-5 SIC.', '[Han, Hyangsun; Kim, Hyun-cheol] Korea Polar Res Inst, Unit Arctic Sea Ice Predict, Incheon, South Korea.', 'Korea Polar Research Institute (KOPRI)RP Kim, HC (通讯作者)，Korea Polar Res Inst, Unit Arctic Sea Ice Predict, Incheon, South Korea.', 'kimhc@kopri.re.krRI Han, Hyangsun/AAE-7670-2022; Kim, Hyun-Cheol/AAP-1250-2020', 'Han, Hyangsun/0000-0002-0414-519X; Kim, Hyun-Cheol/0000-0002-6831-9291', 'Korea Polar Research Institute (KOPRI) [PE18120]; Korea Polar Research   Institute of Marine Research Placement (KOPRI) [PE18120] Funding Source:   Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information (KISTI), National   Science & Technology Information Service (NTIS)', 'This research was supported by the Korea Polar Research Institute   (KOPRI) Grant PE18120 (Research on analytical technique for satellite   observation of Arctic sea ice).

The study area was in Burkina Faso, and the response variable of interest was firewood volume (m(3)/ha). A sample consisting of 160 field plots was selected from the population following a two-stage sampling design. Models were fit using weighted least squares; the population mean, mu, and the variance of the estimator of the population mean, V ((mu) over cap), were estimated using two inferential frameworks, model-based and model-assisted, and compared. For each framework, V((mu) over cap) was estimated both analytically and empirically. Empirical variances were estimated using bootstrapping that accounted for the two-stage sampling. The primary results were twofold. First, for the effects of spatial resolution and subpixel information, four conclusions are relevant: (1) finer spatial resolution imagery indeed contributed to greater precision for estimators of population parameter, but despite the finer spatial resolution of RapidEye, the increase was only marginal, on the order of 10% for model-based variance estimators and 36% for model assisted variance estimators; (2) subpixel information on texture was marginally beneficial for inference of large area population parameters; (3) RapidEye did not offer enough of an improvement to justify its cost relative to the free Landsat 8 imagery; and (4) for a given plot size, candidate remote sensing auxiliary datasets are more cost-effective when their spatial resolutions are similar to the plot size than with much finer alternatives. Second, for the comparison between estimators, three conclusions are relevant: (1) sampling distribution for the model based V((mu) over cap) was more concentrated and smaller on the order of 42% to 59% than that for the model-assisted V((mu) over cap), suggesting superior consistency and efficiency of model-based inference to model-assisted inference; (2) bootstrapping is an effective alternative to analytical variance estimators; and (3) prediction accuracy expressed by RMSE is useful for screening candidate models to be used for population inferences.', '[Hou, Zhengyang; Greenberg, Jonathan A.; Xu, Qing] Univ Nevada, Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Reno, NV 89667 USA.

We used satellite-derived products in combination with an extensive data set of ship-based observations to develop an unprecedented multi-year time-series of pCO(2) and air-sea flux of CO2 in the northern Gulf of Mexico for the period 2006-2010. A regression tree algorithm was used to relate satellite-derived products for chlorophyll, sea surface temperature, and dissolved and detrital organic matter to ship observations of pCO(2). The resulting relationship had an r(2) of 0.827 and a prediction error of 31.7 mu atm pCO(2) (root mean-squared error of the relationship was 28.8 mu atm). Using a wind speed and gas exchange relationship along with satellite winds, estimates of air-sea flux of CO2 were derived yielding an average annual flux over the period 2006-2010 of -0.8 to -1.5 (annual mean = -1.1 +/- 0.3) mol C m(-2) y(-1), where the negative value indicates net ocean uptake. The estimated total annual CO2 flux for the study region was -4.3 + 1.1 Tg C y(-1) Relationships of satellite-derived pCO(2) with salinity were consistent with shipboard observations and exhibited a concave relationship with low values at mid- and low salinities attributed to strong biological drawdown of CO2 in the high productivity river-mixing zone. The time-series of satellite-derived pCO(2) was characterized by a seasonal pattern with values lower during winter and spring, low to intermediate values during fall, and higher and more variable values during summer. These findings were similar to simulations from a coupled physical-biogeochemical model. A seasonal pattern was also evident in the air-sea flux of CO2 with generally more negative fluxes (i.e., ocean uptake) during winter and spring, and positive fluxes during summer months with fall being a period of transition. Interannual variations in annual means of both air-sea flux of CO2 and DIN loading were significant, with higher DIN loading coinciding in some cases with more negative air-sea flux of CO2 (i.e., net ocean uptake). Spatial patterns of pCO(2) reflected regional environmental forcing including effects of river discharge, wind forcing, and shelf-slope circulation. Our study also illustrates the utility of satellite extrapolation for highlighting areas that may contribute significantly to regional signals and for guiding prioritization of locations for acquiring further observations. The approach should be readily applicable to other regions given adequate availability of in situ observations for algorithm development.', '[Lohrenz, S.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products have been widely used for regional hydrological modeling. However, data gaps in snow products due to frequent clouds remain a serious problem, particularly for daily products. This paper presents a spatio-temporal modeling technique for filling up data gaps in daily snow cover estimates, based on time series of Terra/Aqua MODIS images. The spatio-temporal modeling technique integrates MODIS spectral information, spatial and temporal contextual information, and environmental association within a Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) framework. The performance of our new technique is quantitatively evaluated by comparing our snow cover estimates with in situ observations at 33 SNOTEL stations as well as to original MODIS snow cover products over the Upper Rio Grande Basin during 2006-2008 snow seasons. Mainly due to cloud obscuration, there are as high as 32% data gaps in original Terra/Aqua combined MODIS snow products. Our HMRF technique reduced cloud-cover related data gaps to < 1% and achieved a snow -mapping accuracy of 88.0% for the gap-filled areas. For the areas not covered by clouds, our HMRF-based technique also improved the snow cover estimate accuracy of original MODIS snow products by 3.5%, from 85.1% to 88.6%. When spatio-temporal contextual information and environmental association information are progressively incorporated within the HMRF framework, the overall snow mapping accuracies are improved and omission errors are reduced. Particularly, our HMRF-based technique increased the snow product accuracy by 4.2% during whole transition periods, and by 6.2% in March during snow melt. The snow mapping accuracies were significantly improved over evergreen forests and mixed forests.', '[Huang, Yan; Liu, Hongxing; Yu, Bailang; We, Jianping] East China Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Geog Informat Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.

BESS captured the interannual variability of SW at both the site (a majority of long-term BSRN sites) and continental levels. Over the study period, global annual SW; PAR, and PAR(dif) values did not show any dimming or brightening trends, although these trends appeared at regional levels, e.g. dimming in India. Mean annual SW over the global land surface was 184.8 W m(-2) (875 ZJ yr(-1), zetta = 10(21)); 46% of SW was partitioned to PAR, which was further split into direct (59%) and diffuse (41%) components. The developed products will be useful in solar energy harvesting research and will improve water, carbon, and energy flux estimates of terrestrial ecosystems from local to the global scales.', '[Ryu, Youngryel] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Rural Syst Engn, Seoul 151921, South Korea.

IWV data from GPS in nine ground based stations located in the Iberian Peninsula are used as reference. The study period extends from 2007 to 2012. The results show that, in general, OMI has good accuracy (pseudomedian of the relative differences between OMI and GPS IWV of (-0.7 +/- 1.1)%). However, OMI, SCIAMACHY and AIRS show higher inter quartile range (IQR) (which indicates lower precision) than the rest of satellite instruments. Both MODIS satellite instruments and SEVIRI products tend to slightly underestimate reference IWV data while GOME-2 exhibits a notable overestimation (16.7 +/- 0.8%). All satellite instruments showed a tendency to reduce IWV extreme values: low IWV is overestimated while high IWV is underestimated. As for the influence of solar zenith angle (SZA), it can be observed that GOME-2 strongly overestimates the reference for high SZA values (by around 60% for SZA 60 - 80 degrees). OMI shows, however, a high IQR for high SZA values. Both MODIS instruments show an increase in the pseudomedian of relative differences and IQR with SZA at daytime, with more stable values at night. Seasonal dependence is mainly due to the SZA and IWV typical values in each season. In general, in summer the tendency is to underestimate with low IQR (which happens when IWV is high and SZA is low), and in winter the trend is to overestimate with high IQR (which happens when IWV is low and SZA is high). SCIAMACHY shows a high pseudomedian in summer and autumn, and lower in winter and spring. It must be noted that GOME-2 shows a higher overestimation and OMI shows a higher IQR than other satellite instruments in winter and autumn. The influence of clouds was also studied, showing an increase of IQR as cloudiness increases in all satellites. Pseudomedian also worsens as cloudiness increases, generally.', '[Vaquero-Martinez, Javier; Anton, Manuel] Univ Extremadura, Dept Fis, Badajoz, Spain.

Our approach relies on the availability of a multi-temporal set of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data collected from ascending and descending orbits over an area of interest, and also permits us to estimate the vertical and horizontal (East-West) components of the Earth\'s surface deformation. The adopted methodology is based on an advanced cloud computing implementation of the differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) Parallel Small Baseline Subset (P-SBAS) processing chain which allows the unsupervised processing of large SAR data volumes, from the raw data (level-0) imagery up to the generation of the corresponding DInSAR time series and maps. The solution presented, which is highly scalable, has been tested on ascending and descending ENVISAT SAR archives comprising approximately 400 GB of data, which have been acquired over a large area of southern California (US) that extends over about 90,000 km(2). Such an input dataset has been processed in parallel by exploiting 280 computing nodes of the Amazon Web Services Cloud environment The overall processing lasted about 8 h and cost approximately $1900 USD. Moreover, to produce the final mean deformation velocity maps of the vertical and horizontal (East-West) displacement components of the whole investigated area, we also took advantage of the information available from external GPS measurements that permit us to account for possible regional trends not easily detectable by DInSAR and to refer the P-SBAS measurements to an external geodetic datum.   The results presented clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach that paves the way to the extensive use of the available ERS-1/2 and ENVISAT SAR data archives. Furthermore, the proposed methodology can be particularly suitable to deal with the very large data flow provided by the Sentinel-1 constellation, thus permitting the extension of the DInSAR analyses at a nearly global scale.

Empirical case studies however showed that the relationship between Fourier texture features and forest AGB varies across forest types and regions of the world, limiting model transferability. A better understanding of the biophysical mechanisms on which canopy texture forest AGB relation relies is a prerequisite to move toward broad scale applications. Here we simulated VHSR optical canopy scenes in identical sun-sensor geometry for 279 1-ha tropical forest inventory plots distributed across the tropics. Our aim was to assess the respective merits and complementarity of two types of texture analysis techniques (i.e. Fourier and lacunarity) on a set of forests with contrasted structure and geographical origin, and develop a general texture-based approach for tropical forest AGB mapping. Across forests, Fourier texture captured a gradient of stands mean crown size reflecting well the progressive changes in stand structure throughout forest aggradation phase (e.g. Pearson\'s r = - 0.42 with basal area) while lacunarity texture captured a gradient of canopy openness (, i.e. Pearson\'s r = - 0.57 with stand gap fraction). Both types of texture indices were highly complementary for predicting forest AGB at the global level (so-called FL-model). The residual error of the FL-model was structured across sites and could be partially captured with a bioclimatic proxy, further improving the performance of the global model (so-called FLE-model) and reducing site-level biases. The FLE model was tested on a set of real Pleiades images covering a mosaic of high-biomass forests in the Congo basin (mean AGB over 49 field plots: 359 98 Mg ha(-1)), leading to a significant relationship (R-2 = 0.47 on validation data) with reasonable error levels (< 25% rRMSE). The increasing availability of VHSR optical sensors (such as from constellations of small satellite platforms) raises the possibility of routine repeated imaging of the world\'s tropical forests and suggests that texture-based analyses could become an essential tool in international efforts to monitor carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradations (REDD +).', '[Ploton, P.; Barbier, N.; Couteron, P.; Antin, C.

The MOD04/MYD04 has different data coverage for the DT and the DB algorithms due to differences in their retrieval methods. Recently in the collection 6 (C6), a DT and DB merged (DTBC6) AOD product has been introduced based on different thresholds of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to improve the data coverage. The main objective of this study is to increase the data coverage and reduce the error in the merged DTBC6 AOD product by introducing three new customized methods (DTBMX): (i) DTBM1: \"use an average of the DT and DB AOD retrievals or the available one for all the NDVI values\", as it is independent of the NDVI values, (ii) DTBM2: \"use an average of the DT and DB AOD retrievals or the available one for NDVI >= 0.2, and use the DB retrievals for NDVI < 0.2\", and (iii) DTBM3: \"use AOD retrievals from the DB algorithm for NDVI NDVI > 0.3, and use an average of the DT and DB retrievals or the available one for NDVI <= 0.3\". Validation of the DTBMX is conducted at a global scale from 2004 to 2014 using AERONET AOD measurements from 68 sites located in Asia (9), Europe (22), Southern Africa (8), and North (23) and South America (8), and for comparison purpose, the DTBC6 is evaluated for the same period. Results showed that the number of coincident observations of the DTBMX methods compared to the DTBC6 is increased by 31%, 41% 30%, and 108% for Asian, European, Southern African, and North and South American sites, respectively. At global scale, the number of coincident observations are increased for the DTBM1, DTBM2, and DTBM3 from 29,088 for DTBC6, to 45,937, 45,028, 37,393 which are 58%, 57%, and 29%, respectively more than the for DTBC6 observations. For an equal number of coincident observations, the percentage of retrievals within the EE is increased by between 17% to 20% and the RMSE is decreased by up to 15% for the DTBMX methods, but R is the same as for the DTBC6. The percentage above the EE is also decreased by between 43% to 55% due to greater contribution of the DB retrievals. Overall, the performance of all the DTBMX methods is much better than the DTBC6, but the DTBM1 is the most robust as it is independent of NDVI values, and significantly increases the data coverage. Therefore, it can be used operationally for global merged AOD retrievals. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Identifying the presence of cloud in a ground scene and establishing an accurate and adequate cloud mask is a challenging task. In this study, measurements by the European Space Agency (ESA) MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) have been used to develop a cloud identification and cloud mask algorithm for preprocessing prior to application of the new algorithm called eXtensible Bremen AErosol Retrieval (XBAER), which retrieves AOT. The new XBAER cloud identification and cloud mask algorithm is called XBAER-CM. This uses thresholds of the reflectance and reflectance ratios measured by MERIS at Top Of Atmosphere (TOA). In this study the parameters used to determine the presence of cloud in ground scenes are i) the brightness of the scenes, ii) the homogeneity or variability of the radiance and iii) cloud height or altitude information. The threshold values used to identify the presence of cloud are selected by using accurate radiative transfer modeling with different surface and atmospheric scenarios. A histogram analysis has been used for different cloud (thin, thick, two-layers, aerosol contaminated cloud), aerosol (dust and biomass burning) and surface scenarios (vegetation, urban, desert and water). Additionally, a snow/ice detection algorithm has been adapted from MerIs Cloud fRation fOr Sciamachy (MICROS) algorithm.   A validation for the resulting cloud mask data products has been undertaken. This comprised i) comparison of regions scenes, which have beenmanually generated by experts and ii) more global comparisonwith cloud identification data products from surface synoptic observations (SYNOP) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). As a part of verification and validation, the XBAER-CM results have been shown to be in good agreement with the \"manually\"-created masks, considered to be the true reference for a set of challenging scenarios. The overall accuracy compared with SYNOP and CALIOP are 84.4% and 83.2%, respectively. The XBAER-CM data product is a standalone data product but valuable for use with algorithms, which retrieve other cloud, aerosol and surface parameters from the measurements of MERIS and the follow on instruments such as Sentinel 3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) now in space.

Due to sparse distribution of in-situ soil moisture networks, over the last two decades, several active and passive radar satellite missions have been launched to provide information that can be used to estimate surface conditions and subsequently soil moisture content of the upper few cm soil layers. Some recent studies reported the potential of satellite altimeter backscatter to estimate SSM, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. They also pointed out some difficulties of such technique including: (i) the noisy behavior of the backscatter estimations mainly caused by surface water in the radar foot-print, (ii) the assumptions for converting altimetry backscatter to SSM, and (iii) the need for interpolating between the tracks.   In this study, we introduce a new inversion framework to retrieve soil moisture information from along-track altimetry measurements. First, 20Hz along-track nadir radar backscatter is estimated by post-processing waveforms from Jason-2 (Ku-and C-Band during 2008-2014) and Envisat (Ku-and S-Band during 2002-2008). This provides backscatter measurements every similar to 300m along-track within every similar to 10 days from Jason, and every similar to 35days from Envisat observations. Empirical orthogonal base-functions (EOFs) are then derived from soil moisture simulations of a hydrological model, and used as constraints within the inversion. Finally, along-track altimetry reconstructed surface soil moisture (ARSSM) storage is inverted by fitting these EOFs to the altimeter backscatter. The framework is tested in arid and semiarid Western Australia, for which a high resolution hydrological model (the Australian Water Resource Assessment, AWRA model) is available. Our ARSSM products are also validated against Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) L3 products, for which maximum correlation coefficients of bigger than 0.8 are found. Our results also indicate that ARSSM can validate the simulation of hydrological models at least at seasonal time scales. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

While impervious surfaces are associated with degraded soil conditions, rerouted hydrological networks and urban microclimates, the overall impact of these effects on tree development is highly variable. This study examines this relationship at two spatial scales: within the individual tree\'s local environment and across the broad-scale urban landscape. Using a fusion of airborne hyperspectral imagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, a 1.0 m spatial resolution classified land cover map (accuracy of 88.6%) was produced for the city of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, from which landscape imperviousness was then derived. The stem heights of 1914 trees were estimated from the LiDAR data, to which species-specific height models were fit using planting dates recorded by city authorities. Having accounted for the age of the trees, the residuals from these models (i.e.: the difference between modelled and measured height) were then used as indicators of tree development. When aggregated to 0.5 km(2) spatial units, negative relationships (r(2) between 0.292 and 0.753) were found between height model residuals and the degree of land cover imperviousness. These relationships did not persist when examined at the individual tree level, for which imperviousness was measured within the direct vicinity of each tree using the same imperviousness map. We conclude that, using this approach, imperviousness does not appear to be a significant driver of tree height variation, with broad-scale relationships likely due to correlations with other environmental variables associated with the urban-rural gradient. Despite some limitations, the integration of hyperspectral and LiDAR data proved to be a powerful tool for mapping imperviousness, with LiDAR metrics being particularly important for distinguishing between types of urban land cover.

A number of studies have used satellite observations to estimate the severity of the blooms through estimating the bloom size and duration. However, a critical bloom parameter, namely biomass, has never been objectively determined due to lack of measurements. In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted to measure U. prolifera biomass (wet weight) per unit area and the corresponding spectral reflectance, through which a robust relationship has been established to link biomass per area to the reflectance-based floating algae index (FAI). The lab-based model has been validated with in situ measurements, with an estimated relative uncertainty of < 16% for algae with FAI values < 0.2 (corresponding to 2 Icg/m(2) biomass and accounting for > 99.5% of the algae-containing pixels in satellite images). The model was further transferred to MODIS Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R-rc), where aerosol impacts on the model were simulated under various atmospheric conditions. The simulations showed an average of 6.5% (up to 12.3% for the extreme case) uncertainties in biomass estimates when MODIS R-rc data were used as the model inputs. The dry biomass per wet biomass and carbon and nitrogen contents per dry biomass were also determined through lab experiments, thus making their estimation possible from MODIS R-rc data. The model was then applied to time-series of MODIS observations over the YS between 2008 and 2015 to determine the inter-annual variability of these critical parameters. Results showed maximum daily biomass of > 1.7 million tons during June 2015 and minimum daily biomass of < 0.09 million tons during 2012.

A number of studies have focused on retrieval of the total precipitable water (TPW) using microwave or optical remote sensing. In this paper, the global quarter-degree gridded TPW over land was retrieved using water vapor sensitivity parameter Delta Tb-18.7/Delta Tb-23.8 based on the combination of AMSR-E and MODIS observations. There are two major improvements in the retrieval algorithm, including optimization of the estimation model of surface emissivity Delta epsilon(18.7)/Delta epsilon(23.8) and correction of the terrain influence to the retrieval of TPW using DEM. To obtain a high resolution TPW, we also developed an algorithm to downscale the retrieved quarter-degree gridded TPW to a fine scale of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees using DEM and NDVI. In addition, the downscaled TPW was further calibrated using high precision TPW from MODIS in the clear-sky condition to improve its accuracy. Finally, both quarter-degree and 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees gridded TPW were validated against SuomiNet GPS retrieved TPW on a global scale. The RMSE for the retrieved quarter-degree gridded global TPW is 3.45 mm, with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. In addition, the RMSE for the downscaled 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees gridded global TPW is 4.18 mm, with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. An obvious advantage of our algorithm compared with MODIS TPW product is that it can retrieve TPW under cloudy sky condition over land. The algorithm developed in this study can be easily transferred to AMSR2 on board GCOM-W1 and provides the long-term global daily TPW over land since the launch of Aqua to present day to support hydrologic cycle and climate change studies.

In this work, a remote sensing algorithm was developed to estimate the concentrations of the total suspended sediments (TSS) in large lakes and reservoirs over the MLY basin and was based on a band ratio between 555 nm and 645 nm of the atmospherically corrected surface reflectance of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). In situ samples used to calibrate the algorithm were collected from 58 lakes and reservoirs with a TSS range of 1 to 300 mg L-1, and the uncertainty of this algorithm was 30-40%. The algorithm was subsequently applied to a total of 102 lakes and reservoirs located in the MLY basin to derive TSS maps from 2000 to 2014 at a 250 m spatial resolution, and the first comprehensive document of the TSS distributions and dynamics of large inland waters of the MLY basin was created. The seasonal patterns among the selected water bodies were similar, with the largest TSS concentrations occurring in the first and fourth quarters in a year and the lowest values occurring in the third quarter. In contrast, spatial heterogeneities were revealed by the 15-year long-term mean TSS climatology information. Although most lakes downstream of Poyang Lake were turbid with 15-year TSS climatology values of 45-100 mg L-1, waters between Poyang and Doting Lake were relatively clearer with TSS climatology values of 15-45 mg L-1, and the clearest waters (<15 mg L-1) were found in reservoirs. The turbidity of 64.5% (e.g., 49/76) for lakes in Class II exhibited a decreasing trend over the 15-year period, and the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) and Dongting Lake in Class I also showed significant TSS declines. Analysis with meteorological data shows that the intra-annual variations appear to be significantly correlated with local precipitation, with a time lag of two months for TSS. The prominent TSS decreasing trend of the lakes in Class,II was probably linked to the significant NDVI increase in the MLY basin, whereas the TSS decrease in the TGR and Dongting Lake is likely to be attributed to the impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam. The TSS environmental data record (EDR) of large inland waters presented in this study serves as an important reference for future water quality monitoring and evaluation in the MLY and in China.

Satellite radar altimetry offers a long time series of data over the GrIS, starting with ERS-1 in 1991. ESA\'s Cryosat-2 mission, launched in 2010, provides an invaluable radar altimetry dataset for monitoring the current changes of the ice sheets due to its dense spatial and temporal coverage of these areas. Here, we investigate the effects of including different parameters which describe the shape of the return radar waveform (waveform parameters) in the elevation change algorithm, to correct for temporal changes in the ratio between surface- and volume-scatter in Cryosat-2 observations. We present elevation and volume changes for the Greenland ice sheet in the period from 2010 until 2014. The waveform parameters considered here are the backscatter coefficient, and the leading edge width, which are both available in the ESA Cryosat-2 Level-2i data product. Investigations into relocation of radar reflection points are also included.   Inter-comparison of the Cryosat-2 derived elevation changes with those derived from Operation IceBridge laser data suggests waveform parameters to be applicable for correcting for changes in volume scattering. The best results in the Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometric mode area of the GrIS are found when applying only the backscatter correction, whereas the best result in the Low Resolution Mode area is obtained by only applying a leading edge width correction. Using this approach to correct for the scattering properties, a volume loss of -292 +/- 38 km(3) yr(-1) is found for the GrIS for the time span November 2010 until November 2014. The inclusion of waveform parameter corrections and improved relocation for the GrIS, helps to reconcile the satellite-derived elevation changes with those observed by Operation IceBridge. However, the bias of temporal changes in the scattering horizons of Cryosat-2 is not entirely removed and suggests that future improvements could be made by including climate data and/or additional waveform parameters to make additional corrections in the Cryosat-2 radar altimetry.

The ever growing, freely accessible Landsat archive provides data to derive such information; however, the manipulation of raw imagery can constitute a barrier to those lacking remote sensing expertise. The Landsat-based, global dataset of annual forest loss (version 1.0, Hansen et al., 2013) makes such information readily available. While the accuracy of this dataset has been assessed at the global scale, its applicability for reliable local monitoring of forest harvesting has not yet been validated. Here we undertake such an exercise in a temperate forest in Atlantic Canada. We used a census, polygon based approach to comprehensively assess thematic, temporal and structural accuracy. We vectorized Hansen\'s forest loss raster for the 8,520 km(2) of public lands in the Miramichi River basin (13,496 km(2)), which yielded 9299 polygons of 1 ha minimum size. Then we used the provincial forest harvest inventory as reference. User\'s and producer\'s accuracies were 81% and 82% based on area, and 86% and 85% based on polygon counts. Detection probability decreased with decreasing cutblock size and harvest intensity. From all Hansen polygons, 85% had the correct harvest year and 88% structurally matched one or more reference polygons either alone or together with other Hansen polygons. After the validation, we used the Hansen dataset to derive trends for the entire basin. Mean annual harvest rate was 0.92 ha/km(2)/year between 2000 and 2012. Most of the catchments around the western headwaters of the Miramichi River underwent intensive harvesting, underscoring the need of further monitoring. Our results indicate that the Hansen dataset could be used as a surrogate harvest layer for temperate forests where clear-cutting is common and fire is rare.

Existing homogeneously set-up global urban extent models commonly ignore local-level specifics. While global consistency and regional comparability of urban characteristics are much strived-for goals in the global development and remote sensing communities, non-conformity at the national level often renders such models inapplicable for effective decision-making. Furthermore, the focus on identifying \'urban\' leads to an ill-defined \'rural\', which is simply defined by contrast as \'everything else\'; a questionable definition when referring to strongly spatially localized residential patterns. In this paper we introduce the novel TURBAN geospatial modeling approach, identifying Urban-Rural patterns in Built-up-Adjusted and Nationally-adaptive manner. The model operates at global scale, but at the same time conforms to country specifics. In this model, high-resolution, satellite-derived, built-up data is used to consistently detect global human settlements at unprecedented spatial detail. In combination with global gridded population data, and with reference to national level statistical information on urban population ratios globally compiled in the annually -released UN World Urbanization Prospects, TURBAN identifies matching urban extents. Additionally, a novel reallocation algorithm is introduced which addresses the poor representation of rural areas that is inherent in existing global population grids. Associating all of the population with inhabitable, built-up area and conforming to national urban-rural ratios, iURBAN sets a new standard by enabling careful consideration of both urban and rural as opposed to traditional urban-biased approaches.

Single-factor AGB models only account for 15-49% of the variations in the grassland AGB during the peak period of grass growth, with NDVI-based AGB model to be the best (46%) among all linear remote sensing models we tested; and (3) although the multi-factor model (based on latitude, longitude, and grass cover and height) performs the best (70%) in estimating the AGB, it is not possible for operation due to the current difficulty of grass height modeling. The alternative and operational multi-factor model f(x,y,c) (latitude, longitude, and grass cover) can achieve reasonable estimation of AGB (63%), with the grass cover modeled from the MODIS reflectance, which would be further improved in conjunction with unmanned aerial vehicle technology in the future. Using this model f(x,y,c), the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of AGB estimation is reduced by 20% (i.e., 151 kg DW/ha) as compared with the best single-factor model based on the NDVI (RMSE of 887 kg DW/ha).

It has been demonstrated that the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) is empirically related to epsilon. An experimental US Department of Agriculture (USDA) cornfield in Maryland was selected as our study field. We explored the potential of integrating fAPAR(chl) (defined as the fraction of PAR absorbed by chlorophyll) and nadir PRI (PRInadir) to predict cornfield daily GPP. We acquired nadir or near-nadir EO-1/Hyperion satellite images that covered the cornfield and took nadir in-situ field spectral measurements. Those data were used to derive the PRInadir and fAPARchi. The fAPARchi is retrieved with the advanced radiative transfer model PROSAIL2 and the Metropolis approach, a type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation procedure. We define chlorophyll light use efficiency (epsilon(chl)) as the ratio of vegetation GPP as measured by eddy covariance techniques to PAR absorbed by chlorophyll (epsilon(chl) = GPP/APAR(chl)). Daily epsilon(chl) retrieved with the EO-1 Hyperion images was regressed with a linear equation of PRInadir (epsilon(chl) = alpha x PRInadir + beta). The satellite CchlPRI(nadir) linear relationship for the cornfield was implemented to develop an integrated daily GPP model [GPP = (alpha x PRInadir P) x fAPAR(chl) x PAR], which was evaluated with fAPAR(chl) and PRInadir retrieved from field measurements. Daily GPP estimated with this fAPAR(chl)-PRInadir integration model was strongly correlated with the observed tower in-situ daily GPP (R-2 = 0.93); with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.71 g C mot(-1) PPFD and coefficient of variation (CV) of 16.57%. Both seasonal epsilon(chl) and PRInadir were strongly correlated with fAPAR(chl) retrieved from field measurements, which indicates that chlorophyll content strongly affects seasonal Echi and PRInadir. We demonstrate the potential capacity to monitor GPP with space-based visible through shortwave infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectrometers such as NASA\'s soon to be decommissioned EO-1/Hyperion and the future Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRl).

With increasing vineyard acreage, reduced water availability in much of California, and competing water use interests, it is critical to be able to monitor regional water use and evapotranspiration (ET) over large areas, but also in detail at individual field scales to improve water management within these viticulture production systems. This can be achieved by integrating remote sensing data from multiple satellite systems with different spatiotemporal characteristics. In this research, we evaluate the utility of a multi-scale system for monitoring ET as applied over two vineyard sites near Lodi, California during the 2013 growing season, leading into the drought in early 2014. The system employs a multi-sensor satellite data fusion methodology (STARFM: Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflective Fusion Model) combined with a multi-scale ET retrieval algorithm based on the Two Source Energy Balance (TSEB) land-surface representation to compute daily ET at 30 m resolution. In this system, TSEB is run using thermal band imagery from the Geostationary Environmental Operational Satellites (GOES; 4 km spatial resolution, hourly temporal sampling), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (1 km resolution, daily acquisition) and the new Landsat 8 satellite (sharpened to 30 m resolution, similar to 16 day acquisition). Estimates of daily ET generated in two neighboring fields of Pinot noir vines of different age agree with ground-based flux measurements acquired in-field during most of the 2013 season with relative mean absolute errors on the order of 19-23% (root mean square errors of approximately 1 mm d(-1)), reducing to 14-20% at the weekly timestep relevant for irrigation management (similar to 5 mm wk(-1)). A model overestimation of ET in the early season was detected in the younger vineyard, perhaps relating to an inter-row grass cover crop. Spatial patterns of cumulative ET generally correspond to measured yield maps and indicate areas of variable crop moisture, soil condition, and yield within the vineyards that could require adaptive management. The results suggest that multi-sensor remote sensing observations provide a unique means for monitoring crop water use and soil moisture status at field-scales over extended growing regions, and may have value in supporting operational water management decisions in vineyards and other high value crops.

Most modern satellite-based PM2.5 estimates use statistical models that demand dense PM2.5 monitoring networks. As the national PM2.5 monitoring networks in China were not finished until the end of 2012, the research related to PM2.5 is relatively unsubstantial. To further improve the accuracy and application of remote sensing based estimation models for PM2.5 and take advantage of the newly established networks, we employed a time fixed effects regression model and geographically weighted regression model to develop a spatiotemporal statistical model that estimated ground-level PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. The time fixed effects regression model used the aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from the VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) instrument as the major predictive variable along with several other dependent variables, including some factors uncommonly discussed in previous literature, i.e., the satellite-derived NO2 concentrations of the previous day (NO2_Lag) and four directional wind vectors, and estimated day-by-day ground-level PM2.5 surfaces. The geographically weighted regression model used the residuals from the time fixed effects regression model as the dependent variable and the AOD value as the independent variable. Through adding the estimated residuals back to previous surfaces, we obtained the final prediction maps of ground-level PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei with a spatial resolution of 6 km x 6 km. The results were as follows. i). The spatiotemporal statistical model performed satisfactorily in that it successfully captured both the temporal and spatial variations in the PM2.5-AOD relationships. The coefficient of determination (R-2), mean prediction error (MPE), and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were 0.88301, 8.1331 mu g/m(3), and 13.0574 mu g/m(3), respectively, during model fitting and 0.71889, 12.2712 mu g/m(3), and 19.2927 mu g/m(3), respectively, during model validation. ii). Incorporating the NO2_Lag in the time fixed effects regression model significantly improved the model\'s performance and it played a positive role in ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. Replacing the simple wind speed with four directional wind vectors was helpful for the model\'s performance. iii). Meteorological factors and land use characteristics significantly affected the PM2.5-AOD relationships. The temperature and surface relative humidity (SRH) played a positive role, whereas the rainfall, planet boundary layer height (PBLH), average relative humidity in the PBLH (RH_PBLH), four directional wind vectors, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) played a negative role. iv). The prediction maps revealed that fine particle pollution in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei is severe and the pollution pattern presents relatively strong seasonal heterogeneity and southeast-northwest spatial heterogeneity.

To manage forests on large scales, spatially explicit gridded data that describes the characteristics of these forests over the entire study area are required. There have been multiple efforts to create such data on regional and global scales. This type of gridded spatially explicit data on forest characteristics are typically done by integrating terrestrial forest inventory (NFI) and satellite-based remotely sensed data. Many studies that incorporate remotely sensed data and forest inventory data often directly compare pixels to inventory plots. The standard resolution of 0.0083 degrees is typically used to integrate these two types of data sets. There is an assumption that, when producing gridded data sets incorporating forest inventory data, the finer the resolution the better the information. This assumption may seem intuitive, however at this resolution, in Europe, each 0.0083 degrees cell has on average 1 NFI plot, which results in a sample with 0 degrees of freedom that represents 0.02% of the cell area. In this study, we challenge this assumption and we quantify the optimal resolution with which to compare and combine remotely sensed and NFI data from the largest collated and harmonized NFI data set in Europe including 196,434 plots. We determined that aggregating data with an original resolution of 0.0083 degrees to between 0.0664 degrees and 0266 degrees (or x 8 to x 32) produces the best agreement between these two forest inventory and remotely sensed data sets, and the lowest standard error in NFI data, and maintains the majority of the local-level spatial heterogeneity.

Retrieving SIF from space can thus provide an indication on the temporal and spatial patterns of the terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP). Recent studies have successfully demonstrated the serendipitous retrieval of SIF from satellite remote sensing instruments originally destined to atmospheric studies. However, the finest spatial resolution achieved by these products is 0.5 degrees, which remains too coarse for many applications, including the early detection of drought impacts on vegetation and the integration with ground GPP measurements from flux towers. This paper proposes a methodology to spatially disaggregate the information contained within each coarse SIF pixels by using a non-linear model based on the concept of light use efficiency (LUE). The strategy involves the aggregation of high-resolution (0.05 degrees) remote sensing biophysical variables to calibrate the downscaling model locally and independently at each time step, which can then be applied to non-aggregated data to create a new layer, denoted SIF*, with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees. A global SIF* dataset is generated by applying this methodology globally to 7 years of monthly GOME-2 SIF data. SIP is shown to be a better proxy for GPP than the original coarse spatial resolution product according to flux-tower eddy covariance measurements. Its performance is comparable to dedicated GPP products despite that (unlike SIF*) these are calibrated based on the same flux towers, driven by meteorological data and not hampered by the large noise caused by the SIF retrieval. To further illustrate the added-value of the global SIF* product, this paper also presents: (1) an ecosystem level assessment showing a considerable reduction of noise with respect to the original SIF; (2) a spatio-temporal inter comparison with existing GPP products; and (3) estimations of global terrestrial productivity per selected vegetation types based on SIF*.

The eruption ended on February 27, 2015, thus lasting for a period of about 6 months. During these months the magma chamber below the caldera gradually deflated, feeding the eruption and causing the rare event of a slow caldera collapse. In this scenario, TanDEM-X remote sensing data are of particular interest. By producing medium-high resolution and accurate elevation models of the caldera, it is possible to evaluate volume losses and topographical changes to increase the knowledge about the ongoing activity. In particular, five TanDEM-X bistatic acquisitions have been commanded between August 01, 2014 and November 08, 2014, two of them before the volcanic eruption and three of them during the event. Additionally, to fully cover the volcanic activity, the lava field 48 km north-east of the caldera has also been monitored. In the first part of the paper, the expected elevation accuracy is studied on two levels. Absolute and relative height accuracies are analyzed by inspecting the X-band signal propagation into snow and by investigating the impact of the main geometrical system parameters and the local geomorphology. In the second part of the paper, the analysis is applied to the Baroarbunga volcanic system, including a validation performed using complementary altimeter data. The main geophysical outcome is the accurate temporal height tracking of the entire caldera and the glacial volcanic system. The measured volume loss at the caldera location is about 1 billion cubic meters in two months with an average rate of subsidence of nearly 50 cm/day. These numbers confirm other independent sources and can be compared to lava volume measurements. Finally, the last segment of the dyke that propagated from the Baroarbunga caldera to the Holuhraun lava field is mapped and a graben structure with a width of up to 1 km and a sinking of a few meters is reported.

The Alaskan evergreen needleleaf forests are sparse and the understory vegetation has a substantial impact on the satellite signal. We evaluated SOS and EOS of understory and tundra vegetation using time-lapse camera images. From the comparison of three SOS algorithms for determining SOS from two satellite datasets (SPOT-VEGETATION and Terra-MODIS), we found that the satellite-based SOS timing was consistent with the leaf emergence of the forest under story and tundra vegetation. The ensemble average of SOS over all satellite algorithms can be used as a measure of spring leaf emergence for understory and tundra vegetation. In contrast, the relationship between the ground-based and satellite-based EOSs was not as strong as that of SOS both for boreal forest and tundra sites because of the large biases between those two EOSs (19 to 26 days). The satellite-based EOS was more relevant to snowfall events than the senescence of understory or tundra. The plant canopy radiative transfer simulation suggested that 84-86% of the NDVI seasonal amplitude could be a reasonable threshold for the EOS determination. The latitudinal gradients of SOS and EOS evaluated by the satellite and ground data were consistent and the satellite derived SOS and EOS were 3.5 to 5.7 days degree(-1) and -2.3 to -2.7 days degree(-1), which corresponded to the spring (May) temperature sensitivity of -2.5 to -3.9 days degrees C-1 in SOS and the autumn (August and September) temperature sensitivity of 3.0 to 4.6 days degrees C-1 in EOS. This demonstrates the possible impact of phenology in spruce forest understory and tundra ecosystems in response to climate change in the warming Artic and sub-Arctic regions. (C) 2016 The Authors.

This characterization can be now provided by the novel Earth Observation tools. This study aims to contribute to understanding the innovation in forest and ecological research that can be brought in by advanced remote sensing instruments, and proposes the guild mapping approach as a tool to efficiently monitor the varied tropical forest resources. We evaluated, in tropical Ghanaian forests, the ability of airborne hyperspectral and simulated multispectral Sentinel-2 data, and derived vegetation indices and textures, to: distinguish between two different forest types; to discriminate among selected dominant species; and to separate trees species grouped according to their functional guilds: Pioneer, Non Pioneer Light Demanding, and Shade Bearer. We then produced guild classification maps for each area using hyperspectral data. Our results showed that with both hyperspectral and simulated Sentinel-2 data these discrimination tasks can be successfully accomplished. Results also stressed the importance of texture features, especially if using the lower spectral and spatial Sentinel-2 resolution data, and highlighted the important role of the new Sentinel-2 data for ecological monitoring. Classification results showed a statistically significant improvement in overall accuracy using Support Vector Machine, over Maximum Likelihood approach. We proposed the functional guilds mapping as an innovative approach to: (i) monitor compositional changes, especially with respect to the effects of global climate change on forests, and particularly in the tropical biome where the occurrence of hundreds of species prevents mapping activities at species level; (ii) support large-scale forest inventories. The imminent Sentinel-2 data could serve to open the road for the development of new concepts and methods in forestry and ecological research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Yet the liana growth form is chronically understudied in large-scale tropical forest censuses, resulting in few data on the scale, cause, and impact of increasing lianas. Satellite and airborne remote sensing provide potential tools to map and monitor lianas at much larger spatial and rapid temporal scales than are possible with plot-based forest censuses. We combined high-resolution airborne imaging spectroscopy and a ground-based tree canopy census to investigate whether tree canopies supporting lianas could be discriminated from tree canopies with no liana coverage. Using support vector machine algorithms, we achieved accuracies of nearly 90% in discriminating the presence-absence of lianas, and low error (15.7% RMSE) when predicting liana percent canopy cover. When applied to the full image of the study site, our model had a 4.1% false-positive error rate as validated against an independent plot-level dataset of liana canopy cover. Using the derived liana cover classification map, we show that 6.1%-10.2% of the 1823 ha study site has high-to-severe (50-100%) liana canopy cover. Given that levels of liana infestation are increasing in Neotropical forests and can result in high tree mortality, the extent of high-to-severe liana canopy cover across the landscape may have broad implications for ecosystem function and forest carbon storage. The ability to accurately map landscape-scale liana infestation is crucial to quantifying their effects on forest function and uncovering the mechanisms underlying their increase.

For Kenya and southern. Ethiopia, an existing index insurance scheme aims to reduce the adverse effects of such losses. The scheme insures individual households through an area-aggregated seasonal forage scarcity index derived from remotely-sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series. Until recently, insurance contracts covered animal losses and indemnity payouts were consequently made late in the season, based on a forage scarcity index incorporating both wet and dry season NDVI data. Season timing and duration were fixed for the whole area (March-September for long rains, October-February for short rains). Due to demand for asset protection insurance (pre-loss intervention) our aim was to identify earlier payout options by shortening the temporal integration period of the index. We used 250 m-resolution 10-day NDVI composites for 2001-2014 from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). To better describe the period during which forage develops, we first retrieved per-pixel average season start- and end-dates using a phenological model. These dates were averaged per insurance unit to obtain unit-specific growing period definitions. With these definitions a new forage scarcity index was calculated. We then examined if shortening the temporal period further could effectively predict most (>90%) of the interannual variability of the new index, and assessed the effects of shortening the period on indemnity payouts. Our analysis shows that insurance payouts could be made one to three months earlier as compared to the current index definition, depending on the insurance unit. This would allow pastoralists to use indemnity payments to protect their livestock through purchase of forage, water, or medicines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We examined effects of fire severity, post-fire climate, and topographic factors on short-term (<5 years) vegetation recovery in mixed-conifer and red fir forests in the Sierra Nevada. We hypothesized that short-term vegetation recovery patterns would be different among patches with varying fire severity, especially between low-moderate and high severity patches, and that post-fire climate would have differing impacts on short-term vegetation recovery in different ecological zones (lower montane forest vs. upper montane forest). 30-meter Landsat time series stacks were used to monitor short-term vegetation recovery following wildfire in mixed-conifer and red fir forest types. Changes in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) following thirty-five fires (>405 ha) between 1999 and 2006 were examined. According to the modeling results provided by ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions including spatial variation coefficients, fire severity, post-fire wet eason precipitation, post-fire January minimum temperature, and topographic factors explain variations in short-term post-fire NDVI values (adjusted R-squared = [0.680, 0.688] for red fir forests; adjusted R-squared = [0.671, 0.678] for mixed-conifer forests). The modeling results indicated that burned mixed-conifer forest was sensitive to post-fire drought, while burned red fir forest, with higher summer soil moisture availability, was sensitive to post-fire temperature. We also found that differences in recovery related to fire severity disappeared more quickly in burned mixed-conifer forest than in burned red fir forest. Future efforts should focus on long-term recovery, including competition between forest and shrub species in previously burned areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The algorithm relies on the Soil Evaporative Efficiency (SEE), which was estimated using the 1-km resolution data from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectoradiometer (MODIS). The study aimed to: (i) evaluate DISPATCH under wet soil conditions, (ii) test the linearity/non-linearity of the relationship between soil moisture and SEE, and (iii) propose a more robust procedure to calibrate the SEE model under very wet soil conditions. The disaggregated soil moisture values were compared to 0-5 cm in situ measurements and the soil moisture derived from the L-MEB (L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere) model from airborne brightness temperature at 1.4 GHz collected during the Canadian Experiment for Soil Moisture in 2010 (CanEx-SM10) field campaign. The results show a correlation between 0.7 and 0.8 and bias values similar to 0 m(3)/m(3). The DISPATCH algorithm shows better disaggregation results under very wet soil conditions when a non-linear relationship is considered between SEE and soil moisture instead of a linear model. This is mainly due to the small variability of surface temperature inside the area covered by the SMOS pixel under very wet soil conditions, and the difficulty in accurately estimating the maximum soil temperature (Ts-max), which is a driving factor for SEE. A sensitivity analysis was conducted and it shows that the linear model performs well only if Ts-max can be determined more accurately. The possibility to determine Ts-max using high resolution MODIS data over a larger area than the SMOS pixel is examined and discussed in the paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The Landsat 5 and 7 archives offer a unique data source to monitor globally the land surface at high spatial resolution. The Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7 ETM + SR products, derived from the on-demand processing Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS), require periodic evaluation to check the data consistency. Two evaluation approaches are presented in this paper. The first approach used the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data set for the period 2000 to 2013 over 489 sites with 3600 Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7 ETM + scenes selected. For each scene, 10 x 10 km subsets of LEDAPS-derived Landsat SR and AERONET-derived SR are compared. The latter are computed using Landsat top of atmosphere reflectance, AERONET measurements of atmospheric parameters, and the 6S radiative transfer model. Second, we introduce a methodology to cross-compare Landsat data and MODIS data acquired on the same day. The analysis is based on 4000 random Landsat scenes globally distributed from 2000 to 2013. This method includes: (i) a surface anisotropy adjustment, based on the VJB Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) method, to adjust Terra and Aqua MODIS data to Landsat 5 and 7 sun-view geometry, (ii) a spectral adjustment based on an artificial neural network trained with the PROSAIL vegetation radiative transfer model, to adjust MODIS data to TM and ETM+ spectral responses.   The overall results of both approaches show a good match in over 80% of the scenes, i.e. the TM and ETM + SR uncertainty remained within the SR specification, defined as 0.05 x SR + 0.005. The worst results are found in the blue band used in LEDAPS to adjust the Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT). The MODIS-Landsat SR cross-comparison confirms the utility of a BRDF adjustment method to decrease the scattering between Landsat sensors and MODIS sensors (Terra and Aqua). The spectral adjustment removes part of the biases related to spectral response differences. Global analysis is used to identify AOT retrieval issues over specific scenes, mostly over bright surfaces. From 2000 to 2013, no significant temporal variation of the performance is detected, which enhanced the consistency of LEDAPS-derived surface reflectance data set. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Band depths of prominent water absorption features in the near and shortwave infrared, centered at 970 nm, 1160 nm, 1440 nm, and 1930 nm, were then compared to the surface water content, with the expectation that this metric would be characteristic of the soil moisture content and be largely independent of soil properties. As expected, the band depths at 970 nm and 1160 nm decreased monotonically as the water content decreased. Unfortunately, these bands were only detectable in the sample consisting of large, reflective particles and large pore spaces (quartz sand). That they were not apparent in the darker soils with smaller particles and pore spaces suggests that these water absorption bands will not be generally useful for observing surface soil moisture. In contrast, the band depths of the 1440 nm and 1930 nm absorption features were very responsive to the water content over the entire drying cycle, providing a strong, but more complex signal, with the band depth initially increasing with decreasing water content before reaching a maximum and finally decreasing late in the drying cycle. The change in band depth at 1930 nm was particularly interesting since it reached a maximum coincident with the transition from constant evaporation rate (stage-1 drying) to a much slower evaporation rate (stage-2 drying) for all three soils. A simple mathematical model suggests that the pattern of change in the band depth is related to the near extinction of light at the band center relative to the band shoulders, which can be related to a specific water optical path length. The maximum absorption band depth at 1930 nm (and the associated water optical path length) appears to coincide with a trace amount of water present in the pore spaces for all three soil samples, which is consistent with the transition in drying rates.

The launch of the ESA\'s Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission in 2009 now means that global space-borne brightness temperature observations are available at L-band (1.41 GHz) to estimate soil moisture every 2 to 3 days with a target accuracy of 0.04 m(3)/m(3). Moreover, NASA\'s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite has been launched on 31st January 2015, also carrying an L-band radiometer, together with an L-band radar for downscaling the brightness temperature observations to better than 10 km resolution. At the SMOS/SMAP radiometer scale of similar to 40 km, the presence of water bodies potentially induces an overestimation of retrieved soil moisture, if not carefully accounted for in retrieval models. Such water fraction effects on brightness temperature and soil moisture retrieval accuracy were investigated in this study, using airborne L-band brightness temperature data collected during three Australian field experiments. The water induced brightness temperature effect and water fraction were compared under different resolutions, sampling days, and land surface conditions, showing that the water fraction impact on retrieved soil moisture is independent of scale, but heavily dependent on the soil water content status. Subsequently, the highest water fraction threshold that can be tolerated in order to achieve the 0.04 m(3)/m(3) target accuracy without correction has been determined as 0.08 (actual range is from 0.02 for dry bare soil to 0.08 for wet vegetated soil). Using a MODIS derived water fraction dataset, the water fraction dynamics were also studied over Australia during the ten years from 2001 to 2010. The results show that if the mean water fraction map was used as a static water map to flag or correct water effects, the water body induced soil moisture retrieval error would have exceeded the 0.04 m(3)/m(3) target more than once for 135% of the Australian land 40 km sized radiometer pixels; only 0.6% Australian land pixels would have exceeded this target with a frequency of 10 times or more per year.

Stimulated by the paucity of in situ observations on size structure, and by the sampling advantages of autonomous remote platforms, new efforts are being made to infer the size-structure of the phytoplankton from oceanographic variables that may be measured at high temporal and spatial resolution, such as total chlorophyll concentration. Largescale analysis of in situ data has revealed coherent relationships between size-fractionated chlorophyll and total chlorophyll that can be quantified using the three-component model of Brewin et al. (2010). However, there are variations surrounding these general relationships. In this paper, we first revise the three-component model using a global dataset of surface phytoplankton pigment measurements. Then, using estimates of the average irradiance in the mixed-layer, we investigate the influence of ambient light on the parameters of the three-component model. We observe significant relationships between model parameters and the average irradiance in the mixed-layer, consistent with ecological knowledge. These relationships are incorporated explicitly into the three-component model to illustrate variations in the relationship between size-structure and total chlorophyll, ensuing from variations in light availability. The new model may be used as a tool to investigate modifications in size-structure in the context of a changing climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Brewin, Robert J.

The current Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in standard MODIS and ASTER LST products is greater than 1 K, and for ASTER can be as large as 4 K for graybody pixels such as vegetation. Errors of 3 to 8 K have been observed for ASTER in humid conditions, making knowledge of atmospheric water vapor content critical in retrieving accurate LST. For this reason improved accuracy in LST measurements through the synthesis of visible-to-shortwave-infrared (VSWIR) derived water vapor maps and Thermal-Infrared (TIR) data is one goal of the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager, or HyspIRI, mission. The 2011 ER-2 Delano/Lost Hills flights acquired data with both the MODIS/ASTER Simulator (MASTER) and Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) instruments flown concurrently. This study compares LST retrieval accuracies from the standard JPL MASTER temperature products produced using the temperature-emissivity separation (TES) algorithm, and the water vapor scaling (WVS) atmospheric correction method proposed for HyspIRI. The two retrieval methods are run both with and without high spatial resolution AVIRIS-derived water vapor maps to assess the improvement from VSWIR synthesis. We find improvement using VSWIR derived water vapor maps, with the WVS method being most accurate overall. For closed canopy agricultural vegetation we observed temperature retrieval RMSEs of 0.49 K and 0.70 K using the WVS method on MASTER data with and without AVIRIS derived water vapor, respectively.

However, forest composition and function in urban ecosystems are ecologically complex because of high heterogeneity of the landscape and long legacies of intensive human management. Accurate quantification and mapping of composition of tree taxa in urban forests using remote sensing require high spatial and spectral resolution imagery. As such, mapping of individual species over large areas is impractical, so instead we map gradients of composition based on canopy traits derived from AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) and lidar. This trait-based approach depicts emergent functional overlaps due to pixel-scale mixing of disparate species or genera found in the region. This provides a basis for understanding forest functioning in urban ecosystems where multiple taxa are functionally and spectrally similar. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to ordinate multi-dimensional forest composition data, where NMDS scores (NMDS1 and NMDS2) represent compositional gradients. Predictive models of NMDS1 and NMDS2 were built using AVIRIS-derived foliar traits such as nitrogen concentration and lidar structural variables. Gradients of composition were strongly related to AVIRIS-derived traits (R-2 = 0.67 for NMDS1 and R-2 = 0.47 for NMDS2). Lidar-derived structural variables provided no improvement to prediction of the first NMDS axis estimates, and a minimal improvement (3% more variance explained) on NMDS2. We applied predictive models of NMDS1 and NMDS2 to maps of predictor traits to map NMDS1 and NMDS2. From the NMDS1 and NMDS2 maps, we mapped potential composition patterns and associated uncertainties by genus from the ordination of the field data. Our maps of composition gradients show the potential for data from imaging spectrometers such as HyspIRI to comprehensively characterize the diversity of ecosystems in heterogeneous landscapes. Moderate resolution satellite imagery may not facilitate detection of individual species, but imaging spectroscopy provides a basis to estimate the potential distribution of particular taxa based on assemblages associated with foliar traits that can be derived from imaging spectroscopy. Comprehensive satellite-based mapping will provide basic understanding and spatially explicit information on forest functioning suitable for monitoring and management of urban ecosystems.

However, the spatial resolution of MODIS bands 3-7 (i.e., 500 m) is coarser than that of bands 1 and 2 (i.e., 250 m), and may be too coarse for a large number of applications. In this paper, a new geostatistical approach based on area-to-point regression kriging (ATPRK) is proposed for downscaling coarse spatial resolution bands 3-7 such as to produce a complete set of MODIS images at 250 m.ATPRK takes advantages of the fine spatial resolution information in bands 1 and 2 by regression modeling, and uses area-to-point kriging to downscale the coarse residuals from the regression. ATPRK was compared to four existing methods, including the principal component analysis, wavelets, high-pass filter and kriging with external drift (RED) methods for downscaling in two experiments on MODIS data from the Brazilian Amazon. Both visual and quantitative evaluations (in terms of the root mean square error, correlation coefficient, relative global-dimensional synthesis error, universal image quality index, spectral angle mapper and spectral information divergence) showed that ATPRK produced sharpened images with the greatest quality. In addition, ATPRK perfectly preserved the spectral properties of the original coarse data and was faster than KED. The results reveal the great potential of ATPRK applied to MODIS data for a wide variety of applications, including global monitoring of deforestation. The ATPRK proposed in this paper is an entirely new image fusion approach based on a new conceptualization. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Like the popular Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) that has been used for decades to measure photosynthetic capacity, SIF measurements are sensitive to the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically-active radiation (fPAR). However, in addition, SIF is sensitive to PAR as well as the fluorescence yield that is related to the photosynthetic yield. Both SIF and NDVI from satellite data show drought-related declines early in the growing season in 2010 as compared to other years between 2007 and 2013 for areas dominated by crops and grasslands. This suggests an early manifestation of the dry conditions on fPAR. Using MODIS fPAR retrievals, we computed SIF/APAR which is related to light use efficiencies (LUEs) for fluorescence and photosynthesis. We found drought-related losses in fluorescence efficiency for all areas including those dominated by mixed forests. Unlike croplands and grasslands, areas of mixed forest did not show significant drought-related declines in fPAR. We also simulated SIF and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) using a global land surface model driven by observation-based meteorological fields. The model provides a reasonable simulation of the drought and heat impacts on SIF in terms of the spatial extents of anomalies, but some differences were found in timing of the peak drought response between modeled and observed SIP. Model data also suggested that drought-related declines in LUE for fluorescence and photosynthesis in areas of mixed forest produce losses in SIF and GPP. SIF and GPP losses due to drought in croplands and grasslands result from both LUE and fPAR reductions. The combination of SIF and NDVI or fPAR data is shown to be an important source of information for evaluating model performance.

Variability in snow cover within mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest, USA is attributable to a combination of anthropogenic climate change and climate oscillations. However, snow covered areas can be heterogeneous and patchy, requiring more detailed mapping of snow trends to understand their potential influences on montane forests. We used standard daily MODIS snow products (MOD10A1.5) to investigate the 15-year record (2000-2014) of snow cover in the predominant forest ecotone of the Oregon Western Cascades. We modeled the ecotone using field data from the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, and only considered forested MODIS Terra pixels located within the mapped ecotone of a five-county region. Three snow cover metrics were developed using both binary and fractional snow cover data: mean ecotone snow cover percent, number of snow covered days during the melt season, and day of snow disappearance. Snow cover and depletion dates exhibited large interannual variability and no significant linear trends. This variability is likely influenced by the preceding wintertime states of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the El Nino/Southem Oscillation (ENSO), which tend to covary. We improve and generalize existing methods for power analysis of trend estimation and quantify the number of uninterrupted observations of the snow metrics that would be needed to distinguish trends of different magnitudes from noise variance, taking possible autocorrelation into account. Sensitivity analyses of the results to some of our heuristic choices are conducted, and challenges associated with optical remote sensing of snow in a dense montane forest are discussed.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance was simulated for pixels with various ground (fractional cover of green vegetation (GV), nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and soil) and atmospheric/geometric (solar zenith angle, visibility, and water vapor) conditions for four operational spacebome multispectral images, Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhance Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Instrument noise was added to the TOA radiance. Three reflectance retrieval methods were used to estimate surface reflectance, and fractional cover estimates of GV, NPV, and soil were made using spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA). Among atmospheric characteristics, we found that visibility and solar zenith angle made the greatest contributions to spectral and fractional cover error. In all cases, CV fraction was estimated with lower error than NPV or soil fraction. The reflectance retrieval method that provided the best reflectance estimates did not produce the fractional cover estimates with the lowest error due to variable bias across bands. Fractional cover estimates for all ground components were strongly impacted by instrument noise, but MESMA significantly improved fractional cover estimates for NPV and soil, regardless of noise level. This study suggests that there are practical constraints on the level of accuracy that can be attained in multispectral estimates of NPV and soil. A set of recommendations for the use of spectral unmixing of multispectral reflectance data is developed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The uncertainty analysis of remotely sensed AGB is tricky because, if validation plots or cross-validation is used for error assessment, the AGB of validation plots does not necessarily represent the actual measurements but estimates of the true AGB. Leveraging a recently published pan-tropical destructively measured tree AGB database, this study proposed a new method of characterizing the uncertainty of the remotely sensed AGB. The method propagates errors from tree- to landscape-level by considering errors in the whole workflow of the AGB mapping process, including allometric model development, tree measurements, tree-level AGB prediction, plot-level AGB estimation, plot-level remote sensing based biomass model development, remote sensing feature extraction, and pixel-level AGB prediction. Applying such a method to the tree AGB mapped using airborne lidar over tropical forests in Ghana, we found that the AGB prediction error is over 20% at 1 ha spatial resolution, larger than the results reported in previous studies for other tropical forests. The discrepancy between our studies and others reflects not only our focus on African tropical forests but also the methodological differences in our uncertainty analysis, especially in the aspect of comprehensively addressing more sources of uncertainty. This study also highlights the importance of considering the plot-level AGB estimate uncertainty when field plots are used to calibrate remote sensing based biomass models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Based on the differences between the absorption characteristics of P. donghaiense and diatoms from the East China Sea and an extensive in-situ remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) dataset, a multispectral approach for discriminating P. donghaiense blooms from other water types was developed based on MODIS R-rs spectral shape discrimination. The procedure is separated into two steps. First, the bloom waters are identified by the low R-rs(555) and high R-AB owing to their relatively low reflectance and high spectral slope in the green bands. Second, two new indices of P. donghaiense index (PDI) and diatom index (DI) are developed for discriminating P. donghaiense from diatom blooms, based on the distinct spectral differences found in the green and red spectral ranges of phytoplankton absorption between the two algal groups. The validation using observations collected during near-con-current field surveys showed that the application of our practical method to MODIS imagery can provide reliable information on the inferred pattern and spatial distribution of the algal bloom, and that the classification technique for P. donghaiense bloom is considered successful, which may allow coastal mangers to better mitigate the harmful effects of P. donghaiense blooms in the East China Sea.

We used a synergistic approach that combines remote sensing bio-optical empirical and three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling to represent phytoplankton dynamics. Seasonal differences were evaluated by simulating the bio-optical and the three-dimensional hydrodynamic models for two periods: the austral summer and winter of 2009. The three-dimensional hydrodynamic model simulations showed that the water column was completely mixed during winter; the water column remained stratified during summer. We also noticed a permanent thermocline during the summer between 15 and 25 m in the reservoir. In both seasons, the surface current was wind driven and preferentially directed eastward. The bio-optical model showed that the horizontal surface phytoplankton distribution, as indicated by chlorophyll-a concentration, was heterogeneous during winter and homogenous during summer. Moreover, higher concentrations were observed by the empirical bio-optical model during winter (the highest mean areal concentration was 24 mu g L-1) than in summer (2.1 mu g L-1). This difference was explained by short timescale events, such as cold front passages, which contributed to the proliferation of phytoplankton in winter by enhancing vertical mixing in the water column. Lake number analysis showed that upwelling events were the most common mechanisms driving the mixing process during winter (L-N < 1 82% of the time). Combining remote sensing and three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling makes it possible to more fully analyze the dynamics of the horizontal surface phytoplankton distribution under different meteorological conditions. The two modeling techniques can be used in a complementary manner and serve as an essential tool for the environmental monitoring of aquatic systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Whereas conventional monitoring approaches tend to be limited in terms of spatial coverage and temporal frequency, remote sensing has the potential to provide an invaluable complementary source of data at local to global scales. Furthermore, as sensors, methodologies, data availability and the network of researchers and engaged stakeholders in this field develop, increasingly widespread use of remote sensing for operational monitoring of inland waters can be envisaged. This special issue on Remote Sensing of Inland Waters comprises 16 articles on freshwater ecosystems around the world ranging from lakes and reservoirs to river systems using optical data from a range of in situ instruments as well as airborne and satellite platforms. The papers variably focus on the retrieval of in-water optical and biogeochemical parameters as well as information on the biophysical properties of shoreline and benthic vegetation. Methodological advances include refined approaches to adjacency correction, inversion-based retrieval models and in situ inherent optical property measurements in highly turbid waters. Remote sensing data are used to evaluate models and theories of environmental drivers of change in a number of different aquatic ecosystems. The range of contributions to the special issue highlights not only the sophistication of methods and the diversity of applications currently being developed, but also the growing international community active in this field. In this introductory paper we briefly highlight the progress that the community has made over recent decades as well as the challenges that remain. It is argued that the operational use of remote sensing for inland water monitoring is a realistic ambition if we can continue to build on these recent achievements. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Different algorithms to retrieve T and/or SPM from water reflectance already exist, however there are important questions as to whether these algorithms need to be calibrated specifically for different regions. In the present work the potential generality of a semi-empirical single band turbidity retrieval algorithm using the near infrared (NIR) band at 859 nm in highly turbid waters is assessed. For completeness the use of 645 nm in medium to low turbidity waters is also proposed. Radiative transfer simulations and in situ measurements from various European and South American coastal and shallow estuarine environments characterized by high concentrations of suspended sediments are analyzed. Reflectance and turbidity measurements were performed in the southern North Sea (SNS) and French Guyana (FG) coastal waters, and Scheldt (SC), Gironde (GIR) and Rio de la Plata (RdP) estuaries. Simulations showed that uncertainty for turbidity estimation associated with different particle types and bidirectional effects is typically less than 6%. When applied to field data from the five different sites, the semi-analytical algorithm performed well: turbidity estimates were within 12% and 22% of in situ values. A good performance was also found when the entire database was analyzed (n = 106) with a mean relative error of 13.7% and bias of 4.8%. The good performance of the algorithm for all these regions, despite differences in sediment characteristics, and the results of the radiative transfer simulations suggest the global applicability of the algorithm to map turbidity up to 1000 FNU. Consequently regional algorithms to retrieve SPM concentration from reflectance can be designed by combining this global algorithm to retrieve T from water reflectance with a regional relationship to convert T to SPM. This has the very practical advantage that the measurements needed to calibrate the latter T/SPM conversion for any new region are much easier and cheaper than in situ reflectance measurements.

Starting from a compilation of \"typical\" mineral dust particle size distributions and mineralogical compositions, the information content of dust spectra from Mie simulations and from FTIR (Fourier-transform-infrared spectrometer) measurements (provided by the University of Iowa) is analysed. While the Mie spectra provide a higher number of degrees of freedom for signal (up to 6.7) than the FTIR spectra (up to 5.7), the Shannon information content is slightly lower (3.4) from Mie than from FTIR (3.5). The analysis shows that the spectra provide information on particle size and composition, but information about both cannot be extracted independently owing to the correlations between the different spectra. A dust retrieval approach for IASI probing the spectral shape of extinction has been updated using the Mie and FTIR spectra. Dust properties provided by the retrieval algorithm are: AOD (at 0.55 mu m and 10 mu m), effective radius, mass-weighted mean diameter, weight-fractions of mineralogical components, IR single scattering albedo and dust layer effective emission temperature. The retrieval uncertainty in each of these parameters is calculated for each IASI pixel. From the retrieved dust layer temperature the dust layer altitude is also inferred using temperature profiles from the WRF numerical weather prediction model.   To evaluate the impact of using the Mie and FTIR spectra within the algorithm, AODs determined using each are compared to AERONET and SEVIRI dust observations. This evaluation suggests that the overall performance of the retrieval in terms of AOD is better for the FOR version. Evaluation (of the FTIR version) with AERONET coarse mode AOD shows a correlation of 0.73 with RMSD of 0.18 and bias of -0.07. 85% of IASI AOD retrievals are found to be within +/- 0.2 of AERONET coarse AOD. Evaluating the quality of the other retrieved parameters is more difficult but we find that the values obtained do show a strong dependence on whether the Mie or FTIR spectra are used. For example, using FTIR spectra results in higher spatial variability in the clay fraction of the retrieved dust compared to Mie. Similar sensitivity is seen in the retrieved particle sizes and single scattering albedo. Indeed, assumptions made concerning the absorption properties of the Mie spectra result in the retrieval of unrealistically low dust layer altitudes, while reasonable values are obtained when using FOR spectra. Thus it is important to acknowledge that good AOD agreement with independent validation sources does not automatically imply a similar level of quality in the remaining variables.

Several case studies from around the globe are used to illustrate these improvements, and demonstrate new pixel flagging procedures and algorithm operation.

However, choosing relevant conditioning factors in such analyses remains a challenging task. Landslide susceptibility mapping employs topological, environmental, geological, and hydrological parameters. Some researchers assume that as the number of conditioning factors increases, the precision of the generated susceptibility map increases. By contrast, other case studies prove that a small number of conditioning factors are sufficient to produce landslide susceptibility maps with a reasonable quality. This study investigates the effects of conditioning factors on landslide susceptibility mapping. Bukit Antarabangsa, Ulu Kiang, Malaysia was selected as the study area, because it is a catchment area with a high potential of landslide occurrence. A spatial database of 31 landslide locations was evaluated to map landslide-susceptible areas. Two datasets of conditioning factors were constructed in GIS environment. The first dataset was derived from high-resolution airborne laser scanning data (LiDAR), which contains eight landslide conditioning factors: altitude, slope, aspect, curvature, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), topographic roughness index (TRI), and sediment transport index (STI). The second dataset was gathered by using the same conditioning factors of the first dataset, but with the addition of other conditioning factors: geological and environmental factors of soil, geology, land use/cover (LULC), distance from river, and distance from road. Two different datasets were constructed to compare the efficiency of one over the other in landslide susceptibility zonation. Three methods were implemented to recognize the importance of different conditioning factors in landslide susceptibility mapping. Three different types of models such as weights-of-evidence (WoE) (bivariate statistical analysis), logistic regression (LR) (multivariate statistical analysis), and data-driven support vector machine (SVM) were used to determine the optimal landslide conditioning factors. The area under curve (AUC) was used to assess the obtained results. The prediction rates of WoE, LR, and SVM obtained from only the LiDAR-derived conditioning factors were 59%, 86%, and 84%, respectively. The prediction rates of the WoE, LR, and SVM obtained ffom the second dataset were 65%, 66%, and 69%, respectively. The LiDAR-derived conditioning factors were more sufficient in generating an accurate landslide susceptibility map. Using additional factors, such as geology, LULC, and so on, does not significantly increase the accuracy of the map. The findings of this study can be used as reference for future analysis in selecting data for landslide conditioning factors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

It is noteworthy that an increase in the number of surface roughness parameters in a model also increases the difficulty with which data can be inverted for the purposes of estimating soil parameters. In this paper, a new description of soil surface roughness is proposed for microwave applications. This is based on an original roughness parameter, Zg, which combines the three most commonly used soil parameters: root mean surface height, correlation length, and correlation function shape, into just one parameter. Numerical modelling, based on the moment method and integral equations, is used to evaluate the relevance of this approach. It is applied over a broad dataset of numerically generated surfaces characterised by a large range of surface roughness parameters. A strong correlation is observed between this new parameter and the radar backscattering simulations, for the HH and VV polarisations in the C and X bands. It is proposed to validate this approach using data acquired in the C and X bands, at several agricultural sites in France. It was found that the parameter Zg has a high potential for the analysis of surface roughness using radar measurements. An empirical model is proposed for the simulation of backscattered radar signals over bare soil.

The success of REDD+ depends also on effective monitoring systems that can produce credible and comparable forest cover estimates. If remote sensing technologies are to be involved, methods need to be developed to implement the politically negotiated forest definitions into the technical process of image analysis. We present here a new framework for translating elements of the currently discussed forest definitions into the analysis of satellite images. The framework is based on a hierarchical classification scheme which separates the process of image classification from the application of a specific forest definition. We test this approach for two contrasting tropical regions on RapidEye images which are classified using the Random Forests algorithm. The results show that the developed framework can be operationally applied on a project level and results in standardized forest cover maps with high accuracies. Furthermore, it can serve as a research tool for analyzing consequences of political decisions regarding the forest definitions as it readily enables the user to produce forest maps and estimate forest cover for different underlying forest definitions.

The VIIRS Surface Reflectance(SR) Intermediate Product (IP) is based on the heritage MODIS Collection 5 product (Vermote, El Saleous, & Justice, 2002). The quality and character of surface reflectance depend on the accuracy of the VIIRS Cloud Mask (VCM), the aerosol algorithms and the adequate calibration of the sensor. The focus of this paper is the early evaluation of the VIIRS SR product in the context of the maturity of the operational processing system, the Interface Data Processing System (IDPS). After a brief introduction, the paper presents the calibration performance and the role of the surface reflectance in calibration monitoring. The analysis of the performance of the cloud mask with a focus on vegetation monitoring (no snow conditions) showstypical problems over bright surfaces and high elevation sites. Also discussed is the performance of the aerosol input used in the atmospheric correction and in particular the artifacts generated by the use of the Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System. Early quantitative results of the performance of the SR product over the AERONET sites show that with the few adjustments recommended, the accuracy is within the threshold specifications. The analysis of the adequacy of the SR product (Land PEATE adjusted version) in applications of societal benefits is then presented. We conclude with a set of recommendations to ensure consistency and continuity of the JPSS mission with the MODIS Land Climate Data Record.

We predicted avian species richness in two mixed conifer forests, Moscow Mountain and Slate Creek, containing different management contexts and located in north-central Idaho. We utilized general linear models and an AIC model selection approach to examine the relative importance of a wide range of remotely-sensed ecological variables, including LiDAR-derived metrics of vertical and horizontal structural heterogeneities of both vegetation and terrain, and Landsat-derived vegetation reflectance indices. We also examined the relative importance of these remotely sensed variables in predicting nesting guild distributions of ground/understory nesters, midupper canopy nesters, and cavity nesters. All top models were statistically significant, with adjusted R(2)s ranging from 0.05 to 0.42. Regardless of study area, the density of the understory was positively associated with total species richness and the ground/understory nesting guild. However, the relative importance of ecological predictors generally differed between the study areas and among the nesting guilds. For example, for mid-upper canopy nester richness, the best predictors at Moscow Mountain included height variability and canopy density whereas at Slate Creek they included slope, elevation, patch diversity and height variability. Topographic variables were not found to influence species richness at Moscow Mountain but were strong predictors of avian species richness at the higher elevation Slate Creek, where species richness decreased with increasing slope and elevation. A variance in responses between focal areas suggests that we expand such studies to determine the relative importance of different factors in determining species richness. It is also important to note that managers using predictive maps should realize that models from one region may not adequately represent communities in other areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) nighttime stable light data (NTL) provide a potential way to map the extent and dynamics of urban areas in an economic and timely manner. In this study, we developed a cluster-based method to estimate optimal thresholds and map urban extent from the DMSP/OLS Nil data in five major steps, including data preprocessing, urban cluster segmentation, logistic model development, threshold estimation, and urban extent delineation. In our method the optimal thresholds vary by clusters and are estimated based on cluster size and overall nightlight magnitude. The United States and China, two large countries with different urbanization patterns, were selected to test the proposed method. Our results indicate that the urbanized area occupies about 2% of total land area in the US, ranging from lower than 0.5% to higher than 10% at the state level, and less than 1% in China, ranging from lower than 0.1% to about 5% at the province level with some municipalities as high as 10%. The derived thresholds and urban extent were evaluated using a validation sub-sample of high-resolution land cover data at the cluster and regional levels. It was found that our method can map urban areas in both countries efficiently and accurately. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the derived optimal thresholds are not highly sensitive to the parameter choices in the logistic model. Our method reduces the over- and under-estimation issues often associated with previous fixed-threshold techniques when mapping urban extent over a large area. More importantly, our method shows potential to map global urban extent and temporal dynamics using the DMSP/OLS NTL data in a timely, cost-effective way. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we explore the potential of the new DEIMOS-1, multi-spectral, medium-resolution satellite sensor for quantifying TSS dynamics within the large, turbid Guadalquivir estuary (SW Iberian Peninsula). Eight scenes were atmospherically corrected using various image-based procedures (apparent reflectance; Dark Object Subtraction, DOS; and solar zenith angle approximation, COSTZ). In-situ measurements (100 to 1400 mg L-1) from three campaigns coinciding ( 15 mm) with satellite overpasses were used to assess the semi-analytical algorithm from Nechad et al. (2010) relating water-leaving reflectance (rho(w)) to TSS. All bands were very sensitive to TSS, however saturation of the visible wavelengths was observed at the highest sediment loads. The best correlation was obtained for the NIR band (755-906 nm) using the simple band-reflectance model at the top of atmosphere reflectance (rho(w(ToA))), TSS (mg L-1) = 21428.77 rho(w(TOA)) (1 rho(w(TOA)) / 0.21) 346.17 (r(2) = 0.864, p < 0.001, epsilon(r) = 25.411%, n = 53), which was used to generate maps. This approach revealed detailed spatio-temporal variability in sediment concentrations within the river plume, near to shore and far up the river channel. We demonstrate that DEIMOS-1 has a high capability as a valuable tool for the frequent, synoptic monitoring of water-quality parameters needed for the optimum management of coastal and transitional waters.

The correction method has been used to construct improved single sensor and multi-sensor, merged and interpolated satellite SST products from January to December 2008.   The validation of the satellite products ingested in the level 4 production shows that large biases can persist for months in this region. The SST products from the AATSR sensor on ENVISAT and the NAVOCEANO AVHRR GAC are the most stable and reliable products for the Arctic region. These products have therefore been used to construct the reference product against which the other satellite products have been corrected. The bias correction method has been developed using detailed error characteristics and thorough time-space analysis, and the bias corrected fields are validated against in situ observations from drifting buoys. All the individual satellite products show improvement in both bias and standard deviation after correction. Largest improvements are found for the Modis sensor on the Terra satellite, where biases are improved from -0.46 K to 0.02 K with the correction method. Temporal validation statistics reveal that extended periods with significant biases are also removed by the bias correction method. A significant improvement is seen when the corrected satellite products are used for the SST analysis. When compared against drifting buoys, not included in the analysis, the corrected level 4 satellite SST product shows a bias of -0.04 K and standard deviation of 0.54 K, compared to an original bias of -0.28 K and standard deviation of 0.61 K. The effect of a missing reference sensor is assessed for the full period. Level 4 test runs using only one reference sensor demonstrates that improvements can be obtained with a single sensor bias correction method, and that the AATSR sensor gives the largest improvements.

Parametric and non-parametric models were used to relate reference biomass levels obtained from field plot measurements and high point density lidar data to backscatter intensities or polarimetric target decomposition components. Single-date retrieval using multiple independent variables provided lower estimation errors when compared to models using one independent variable with errors decreasing by 2% to 15%. The multi-temporal aggregation of daily biomass estimates did not improve the overall retrieval accuracy but provided more reliable estimates with respect to single-date methods. Backscatter intensities improved estimation accuracies up to 10% compared to polarimetric target decomposition components. Using all four polarizations increased the estimation accuracy marginally (2%). when compared to a dual-polarized system. The biomass estimation error was considerably reduced (up to 30%) only by decreasing the spatial resolution and was related to decreasing forest variability with increasing pixel size. These results indicate that, at least in semi-arid areas, future L-band missions would not significantly improve biomass estimation accuracy using backscatter-based modeling approaches despite their better spatial resolution, higher revisit cycles and the availability of fully polarimetric information.

It is capable of detecting many kinds of land cover change continuously as new images are collected and providing land cover maps for any given time. A two-step cloud, cloud shadow, and snow masking algorithm is used for eliminating \"noisy\" observations. A time series model that has components of seasonality, trend, and break estimates surface reflectance and brightness temperature. The time series model is updated dynamically with newly acquired observations. Due to the differences in spectral response for various kinds of land cover change, the CCDC algorithm uses a threshold derived from all seven Landsat bands. When the difference between observed and predicted images exceeds a threshold three consecutive times, a pixel is identified as land surface change. Land cover classification is done after change detection. Coefficients from the time series models and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from model estimation are used as input to the Random Forest Classifier (RFC). We applied the CCDC algorithm to one Landsat scene in New England (WRS Path 12 and Row 31). All available (a total of 519) Landsat images acquired between 1982 and 2011 were used. A random stratified sample design was used for assessing the change detection accuracy, with 250 pixels selected within areas of persistent land cover and 250 pixels selected within areas of change identified by the CCDC algorithm. The accuracy assessment shows that CCDC results were accurate for detecting land surface change, with producer\'s accuracy of 98% and user\'s accuracies of 86% in the spatial domain and temporal accuracy of 80%. Land cover reference data were used as the basis for assessing the accuracy of the land cover classification.

The algorithms of Lee et al. (2005b, Journal of Geophysical Research Oceans, 110, C02017) were tuned for this region using radiative transfer calculations which incorporated locally determined specific inherent optical properties and constituent concentrations. The optimised algorithms were then applied to r(rs) spectra derived from profiling radiometry for 145 stations in the Irish Sea and adjacent waters, and their outputs compared with inherent optical property measurements for these stations. For the modelled data, recoveries of, a(lambda), b(b)(lambda) and K-d(lambda) in six wavebands between 412 nm and 667 nm had mean percentage errors below 3% and standard deviations of around 6%. For in situ data, the algorithms tended to over-estimate a(lambda) and under estimate b(b)(lambda) relative to measured values, but a contributing factor could be the difficulty of measuring optical properties accurately in turbid waters. Retrieved values of K-d(lambda) were highly correlated with those measured in situ, with regression slopes in the best-performing bands of 1.05 at 442 nm (r(2) = 0.91) and 0.92 at 488 nm (r(2) = 0.96). Three previously published relationships between satellite-derived optical properties at 490 nm and euphotic depth, z(1%PAR), produced roughly equivalent results with root mean square percentage errors, relative to in situ measurements, of around 20%. On the logarithmic scales usually employed in remote sensing, values of a(488), b(b)(488),K-d(488) and z(1%PAR) recovered using the optimised algorithms bore strong linear relationships to in situ measurements, with least square regression slopes in the range 0.89 to 1.03 and r(2) values from 0.87 to 0.94. Application of these algorithms to a MODIS image of the Irish Sea in early summer (25th May 2013) revealed marked spatial variations in optical properties which were well correlated with known patterns of tidal stirring in the region.

The wavelength range where this information can be exploited changes depending on the water characteristics. In low chlorophyll-a waters, the blue/green region of the spectrum is more sensitive to changes in chlorophyll-a concentration, whereas the red/NIR region becomes more important in turbid and/or eutrophic waters. In this work we present an approach to manage the shift from blue/green ratios to red/NIR-based chlorophyll-a algorithms for optically complex waters. Based on a combined in situ data set of coastal and inland waters, measures of overall algorithm uncertainty were roughly equal for two chlorophyll-a algorithms the standard NASA OC4 algorithm based on blue/green bands and a MERIS 3-band algorithm based on red/NIR bands-with RMS error of 0.416 and 0.437 for each in log chlorophyll-a units, respectively. However, it is clear that each algorithm performs better at different chlorophyll-a ranges. When a blending approach is used based on an optical water type classification, the overall RMS error was reduced to 0.320. Bias and relative error were also reduced when evaluating the blended chlorophyll-a product compared to either of the single algorithm products. As a demonstration for ocean color applications, the algorithm blending approach was applied to MERIS imagery over Lake Erie. We also examined the use of this approach in several coastal marine environments, and examined the long-term frequency of the OWTs to MODIS-Aqua imagery over Lake Erie. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) released a climate data record (CDR) of global and direct surface irradiance as well as effective cloud albedo derived from observations of the Meteosat First Generation satellites (MFG, 1983-2005). This study presents an extension of this CDR using measurements from the Meteosat Second Generation satellites (MSG, 2004-present). This extended surface radiation dataset spans nearly 30 years of data and, therefore, is in its uniquely high temporal and spatial resolution a valuable contribution to the climate community.   In order to enable climatological consistency and homogeneity, the retrieval algorithm had to be modified for MSG: 1. The two narrowband visible channels of the MSG satellites are combined to simulate the MFG broadband visible channel; 2. The maximum cloud reflectance is empirically adjusted to account for the differences in the dynamic range of MSG compared to MFG.   The extended dataset is tested for homogeneity and no significant breaks are detected during the overlap period of 2004-2005. Validation of the extended global radiation dataset against ground based observations from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network yields a mean monthly absolute bias of 8.15 W m(-2). This complies with the target accuracy threshold of 15 W m(-2) defined by the Global Climate Observing System.   Global radiation has an overall positive, and significant, trend over the Meteosat disk which is mainly due to a negative trend in the effective cloud albedo, i.e., a decrease in cloudiness. Trends due to changes in the clear sky radiation are small and only induced by trends in the water vapor fields. Trends caused by changes in the direct effects of atmospheric aerosol are not represented because an aerosol climatology is used. (C) 2013 The Authors.

The current algorithm overcomes the disadvantages of previous dust detection methods by considering the Brightness Temperature Ratio (BTR) values of the dual wavelength channels with 30-day composite, the optical properties of the dust particles, the variability of surface properties, and the cloud contamination. Therefore, the current algorithm shows improvements in detecting the dust loaded region over land during daytime.

The agreement between the results of the current algorithm and the OMI AI over the non-polluted land also ranges from 60 to 67% to avoid errors due to the anthropogenic aerosol.

While different BRDF methods have been proposed to address this effect, its performance has been evaluated at coarse spatial resolutions making it difficult to assess its applicability to, for example, crop monitoring. Here we test 2 approaches based on two different assumptions: the Classic approach that relies on the hypothesis of stable target and a recent Alternative that is based on the idea that despite reflectance magnitude may change rapidly, the BRDF shape varies slowly in time. Additionally, we segmented the growing season into different numbers of periods for the BRDF correction (a single period along the growing season, 3 periods based in phenology and 9-12 periods of fixed 16-days). The resulting 6 methods were compared over annual crops (wheat, maize and soybean) at 250 m spatial resolution from a site located in the Argentine Pampas. We used MOD and MYD 09 GQ and GA as inputs and compared the corrected daily red and infrared reflectances and the NDVI time series against the filtered benchmark (input time series with quality filters applied) by means of the high frequency variability (i.e. noise). We also tested whether corrected time series were better correlated with soybean PAR interception and biomass. Our results showed that methods\' performance was more explained by the number of periods than by the approach (Classic or Alternative). Single period methods decreased noise by 52%, 55% and 4% for red, infrared and NDVI time series. The use of 3 periods improved the correction performance to 63, 64 and 24% for red, infrared and NVDI time series respectively, while the highest reductions (65,68 and 32% for red, infrared and NVDI) were found with 16-day intervals (9-12 periods) considering a magnitude inversion process. Wheat displayed the lowest noise reduction compared to the other crops. BRDF parameters obtained from different methods were associated to crop structure, suggesting that they have biophysical meaning. The decrease in noise obtained with correction methods was translated into a better assessment of the fraction of intercepted PAR and biomass.

However, each of these characteristics can vary within the area of one pixel of a remote sensing dataset. which ultimately affects the accuracy of the retrieval of these characteristics. For example, where multiple temperatures occur in a particular pixel, the derived emissivity spectrum and pixel-integrated brightness temperature for that pixel are inaccurate. We present a new approach for deconvolving thermally-mixed pixels in a day/night pair of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) thermal infrared (TIR) scenes over Kilauea volcano, acquired during an active effusive phase in October 2006. The thermal deconvolution algorithm identifies thermally-mixed pixels and determines the multiple temperature components and their area, using data from the higher spatial resolution short wave infrared (SWIR) channels of ASTER. The effects of thermal mixing on the emissivity retrievals were quantified using a spectral deconvolution approach comparing the original to the thermally deconvolved data. The root mean squared (RMS) error improved slightly from.0.879 to 0.813, whereas the compositional end-members changed more dramatically (e.g., glass decreased from 70.2% to 49.3% and the vesicularity increased from 0.7% to 16.3%). The results provide more accurate temperature and emissivity data derived from ASTER data over thermally-elevated surfaces such as volcanoes and fires. This approach also serves as rapid means for accurately identifying sub-pixel temperatures, commonly obscured in low to medium spatial resolution orbital datasets. Moreover, it minimizes processing time, allowing critical information to be quickly disseminated.

Here we use this information to retrieve quantitative information on phytoplankton size structure by developing a novel method to compute the exponent of an assumed power-law for their particle-size spectrum. This quantity, in combination with total chlorophyll-a concentration, can be used to estimate the fractional concentration of chlorophyll in any arbitrarily-defined size class of phytoplankton. We further define and derive expressions for two distinct measures of cell size of mixed. populations, namely, the average spherical diameter of a bio-optically equivalent homogeneous population of cells of equal size, and the average equivalent spherical diameter of a population of cells that follow a power-law particle-size distribution. The method relies on measurements of two quantities of a phytoplankton sample: the concentration of chlorophyll-a, which is an operational index of phytoplankton biomass, and the total absorption coefficient of phytoplankton in the red peak of visible spectrum at 676 nm. A sensitivity analysis confirms that the relative errors in the estimates of the exponent of particle size spectra are reasonably low. The exponents of phytoplankton size spectra, estimated for a large set of in situ data from a variety of oceanic environments (similar to 2400 samples), are within a reasonable range; and the estimated fractions of chlorophyll in pico-, nano- and micro-phytoplankton are generally consistent with those obtained by an independent, indirect method based on diagnostic pigments determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. The estimates of cell size for in situ samples dominated by different phytoplankton types (diatoms, prymnesiophytes, Prochlorococcus, other cyanobacteria and green algae) yield nominal sizes consistent with the taxonomic classification. To estimate the same quantities from satellite-derived ocean-colour data, we combine our method with algorithms for obtaining inherent optical properties from remote sensing. The spatial distribution of the size-spectrum exponent and the chlorophyll fractions of pico-, nano- and micro-phytoplankton estimated from satellite remote sensing are in agreement with the current understanding of the biogeography of phytoplankton functional types in the global oceans. This study contributes to our understanding of the distribution and time evolution of phytoplankton size structure in the global oceans. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We present a geostatistical inverse modeling (GIM) approach for merging coarse-resolution images with variable resolutions and for super-resolution (i.e., predictions at the sub-pixel level) mapping of continuous spatial processes. GIM can explicitly account for the differences in spatial supports of multiple datasets. The restricted maximum likelihood method was used for parameter estimations associated with the change-of-support problem. We used GIM to produce both spatial predictions of a target image and prediction uncertainties, while preserving the values of original measurements. GIM is totally data driven, and covariance parameters for a target resolution can be directly derived from measurements. We also developed a moving-window GIM approach to accommodate spatial nonstationarity and reduce computational burden associated with large image data. First we demonstrated GIM and moving-window GIM on synthetic images. Aggregated synthetic images with variable resolutions were merged to produce a single resolution image. The results show that the two approaches can produce accurate spatial predictions and generate prediction uncertainties. Second, we applied moving-window GIM for merging aerosol optical depth (ADD) data with variable resolutions, which were derived from two satellite sensors. The modeling results show that moving-window GIM can be applied for merging complementary AOD data from two sensors and for super-resolution mapping of global AOD distributions. Therefore, we can conclude that GIM is a practical solution for merging complementary coarse-resolution images and for super-resolution mapping of continuous spatial processes.

An experiment designed to evaluate the error, and its reduction with spatial resolution (expected from ergodicity properties), of Ts is described. It is based on the analysis of time series of Ts at different resolutions reconstructed from sequences of images acquired at high frequency using a helicopter borne TIR camera over 5 different surfaces in the south-west of France, in the 2010 summer. Unfortunately the non-respect of a stationary flight resulted in a contamination of the data by directional effects; the filtering process developed to correct for this also eliminated the signature of low frequency PBL turbulence related to Is measurements, and made only possible the study of high frequency turbulence impact on Ts. For decreasing resolution (i.e., increase in pixel size), the contribution of the SBL turbulence to error rapidly decreases with resolution (i.e., pixel size increase); it reaches +/- 0.5 degrees C at 50 m, the resolution selected for recent spatial mission projects, with only little variations thereafter. Recommendations are made for future experiments to evaluate the overall error induced by atmospheric turbulence on satellite Ts measurements.

It contains large quantities of carbon in its vegetation and soils, and research suggests that it will be subject to increasingly severe climate-driven disturbance.

Incorporating these inventory techniques with uncertainty analysis, we estimate total aboveground carbon of 38 +/- 3.1 Pg. This boreal forest carbon is mostly concentrated from 50 to 55 degrees N in eastern Canada and from 55 to 60 degrees N in eastern Eurasia. Both of these regions are expected to warm >3 degrees C by 2100, and monitoring the effects of warming on these stocks is important to understanding its future carbon balance.

Despite its importance, no IOPs retrieval model was specifically developed for inland water bodies, although significant efforts were made on oceanic inversion models. In addition, for inland waters, an IOPs-based model is often preferred for estimating chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, an application of IOPs, over empirical and some semi-empirical algorithms. Then developing a model for estimating both IOPs and Chl-a is of significance for understanding the bio-optical properties and occurrence of algal blooms in eutrophic reservoirs, lakes and estuaries. In this paper, an IOPs Inversion Model of Inland Waters (IIMIW) for deriving natural water IOPs and estimating Chl-a is proposed and validated. The results indicate that this model can be used to accurately retrieve absorption coefficients at 443 nm and 665 nm with R-2 = 0.8347 and R-2 = 0.7550 respectively for Indiana study sites, and to estimate Chl-a from the derived absorption coefficients at high accuracies (R-2 = 0.9292 and a mean relative error 21.65%) with samples collected from eight different study sites in the world and in different seasons. The model was also applied on Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Application (AISA) images to map IOPs and Chl-a. Through validation by in situ measured Chl-a, results directly show that IIMIW can predict Chl-a with good accuracy even using the AISA bands, to as well indirectly prove that non-water absorption coefficients are retrieved accurately, at least within red and near-infrared region. Further biogeochemical information can be derived from these maps as well. These promising mapping results reveal possible remote routine surveillance of bio-optical states of inland waters.

As a result, large errors are associated with derived water column properties. These deficiencies greatly reduce the ability to use satellites to assess the shallow water environments around coral reefs and seagrass beds. Here, a modified version of an existing algorithm is used to derive multispectral diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) from MODIS/Aqua measurements over optically shallow waters in the Florida Keys. Results were validated against concurrent in situ data (K-d(488) from 0.02 to 0.20 m(-1), N = 22, R-2 = 0.68, Mean Ratio = 0.93, unbiased RMS = 31%), and showed significant improvement over current products when compared to the same in situ data (N = 13, R-2 = 037, Mean Ratio = 1.61, unbiased RMS = 50%). The modified algorithm was then applied to time series of MODIS/Aqua data over the Florida Keys (in particular, the Florida Keys Reef Tract), whereby spatial and temporal patterns of water clarity between 2002 and 2011 were elucidated. Climatologies, time series, anomaly images, and empirical orthogonal function analysis showed primarily nearshore-offshore gradients in water clarity and its variability, with peaks in both at the major channels draining Florida Bay. ANOVA revealed significant differences in K-d(488) according to distance from shore and geographic region. Excluding the Dry Tortugas, which had the lowest climatological K-d(488), water was clearest at the northern extent of the Reef Tract, and K-d(488) significantly decreased sequentially for every region along the tract. Tests over other shallow-water tropical waters such as the Belize Barrier Reef also suggested general applicability of the algorithm. As water clarity and light availability on the ocean bottom are key environmental parameters in determining the health of shallow-water plants and animals, the validated new products provide unprecedented information for assessing and monitoring of coral reef and seagrass health, and could further assist ongoing regional zoning efforts.

The study was designed to link TP concentrations with relevant water quality parameters and remote sensing reflectance bands in aquatic environments using in-situ data from a local database to support the calibration and validation of the GP model. The GP models show the effective capacity to demonstrate snapshots of spatiotemporal distributions of TP across the Bay, which helps to delineate the short-term seasonality effects and the decadal trends of TP in an environmentally sensitive coastal bay area. In the past decade, urban development and agricultural activities in the Bay area have substantially increased the use of fertilizers. Landfall hurricanes, including Frances and Jeanne in 2004 and Wilma in 2005, followed by continuous droughts from 2006 to 2008 in South Florida, made the Bay area an ideal place for a remote sensing impact assessment. A changing hydrological cycle, triggered by climate variations, exhibited unique regional patterns of varying TP waste loads into the Bay over different time scales ranging from seasons to years. With the aid of the derived GP model in this study, we were able to explore these multiple spatiotemporal distributions of TP concentrations in the Tampa Bay area aquatic environment and to elucidate these coupled dynamic impacts induced by both natural hazards and anthropogenic perturbations. This advancement enables us to identify the hot moments and hot spots of TP concentrations in the Tampa Bay region. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This SSR product has been recently derived based on the visible channel of the Meteosat First Generation satellites, providing a dataset with a high spatial resolution (0.03 degrees x 0.03 degrees) covering the 1983-2005 period. The CM SAF SSR product is compared against a homogeneous dataset of surface observations from the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA) over Europe, which has been homogenized by means of the Standard Normal Homogeneity Test (SNHT). The results show a good agreement between both datasets (r(2) = 0.86, p < 0.01), with a slight overestimation (bias of +5.20 W m(-2)) of the CM SAF records as compared to the surface observations on a monthly mean basis. Equally, there is a monthly mean absolute bias difference (MABD) of 8.19 W m(-2) that is below the accuracy threshold defined by the CM SAF. There is a clear maximum and minimum MABD during summer and winter, respectively, with an opposite cycle if the relative MABD values are considered. Moreover, the temporal stability of the CM SAF SSR is checked against the GEBA stations for the mean time series over Europe, as well as for each individual series. The results point to possible inhomogeneities in the CM SAF records around 1987 and 1994, possibly due to changes in the satellite instruments, although other factors such as the lack of aerosol retrievals in the CM SAF SSR are also discussed. Consequently, the study of the means and trends in the SSR derived from CM SAF is only recommended for the records after 1994. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

An effective coastal management strategy should therefore map and actively monitor the distribution of this sentinel for any significant changes. While manual transect methods are commonly employed to map eelgrass, the analysis of remote imagery has been proposed as an efficient alternative; a remote sensor can capture large and inaccessible areas cost- and time-effectively, nearly instantly, and with high frequency. The purpose of this study was to explore and compare the efficacy of high spatial resolution airborne (AISA) and satellite (IKONOS) imagery for mapping eelgrass distribution at Sidney Spit, Gulf Islands National Park Reserve of Canada (GINPRC). The primary objective was to determine the optimal spectral resolution, spatial resolution and image processing effort for resolving bed location. A two-meter resolution hyperspectral AISA image and a four-meter resolution multispectral IKONOS image were acquired over Sidney Spit in August 2008. Concurrently collected were in situ above-water hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance, underwater videography, and water samples for optical constituent analysis. The images were subjected to varying combinations of 1) image processing steps: atmospheric correction, surface glint correction, deep water masking, and water column removal; 2) image classifiers: with differing user effort and data input requirements; and 3) spectral resolution: >200-band AISA versus a reduced resolution AISA image (AISA(r)) of only four key bands unique to eelgrass - slope 500-530 nm, first derivatives of 556 nm, 580 nm, and 602 nm (O\'Neill et al. (2011)) - versus four-band IKONOS. The highest classification accuracies were achieved with atmospheric correction, glint correction, deep water masking, and maximum likelihood (ML) classification of the AISA(r) image and IKONOS full resolution image. AISA(r) achieved eelgrass producer and user accuracies of 85% in water less than 3 m deep, and 93% in deeper areas. IKONOS achieved 79% for water less than 3 m deep and 91% in deeper areas. Most confusion occurred between eelgrass and green algae, and between exposed eelgrass and other exposed vegetation. The most automated combination of methods yielded poor accuracies but could be greatly improved by refining atmospheric correction input parameters and building on the endmember spectral library. This study resulted in recommendations for remote eelgrass mapping and monitoring within the GINPRC. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Despite the increasing use of such techniques, and the requirement for well understood uncertainties where analysis of temporal variability is sought, studies that incorporate an assessment of accuracy based on in situ data remain rare. This study presents a rigorous methodology to quantify the uncertainties that apply to glacier flow velocities derived from optical satellite imagery. This method is applied on three successive ASTER images of Tasman Glacier, New Zealand. Evaluation of the quality of co-registration between image pair constituents allows unique uncertainties to be calculated for individual velocity measurements. These uncertainties have magnitudes that correspond to sub-pixel co-registration errors and account for anisotropic co-registration variance. Compared to estimated velocities, uncertainties on the order of 2-30% are achieved. Flow-fields for the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 periods were derived using various spectral bands and validated with in situ data obtained by GPS survey over a nearly coincident period. This revealed the importance of considering the spectral characteristics of the target surface when selecting bands for image correlation, while validation demonstrated the success of the implemented methodology. Uncertainties derived for the flow-fields permitted statistical significance of velocity change between measurement periods to be assessed. Significant velocity changes, observed across the glacier surface, suggest that the Tasman Glacier behaves in a more dynamic way than previously recognised, highlighting the advantages of the methodology described here.

Since the early 1990s, three U.S. National Land Cover Database (NLCD) products (circa 1992, 2001, and 2006) have been released as free downloads for users. The NLCD 2006 also provides land cover change products between 2001 and 2006. To continue providing updated national land cover and change datasets, a new initiative in developing NLCD 2011 is currently underway. We present a new Comprehensive Change Detection Method (CCDM) designed as a key component for the development of NLCD 2011 and the research results from two exemplar studies. The CCDM integrates spectral-based change detection algorithms including a Multi-Index Integrated Change Analysis (MIICA) model and a novel change model called Zone, which extracts change information from two Landsat image pairs. The MIICA model is the core module of the change detection strategy and uses four spectral indices (CV, RCVMAX, dNER, and dNDVI) to obtain the changes that occurred between two image dates. The CCDM also includes a knowledge-based system, which uses critical information on historical and current land cover conditions and trends and the likelihood of land cover change, to combine the changes from MIICA and Zone. For NLCD 2011, the improved and enhanced change products obtained from the CCDM provide critical information on location, magnitude, and direction of potential change areas and serve as a basis for further characterizing land cover changes for the nation. An accuracy assessment from the two study areas show 100% agreement between CCDM mapped no-change class with reference dataset, and 18% and 82% disagreement for the change class for WRS path/row p22r39 and p33r33, respectively. The strength of the CCDM is that the method is simple, easy to operate, widely applicable, and capable of capturing a variety of natural and anthropogenic disturbances potentially associated with land cover changes on different landscapes.

A statistical Landsat metadata analysis is reported considering more than 800,000 Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM + acquisitions obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center archive. The global monthly probabilities of acquiring a cloud-free land surface observation for December 1998 to November 2001 (2000 epoch) and from December 2008 to November 2011 (2010 epoch) are reported to assess the availability of the Landsat data in the USGS Landsat archive for global multi-temporal land remote sensing applications. The global probabilities of acquiring a cloud-free land surface observation in each of three different seasons with the highest seasonal probabilities of cloud-free land surface observation are reported, considering one, two and three years of Landsat data, to assess the availability of Landsat data for global land cover mapping. The probabilities are derived considering Landsat 5 TM only, Landsat 7 ETM + only, and both sensors combined, to examine the relative benefits of using one or both Landsat sensors. The results demonstrate the utility of combing both Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM + data streams to take advantage of their different acquisition patterns and to mitigate the deleterious impact of the Landsat 7 ETM + 2003 scan line failure. Sensor combination provided a greater global acquisition coverage with a 1.7% to 14.4% higher percentage of land locations acquired monthly compared to considering Landsat 7 ETM + data alone. The mean global monthly probability of a cloud-free land surface observation for the combined sensors was up to nearly 1.4 and 6.7 times greater than for ETM + and TM alone respectively. The probability of acquiring a cloud-free Landsat land surface observation in different seasons was greater when more years of data were considered and when both Landsat sensor data were combined. Considering combined sensors and 36 months of data, 86.4% and 84.2% of the global land locations had probabilities >= 0.95 for the 2000 and 2010 epochs respectively, with a global mean probability of 0.92 (sigma 0.24) for the 2000 epoch and 0.90 (sigma 0.28) for the 2010 epoch. These results indicate that 36 months of combined Landsat sensor data will provide sufficient land surface observations for 30 m global land cover mapping using a multi-temporal supervised classification scheme.

Because FMC is calculated from the ratio of canopy water content to dry-matter content, we hypothesized that FMC may be estimated by remote sensing with a ratio of a vegetation water index to a vegetation dry-matter index. Four vegetation water indices, six dry-matter indices, and the resulting water/dry-matter index ratios were calculated using simulated leaf reflectances from the PROSPECT model. Two water indices, the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), were more correlated with leaf water content than with FMC, and were not correlated with leaf dry-matter content. Two dry-matter indices, the Normalized Dry Matter Index (NDMI) and a recent index (unnamed) were correlated to leaf dry matter content, were inversely correlated with FMC, and were not correlated with water content. Ratios of these water indices and these dry-matter indices were highly and consistently correlated with FMC. Ratios of other water indices with other dry-matter indices were not consistently correlated with FMC. The ratio of NDII with NDMI was strongly related to FMC by a quadratic polynomial equation with an R-2 of 0.947. Spectral reflectance data were acquired for single leaves and leaf stacks of Quercus alba, Acer rubrum, and Zea mays; the relationship between FMC and NDII/NDMI had an R-2 of 0.853 and was almost identical to the equation from the PROSPECT model simulations. For the SAIL model simulations, the relationship between NDII/NDMI and FMC at the canopy scale had an R-2 of 0.900, but the quadratic polynomial equation differed from the equations determined from the PROSPECT simulations and spectral reflectance data. NDMI requires narrow-band sensors to measure the effect of dry matter on reflectance at 1722 nm whereas NDII may be determined with many different sensors. Therefore, monitoring FMC with NDII/NDMI requires either a new sensor or a combination of two sensors, one with high temporal resolution for monitoring water content and one with high spectral resolution for estimating dry-matter content.

However, these indices have not been evaluated to detect or to differentiate between plant diseases on crop plants. The aim of this study was to develop specific spectral disease indices (SDIs) for the detection of diseases in crops. Sugar beet plants and the three leaf diseases Cercospora leaf spot, sugar beet rust and powdery mildew were used as model system. Hyperspectral signatures of healthy and diseased sugar beet leaves were assessed with a non-imaging spectroradiometer at different developing stages and disease severities of pathogens. Significant and most relevant wavelengths and two band normalized differences from 450 to 950 nm, describing the impact of a disease on sugar beet leaves were extracted from the data-set using the RELIEF-F algorithm. To develop hyperspectral indices for the detection of sugar beet diseases the best weighted combination of a single wavelength and a normalized wavelength difference was exhaustively searched testing all possible combinations. The optimized disease indices were tested for their ability to detect and to classify healthy and diseased sugar beet leaves. With a high accuracy and sensitivity healthy sugar beet leaves and leaves, infected with Cercospora leaf spot, sugar beet rust and powdery mildew were classified (balanced classification accuracy: 89%, 92%, 87%, 85%, respectively). Spectral disease indices were also successfully applied on hyperspectral imaging data and on non-imaging data from a sugar beet field. Specific disease indices will improve disease detection, identification and monitoring in precision agriculture applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

A novel forward model is presented which allows the reflectances and brightness temperatures from the VIS/IR sensor to be assimilated. The VIS/IR data are assimilated in combination with ice concentration retrievals from a passive microwave sensor using 3D variational data assimilation into a 5 km x 5 km grid of sea ice concentrations. Results are compared with those from an experiment which assimilates only the ice concentration retrievals. It is found that the VIS/IR data have a positive impact as ice on the sea ice state through comparison with independent data. The proportion of points correctly identified asice or open water increased in each region studied by including the AVHRR data, with the largest increase being from 0.921 to 0.935. This positive impact is due to the higher resolution of the VIS/IR data as compared with the passive microwave data, that improves the representation of open water in bays and coastal polynyas. There is however, a degradation in the accuracy of the sea ice state in some regions of the analysis from assimilating the VIS/IR data. Possible ways of improving the impact from VIS/IR data are discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Scott, K.

Airborne hyperspectral imagery was collected over a north/south flight line covering the study site in May and July 2008. Ground data on live FMC were collected concurrently with the flights for ten study plots. Radiance values for the study plots were extracted from the airborne imagery and calibrated to reflectance using spectral measurements from reference targets measured on the ground at the time of the overflights. First derivatives, and a number of vegetation indices (VI), were calculated and correlated with field measured live FMC collected at the study plots. Vegetation FMC maps were produced for the study site for both dates. The results showed that live FMC exhibited spatial and temporal variations that affect the spectral reflectance measured by the airborne hyperspectral instrument, particularly in the near infrared and shortwave infrared regions. Using the first derivative and specific VI improved the correlation between the hyperspectral data and live FMC, but the simple two-wavelength Moisture Stress Index, based on measurements in the near infrared and shortwave infrared, was shown to be effective for FMC estimation. Live FMC was estimated with a root mean square error of 16.8% for all vegetation plots and 10.0% when considering plots composed only of C vulgaris. The results point to the prospect of FMC mapping for improved modelling of fire risk in UK uplands using remotely sensed data. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we provide a thorough uncertainty assessment of multi-temporal airborne laser scanning DEMs based on: (a) applying a statistical error model, (b) comparing laser echoes to reference points and surfaces, and (c) developing a physical error propagation model. The latter model takes into account the measurement platform characteristics, components of the measurement process, and the surface properties. Such a model allows the estimation of systematic and stochastic uncertainties for single laser echoes, as well as for distributed surfaces in every part of the study site, independent of the reference surfaces. The full error propagation framework is applied to multi-temporal DEMs covering the highly undulating terrain in the Findelengletscher catchment in Canton Valais, Switzerland. This physical error propagation model is able to reproduce stochastic uncertainties in accordance with measurements from reference surfaces. The high laser point density in the study site reduces the stochastic uncertainties over the whole glacier area to negligibly small values. However, systematic uncertainties greatly influence the calculation of mass changes and lead to corrections of the thickness change of up to 35%. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, studies of lake response to drivers of change at a pan-European scale are exceptionally rare. The need for such studies has been given renewed impetus by concerns over environmental change and because of international policies, such as the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), which impose legal obligations to monitor the condition of European lakes towards sustainable systems with good ecological status. This has highlighted the need for methods that can be widely applied across large spatial and temporal scales and produce comparable results. Remote sensing promises much in terms of information provision, but the spatial transferability and temporal repeatability of methods and relationships observed at individual or regional case studies remains unproven at the continental scale. This study demonstrates that NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) thermal data are capable of producing highly accurate (R-2>0.9) lake surface temperature (LST) estimates in lakes with variable hydromorphological characteristics and contrasting thermal regimes. Validation of the approach using archived AVHRR thermal data for Lake Geneva produced observations that were consistent with field data for equivalent time periods. This approach provides the basis for generalizing temporal and spatial trends in European lake surface temperature over several decades and confirms the potential of the full 30 year NOAA AVHRR archive to can provide AVHRR-derived LST estimates to help inform European policies on lake water quality.

In 2011, we completed and launched the CAO-2 next generation Airborne Taxonomic Mapping Systems (AToMS), which includes a high-fidelity visible-to-shortwave infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectrometer (380-2510 nm), dual-laser waveform light detection and ranging (LiDAR) scanner, and high spatial resolution visible-to-near infrared (VNIR) imaging spectrometer (365-1052 nm). Here, we describe how multiple data streams from these sensors can be fused using hardware and software co-alignment and processing techniques. With these data streams, we quantitatively demonstrate that precision data fusion greatly increases the dimensionality of the ecological information derived from remote sensing. We compare the data dimensionality of two contrasting scenes - a built environment at Stanford University and a lowland tropical forest in Amazonia. Principal components analysis revealed 336 dimensions (degrees of freedom) in the Stanford case, and 218 dimensions in the Amazon. The Amazon case presents what could be the highest level of remotely sensed data dimensionality ever reported for a forested ecosystem. Simulated misalignment of data streams reduced the effective information content by up to 48%, highlighting the critical role of achieving high precision when undertaking multi-sensor fusion. The instrumentation and methods described here are a pathfinder for future airborne applications undertaken by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and other organizations.

In particular, landscape scales intermediate between stands and regions have not been well studied. Remote sensing is an effective tool for quantifying impacts of insect outbreaks on forest ecosystems at landscape scales. In this study, we developed and evaluated methodologies for quantifying aboveground carbon (AGC) stocks affected by mountain pine beetle using field observations, lidar data, and multispectral imagery. We evaluated methods at two scales, the plot level and the tree level, to ascertain the capability of each for mapping AGC impacts of bark beetle infestation across a forested landscape. In 27 plots across our 5054-ha study area in central Idaho, we measured tree locations, health, diameter, height, and other relevant attributes. We used allometric equations to estimate AGC content of individual trees and, in turn, summed tree AGC estimates to the plot level. Tree-level and plot-level AGC were then predicted from lidar metrics using separate statistical models. At the tree level, cross-validated additive models explained 50-54% of the variation in tree AGC (root mean square error (RMSE) values of 26-42 kg AGC, or 32-48%). At the plot level, a cross-validated linear model explained 84% of the variation in plot AGC (RMSE of 9.2 Mg AGC/ha, or 12%). To map beetle-caused tree mortality, we classified high-resolution digital aerial photography into green, red, and gray tree classes with an overall accuracy of 87% (kappa = 0.79) compared with our field observations. We then combined the multispectral classification with lidar-derived AGC estimates to quantify the amount of AGC within beetle-killed trees at the field plots. Errors in classification, apparent tree lean caused by off-nadir aerial imagery, and a bias between percent cover and percent AGC reduced accuracy when combining multispectral and lidar products. Plot-level models estimated total plot AGC more accurately than tree-level models summed for plots as determined by RMSE (9.2 versus 21 Mg AGC/ha, respectively) and mean bias error (0.52 versus -6.7 Mg AGC/ha, respectively). When considering individual tree classes (green, red, gray) summed for plots, comparisons of plot-level and tree-level methods exhibited mixed results, with some accuracy measures higher for plot-level models. Despite a lack of clear improvement in tree-level models, we suggest that tree-level models should be considered for assessing situations with high spatial variability such as beetle outbreaks, especially if apparent tree lean effects can be minimized such as through the use of satellite imagery. Our methods illustrate the utility of combining lidar and multispectral imagery and can guide decisions about spatial resolution of analysis for understanding and documenting impacts of these forest disturbances.

In this work an automatic procedure based on the Vegetation Cover Method, combined with the GLOBCOVER land surface type classification, is proposed. The algorithm combines this land cover classification with remote sensing information on the vegetation cover fraction to obtain land surface emissivity maps for AATSR split-window bands. The emissivity estimates have been compared with ground measurements in two validation cases in the area of rice fields of Valencia. Spain, and they have also been compared to the classification-based emissivity product provided by MODIS (MOD11_12).

To obtain the corrected land surface reflectance and detect land surface change through time series analysis over rugged surfaces, it is necessary to remove or reduce the topographic effects. In this paper a physics-based BRDF and atmospheric correction model that handles both flat and inclined surfaces in conjunction with a 1-second SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission) derived Digital Surface Model (DSM) product was applied to 8 Landsat scenes covering different seasons and terrain types in eastern Australia. Visual assessment showed that the algorithm removed much of the topographic effect and detected deep shadows in all 8 images. An indirect validation based on the change in correlation between the data and terrain slope showed that the correlation coefficient between the surface reflectance factor and the cosine of the incident (sun) angle reduced dramatically after the topographic correction algorithm was applied. The correlation coefficient typically reduced from 0.80-0.70 to 0.05 in areas of significant relief. It was also shown how the terrain corrected surface reflectance can provide suitable input data for multi-temporal land cover classification in areas of high relief based on spectral signatures and spectral albedo, while the products based only on BRDF and atmospheric correction cannot. To provide comparison with previous work and to validate the proposed algorithm, two empirical methods based on the C-correction were used as well as the established SCS-method to provide benchmarks. The proposed method was found to achieve the same measures of shade reduction without empirical regression. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we examined the capability of fine spatial resolution hyperspectral imagery collected from Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) for vegetation mapping in the Everglades. In order to obtain an efficient and accurate procedure for vegetation discrimination, we developed a neural network classifier first and then combined the object-based texture measures with the classifier to examine the contribution of the spatial information for vegetation mapping. The neural network is capable of modeling the characteristics of multiple spectral and spatial signatures within a class by an internally unsupervised engine and characterizing spectral and spatial differences between classes by an externally supervised system. The designed procedure was tested in a portion of the Everglades. An object-based vegetation map was generated with an overall classification accuracy averaged 94% and a kappa value averaged 0.94 in discriminating 15 classes. The results are significantly better than those obtained from conventional classifiers such as maximum likelihood and spectral angle mapper. The study illustrates that combining object-based texture measures in the neural network classifier can significantly improve the classification. It is concluded that fine spatial resolution hyperspectral data is an effective solution to accurate vegetation mapping in the Everglades which has a rich plant community with a high degree of spatial and spectral heterogeneity.

A possible approach to assess the validity of inference when complex designs are involved is to use a sampling simulator where an artificial population represents the \'ground truth\' and the properties of the estimators are investigated via simulated sampling. To create the artificial population, a large multivariate dataset containing NFI field observations and ALS metrics was generated using a copula function fitted to the empirical observations, and then it was generalized over the study area using satellite imagery and nearest: neighbor imputations. The properties of several design-based model-assisted and model-based variance estimators were investigated using simulated sampling and the accuracy of ALS-based and ground-based estimates under simple random sampling without replacement (SRSwoR) and SYS designs were compared. The simulation results indicated that the ALS-based survey produced valid inference under design-based and model-based frameworks. The variance estimators performed well under two-phase SRSwoR, but the real standard errors were overestimated approximately 4.7 times under two-phase SYS. Compared to the pure ground-based inventories, the estimated standard errors of the ALS-based estimates were approximately 1.8 times larger, while the real accuracy (in terms of root mean squared error) improved with 59%.

USGS is building the ground system and will assume responsibility for satellite operations and for collecting, archiving, and distributing data following launch. The observatory will consist of a spacecraft in low-Earth orbit with a two-sensor payload. One sensor, the Operational Land Imager (OLI), will collect image data for nine shortwave spectral bands over a 185 km swath with a 30 m spatial resolution for all bands except a 15 m panchromatic band. The other instrument, the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), will collect image data for two thermal bands with a 100 m resolution over a 185 km swath. Both sensors offer technical advancements over earlier Landsat instruments. OLI and TIRS will coincidently collect data and the observatory will transmit the data to the ground system where it will be archived, processed to Level 1 data products containing well calibrated and co-registered OLI and TIRS data, and made available for free distribution to the general public. The LDCM development is on schedule for a December 2012 launch. The USGS intends to rename the satellite \"Landsat 8\" following launch. By either name a successful mission will fulfill a mandate for Landsat data continuity. The mission will extend the almost 40-year Landsat data archive with images sufficiently consistent with data from the earlier missions to allow long-term studies of regional and global land cover change.

The basis for this retrieval is the modeling of the in-filling of solar Fraunhofer lines by fluorescence. This contribution to the field of space-based carbon cycle science presents an alternative method for the retrieval of Fs from the Fraunhofer lines resolved by GOSAT-FTS measurements. The method is based on a linear forward model derived by a singular vector decomposition technique, which enables a fast and robust inversion of top-of-atmosphere radiance spectra. Retrievals are performed in two spectral micro-windows (similar to 2-3 nm width) containing several strong Fraunhofer lines. The statistical nature of this approach allows to avoid potential retrieval errors associated with the modeling of the instrument line shape or with a given extraterrestrial solar irradiance data set. The method has been tested on 22 consecutive months of global GOSAT-FTS measurements. The fundamental basis of this F-s retrieval approach and the results from the analysis of the global F-s data set produced with it are described in this work. Among other findings, the data analysis has shown (i) a very good comparison of F-s intensity levels and spatial patterns with the state-of-the-art physically-based F-s retrieval approach described in Frankenberg et al. (2011a), (ii) the overall good agreement between F-s annual and seasonal patterns and other space-based vegetation parameters, (iii) the need for a biome-dependent scaling from F-s to gross primary production, and (iv) the apparent existence of strong directional effects in the F-s emission from forest canopies. These results reinforce the confidence in the feasibility of F-s retrievals with GOSAT-FTS and open several points for future research in this emerging field. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Monitoring its long-term changes over large spatial extents is critical for understanding woody vegetation response to climate variability and global change. However, quantifying tree canopy cover with remotely sensed data remains a challenge for dryland ecosystems where vegetation is sparse and trees, shrubs, and grasses often co-exist at fine spatial scales. In this study, we developed a full SMA (spectral mixture analysis) method that regressed photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and shade components of the SMA with dryland tree cover to monitor tree cover dynamics on a pinyon-juniper woodland landscape in Nevada, USA using Landsat TM data. We assessed 1) how well this method could estimate tree cover in both disturbed (chained and burned) and non-disturbed woodland patches and 2) how sensitive this method was to the confounding effects of climatic variations. The assessment was conducted in comparison with two other more commonly used methods that regressed NDVI or PV with tree cover. Our results showed that although PV performed better than NDVI, both methods overestimated tree canopy cover within recently disturbed woodland patches where the confounding effects of shrubs on greenness index were higher than in non-disturbed patches. The full SMA efficiently quantified variations within post-chaining patches in addition to non-disturbed patches, but overestimated tree cover within burned patches. Of the three methods tested, only full SMA showed promising capability for mitigating the confounding effects of interannual climatic variations on monitoring the woodland recovery process. Our results are generalizable to other semi-arid landscapes comprising a mosaic of small-statured trees intermixed with shrub steppe vegetation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The use of image texture measures, as a proxy for the spatial structure of land cover and vegetation, has proven useful in explaining patterns of avian abundance and species richness. However, prior studies that modeled habitat with texture measures were conducted over small geographical extents and typically focused on a single habitat type. Our goal was to evaluate the performance of texture measures over broad spatial extents and across multiple habitat types with varying levels of vertical habitat structure. We calculated a suite of texture measures from 114 Landsat images over a study area of 1,498,000 km(2) in the Midwestern United States, which included habitats ranging from grassland to forest. Avian species richness was modeled for several functional guilds as a function of image texture. We subsequently compared the explanatory power of texture-only models with models fitted using landscape composition metrics derived from the National Land Cover Dataset, as well as models fitted using both texture and composition metrics. Measures of image texture were effective in modeling spatial patterns of avian species richness in multiple habitat types, explaining up to 51% of the variability in species richness of permanent resident birds. In comparison, landscape composition metrics explained up to 56% of the variability in permanent resident species richness. In the most heavily forested ecoregion, texture-measures outperformed landscape metrics, and the two types of measurements were complementary in multivariate models. However, in two out of three ecoregions examined, landscape composition metrics consistently performed slightly better than texture measures, and the variance explained by the two types of measures overlapped considerably. These results show that image texture measures derived from satellite imagery can be an important tool for modeling patterns of avian species richness at broad spatial extents, and thus assist in conservation planning. However, texture measures were slightly inferior to landscape composition metrics in about three-fourths of our models. Therefore texture measures are best considered in conjunction with landscape metrics (if available) and are best used when they show explanatory ability that is complementarity to landscape metrics.

The estimation of LUE at regional to global scales would be a significant advantage for global carbon cycle research. Traditional methods for canopy level LUE determination require meteorological inputs which cannot be easily obtained by remote sensing. Here we propose a new algorithm that incorporates the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and a modified form of land surface temperature (T-m) for the estimation of monthly forest LUE based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery. Results demonstrate that a model based on EVI x T-m parameterized from ten forest sites can provide reasonable estimates of monthly LUE for temperate and boreal forest ecosystems in North America with an R-2 of 0.51 (p<0.001) for the overall dataset. The regression coefficients (a, b) of the LUE-EVI x T-m correlation for these ten sites have been found to be closely correlated with the average EVI (EVI_ave, R-2=0.68, p=0.003) and the minimum land surface temperature (LST_min, R-2=0.81, p=0.009), providing a possible approach for model calibration. The calibrated model shows comparably good estimates of LUE for another ten independent forest ecosystems with an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.055 g C per mol photosynthetically active radiation. These results are especially important for the evergreen species due to their limited variability in canopy greenness. The usefulness of this new LUE algorithm is further validated for the estimation of gross primary production (GPP) at these sites with an RMSE of 37.6 g Cm-2 month(-1) for all observations, which reflects a 28% improvement over the standard MODIS GPP products. These analyses should be helpful in the further development of ecosystem remote sensing methods and improving our understanding of the responses of various ecosystems to climate change.

However, the spectral response functions of the channels used (centred near 550 nm, 660 nm, 870 nm, and 1.6 mu m) do not exactly match between the two sensors. It is shown that failure to account for differences between the instruments\' spectral response functions leads to errors of typically 0.001-0.01 in spectral surface albedo, and distinct biases, dependent on wavelength and surface type. A technique based on singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to reduce these random errors by an average of 35% at 670 nm and over 60% at the other wavelengths used. The technique reduces the biases so that they are negligible. In principle, the method can be extended to any combination of sensors. The SVD-based scheme is applied to AATSR data from the month of July 2008 and found to increase the number of successful aerosol retrievals, the speed of retrieval convergence, and improve the level of consistency between the measurements and the retrieved state. Additionally, retrieved aerosol optical depth at 550 nm shows an improvement in correspondence when compared to Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

More than 1500 independent pairings between an ISAR record and an AATSR pixel, coincident within specified space-time matching windows, are analysed. These confirm good agreement between the in situ and the satellite derived SST estimates, based on the dual view AATSR algorithms, with a bias of less than 0.1 K which is the accuracy limit of the ISAR. The standard deviation of the comparisons depends on the coincidence criteria: for a match-up window of 1 km and 2 h it is around 0.3 K for the three channel (night only) algorithm and 0.4 K for the 2 channel algorithm. Separate validation statistics are produced for the periods before and after 7 Dec 2005 when a change was made to the AATSR algorithms. It is shown that the error distribution was narrowed by introducing the new algorithm and further narrowed by using only the AATSR data that have the highest Confidence Value. This is the first systematic use of autonomous underway shipboard radiometry on a vessel of opportunity for validating satellite data. The methodology is carefully assessed and shown to provide an effective and reliable means of confirming the high quality and stability of the SST data products from AATSR. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

For a study area covering much of the southern half of Mali, phenological parameters were estimated using a double-logistic function fitted to seasonal NDVI trajectories for 1 km(2) MODIS data over the period 2000-2010. Green-up dates, senescence dates and length of growing season were all found to more strongly vary by latitude (+9 days/degree, 5 days/degree and -14 days/degree, respectively) than across years (+0.42 days/year, +0.86 days/year and +0.44 days/year respectively). Interannual and spatial variability of these parameters are highest at lower latitudes within the study area. The slopes of the relationship of phenological parameters with latitude change across the latitudinal range studied. Breakpoint analysis of annual green-up versus latitude curves identifies a mean inflection point of 13 degrees north latitude above which the positive slope declines significantly. This previously-undescribed pattern is consistent with recent work on monsoonal dynamics showing rainfall onset being associated with an abrupt shift in the location of the ITCZ (monsoon onset) at latitudes north of 13 degrees north latitude. The effects of the observed variation in latitudinal gradients of phenological variables on the direction and timing of regional livestock movements are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Here we demonstrate the sensitivity of Landsat data for detecting gaps at the subpixel level in the Manaus region, Central Amazon. Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) on treefall gaps was used to map their occurrence across a 3.4 x 10(4) km(2) landscape using the annual change in non-photosynthetic vegetation (Delta NPV) as the change metric. Thirty randomly selected pixels with a spectral signature of a treefall event (i.e. high Delta NPV) were surveyed in the field. The most frequent single-pixel gap size detected using Landsat was similar to 360 m(2), and the severity of the disturbance (Delta NPV) exhibited a significant (r(2) = 0.32, p = 0.001) correlation with the number of dead trees (>10 cm diameter at breast height), enabling quantification of the number of downed trees in each gap. To place the importance of these single-pixel disturbances into a broader context, the cumulative disturbance of these gaps was equivalent to 40% of the calculated deforestation across the Manaus region in 2008. Most detected single-pixel gaps consisted of six to eight downed trees covering an estimated area of 250-900 m(2). These results highlight the quantitative importance of small blowdowns that have been overlooked in previous satellite remote sensing studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

But very few studies exist on the dynamics or current status of the Sundarbans coastline. We used Landsat images spanning from 1973 to 2010, and an algorithm that we developed, to consistently estimate the spatiotemporal dynamics of erosion and accretion for four different time intervals and the whole study period. Our results show that the direction and extent of erosion and accretion rates varied throughout the different periods. Erosion was the highest in the 1973-1979 interval, with 23.2 km(2) year(-1) of land loss. However, that rate substantially declined in the following periods, reaching a rate of 7-10 km(2) year(-1). Accretion showed a rate of 10 km(2) year(-1) between 1973 and 1989, but substantially declined to similar to 4 km(2) year(-1) between 1989 and 2010. Accretion rate has declined in the recent years but erosion rate has remained relatively high. As a result the delta front has undergone a net erosion of similar to 170 km(2) of coastal land in the 37 years of our study period. These numbers are significantly higher than the previously reported rates and magnitudes of erosion in this area. The methods and maps developed in this study may be helpful in management planning of this vulnerable coastline. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

A surface urban heat island encompasses the patterns of land surface temperatures in urban areas. The classical indicator to describe a surface urban heat island is the difference between urban and rural surface temperatures. However, several other indicators for this purpose have been suggested in the literature. In this study, we compared the eleven different indicators for quantifying surface urban heat islands that were most frequently used in recent publications on remote sensing-based urban heat island assessments. The dataset used here consists of 263 European cities with monthly mean temperatures from MODIS data products for July 2002, January 2003 and July 2003. We found that (i) the indicators individually reveal diurnal and seasonal patterns but show rather low correlations over time, and (ii) for single points in time, the different indicators show only weak correlations, although they are supposed to quantify the same phenomenon. Differentiating cities according to thermal climate zones increased the relationships between the indicators. Thus, we can identify temporal aspects and indicator selection as important factors determining the estimation of urban heat islands. We conclude that research should take into account the differences and instabilities of the indicators chosen for quantifying surface urban heat islands and should use several indicators in parallel for describing the surface urban heat island of a city.

Methods for estimating biomass on stand level using these data are developed and evaluated, and the results for the two frequency bands are compared. For L-band data, the best results were obtained using HV-polarized backscatter only, giving estimation errors in terms of root mean square errors (RMSE) between 31% and 46% of the mean biomass for stands with biomass ranging from 10 to 290 t/ha, and an (adjusted) coefficient of determination (R-2) between 0.4 and 0.6. For P-band data, the results are better than for L-band. Models using HV- or HH-polarized P-band backscatter give similar results, as does a model including both HV and HH. The RMSEs were between 18 and 27%, and the R-2 values were between 0.7 and 0.8. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Sandberg, G.; Ulander, L. M.

Despite the similarity between the results obtained from the application of the two independent PSI methodologies, significant differences in PS density and distribution were detected, motivating a comparative study between both techniques. We analyze which approach might be more appropriate for studying specific areas/environments, which is helpful in evaluating the benefits that could be derived from an integration of the two methodologies. Several experiments are performed to assess the sensitivity of both PSI approaches to different parameter settings and circumstances. The most significant differences in the processing chain of both procedures are then investigated. We apply both methodologies to the Granada Basin area (southern Spain) and realize that coherence does not improve significantly as function of the methodology applied. If oversampling is implemented in the StaMPS processing chain, the PS density increases so that the density in the urbanized areas is similar to the results provided by DePSI but in all the remaining covers the density is significantly higher. The general results provided by both approaches are very similar in the relative deformations estimated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We examine the application of an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis to phytoplankton pigment data and spectra of the absorption coefficient and remote-sensing reflectance with the aim of discriminating different phytoplankton assemblages in open ocean environments under non-bloom conditions. This technique is applied to an optical and phytoplankton pigment data set collected at several stations within the eastern Atlantic Ocean, where the surface total chlorophyll-a concentration (TChla) ranged from 0.11 to 0.62 mg m(-3). Stations were selected on the basis of significant differences in the ratios of the two most dominant accessory pigments relative to TChla, as derived from High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The performance of cluster analysis applied to absorption and remote-sensing spectra is evaluated by comparisons with the cluster partitioning of the corresponding HPLC pigment data, in which the pigment-based clusters serve as a reference for identifying different phytoplankton assemblages. Two indices, cophenetic and Rand, are utilized in these comparisons to quantify the degree of similarity between pigmentbased and optical-based clusters. The use of spectral derivative analysis for the optical data was also evaluated, and sensitivity tests were conducted to determine the influence of parameters used in these calculations (spectral range, smoothing filter size, and band separation). The results of our analyses indicate that the second derivative calculated from hyperspectral (1 nm resolution) data of the phytoplankton absorption coefficient, a(ph)(lambda), and remote-sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda), provide better discrimination of phytoplanIcton pigment assemblages than traditional multispectral band-ratios or ordinary (non-differentiated) hyperspectral data of absorption and remote-sensing reflectance. The most useful spectral region for this discrimination extends generally from wavelengths of about 425-435 nm to wavelengths within the 495-540 nm range, although in the case of phytoplankton absorption data a broader spectral region can also provide satisfactory results.

However, none of the previous work evaluates AMSR-E performance under the conditions of flood irrigation or other forms of standing water. Also, it should be mentioned that global soil moisture retrievals from AMSR-E typically utilize X-band data. Here, C-band based AMSR-E soil moisture estimates are evaluated using 1 km resolution retrievals derived from L-band aircraft data collected during the National Airborne Field Experiment (NAFE\'06) field campaign in November 2006. NAFE\'06 was conducted in the Murrumbidgee catchment area in southeastern Australia, which offers diverse ground conditions, including extensive areas with dryland, irrigation, and rice fields. The data allowed us to examine the impact of irrigation and standing water on the accuracy of satellite-derived soil moisture estimates from AMSR-E using passive microwave remote sensing. It was expected that in fields with standing water, the satellite estimates would have a lower accuracy as compared to soil moisture values over the rest of the domain. Results showed sensitivity of the AMSR-E to changes in soil moisture caused by both precipitation and irrigation, as well as good spatial (average R = 0.92 and RMSD = 0.049 m(3)/m(3)) and temporal (R = 0.94 and RMSD = 0.04 m(3)/m(3)) agreement between the satellite and aircraft soil moisture retrievals; however, under the NAFE\'06 ground conditions, the satellite retrievals consistently overestimated the soil moisture conditions compared to the aircraft.

This method is based on a mission-by-mission approach, followed by a unique vicarious calibration stage. As the HRS sensor\'s performance may vary in time and space, a vicarious calibration method to retrieve accurate at-sensor radiance values is necessary. In fact, vicarious calibration solutions usually rely on natural, well-known, bright and dark targets that are large in size and radiometrically homogeneous. Since such targets are not commonly found in the field for every mission and their spectral features can sometimes resemble artifacts in the corrected radiance, a new vicarious calibration approach is needed. This paper describes a new method that uses artificial agricultural black polyethylene nets of various densities as vicarious calibration targets that are set up along the airplane\'s trajectory (preferably near the airfield). The different densities of the nets combined with any bright background afford full coverage of the sensor\'s dynamic range. We show that these artificial targets can be used to assess data quality and correct at-sensor radiance within a short time. Several case studies are presented using Aisa-DUAL sensor data taken at different times from different locations. We found that even \"lost data\" (in terms of radiance drift) could be recovered by the suggested method. We term the suggested vicarious calibration approach supervised vicarious calibration (SVC) and demonstrate its performance in terms of spectral accuracy. The limitations of the method are also discussed but the overall conclusion is that the suggested procedure is functional, valuable and practical for sensors with questionable or uncertain laboratory-determined radiometric parameters.

The wavelength range in between, where the main water absorption bands are located, has surprisingly received very little attention because of the complexity of the radiometric signal that mixes both reflected and emitted fluxes. Nevertheless, it is now covered by the latest generation of passive optical sensors (e.g. SEBASS, AHS). This work aims at modeling leaf spectral reflectance and transmittance in the infrared, particularly between 3 mu m and 5 mu m, to improve the retrieval of vegetation water content using hyperspectral data. Two unique datasets containing 32 leaf samples each were acquired in 2008 at the USGS National Center, Reston (VA, USA) and the ONERA Research Center, Toulouse (France). Reflectance and transmittance were recorded using laboratory spectrometers in the spectral region from 0.4 mu m to 14 mu m, and the leaf water and dry matter contents were determined. It turns out that these spectra are strongly linked to water content up to 5.7 mu m. This dependence is much weaker further into the infrared, where spectral features seem to be mainly associated with the biochemical composition of the leaf surface. The measurements show that leaves transmit light in this wavelength domain and that the transmittance of dry samples can reach 0.35 of incoming light around 5 mu m, and 0.05 around 11 mu m. This work extends the PROSPECT leaf optical properties model by taking into account the high absorption levels of leaf constituents (by the insertion of the complex Fresnel coefficients) and surface phenomena (by the addition of a top layer). The new model, PROSPECT-VISIR (VISible to InfraRed), simulates leaf reflectance and transmittance between 0.4 mu m and 5.7 mu m (at 1 nm spectral resolution) with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.017 and 0.018, respectively. Model inversion also allows the prediction of water (RMSE = 0.0011 g/cm(2)) and dry matter (RMSE=0.0013 g/cm(2)) contents. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

However, for soil surfaces, the different BRDF models show a different dependence on illumination geometry (solar zenith and azimuth angles), as well as a different dependence on viewing angle outside the range of RSP measurements. This implies that different models describe the surface-atmosphere interaction differently, leading for soil surfaces to differences in the top-of-atmosphere reflectance up to 4-5%, whereas at surface level the models agree within 2% for RSP illumination and measurement geometry. For vegetation, the different BRDF models show more similar dependence on illumination geometry, meaning that, in general, the differences in top-of-atmosphere reflectances are smaller than the differences in surface total reflectances. For the BPDF. we compare the empirical model of Nadal and Breon (1999) and the model developed by Maignan et al. (2009) with a newly developed model. The latter model compares better with RSP measurements. It was shown that, though all models have essentially different angular profiles at different illumination and viewing geometries, the difference of the top-of-atmosphere degree of linear polarization is less or is of the same order as the degree of linear polarization difference at the surface level taken at RSP illumination and measurement geometry. For the considered models, it can be up to 0.015 but is mostly below 0.005. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Modeling approaches are currently being used to understand and forecast potential management effects in changing insect disturbance trends. However, detailed forest composition data needed for these efforts is often lacking. We used partial least squares (PLS) regression to integrate different combinations of satellite sensor data including landsat, Radarsat-1, and PALSAR, as well as pixel-wise forest structure information derived from SPOT-5 sensor data (Wolter et al., 2009), to determine the best combination of sensor data for estimating near species-level proportional forest composition (12 types: 10 species and 2 genera). Single-sensor and various multi-sensor PLS models showed distinct species-dependent sensitivities to relative basal area (BA), with Landsat variables showing greatest overall sensitivity. However, best results were achieved using a combination of data from all these sensors, with several C-band (Radarsat-1) and L-band (PALSAR) variables showing sensitivity to the composition and abundance of specific species. Pixel-level forest structure estimates derived from SPOT-5 data were generally more sensitive to conifer species abundance (especially white pine) than to hardwood species composition. Relative BA models accounted for 68% (jack pine) to 98% (maple spp.) of the variation in ground data with RMSE values between 2.46% and 5.65% relative BA, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the effective lower limits of usefulness of species relative BA estimates which ranged from 5.94% (jack pine) to 39.41% (black ash). These estimates were then used to produce a dominant forest species map for the study region with an overall accuracy of 78%. Most notably, this approach facilitated discrimination of aspen from paper birch as well as spruce and fir from other conifer species which is crucial for the study of forest tent caterpillar and spruce budworm dynamics in the Upper Midwest. We also demonstrate that PLS regression is an effective data fusion strategy for mapping composition of heterogeneous forests using satellite sensor data. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In Phase I of NAFD forest disturbance history was derived for 23 U.S. sample locations over the time period 1984 to 2005 from biennial Landsat time series stacks (LTSS). This study evaluates the accuracy of these Phase I NAFD disturbance history maps for 6 selected sample locations. We evaluate the disturbance maps using 2 reference datasets: 1) a design-based approach incorporating visual analysis of the LTSS in tandem with high resolution imagery and 2) the USDA FIA field observations. Overall accuracy for the NAFD disturbance product assessed at the individual time step level range from 77% to 86%. We examine the success rates of the mapping approach for capturing different types of disturbance and find that 82% of stand clearing events were detected. When we aggregate the data into change and no change categories the accuracy of stand clearing disturbance samples improved to over 92%. The majority of error in the disturbance maps was due to misclassification of partial disturbance as unchanged forest. We analyze the resulting errors of commission and omission as related to both reference datasets for each ass and present examples to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of Phase I NAFD approach. In addition, we discuss the map biases observed in this work and what this may imply for estimating national forest disturbance rates with this approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The dense snowpack and high sub-grid lake fraction across the tundra mean that conventional brightness temperature difference approaches (such as the commonly used 37 GHz-19 GHz) are not appropriate across the sub-Arctic. Airborne radiometer measurements (with footprint dimensions of approximately 70x120 m) acquired across sub-Arctic Canada during three field campaigns during the 2008 winter season were utilized to illustrate a slope reversal in the 37 GHz T-B versus SWE relationship. Scattering by the tundra snowpack drives a negative relationship until a threshold SWE value is reached near 130 mm at which point emission from the snowpack creates a positive but noisier relationship between 37 GHz T-B and SWE.   The change from snowpack scattering to emission was also evident in the temporal evolution of 37 GHz T-B observed from satellite measurements. AMSR-E brightness temperatures (2002/03-2006/07) consistently exhibited decreases through the winter before reaching a minimum in February or March, followed by an increase for weeks or months before melt. The cumulative absolute change (Sigma vertical bar Delta 37V vertical bar) in vertically polarized 37 GHz T-B was computed at both monthly and pentad intervals from a January 1 start date and compared to ground measured SWE from intensive and regional snow survey campaigns, and climate station observations. A greater (lower) cumulative change in vertical bar Delta 37V vertical bar was significantly related to greater (lower) ground measured SWE (r(2) = 0.77 with monthly averages: r(2) = 0.67 with pentad averages). Sigma vertical bar Delta 37V vertical bar was only weakly correlated with lake fraction: monthly r(2) values calculated for January through April 2003-2007 were largely less than 0.2. These results indicate that this is a computationally straightforward and viable algorithmic framework for producing tundra-specific SWE datasets from the complete satellite passive microwave record (1979 to present).

Multivariate representation of forest structure can be used as a means to infer other environmental attributes such as biodiversity and habitat, which have often been shown to be enhanced in more structurally diverse or complex forests. Image-based modelling of multivariate forest structure is useful in developing an understanding of the associations between different aspects of vertical and horizontal structure and image characteristics. Models can also be applied spatially to all image pixels to produce maps of multivariate forest structure as an alternative to sample-based field assessment. This research used high spatial resolution multispectral airborne imagery to provide spectral, spatial, and object-based information in the development of a model of multivariate forest structure as represented by twenty-four field variables measured in plots within a temperate hardwood forest in southern Quebec, Canada. Redundancy Analysis (RDA) was used to develop a model that explained a statistically significant proportion of the variance of these structural attributes. The resulting model included image variables representing mostly within-crown and within-shadow brightness variance (texture) as well as elevation, taken from a DEM of the study area. It was applied spatially across the entire study area to produce a continuous map of predicted multivariate forest structure. Bootstrapping validation of the model provided an RMSE of 19.9%, while independent field validation of mapped areas of complex and simple structure showed accuracies of 89% and 69%, respectively. Multiscale testing using resampled imagery suggested that the methods could possibly be used with current pan-sharpened, or future sub-metre resolution, multispectral satellite imagery, which would provide much greater spatial coverage and reduced image processing compared to airborne imagery.

The procedure takes advantage of the temporal resolution of SEVIRI (one image every 15 min), and relies on information from SEVIRI channels (namely 0.6, 0.8, 3.9, 10.8 and 12.0 mu m) together with information on illumination angles. The method is based on heritage from contextual algorithms designed for polar, sun-synchronous instruments, namely NOAA/AVHRR and MODIS/TERRA-AQUA. A potential fire pixel is compared with the neighboring ones and the decision is made based on relative thresholds as derived from the pixels in the neighborhood.   An overview is provided of results obtained for January and July 2007, respectively over Northern Africa (NAfr) and Southern Africa (SAfr), paying special attention to the spatial and temporal distribution of active fires. In both NAfr and SAfr, two types of vegetation clearly dominate in terms of fire activity, namely tree-covered areas, containing 40% of total fires observed, and shrub-covered areas, with 25% (19%) of total fires in NAfr (SAfr). However, marked differences were also to be found between the two regions; more than two-thirds (70%) of fires in SAfr were observed in land cover classes dominated by trees but the proportion is much lower (40%) in the case of NAfr. The duration of active fires in both regions tends to follow two-parameter generalized Pareto distributions, with both the scale and the shape parameters presenting very similar values for NAfr and SAfr.   An assessment of the robustness of the algorithm, consistency of results and added value of the product was made by studying the daily cycle of fire activity over two regions located in northern and southern hemisphere Africa and by means of systematic comparisons against fire incidence reported in previous works and against hot spots extracted from the global daily active fire product developed by the MODIS Fire Team. The observed fire incidence by land cover class compares well with the results reported in previous works and it is shown that there is an overall coherence between results obtained from SEVIRI and MODIS when adequate spatial and temporal scales are chosen when performing the comparison.

The earth-atmospheric albedo was obtained from a geostationary satellite (GMS5) while the total column ozone was retrieved from a polar orbiting satellite (EP/TOMS). The model was validated against the monthly average EUV daily dose from the measurements at four solar radiation monitoring stations located in the tropical environment of Thailand. The monthly average EUV daily dose calculated from the model was in reasonable agreement with that obtained from the measurement, with root mean square difference (RMSD) and mean bias difference (MBD) of 12.3% and 0.7%, respectively. After the validation, the model was used to calculate the monthly average EUV daily dose over Thailand employing an 8-year period of data from GMS5. EP/TOMS and other ancillary surface data. Values of the monthly average of EUV daily dose were presented as monthly and yearly maps. These maps reveal that the tropical monsoons have a strong influence on the EUV in this region.

Once vagueness is admitted, it is not sufficient to stop at modelling land cover simply as a fuzzy set, because any threshold map (alpha-cut) of the fuzzy set is itself a Boolean set. Rather it may be appropriate to model it as a type 2 fuzzy set recognising the existence of higher order vagueness. Using the example of estimating land cover extents in an area of the forest-savanna ecotone in Bolivia, this paper,presents the results and possible advantages of a type 2 fuzzy analysis of land cover. The consideration of type 2 fuzzy sets reveals the depth of the uncertainty, and allows the analyst to be specific about minimum, maximum, and average extents of land cover types and even to report fuzzy area itself as a fuzzy number and to justify descriptive qualifications of the results. The nuanced analysis, which is possible with this approach, seems an advance for the scientific community concerned with the conceptualisation of land cover classes, but it may be a nuisance for those involved in policy matters.

Recently, alternative retrieval algorithms based on the spectral fitting of hyperspectral radiance observations, Spectral Fitting Methods (SFMs), have been proposed. The aim of this manuscript is to investigate the performance of such algorithms and to provide relevant information regarding their use. FLD and SFMs were used to estimate F starting from Top Of Canopy (TOC) fluxes at very high spectral resolution (0.12 nm) and sampling interval (0.1 nm), exploiting the O-2-B (687.0 nm) and O-2-A (760.6 nm) atmospheric oxygen absorption bands overlapping the fluorescence emissions at the red and far-red spectral window.   Specific parameters affecting FLD and SFM performances are investigated and the accuracy of F estimation of the two methods is compared. The problem related to the lack of independent measurements of Fat canopy level, which prevents the direct assessment of F estimation accuracy with actual measurements, is overcome in this study by using a modeled database of TOC reflectance spectra. In order to compute accuracy figures valid for operative applications the simulated spectra were perturbed by the addition of radiometric noise. An investigation was conducted to determine the best FLD channel configuration; it showed that violation of FLD assumptions results in a positive bias in F estimation at both oxygen absorption bands that cannot be avoided even at the high spectral resolution considered. SFMs were shown to be more accurate than FLD under any noise configuration considered. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The altimetric time series observed between 2002 and 2008 show variations at 3 different time scales (daily, seasonal and inter-annual), that correlate directly with variations in the snow surface properties. In this study we focus on the analysis of the rapid daily event, occurring on February 14th 2005, that created a jump of the backscatter coefficient of up to 5.3 dB at the S band and 2.5 dB at the Ku band. The ratio of V/H-polarization brightness temperature slowly decreased in December and January 2005, and suddenly increased on February 14th 2005.   The origin of this rapid event is investigated using AWS data from Vostok station, altimetric and radiometric data simultaneously. Both snow surface density and roughness are found to vary during this event. This event is shown to be synchronous with strong wind occuring during a period of anomalous wind direction, and the presence of surface hoar. These particular conditions certainly modified the snow surface roughness and thus impacted the altimetric signal. We finally investigate the impact of this event on the calculation of the regional ice-sheet mass-balance using different corrections of height with echo shape variations. It is shown to be negligible only if the full echo shape correction (Legresy et al., 2006) is used. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In the Everglades region, and particularly in Water Conservation Area 2A (WCA-2A), phosphorus enrichment has drawn a lot of attention and has led to an extensive documentation of different aspects of the degradation of the system. This study presents a hybrid geospatial modeling approach to predict soil total phosphorus (TP) using remotely-sensed data and ancillary landscape properties as supporting variables. Two remote sensors, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM)+ and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), were used to investigate relationships between spectral data and indices and soil TR A variation of a vegetation index (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI green) was found to be the most effective in predicting floc TP values, due to its capacity to capture small variations in chlorophyll a that are associated to TP levels in periphyton, especially in aquatic/non-impacted areas. On the other hand, NDVI, a more traditionally used vegetation index, was still a good indicator of TP variability, particularly in the soil surface layer, due to its stronger relationship with impacted areas dominated by cattail (Typha domingensis Pers.).   Findings from this study indicate that: a) remote sensing can play an important role in optimizing monitoring of environmental variables, particularly below-ground properties of floc and soils: b) because of limitations about the numbers and frequency of soil samples that can be taken, the combination of remote sensing and geostatistics could represent a non-invasive and cost-effective method to monitor soil nutrient status in complex wetland systems, and c) variations of traditional remote sensing indices such as NDVI can be used to better capture the spatial variability associated with soil and periphyton TP.

This paper presents an operative and accurate procedure to estimate FMC though MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectrometer) data and simulation models. The new aspects of the method are its consideration of several ecological criteria to parameterize the models and consistently avoid simulating unrealistic spectra which might produce indetermination (ill-posed) problems when inverting the model. The methodology was operatively applicable to 12 shrubland plots located in different provinces of the Mediterranean region of Spain and tested with field data collected in those areas. The results showed that the proposed method efficiently tracks changes of FMC with average errors around 15%. However the model under-estimates FMC values higher than 135.68% since those situations were not included in the simulation scheme and the inversion precision is also dependent on an accurate estimation of LAI. These limitations will be overcome in future work mainly by including spectral signatures of vegetation with FMC values higher than 135.68% in the simulations, and by exploring new methods for LAI retrieval. Further efforts will also be devoted to extend this approach to other ecosystems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The water adjustment replaces ASTER emissivity values over inland water bodies with a measured library emissivity spectrum of distilled water, and then re-calculates the surface temperatures using a split-window algorithm. The accuracy of ASTER emissivities over vegetated surfaces is improved by applying a fractional vegetation cover adjustment (TES_Pv) to the ASTER Temperature Emissivity Separation (TES) calibration curve.

An impediment to broader use of remote sensing science for monitoring has been the need for resource managers to understand the specialized capabilities of an ever-expanding array of image sources and analysis techniques. Here, we provide guidelines that will enable land managers to more effectively collaborate with remote sensing scientists to develop and apply remote sensing science to achieve monitoring objectives. We first describe fundamental characteristics of remotely sensed data and change detection analysis that affect the types and range of phenomena that can be tracked. Using that background, we describe four general steps in natural resource remote sensing projects: image and reference data acquisition, pre-processing, analysis, and evaluation. We emphasize the practical considerations that arise in each of these steps. We articulate a four-phase process that guides natural resource and remote sensing specialists through a collaborative process to articulate goals, evaluate data and options for image processing, refine or eliminate unrealistic paths, and assess the cost and utility of different options.

Multispectral airborne data was acquired at 150 m above ground level in the thermal, visible and near infrared regions yielding imagery at 15 cm spatial resolution. Simultaneous field experiments conducted in olive, peach, and orange orchards (water stress trials), and an olive orchard (variety trial) enabled the detected variability in fluorescence emission to be examined as function of stress status. In a parallel modelling activity the coupled leaf-canopy reflectance-fluorescence model, FluorMOD, was used to assess fluorescence retrieval capability by the in-filling method, as well as by fluorescence indices from the published literature. Fluorescence retrievals using the in-filling method, the derivative index D702/D680 and reflectance indices R690/R630, R761-R757, and R761/R757 yielded the best results in the simulation study, while demonstrating insensitivity to leaf area index (LAI) variation. The fluorescence in-filling method, derivative index D702/D680, and R761-R757 were the indices least affected by chlorophyll a + b (Cab) variation. On the other hand, other published indices for fluorescence detection at leaf and canopy levels exhibited high sensitivity to variations in Cab and LAI, and therefore were considered less suitable for in-field fluorescence detection. The fluorescence signal extraction from airborne imagery using the in-filling method was validated through comparisons with field-measured steady-state fluorescence (Fs) using the PAM-2100 and GFS-3000 instruments, confirming simulation predictions. The water stress experiments conducted on olive and peach orchards demonstrated the feasibility of chlorophyll fluorescence (F) extraction at the tree level from the airborne imagery, yielding determination coefficients r(2)=0.57 (olive), and r(2)=0.54 (peach). Consistent results were obtained between airborne F and ground truth assimilation (A) measured in the olive variety field experiment under no water stress levels, yielding r(2)=0.71.

In this study, the variability of ground reflectance in the boreal forest zone was investigated in order to assess the feasibility of satellite sensors to the mapping of snow covered area (SCA). This aims at the improvement of the existing snow mapping algorithms, such as the reflectance model-based snow monitoring method SCAmod of the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE). We acquired and identified some statistical features for reflectance spectra of seasonally snow covered and snow-free terrain by using a field spectro radiometer (ASD Field Spec Pro JR). Extensive measurement campaigns were carried out in 20072008 in northern Finland, resulting to hundreds of spectral samples between 350 and 2500 nm. The main emphasis was put on the determination of the melting snow reflectance under different weather conditions and stages of snow metamorphosis as well as over different terrain types. The gained reflectance spectra provide useful information for optical snow mapping studies in general. In this investigation, the primary function of the spectrometer data was the accuracy assessment and optimal band selection when applying the SCAmod-method to different space-borne instruments (MODIS, MERIS and AVHRR). The correspondence of small scale field observations with scene reflectance was also addressed. This was performed by comparing field spectrometer data with mast-based observations.   Based on the inversibility of the SCAmod reflectance model, we addressed the standard deviation (standard error) of SCA estimation contributed by wet snow and snow-free ground reflectance fluctuations. An average error in the determination of the fractional Snow Covered Area (SCA) of about 5-7 %-units was obtained (range from 0% = snow-free ground to 100%= full snowcover), the maximum error of 10-12 %-units occurring at full snow cover conditions (for the moment when first open patches are emerging). These investigations show that the variability in the reflectances of snow and snow-free ground is a significant error source in snow mapping. However, providing the SCA with descriptive error statistics is very beneficial for further use as the error statistics are needed for data assimilation approaches, e.g. in using SCA-values as input to hydrological models.

Conventional vegetation classification and mapping approaches are based on discrete arbitrary classes which do not capture gradual changes in forest type (and corresponding biodiversity and ecosystem services values) from site to site. We developed a simple multi-date NDVI based Mahalanobis distance measure (called eco-climatic distance) that quantifies forest type variability across a moisture gradient for complex tropical forested landscapes on a single ecologically interpretable, continuous scale. This Mahalanobis distance, unlike other distance measures takes into account the variability in the reference class and shared information amongst bands as it is based on the covariance matrix, and therefore is most useful to summarize ecological distance of a pixel to a reference class in multi-band remotely sensed space In this study we successfully apply this measure as a surrogate for tree biodiversity and ecosystem services at two nested scales for the Western Chats Bio-diversity hotspot. Data from over 500 tree-plots and forest type maps was used to test the ability of this remotely sensed distance to be a surrogate for abundance based tree-species compositional turn-over and as a continuous measure of forest type and ecosystem services. Our results suggest a strong but scale dependant relationship between the remotely-sensed distance measure and floristic distance between plots. The multi-date NDVI distance measure emerges as very good quantitative surrogate for forest type and is a useful complement to existing forest classification systems. This surrogate quantifies forest type variability on a single, continuous quantitative scale and has important applications in conservation planning and mapping and monitoring of hydrologic and carbon storage and sequestration services.

Airborne imagery was acquired with a 6-band multispectral camera yielding 15 cm spatial resolution and 10 nm FWHM over 3 crops comprising two tree-structured orchards and a corn field. The methodology is based on the PRI as a water stress indicator, and a radiative transfer modelling approach to simulate PRI baselines for non-stress conditions as a function of leaf structure, chlorophyll concentration (Cab), and canopy leaf area index (LAI). The simulation work demonstrates that canopy PRI is affected by structural parameters such as LAI, Cab, leaf structure, background effects, viewing angle and sun position. The modelling work accounts for such leaf biochemical and canopy structural inputs to simulate the PRI-based water stress thresholds for non-stress conditions. Water stress levels are quantified by comparing the image-derived PRI and the simulated non-stress PRI (sPRI) obtained through radiative transfer. PRI simulation was conducted using the coupled PROSPECT-SAILH models for the corn field, and the PROSPECT leaf model coupled with FLIGHT 3D radiative transfer model for the olive and peach orchards. Results obtained confirm that PRI is a pre-visual indicator of water stress, yielding good relationships for the three crops studied with canopy temperature, an indicator of stomatal conductance (r(2) = 0.65 for olive, r(2) = 0.8 for peach, and r(2) = 0.72 for maize). PRI values of deficit irrigation treatments in olive and peach were consistently higher than the modelled PRI for the study sites, yielding relationships with water potential (r(2) = 0.84) that enabled the identification of stressed crowns accounting for within-field LAI and Cab variability. The methodology presented here for water stress detection is based on the visible part of the spectrum, and therefore it has important implications for remote sensing applications in agriculture. This method may be a better alternative to using the thermal region, which has limitations to acquire operationally high spatial resolution thermal imagery. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast, vegetation in riparian zones can filter pollutants and reduce flow velocities that incise stream channels. We examined the relationship between the built environment and water quality for streams (1st through 4th order) across three physiographic provinces of the State of Maryland, USA, including 59 watersheds with some 865 stream sampling locations. We used image data products capable of discriminating fine-scale information of the land surface, including proportional impervious, tree, grass and crop cover. Stepwise multiple linear regression and decision tree statistical approaches were used to assess the relationship between the land cover predictors and benthic indices of biological integrity (BIBI) and number of sensitive invertebrate taxa (NEPT), response variables derived from the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS). Impervious and tree cover were found to be the best predictors of stream biota, although this varied with physiographic province and the response variable of interest. The best multivariate models predicted 65% of variability in BIBI and 62% of NEPT (p<0.001). The configuration of tree cover across the landscape and the distance of land cover to the stream channel was found to be important in many, but not all cases for improving the predictive quality of statistical models estimating stream biota metrics.

We integrated three approaches in a multi-disciplinary evaluation of the potential for using hyperspectral imaging as a tool to assess nutrient enrichment and vegetation responses in tidal wetlands. For hyperspectral imaging to be an effective tool, spectral signatures must vary in ways correlated with water nutrient content either directly, or indirectly via such proxies as vegetation responses to elevated nitrogen. Working in Elkhorn Slough, central California, where intensive farming practices generate considerable runoff of fertilizers and pesticides, we looked first for long- and short-term trends among temporally ephemeral point data for nutrients and other water quality characters collected monthly at 18 water sampling stations since 1988. Second, we assessed responses of the dominant wetland plant, Salicornia virginica (common pickleweed) to two fertilizer regimes in 0.25 m(2) experimental plots, and measured changes in tissue composition (C, H, N), biomass, and spectral responses at leaf and at canopy scales. Third, we used HyMap hyperspectral imagery (126 bands; 15-19 nm spectral resolution: 2.5 m spatial resolution) for a synoptic assessment of the entire wetland ecosystem of Elkhorn Slough. We mapped monospecific Salicornia patches (similar to 56-500 m(2)) on the ground adjacent to the 18 regular water sampling sites, and then located these patches in the hyperspectral imagery to correlate long-term responses of larger patches to water nutrient regimes. These were used as standards for correlating plant canopy spectral responses with nitrogen variation described by the water sampling program. There were consistent positive relationships between nitrogen levels and plant responses in both the field experiment and the landscape analyses. Two spectral indices, the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) and Derivative Chlorophyll Index (DCI), were correlated significantly with water nutrients. We conclude that hyperspectral imagery can be used to detect nutrient enrichment across three spatial and at least two temporal scales. and suggest that more quantitative information could be extracted with further research and a greater understanding of physiological and physical mechanisms linking water chemistry, plant properties and spectral imaging characteristics.

This work assessed the accuracy of commonly available airborne hyper-spectral and satellite multi-spectral image data sets for mapping seagrass species composition, horizontal horizontal-projected foliage cover and above-ground dry-weight biomass. The work was carried out on the Eastern Banks in Moreton Bay, Australia, an area of shallow and clear coastal waters, containing a range of seagrass species, cover and biomass levels. Two types of satellite image data were used: Quickbird-2 multi-spectral and Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper multi-spectral. Airborne hyper-spectral image data were acquired from a CASI-2 sensor using a pixel size of 4.0 m. The mapping was constrained to depths shallower than 3.0 m, based on past modelling of the separability of seagrass reflectance signatures at increasing water depths. Out results demonstrated that mapping of seagrass cover, species and biomass to high accuracy levels (>80%) was riot possible across all image types. For each parameter mapped, airborne hyper-spectral data produced the highest overall accuracies (46%), followed by Quickbird-2 and then Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper. The low accuracy levels were attributed to the mapping methods and difficulties in matching locations on image and field data sets. Accurate mapping of seagrass cover, species composition and biomass, using simple approaches, requires further work using high-spatial resolution (<5 m) and/or hyper-spectral image data. Further work is required to determine if and how the seagrass maps produced in this work are Suitable for measuring attributes of seagrass biodiversity, and using these data for modelling floral and fauna biodiversity properties of seagrass environments, and for scaling-up seagrass ecosystem models.

Incorporating spatial-temporal contextual information in the classification helps to reduce the classification errors, thus improving change detection results. In this paper, spatial-temporal Markov Random Fields (MRF) models were used to integrate spatial-temporal information with spectral information for multi-temporal classification in an attempt to mitigate the impacts of classification errors on change detection. One important component in spatial-temporal MRF models is the specification of transition probabilities. Traditionally, a global transition probability model is used that assumes spatial stationarity of transition probabilities across an image scene, which may be invalid if areas have varying transition probabilities. By relaxing the stationarity assumption, we developed two local transition probability models to make the transition model locally adaptive to spatially varying transition probabilities. The first model called locally adjusted global transition model adapts to the local variation by multiplying a pixel-wise probability of change with the global transition model. The second model called pixel-wise transition model was developed as a fully local model based on the estimation of the pixel-wise joint probabilities. When applied to the forest change detection in Paraguay, the two local models showed significant improvements in the accuracy of identifying the change from forest to non-forest compared with traditional models. This indicates that the local transition probability models can present temporal information more accurately in change detection algorithms based on spatial-temporal classification of multi-temporal images. The comparison between the two local transition models showed that the fully local model better captured the spatial heterogeneity of the transition probabilities and achieved more stable and consistent results over different regions of a large image scene.

Hyperspectral remote sensing has a valuable role in the monitoring of such dynamics. This study focussed upon improving the accuracy of chlorophyll quantification by applying wavelet analysis to reflectance spectra. Leaf-scale radiative transfer models were used to generate very large spectral data sets with which to develop and rigorously test refinements to the approach and compare it with existing spectral indices. The results demonstrated that by decomposing leaf spectra, the resultant wavelet coefficients can be used to generate accurate predictions of chlorophyll concentration, despite wide variations in the range of other biochemical and biophysical factors that influence leaf reflectance. Wavelet analysis outperformed predictive models based on untransformed spectra and a range of spectral indices. The paper discusses the possibilities for further refining the wavelet approach and for extending the technique to the sensing of a variety of vegetation properties at a range of spatial scales.

It is characterized by its changing nature. Monitoring snow cover extent plays a significant role in dynamic studies and prevention of snow-caused disasters in pastoral areas. Using NASA EOS Terra/MODIS snow cover products and in situ observation data during the four snow seasons from November 1 to March 31 of year 2001 to 2005 in northern Xinjiang area, the accuracy of MODIS snow cover mapping algorithm under varied snow depth and land cover types was analyzed. The overall accuracy of MODIS daily snow cover mapping algorithm in clear sky condition is high at 98.5%; snow agreement reaches 98.2%, and ranges from 77.8% to 100% over the 4-year period for individual sites. Snow depth (SD) is one of the major factors affecting the accuracy of MODIS snow cover maps. MODIS does not identify any snow for SD less than 0.5 cm. The overall accuracy increases with snow depth if SD is equal to or greater than 3 cm, and decreases for SD below 3 cm. Land cover has an important influence in the accuracy of MODIS snow cover maps. The use of MOD10A1 snow cover products is severely affected by cloud cover. The 8-day composite products of MOD10A2 can effectively minimize the effect of cloud cover in most cases. Cloud cover in excess of 10% occurs on 99% of the MOD10A1 products and 14.7% of the MOD10A2 products analyzed during the four snow seasons. User-defined multiple day composite images based on MOD10A1, with flexibilities of selecting composite period, starting and ending date and composite sequence of MOD10A1 products, have an advantage in effectively monitoring snow cover extent for regional snow-caused disasters in pastoral areas.

Many of these studies would benefit from frequent, high spatial resolution (100 m pixels) thermal imagery but currently, at any given location, such data are only available every few weeks from spaceborne sensors such as ASTER. Lower spatial resolution (1 km pixels) thermal imagery is available multiple times per day at any given location, from several sensors such as MODIS on board both the AQUA and TERRA satellite platforms. In order to fully exploit lower spatial resolution imagery, a sub-pixel unmixing technique has been developed and tested at Quesnel Lake, British Columbia, Canada. This approach produces accurate, frequent high spatial resolution water skin temperature maps by exploiting a priori knowledge of water boundaries derived from vectorized water features. The pixel water-fraction maps are then input to a gradient descent algorithm to solve the mixed pixel ground leaving radiance equation for sub-pixel water temperature. Ground-leaving radiance is estimated from standard temperature and emissivity data products for pure pixels and a simple regression technique to estimate atmospheric effects. In this test case, MODIS 1 km thermal imagery was used along with 1:50,000 water features to create a high-resolution (100 m) water skin temperature map. This map is compared to a concurrent ASTER temperature image and found to be within 1 degrees C of the ASTER skin temperature 99% of the time. This is a considerable improvement over the 2.55 degrees C difference between the original MODIS product and ASTER image due to land temperature contamination. The algorithm is simple, effective, and unlocks a largely untapped resource for limnological and hydrological studies. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

However, these products have not been adequately validated. This paper presents preliminary results of validating two MODIS Terra daily LST products, MOD11_L2 (version 4) and MOD07_L2 (version 4), using the FLUXNET and Carbon Europe Integrated Project (CarboEurope-IP) long-term ground measurements over eight vegetated sites. Since ground-measured LSTs were only available over one fixed point in each validation site, the study was carefully designed to mitigate the scale mismatch issue by using nighttime ground measurements concurrent to more than 1800 MODIS Terra overpasses.   The preliminary results show that MOD11-L2 LSTs have smaller absolute biases and root mean squared errors (RMSE) than those of MOD07-L2 LSTs in most cases. The match of MOD11_L2 LSTs with ground measurements in the Brookings, Audubon, Canaan Valley, and Black Hills sites is good, yielding absolute biases less than 0.8 degrees C and RMSEs less than 1.7 degrees C. In the Fort Peck, Hainich, Tharandt, and Bondville sites, MOD11_L2 LSTs were underestimated by 2-3 degrees C. Biases in MOD11-L2 LSTs correlate to those in MOD07_L2 LSTs. Since the MOD07_L2 LST product is one of the input parameters to the MOD11_L2 LST algorithm, biases in MOD11_L2 LSTs may be influenced by biases in MOD07_L2 LSTs. The errors in both products depend weakly on sensor view zenith angle but are independent of surface air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and soil moisture. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Remote sensing from space is the only feasible method for regularly mapping woody shrub cover over large areas, an important application because extensive woody shrub encroachment into former grasslands has been seen in and and semi-arid grasslands around the world during the last 150 years. The major difficulty in applying GO models in desert grasslands is the spatially dynamic nature of the combined soil and understory background reflectance: the background is important and cannot be modeled as either a Lambertian scatterer or by using a fixed bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). Candidate predictors of the background BRDF at the Sun-target-MISR angular sampling configurations included the volume scattering kernel weight from a Li-Ross BRDF model; diffuse brightness (p0) from the Modified Rahman-Pinty-Verstraete (MRPV) BRDF model; other Li-Ross kernel weights (isotropic, geometric); and MISR near-nadir bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs) in the blue, green, and near infra-red bands. The best method was multiple regression on the weights of a kemel-driven model and MISR nadir camera blue, green, and near infra-red bidirectional reflectance factors. The results of forward modeling BRFs for a 5.25 km(2) area in the USDA, ARS Jomada Experimental Range using the Simple Geometric Model (SGM) with this background showed good agreement with the MISR data in both shape and magnitude, with only minor spatial discrepancies. The simulations were shown to be accurate in terms of both absolute value and reflectance anisotropy over all 9 MISR views and for a wide range of canopy configurations (r(2)=0.78, RMSE=0.013, N=3969). Inversion of the SGM allowed estimation of fractional shrub cover with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.03 but a relatively weak correlation (r(2)=0.19)with the reference data (shrub cover estimated from high resolution IKONOS panchromatic imagery). The map of retrieved fractional shrub cover was an approximate spatial match to the reference map. Deviations reflect the first-order approximation of the understory BRDF in the MISR viewing plane; errors in the shrub statistics; and the 12 month lag between the two data sets.

A general solution is proposed in the form of a field of non-linear regression models over the set T of permitted values for the angular variables, i.e., as a map from T to some function space. Each value of the field is a regression model that performs a direct mapping from the top-of-atmosphere reflectance to the marine reflectance. Since the spectral components of the field take values in the same variable vector space, the retrievals in individual spectral bands are not independent, i.e., the solution is not just a juxtaposition of independent models for each spectral band. A scheme based on ridge functions is developed to approximate this solution to an arbitrary accuracy, and is applied to the retrieval of marine reflectance in Case 1 waters, for which optical properties are only governed by biogenic content. The statistical models are evaluated on synthetic data as well as actual data originating from the SeaWiFS instrument, taking into account noise in the data. Theoretical performance is good in terms of accuracy, robustness, and generalization capabilities, suggesting that the function field methodology might improve atmospheric correction in the presence of absorbing aerosols and provide more accurate estimates of marine reflectance in productive waters. When applied to SeaWiFS imagery acquired off California, the function field methodology gives generally higher estimates of marine reflectance than the standard SeaDAS algorithm, but the values are more realistic.

It is achieved by the comparison with MODIS collection 4 and 4.1 products and ECOCLIMAP LAI climatology over the BELMANIP representative set of sites, and with ground measurements over a limited set of sites. Great attention is paid to the consistency of the comparison: for the spatial dimension, product PSF appears to be the main aspect governing the spatial resolution at which the comparison has to be achieved. For CYCLOPES, a minimal size of the sites should be 3 km x 3 km(2), while the optimal one is 10 km x 10 km; regarding the temporal sampling interval and resolution, the problem is much easier to solve when assuming a relatively smooth time course of vegetation characteristics (8-16 days). Great care was also paid to the departure of products from the nominal definition, particularly for LAI where different scales of clumping have to be considered.   Results showed that CYCLOPES and MODlS products have generally consistent seasonality, CYCLOPES being however characterized by a smoother temporal evolution as expected. Differences are mainly concentrated on the magnitude of products values, CYCLOPES achieving better performances both for LAI (RMSE=0.73) and fAPAR (RMSE=0.10) over the limited number of sites where ground measurements were available. This study also sets a framework to the validation exercise that could be used to evaluate other products or future versions of the same products and contribute to associate quantitative uncertainties as required by the user community.

In support of this concept, we used meteorological and flux data from the AmeriFlux network and Support Vector Machine (SVM), an inductive machine learning technique, to develop and apply a predictive GPP model for the conterminous U.S. In the following four-step process, we first trained the SVM to predict flux-based GPP from 33 AmeriFlux sites between 2000 and 2003 using three remotely-sensed variables (land surface temperature, enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and land cover) and one ground-measured variable (incident shortwave radiation). Second, we evaluated model performance by predicting GPP for 24 available AmeriFlux sites in 2004. In this independent evaluation, the SVM predicted GPP with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.87 gC/m(2)/day and an R-2 of 0.71. Based on annual total GPP at 15 AmeriFlux sites for which the number of 8-day averages in 2004 was no less than 67%(30 out of a possible 45), annual SVM GPP prediction error was 32.1% for non-forest ecosystems and 22.2% for forest ecosystems, while the standard Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer GPP product (MOD17) had an error of 50.3% for non-forest ecosystems and 21.5% for forest ecosystems, suggesting that the regionally tuned SVM performed better than the standard global MOD 17 GPP for non-forest ecosystems but had similar performance for forest ecosystems. The most important explanatory factor for GPP prediction was EVI, removal of which increased GPP RMSE by 0.85 gC/m2/day in a cross-validation experiment. Third, using the SVM driven by remote sensing data including incident shortwave radiation, we predicted 2004 conterminous U.S. GPP and found that results were consistent with expected spatial and temporal patterns. Finally, as an illustration of SVM GPP for ecological applications, we estimated maximum light use efficiency (e(max)), one of the most important factors for standard light use efficiency models, for the conterminous U.S. by integrating the 2004 SVM GPP with the MOD17 GPP algorithm. We found that emax varied from similar to 0.86 gC/MJ in grasslands to similar to 1.56 gC/MJ in deciduous forests, while MOD17 emax was 0.68 gC/MJ for grasslands and 1.16 gC/MJ for deciduous forests, suggesting that refinements of MOD17 emax may be beneficial. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) provides a potential means to infer changes in CO2 flux, but whether relationships developed between NDVI and flux components can be generalized across the entire growing season and in response to changes induced by climate warming is uncertain. To investigate how well such changes might be assessed using inultispectral digital images, ecosystem CO2 fluxes and NDVI were compared throughout the 2002 growing season on experimental plots with increased growing season length and soil temperature at Toolik Lake, Alaska. Season length was increased by snow removal early in the season and soil terriperatures were increased using heating cables. Carbon dioxide fluxes were measured using static chamber techniques and corresponding NDVI images were taken with an agricultural digital camera. The seasonal patterns of NDVI in all treatments showed an increase to a peak in early August followed by an abrupt decline, with the snow removal plots phenologically advanced compared to the controls. Net ecosystem production (NEP) showed uptake of CO2 early in the season leveling out to a Slight loss Of CO2 at peak season for both control and extended season plots. Gross primary productivity (GPP) closely followed the pattern of NDVI and the pattern of ecosystem respiration (R,) mirrored that of GPP. NDVI was significantly correlated to GPP and ecosystem respiration (R-2 =0.50 and 0.36 respectively) across plots, dates, and treatments combined. However, most of the covariation was across dates. After accounting for seasonal variation, NDVI never accounted for more than 25% of the remaining variation in flux measures. Analysis of covariance showed that a given NDVI value corresponded to different flux rates on different dates and to different R-e among treatments after correcting for date. The slopes of the NDVI-GPP and NDVI-Re relationships were much steeper across dates than across plots. These plot-scale results suggest that NDVI alone is not sufficient to estimate carbon flux rate responses to climate change across space or years. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Based upon the Bidirectional Reflectance Factor, a contrast function and a classification accuracy assessment, it is shown, for two images examined under sun glint conditions, that the MISR sensor provides a better capability for oil spill discrimination, than the single-view MODIS-250 m data. Analysis of the multi-angle MISR red band indicates that oil spills appear with greater contrast in those view angles affected by sun glitter as a result of local changes in surface roughness caused by the hydrocarbons. Although limited by cloud cover, the capability of the MISR instrument for oil spill discrimination, together with its weekly temporal resolution and open data access, have the potential for improving the operational monitoring of oil releases.

It uses MISR subregion radiance data of the 9 cameras and 4 spectral bands (spatial resolution 1. 1 km) to generate characteristic functions rho(surf)=f(lambda,cam) (beta(e) (550 nm)), where beta(e) (550 nm) and rho(surf) are the ground level aerosol extinction coefficient at 550 nm, and the surface reflectance, respectively. The analysis of the mutual intersections of those functions yield optimum values for P, (550 nm), aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm and p(surf). MODTRAN 4 v3r1 was used to create radiance look-up tables. The algorithm was tested for MISR paths covering the complex terrain of Switzerland and northern Italy. Results of 2 days (low and high aerosol loads on May 14 and June 17, 2002, respectively) were analyzed and compared with sun photometer measurements. First, ground level aerosol extinction coefficients and optical depth over water were derived. From those data it was possible to retrieve a best-fit aerosol mixture. AOD (550 nm) over water is in satisfactory agreement with both sun photometer data and the operational aerosol product of MISR. Second, the Ross-Li approach for the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF), supported by MODTRAN 4, was applied to simulate the radiance over vegetation surfaces. In this case, the retrieved aerosol extinction coefficients and optical depths over vegetation are significantly lower than the values derived over water. We assume that the incomplete coupling of BRF and radiation in MODTRAN 4 is at least partly responsible for this discrepancy. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

These and other metrics are central to studies attempting to quantify global carbon cycles and to improve understanding of the spatial variation in forest structure evident within differing biomes. Data acquired using NASA\'s Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) over the Bartlett Experimental Forest (BEF) in central New Hampshire (USA) was used to assess the performance of waveform lidar in a northern temperate mixed conifer and deciduous forest.   Using coincident plots established for this study, we found strong agreement between field and lidar measurements of height (r(2)=0.80, 2 p < 0.000) at the footprint level. Allometric calculations of aboveground biomass (AGBM) and LVIS metrics (AGBM: r(2)=0.61, PRESS RMSE=58.0 Mg ha(-1), p < 0.000) and quadratic mean stem diameter (QMSD) and LVIS metrics (r(2) = 0.54, p = 0.002) also showed good agreement at the footprint level. Application of a generalized equation for determining AGBM proposed by Lefsky et a]. (2002a) to footprint-level field data from Bartlett resulted in a coefficient of determination of 0.55; RMSE = 64.4 Mg ha(-1); p 0.002. This is slightly weaker than the strongest relationship found with the best-fit single term regression model.   Relationships between a permanent grid of USDA Forest Service inventory plots and the mean values of aggregated LVIS metrics, however, were not as strong. This discrepancy suggests that validation efforts must be cautious in using pre-existing field data networks as a sole means of calibrating and verifying such remote sensing data. Stratification based on land-use or species composition, however, did provide the means to improve regression relationships at this scale. Regression models established at the footprint level for AGBM and QMSD were applied to LVIS data to generate predicted values for the whole of Bartlett. The accuracy of these models was assessed using varying subsets of the USFS NERS plot data. Coefficient of determinations ranged from fair to strong with aspects of land-use history and species composition influencing both the fit and the level of error seen in the predicted relationships.

In order to assess the errors in satellite altimeter measurements it is vital to know where the return is originating from in the snowpack. This return can vary spatially and temporally. Seasonal variations in the volume backscatter can be a major complicating factor in the radar return from the percolation zone. Ground-based step-frequency radar was deployed in the percolation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet at similar to 1945 m elevation (69 51 N, 47 15W). Previous measurements in this area made by scientists from the Byrd Polar Research Centre and the University of Kansas, undertaken prior to summer melt events, have shown the strongest backscatter from ice features at around 1 m depth buried beneath the previous end-of-summer surface. In autumn 2004, radar measurements in the Ku band with bandwidths of 1 and 8 GHz were made alongside detailed stratigraphic observations within a 1 km(2) site. The radar results revealed no continuous reflecting horizons in the upper 3.5 m of the firn. Shallow cores and snowpits also indicated that there were no spatially continuous stratigraphic horizons across the study site. An average electromagnetic wave velocity of 2.11 +/- 0.05 x 10(8) m s(-1) was determined for the upper metre of the firn. Surface and volume backscatter at vertical incidence were calculated using a standard model. The contribution of the surface backscatter to the total backscatter was on average 6 dB higher than that of the volume backscatter. However, at the higher 8 GHz bandwidth the strongest return frequently originated not from the surface but from within the upper 30 cm of the snowpack, most probably from thin ice layers. At 1 GHz bandwidth these ice layers were not always resolved; their return merged with the surface return, causing it to broaden, with the peak and leading edge moving down. Modelling using density and thickness measurements from shallow cores and snowpits showed that the backscatter from these shallow, thin ice layers could be stronger than the surface return owing to constructive interference from the top and base of the layers.

The study covered a 4-year period (2000-2004), which included a severe drought in 2002 and a subsequent wildfire in July 2003, leading to extreme perturbation in ecosystem productivity and optical properties. Two vegetation greenness indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)), and a measure of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (WAR), were compared across sampling platforms, which ranged in pixel size from 1m (tram system in the field) to 1000m (MODIS satellite sensor). The three MODIS products closely followed the same seasonal trends as the tram and AVIRIS data, but tended to be higher than the tram and AVIRIS values, particularly for fPAR and NDVI. Following a wildfire that removed all green vegetation, the overestimation in MODIS MAR values was particularly clear. The MODIS MAR algorithm (version 4 vs. v.4.1) had a significant effect on the degree of overestimation, with v. 4.1 improving the agreement with the other sensors (AVIRIS and tram) for vegetated conditions, but not for low, post-fire values. The differences between MODIS products and the products from the other platform sensors could not be entirely attributed to differences in sensor spectral responses or sampling scale. These results are consistent with several other recently published studies that indicate that MODIS overestimates MAR and thus net primary production (NPP) for many terrestrial ecosystems, and demonstrates the need for proper validation of MODIS terrestrial biospheric products by direct comparison against optical signals at other spatial scales, as is now possible at several SpecNet sites. The study also demonstrates the utility of in-situ field sampling (e.g. tram systems) and hyperspectral aircraft imagery for proper interpretation of satellite data taken at coarse spatial scales.

A novel feature of the instrument is a rotating periscope connected to a spectrometer via a fiber optic cable. Canopy reflectances are calculated for multiple view azimuths, at a single zenith angle from measurements of spectrometer dark current, incoming solar irradiance and reflected radiances. Spectral measurements are made between 300 and 1150 nm wavelength at a band-to-band spacing of 3 nm, and a bandwidth (full-width, half maximum) of 10 nm. Preliminary data analysis showed that the canopy reflectance model of Kuusk [Kuusk, A. (1995). A fast, invertible canopy reflectance model. Remote Sensing of Environment 51, 342-350] reproduced the observed large differences in visible and near-infrared (NIR) reflectances, but the model was unable to predict quantitatively the observed variations in the measured reflectance spectra with azimuth, particularly in the NIR. Discrepancies between model and measurements are likely due to the inhomogeneous nature of the forest canopy in contrast to the assumption of a uniformly absorbing turbid medium in the model. Measurements using the MAS can be used to investigate directional dependences of reflectance indices and for testing BRDF models used to separate geometrical and plant physiological contributions to the reflectance signals. The MAS provides continuous sampling of reflectance indices which can be compared with canopy properties such as chlorophyll content and photosynthetic capacity. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

However, the accuracy and coverage of LiDAR observations is highly dependent on both the extrinsic specifications of the LiDAR survey as well as the intrinsic effects such as the underlying forest structure. Extrinsic parameters which are set as part of the LiDAR survey include platform altitude, scan angle (half max. angle off nadir), and beam cross sectional diameter at the reflecting surface (referred to as footprint size). In this paper we investigate the effect of a number of these extrinsic parameters, including three different platform altitudes (1000, 2000, and 3000 in), two scan angles at 1000 in (10 degrees and 15 degrees half max. angle off nadir), and three footprint sizes (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 m). The comparison was undertaken in eucalypt forests at three sites, varying in vegetation structure and topography within the Wedding Bells State Forest, Coffs Harbour, Australia. Results at the plot scale (40 x 90 m areas) indicate that tree heights computed from the 1000 in LiDAR data set (10 degrees half max. angle off nadir) are well correlated with maximum plot heights (difference < 3 m) and field measured canopy volume (r(2) > 0.75, p < 0.001). Using normalised canopy height profiles (CHP) derived for sites, from data recorded at each altitude, we observed no significant difference between the relative distribution of LiDAR returns, indicating that platform altitude and footprint size I have not had a major influence on CHP estimation. Interestingly, comparisons of first and last returns for individual pulses at increasing altitudes identified progressively fewer discrete first/last pulse combinations with more than 70% of pulses recorded as a single return at the highest altitude (3000 in). A possible hypothesis is that greater platform altitude and footprint size reduces the intensity of laser beam incident on a given surface area thus decreasing the probability of recording a last return above the noise threshold. Furthermore, tree scale analysis found a positive relationship between platform altitude and the underestimation of crown area and crown volume. The implications of this work for forest management are: (i) platform altitudes as high as 3 000 m can be used to quantify the vertical distribution of phyto-elements, (ii) higher platform altitudes record a lower proportion of first/last return combinations that will further reduce the number of points available for forest structural assessment and development of digital elevation models, and (iii) for discrete LOAR data, increasing platform altitude will record a lower frequency of returns per crown, resulting in larger underestimates of individual tree crown area and volume if standard algorithms are applied.

An optimal strategy for mapping forest structure would include detailed measurements of the vertical dimension, which are traditionally provided by field sampling, together with the broad spatial coverage afforded by remote sensing. While no single sensor is capable of delivering this at the present time, it should be possible to combine information from multiple sensors to achieve a reasonable approximation. In this study, we compare estimates of forest structural metrics derived from remote sensing to measurements obtained in the field (large tree maximum canopy height, mean canopy height, standard deviation canopy height, and biomass). We then statistically combine structural information from LiDAR, RaDAR, and passive optical sensors in an attempt to improve accuracy of our estimates. The results of this study indicate that LiDAR is the best single sensor for estimating canopy height and biomass. The addition of ETM+ metrics significantly improved LiDAR estimates of large tree structure, while Quickbird and InSAR/SAR improved estimates either marginally or not at all. The combination of all sensors was more accurate than LiDAR alone, but only marginally better than the combination of LiDAR and ETM+. Structure metrics from LiDAR and RaDAR are essentially redundant, as are ETM+ and Quickbird. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', 'Univ Maryland, Dept Geog, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

Representative canopy reflectance and NDVI data were simulated for historical, current and future AVHRR, MODIS and VIIRS land surface monitoring satellites to quantify the differences due to sensor-specific characteristics. Cross-sensor NDVI translation equations were developed for surface conditions. The effect of a range of atmospheric conditions (Rayleigh scattering, ozone, aerosol optical thickness, and water vapor content) on the sensor-specific reflectance and NDVI values were evaluated to quantify the uncertainty in the apparent NDVI for each sensor. MODIS and VIIRS NDVI data are minimally affected by the atmospheric water vapor, while AVHRR NDVI data are substantially reduced by water vapor.   Although multi-sensor NDVI continuity can be obtained by using the developed cross-sensor translation equations, the interactions between the spectral characteristics of surface vegetation and soil components, sensor-specific spectral band characteristics and atmospheric scattering and absorption windows will introduce uncertainty due to insufficient knowledge about the atmospheric conditions that affect the signal of the Earth\'s pixels at the time of data acquisitions.

Wind maps are derived from a total of 30 ERS-2 SAR scenes and 11 Envisat ASAR scenes over two large offshore wind farms in Denmark: Horns Rev in the North Sea (80 turbines) and Nysted in the Baltic Sea (78 turbines). The wind farms are the world\'s largest to date. For the first time, high-resolution SAR-derived wind speed images are utilized to identify regions of reduced wind speed and high turbulence intensity (i.e. wind wakes) downstream of wind turbine arrays. After quality control, 19 SAR scenes are available for the study of wake effects. A decrease of the mean wind speed is found as the wind flows through the wind farms, leaving a velocity deficit of 8-9% on average, immediately downstream of the wind turbine arrays. From this point, wind speed recovers to within 2% of the free stream velocity over a distance of 5-20 kin depending on the ambient wind speed, the atmospheric stability and the number of turbines in operation. The wake magnitude and extent found from SAR wind maps is consistent with in situ measurements and results from wake models. The standard deviation of SAR-derived wind speeds is an indicator of turbulence intensity. Added turbulence intensity downstream of a wind farm is found for 7 of the 19 cases. Turbulence intensity is not as easily identified from SAR images as changes in the mean wind speed. This may be due to a low impact of wind turbine generated turbulence on the sea surface where SAR measurements are obtained. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

At present, the Euphrates and Tigris are the two largest trans-boundary rivers in Western Asia where Turkey, Syria, Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia are the riparian countries. The Euphrates and Tigris basins are largely fed from snow precipitation whereby nearly two-thirds occur in winter and may remain in the form of snow for half of the year. The concentration of discharge mainly from snowmelt during spring and early summer months causes not only extensive flooding, inundating large areas, but also the loss of much needed water required for irrigation and power generation purposes during the summer season. Accordingly, modeling of snow-covered area in the mountainous regions of Eastern Turkey, as being one of the major headwaters of Euphrates-Tigris basin, has significant importance in order to forecast snowmelt discharge especially for energy production, flood control, irrigation and reservoir operation optimization.   A pilot basin, located on the upper Euphrates River, is selected where five automated meteorological and snow stations are installed for real time operations. The daily snow cover maps obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS at 500 m resolution are compared with ground information for the winter of 2002 - 2003 both during accumulation and ablation and at accumulation stage for the winter of 2003-2004. The snow presence on the ground is determined from the snow courses performed. Such measurements were made at 19 points in and around the upper Euphrates River in Turkey and at 20 points in the upper portion of the pilot basin for the winters of 20022003 and 2003-2004, respectively. Comparison of MODIS snow maps with in situ measurements over the snow season show good agreement with overall accuracies ranging between 62% and 82% considering the shift in the days of comparison. The main reasons to have disagreement between MODIS and in situ data are the high cloud cover frequency in the area and the current version of the MODIS cloud-mask that appears to frequently map edges of snow-covered areas and land surfaces. The effect of elevation and land cover types on validation of MODIS snow cover maps is also analyzed. In order to minimize the cloud cover and maximize the snow cover, MODIS-8 daily snow cover products are used in deriving the snow depletion curve, which is one of the input parameters of the snowmelt runoff model (SRM). The initial results of modeling process show that MODIS snow-covered area product can be used for simulation and also for forecasting of snowmelt runoff in basins of Turkey. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Consistently lower SWE retrievals are present across both the comparatively dense boreal forest to the south, and open tundra to the north. Because of the sparse conventional observing network across this region, a dedicated field sampling campaign was conducted during the 2003/2004 winter season to measure snow properties across these landscape zones in northern Manitoba, Canada. Using road and helicopter access, snow cover measurements were made along an approximately 500 km transect between the communities of Thompson (boreal forest), Gillam (sparse northern boreal forest), and Churchill (open tundra) during late November 2003, and early March 2004.   The November 2003 snow survey revealed good agreement between Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) derived SWE retrievals and in situ measurements across the gradient of increasing SWE between Thompson and Gillam, and the well defined zone of high SWE values to the north and east of Gillam. Further to the north, SSM/I derived SWE retrievals over the boreal ecotone and open tundra were consistently lower than the in situ measurements. Results of the March survey (at which point mean snow depths had increased from approximately 30-60 cm) showed an increase in absolute SWE differences between the in situ measurements and passive microwave estimates, but relative agreement between the datasets remained strong. The same SWE gradient across the boreal forest was again captured by both datasets, although tundra retrievals remained consistently low. These findings, along with consideration of snowpack stratigraphy, density, and the potential influence of tundra lakes and ponds on microwave emission and scatter, suggest that development of a tundra-specific SWE retrieval algorithm is necessary. From a scaling perspective, a large range of SWE values were measured on the ground within each satellite footprint, but a comparison of frequency histograms showed that a high percentage of satellite retrievals (November: 93%; March: 63%) fell within 20 mm of the median ground measurement.

An elementary approach to improving retrievals is to incorporate some form of spatial averaging through the use of superpixels. Determining the best approach for averaging and the optimum size of the superpixel is the objective of this study. It is achieved by examining the bias, correlation coefficient, and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the true and estimated ISFC for a set of simulated cloud scenes and their radiative fields. Because of nonlinear effects, averaging within the superpixel should only be performed after I-SFC is retrieved from R-TOA independently for each pixel For the combined set of stratocumulus and convective cloud fields that have a cloud fraction ranging from 0.25 to 1.0 used in this study, the optimal superpixel size is about 25 km. It is found that the bias is a function of solar and viewing angles and a correction is provided that improves the bias while leaving the correlation coefficient and root-mean-square error unchanged.

The observed relationships between longline catch data, expressed as catch per unit effort (CPUE), and the satellite data were analysed using the statistical method of generalized additive models (GAMs). CPUE was calculated as the number of fish caught by 100 hooks in V latitude by V longitude square grid and integrated into a month of fishing activity for the period of 1995-2000. Results obtained showed evidences of non-linear relationships between catch yields and environmental data. The largest CPUE of yellowfin tuna in the region seems to be strongly associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) position and its temporal variability. In the model, this was confirmed by the highest correlation of CPUE with the meridional wind component. This result also indicates 5degreesS as the southern limit for a larger concentration of this species during the most productive fishing period between March and May. In decreasing order of importance, sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration and sea surface height anomaly, albeit statistically significant, seemed to be of secondary importance in controlling this species abundance in the region.

As part of the Soil Moisture Experiment 2002 (SMEX02), daily surface soil moisture sampling at 90-140 locations were conducted in four fields in Walnut Creek watershed, Iowa. Various combinations of soils, vegetation, and topography characterize the fields. Depending on the field\'s characteristics and soil moisture content, 3-32 independent measurements were necessary to capture the field mean volumetric soil moisture with a +/-2% bias and 95% confidence interval. Validation of the retrieved soil moisture products from the aircraft microwave instruments using the average of 14 samples per field is more appropriate for dry (< 10% volumetric soil moisture) or wet (>25% volumetric soil moisture) range than for intermediate soil moisture range. Time stability analysis showed that an appropriately selected single sampling point could provide similar accuracy across a range of soil moisture conditions. Analyses based on landscape position (depression, hilltop, steep slope, and mild slope) showed that locations with mild slopes consistently exhibit time stable features. Hilltop and steep slope locations consistently underestimated mean field soil moisture. Soils parameters could not be used to identify time stable features as sampling locations with relatively high sand content consistently underestimated the field mean while those locations with relatively high clay content consistently overestimated the field mean. However, the slope position characterization of time stable features was enhanced using soils properties. The mild slope locations having the best time-stable features are those with moderate to moderately high clay content as compare to the field average (28-30% clay). (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The study relied on a comprehensive field campaign using stratified systematic unaligned sampling ranging from full spectroradiometric characterization of the canopy to conventional measurements of biochemical and biophysical variables. Airborne imaging spectrometer data (DAIS7915 and ROSIS) were acquired parallel to the ground measurements, describing the canopy reflectance of the observed forest. Coniferous canopies are highly heterogeneous and thus the transfer of incident radiation within the canopy is dominated by its structure. We demonstrated the viability of radiative transfer representation and compared the performance of two hybrid canopy reflectance models, GeoSAIL and FLIGHT, within this heterogeneous medium. Despite the different nature and canopy representation of these models, they yielded similar results. Subsequently, the inversion of a hyperspectral GeoSAIL version demonstrated the feasibility of estimating structure and foliage water content of a coniferous canopy based on radiative transfer modeling. Estimates of the canopy variables showed reasonably accurate results and were validated through ground measurements. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The method presumes the selection of a few estimation parameters. An important decision is the choice of the pixel-dependent geographical area from which the nearest field plots in the spectral space for each pixel are selected, the problem being that one spectral vector may correspond to several different ground data vectors. The weighting of different spectral components is an obvious problem when defining the distance metric in the spectral space.   The paper presents a new method. The first innovation is that the large-scale variation of forest variables is used as ancillary data that are added to the variables of the multi-source k-NN estimation. These data are assigned weights in a way similar to the spectral information of satellite images when defining the applied distance metric. The second innovation is that \"optimal\" weights for spectral data, as well as ancillary data, are computed by means of a genetic algorithm. Tests with practical forest inventory data show that the method performs noticeably better than other applications of k-NN estimation methods in forest inventories, and that the problem of biases in the species volume predictions can, for example, almost completely be overcome with this new approach.

The utility of this remote sensing technique to measure the Physiological Reflectance Index (PRI) is shown at both leaf level under laboratory conditions and at the canopy level in the field. PRI, defined as the relative changes in reflectance at 531 run with respect to those at 570 nm (PRI = R531 - R570/R531 + R570), is related to xanthophyll-related, dynamic changes of non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence. The robustness of this relationship by simultaneous remote sensing of PRI and chlorophyll fluorescence is strengthened. At the leaf level, the existence of two kinetically distinct components of PRI is shown. A fast (within seconds) component that is partly attributed to DeltapH induced chloroplast shrinkage, and a slow (within minutes), main component that is related to xanthophyll deepoxidation, as demonstrated by its disappearance in the presence of DTT. Overall, PRI correlated better with non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence (NPQ) than with any other measured parameter, including the photochemical efficiency of PSIL Finally, at the canopy level and under field conditions, it is shown that PRI can be a useful tool for remote sensing of water stress in grapevines.

In this paper, we explored the potential of SPOT-4 VEGETATION (VGT) data for the classification of land cover types in TEA, An unsupervised classification was performed using multi-temporal (March-November 2000) VGT-derived spectral indices (Land Surface Water Index [LSWI] and Enhanced Vegetation Index [EVI]) to generate a land cover map of TEA (called VGT-TEA). Land cover classes from VGT-TEA were aggregated to broad, general class types, and then compared and validated with classifications derived from fine-resolution (Landsat) data. VGT-TEA produced reasonable results when compared to the Landsat products. Analysis of the seasonal dynamics of LSWI and EVI allows for the identification of distinct growth patterns between different vegetation types. We suggest that LSWI seasonal curves can be used to define the growing season for temperate deciduous vegetation, including grassland types. Seasonal curves of EVI tend to have a slightly greater dynamic range than LSWI during the peak growing season and can be useful in discriminating between vegetation types. By using these two complementary spectral indices, VGT data can be used to produce timely and detailed land cover and phenology maps with limited ancillary data needed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Two study sites were selected: a semi-arid area located in northern Chihuahuan desert, USA, and a Savannah landscape located in central Africa. Atmospheric corrections were performed using the MODTRAN 4 atmospheric radiative transfer code along with atmospheric profiles generated by the National Center for Environmental Predictions (NCEP). Atmospheric radiative properties were derived from MODTRAN 4 calculations according to the sensor swaths, which yielded different strategies from one sensor to the other. The MODIS estimates were then computed using a designed Temperature-Independent Spectral Indices of Emissivity (TISIE) method. The ASTER estimates were derived using the Temperature Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm. The MODIS and ASTER radiometric temperature retrievals were in good agreement when the atmospheric corrections were similar, with differences lower than 0.9 K. The emissivity estimates were compared for MODIS/ASTER matching bands at 8.5 and 11 mum. It was shown that the retrievals agreed well, with RMSD ranging from 0.005 to 0.015, and biases ranging from -0.01 to 0.005. At 8.5 mum, the ranges of emissivities from both sensors were very similar. At 11 mum, however, the ranges of MODIS values were broader than those of the ASTER estimates. The larger MODIS values were ascribed to the gray body problem of the TES algorithm, whereas the lower MODIS values were not consistent with field references. Finally, we assessed the combined effects of spatial variability and sensor resolution. It was shown that for the study areas we considered, these effects were not critical. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Ecosystem-specific regeneration rates are an important consideration for determining the required frequency of data collections to minimize change omission errors. Clear-cut forested areas in north central North Carolina undergo rapid colonization from pioneer (replacement) vegetation that is often difficult to differentiate spectrally from that previously present. This study compared change detection results for temporal frequencies corresponding to 3-, 7-, and 10-year time intervals for near-anniversary date Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data acquisitions corresponding to a single path/row. Change detection was performed using an identical change vector analysis (CVA) technique for all imagery dates. Although the accuracy of the 3-year analysis was acceptable (86.3%, kappa = 0.55), a significant level of change omission errors resulted (51.7%). Accuracies associated with both the 7-year (43.6%, kappa = 0.10) and 10-year (37.2%, kappa=0.05) temporal frequency analyses performed poorly, with excessive change omission errors of 84.8% and 86.3%, respectively. The average rate of LC change observed over the study area for the 13-year index period (1987-2000) was approximately 1.0% per annum. Overall results indicated that a minimum of 3-4-year temporal data acquisition frequency is required to monitor LC change events in north central North Carolina. Reductions in change omission errors could probably best be achieved by further increasing temporal data acquisition frequencies to a 1-2-year time interval. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Dome C area has many good calibration site characteristics: The site is very flat and extremely homogeneous (only snow), there is little wind and a very small snow accumulation rate and therefore a small temporal variability, the elevation is 3200 m and the atmosphere is very clear most of the time. Finally, due to its location, it is frequently within view of many satellites.

Waste rock from phosphorite mining in the area contains selenium, cadmium, vanadium, and other metals. Toxic concentrations of selenium have been found in plants and soils near some mine waste dumps. Eighteen mine waste dumps and five vegetation cover types in the southeast Idaho phosphate district were mapped by using Airborne Visible-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery and field data. The interaction of surface water runoff with mine waste was assessed by registering the AVIRIS results to digital elevation data, enabling determinations of (1) mine dump morphologies, (2) catchment watershed areas above each mine dump, (3) flow directions from the dumps, (4) stream gradients, and (5) the extent of downstream wetlands available for selenium absorption.   Watersheds with the most severe selenium contamination, such as the South Maybe Canyon watershed, are associated with mine dumps that have large catchment watershed areas, high stream gradients, a paucity of downstream wetlands, and dump forms that tend to obstruct stream flow. Watersheds associated with low concentrations of dissolved selenium, such as Angus Creek, have mine dumps with small catchment watershed areas, low stream gradients, abundant wetlands vegetation, and less obstructing dump morphologies.

We define the goal of scaling as the process by which it is established that LAI values derived from coarse resolution sensor data equal the arithmetic average of values derived independently from fine resolution sensor data. The increasing probability of land cover mixtures with decreasing resolution is defined as heterogeneity, which is a key concept in scaling studies. The effect of pixel heterogeneity on spectral reflectances and LAI retrievals is investigated with 1-km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data aggregated to different coarse spatial resolutions. It is shown that LAI retrieval errors at coarse resolution are inversely related to the proportion of the dominant land cover in such pixel. Further, large errors in LAI retrievals are incurred when forests are minority biomes in non-forest pixels compared to when forest biomes are mixed with one another, and vice versa. A physically based scaling with explicit spatial resolution-dependent radiative transfer formulation is developed. The successful application of this theory to scaling LAI retrievals from AVHRR data of different resolutions is demonstrated. These principles underlie our approach to the production and validation of LAI product from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) aboard the TERRA platform.

With this aim, it is first necessary to study the consistency of the various sets of satellite data as provided by the space agencies, and to compare them to in situ available data. Pixel-by-pixel comparisons of the Level 3 chlorophyll products derived from the ocean color and temperature scanner (OCTS; Version 4, August 1999), polarization and directionality of earth reflectances (POLDER; reprocessing no. 2, July 2000), and the sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS; reprocessing no. 3, May 2000) reveal a reasonably good agreement. Discrepancies, however, appear particularly in oligotrophic areas: weekly (or 10-day) means for OCTS and POLDER (which were operating simultaneously) differ in these areas by 30-70% on average, and OCTS and SeaWiFS weekly means, at 1-year distance, reveal differences by up to a factor of 2. Comparisons with measurements at sea, performed during various cruises, show that all these sensors tend to overestimate chlorophyll concentrations in oligotrophic waters. A \"regional algorithm\" is proposed to reduce this bias. The impact of using the various datasets for chlorophyll concentration, and for seawater temperature (Reynolds sea surface temperature [SST] analyses, Levitus climatological profiles) for primary production computations is shown. Because they are simultaneous to ocean color data, Reynolds analyses appear to be the most appropriate inputs to such computations. They have, however, to be combined with climatological vertical profiles of seawater temperature, so as to provide representative values for the productive layer. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The impact of both the calibration and filter function variations between National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-AVHRR sensors is addressed in this proposed ALP-II approach. Accounting for these sensor factors reduces the error of intersatellite comparison of surface temperatures by as much as 2.3 K. The environmental factors were also addressed, including the surface emissivity, large range of atmospheric water vapor (WV) across the globe, and the potential for large surface-to-air temperature differences for land. To account for both the sensor and environmental factors in the ALP-H data set, we derive, from the MODTRAN-3 model, two sets of new coefficients, for low and high WV in the atmosphere. Two types of split-window equations were analyzed, the linear and quadratic forms of the land split-window equations. Our MODTRAN-based analysis suggests that the quadratic form is more accurate than the linear form, especially for high WV contents. These coefficients can be used in our LST algorithm in combination with a global emissivity map and WV data from Global Circulation Model (GCM). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

In order to determine the brightness temperature (BT) measured by a satellite for a given LST, the atmospheric influence on radiance emitted by the surface has to be accounted for. Provided that the current state of the atmosphere (vertical moisture and temperature profiles) and the surface emissivity are sufficiently well known, it is possible to calculate the BT using a radiative transfer model (RTM), e.g., Moderate Resolution Transmittance Code 3 (MODTRAN-3). RTMs do not linearise the atmospheric effect and variations of surface emissivity, elevation, and view angle (i.e., the path through the atmosphere) are readily accounted for. However, RTMs are very expensive in terms of computing time and, therefore, not well suited to simulate large quantities of data. In order to overcome this limitation, the main objective of this study is to investigate if MODTRAN-3 can be substituted by a feed-forward neural network (NN). Training and validation data consist of inputs and outputs of MODTRAN-3 for 84 TOVS Initial Guess Retrieval (TIGR) profiles in the middle latitudes (45degreesN to 55degreesN). The RTM was run for these atmospheric situations and a range of LSTs, surface elevations, and view angles. In total, 4032 radiative transfer calculations were performed. A NN developed manually for this data is evaluated using forward calculations for atmospheric profiles from the European Centre of Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses. Grid cells of the ECMWF analyses containing clouds are identified using cloudmasks derived from Meteosat IR and VIS data. The manually developed NN is compared against a NN developed by the evolutionary algorithm \"Evolutionarer Netzwerk Optimierer\" (ENZO). ENZO evolves populations of NNs: it utilises mutation and crossover to optimise NN topology (layers, number of neurons, and weights) and trains (fine-tunes) the NNs with the Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator (SNNS). The NN developed by ENZO has a rms validation error (untrained TIGR situations) of 0.25 K and a rms verification error (cloud-free situations from ECMWF analyses) of 0.31 K. ENZO is shown to produce substantially smaller NNs than the manual approach: the developed NN has 58% fewer hidden neurons and about 90% fewer weights than the manually developed NN. Furthermore, the NN developed by ENZO is more robust and generalises better. A major advantage of the NN is its computational speed, which is estimated to be of the order of 104 times faster than MODTRAN-3. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Additionally, estimation of forest structural attributes, such as aboveground biomass (AGBM), is an important step in identifying the amount of carbon in terrestrial vegetation pools and is central to global carbon cycle studies. Although current remote sensing techniques recover such tropical forest structure poorly, new large-footprint lidar instruments show great promise. As part of a prelaunch validation plan for the Vegetation Canopy Lidar (VCL) mission, the Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS), a large-footprint airborne scanning lidar, was flown over the La Selva Biological Station, a tropical wet forest site in Costa Rica. The primary objective of this study was to test the ability of large-footprint lidar instruments to recover forest structural characteristics across a spectrum of land cover types from pasture to secondary and primary tropical forests. LVIS metrics were able to predict field-derived quadratic mean stem diameter (QMSD), basal area, and AGBM with R 2 values of up to .93,.72, and .93, respectively. These relationships were significant and nonasymptotic through the entire range of conditions sampled at the La Selva.

Uncertainties in the land surface reflectance and model used in the algorithm determine the quality of the retrieved LAI/FPAR fields. The in-orbit radiances measured by space-borne sensors require corrections for calibration and atmospheric effects, and this introduces uncertainty in the surface reflectance products. The model uncertainty characterizes the accuracy of a vegetation radiation interaction model to approximate the observed variability in surface reflectances. When the amount of spectral information input to the retrieval technique is increased, not only does this increase the overall information content but also decreases the summary accuracy in the data. The former enhances quality of the retrievals, while the latter suppresses it. The quality of the retrievals can be influenced by the use of uncertainty information in the retrieval technique. We introduce a stabilized uncertainty, which is basic information to the retrieval technique required to establish its convergence; that is, the more the measured information and the more accurate this information is, the more reliable and accurate the algorithm output will be. The quality of retrieval is a function of the stabilized uncertainty whose accurate specification is critical for deriving biophysical surface parameters of the highest quality possible using multispectral land surface data. The global LAI and FPAR maps derived from SeaWiFS multispectral surface reflectances and uncertainty information, as well as an analysis of these products is presented here.

An expert (or hypothesis testing) system has been used with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data to derive a land cover classification for the semiarid Phoenix metropolitan portion of the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long Term Ecological Research (CAP LTER) site. Expert systems allow for the integration of remotely sensed data with other sources of georeferenced information such as land use data, spatial texture, and digital elevation models (DEMs) to obtain greater classification accuracy. Logical decision rules are used with the various datasets to assign class values to each pixel. TM reflectance data acquired in 1998 [visible to shortwave infrared (VSWIR) bands plus a vegetation index] were initially classified for land cover using a maximum likelihood decision rule. In addition, spatial texture of the TM data was calculated. An expert system was constructed to perform postclassification sorting of the initial land cover classification using additional spatial datasets such as texture, land use, water rights, city boundaries, and Native American reservation boundaries. Pixels were reclassified using logical decision rules into 12 classes. The overall accuracy of this technique was 85%. Individual class user\'s accuracy ranged from 73% to 99%, with the exception of the commercial/industrial materials class. This class performed poorly (user\'s accuracy of 49%) due to the similarity of subpixel components with other classes. The results presented here indicate that the expert system approach will be useful both for ongoing CAP LTER research, as well as the planned global Urban Environmental Monitoring (UEM) program of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument.

Underestimation of OCTS values for high Chl-a concentrations and ghost patterns in coastal areas suggest that the OCTS ocean color algorithm needs to be improved. OCTS images depicted detailed Chl-a distributions associated with the oceanic fields observed by hydrographic data. The Chl-a-rich coastal waters correlated closely with the cold waters, suggesting that coastal upwelling might enhance nutrient supply and phytoplankton production. The high Chl-a frontal eddies near the meander crest of the Kuroshio Extension (KE) may be caused by a combination of advection of coastal waters by the KE front and an upwelling due to the cyclonic circulation. Fishing grounds reported during this period were often distributed in and around the high Chl-a area of the frontal eddy and around another coastal eddy. These results suggest that high Chl-a waters can be one of the important factors enhancing fishing ground formation. OCTS Chl-a images are useful to clarify the detailed biological processes in the Kuroshio frontal region of the Joban/Kashima coast of Japan.

The scale transformation enables the multifractal scaling exponents of landscapes or individual spectral bands to be brought in and out of register with each other, thereby opening another dimension upon which to detect the scales at which various land use or terrain processes operate. Alternatively, landscapes can be selectively rescaled to highlight patterns due to particular processes. We recommend geostatistical procedures with which to assess spatial characteristics both within a site and within individual image cells.

High resolution remote sensing has potential for providing means to spatially and temporally evaluate such damage. In particular, image texture can be sued in modeling forest and individual tree structural variations which may result from stress. In this study, an airborne multispectral digital camera system was used to acquire imagery with ground pixel spacing of 0.25 m, 0.5 m, and 1.0 m. Relations of image semivariance measures with field forest structure and health measures were determined. Semivariograms were derived using two sampling techniques: transects in two perpindicular directions, and omnidirectional sampling within pixel matrices. Sampling was conducted over the forest canopy as well as within individual tree crowns. The principal objective of the study was to determine the types of forest canopy and individual tree crown structure and health information captured by semivariograms at the three spatial resolutions. In canopy scale sampling, the 1 m pixel semivariograms were best related to forest canopy closure, stem density, and a visually derived tree stress index. The 0.5 m pixel semivariograms related better to tree crown size and tree height. The transect technique was more sensitive to tree height ant the matrix technique produced stronger relations with tree stress. In individual tree crown samples, the 0.25 m pixel semivariograms were well related to tree crown closure. This suggests that semivariograms extracted from the 1 m and 0.5 m pixel images are suitable for mapping structural and textural information related to forest damage at the canopy level while the semivariograms extracted from the 0.25 m pixel images depict information at the tree crown level.

A vegetation-density map derived from integrated reflectances (R(i)), from MAS data, is compared with an independently-produced vegetation type and density map derived from Thematic Mapper (TM) and ancillary data. The maps agreed to within 13%, thus corroborating the effectiveness of using the reflectance technique for mapping vegetation density. Snow cover was mapped on a 13 April 1995 MAS image, using the original MODIS prototype algorithm and an enhanced MODIS prototype algorithm. Field measurements revealed that the area was completely snow covered. With the original algorithm, snow teas mapped in 96% of the pixels having <50% vegetation-cover density according to the R(i) map, while in the areas having vegetation-cover densities greater than or equal to 50%, snow was mapped in only 71% of the pixels. When the enhanced MODIS snow-mapping algorithm was employed, 99% of the pixels having <50% vegetation-cover density were mapped, and 98% of the pixels with greater than or equal to 50% vegetation-cover density were mapped as snow covered. These results demonstrate that. the enhanced algorithm represents a significant improvement over the original MODIS prototype algorithm especially in the mapping of snow; In dense vegetation. The enhanced algorithm will thus be adopted as the MODIS at-launch snow-cover algorithm. Using this simple method for estimating vegetation density from pixel reflectance, it rc;ill be possible to analyze the accuracy of the MODIS snow-cover algorithm in a range of vegetation-cover in places where information on vegetation-cover density is not available from ground measurements.

Radar signature measures examined were C-, L- and VV polarizations, ratios of sigma(0)HH and sigma(0)HV to sigma(0)VV, and the HH-VV polarization phase difference and correlation coefficient. The most effective measure for estimation of shrub density was L-band sigma 0HV, which distinguished among shrub density classes with no misclassification. Sensitivity of this measure to small amounts of shrub cover was indicated by successful separation of sites with <1% shrub cover from sites with 1-5% cover. Separability of shrub density classes was generally least for C-band signature measures. A distinctive radar signature was exhibited by dense stands of Yucca elata, a semitreelike plant with uniformly thick (approximate to 10 cm diameter) fibrous stems. Yucca sites were distinguished from others by their high P-band sigma 0HV relative to L-band sigma 0HV. The results are largely explained by the greater sensitivity of longer wavelengths to larger canopy structural elements. L-band sigma 0HV and other measures responsive to canopy volume scattering were more strongly related to shrub than to herbaceous plant cover because woody shrub canopies have numberous stems of the intermediate size to which L-band is most sensitive, whereas stems of this size are mostly lacking in herbaceous canopies. The uniform-diameter stems of yucca have larger dimensions to which P-band is more sensitive than L-band. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998', 'Univ New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.

To solve this problem, several sensible hear models, using radiometric surface temperature, have appeared in the literature. In this study, using the observational data from three interdisciplinary field experiments [the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE), Monsoon \'90 and Washita \'92], the performance of four models using average values of their parameters in predicting land surface sensible heat flux was evaluated. By analyzing the sensitivity of the models to common parameters and input variables, reasons for differences in the performances of the models and the potential to improve the agreement with observations have been ascertained. From the comparisons of modeled versus measured sensible heat flux for the different surfaces, the dual-source model in Norman et al. (1995) had the best agreement with its mean absolute percent difference (MAPD) values being similar to the observational accuracy (i.e., similar to 20%). Front the sensitivity analysis the model appears to have the greatest potential for operational applications since it requires relatively few parameters and Is not very sensitive to the uncertainty in most of the model parameters. The single-source models in Kustas et al. (1989) and Troufleau et al. (1996) require accurate estimates of the surface roughness z(0m) and empirical relationships to account for differences between aerodynamic and radiometric temperature. Therefore, it may be difficult to improve their performance without some independent means of estimating the empirical coefficients and a reliable method for determining z(0m). Estimates from the dual-source model in Lhomme et al. (1994) tend to produce the largest scatter with the observations. This may be related to the fact that the model is more sensitive to variations in most of the parameters common in dual-source models. In addition, its response to high surface-air temperature differences in the sensitivity analysis differs from all other models. Therefore, it may be more difficult to obtain reliable estimates from this model on an operational basis.

In this experiment, L-band, like-polarized SIR-B radar imagery of southern Germany and northeastern France are examined. Three data takes at three different incident angles and two different look directions covering some 20,000 square kilometers comprised the study area. Two analyses were performed: one of the entire imaged areas, and one limited to similar terrain conditions to focus on look direction effects. Errors of omission and commission were calculated and accuracies tabulated for both tests. Results indicated that steep incident angles were of minimal utility, generating the highest omission and commission errors. Accuracy improved as incident angle increased, up to a point, and then decreased.

The predictability of the landcover classes was determined by visiting random preselected sites within wetlands, woodlands, canefields, and grazing. On a second visit adult ticks were counted in over 103 herds and the habitats recorded. Descriminant analysis indicated that there were a limited number of tick habitats. The tick counts for the herds within these habitats indicate that each habitat probably has a characteristic tick density. The visible farms in Grande Terre, representing four habitats, were then compared with the landcover classes found in a 5 x 5 pixel array at each farm site in the classified image.

This was done by using the delta-Eddington approximation for multiple scattering, together with Mie theory for single scattering. The model contains only one adjustable parameter, a complex refractive index of soil particles. The complex refractive index of soil particles was identified from the observed spectral albedos on both dry and wet surfaces of soils. The imaginary refractive index obtained was highly correlated with the soil chemical properties. Especially, the correlations between the imaginary index and the free iron oxides content were sufficiently higher than those between the spectral albedo and its content, so that the imaginary index would be of some use in estimating free iron oxides content.

The fluorescence band with a maximum at 440 nm, in conjunction with the chlorophyll bands with maxima at 685 and 740 nm, has been found to be a critical band in the development of algorithms for detecting stress, and identifying plant types.  The identification of the plant constituent responsible for this band is vital to understanding the mechanism underlying its fluorescence changes in response to environmental and physiological changes.  The identification was achieved as follows:  The laser induced fluorescence (LIF) spectra of pure plant pigments were determined.  Fluorescence bands with maxima at 420 nm, 440 nm, 490 nm, and 525 nm were observed for vitamin K1, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADPH), beta-carotene, and riboflavin, respectively.  The LIF spectra of water extracts and acetone extracts of clover leaves were also measured.  It was found that the blue fluorescence band was associated with the water extract.  NADPH which is a water-soluble compound, and the water extract of clover had no fluorescence after oxidation by potassium ferricyanide, while the fluorescence of water insoluble vitamin K1 was unchanged by the oxidizing agent.  It was also found that the absorption maximum of NADPH was the same as the absorption maximum of the aqueous extract of clover.  The above findings indicated that the compound responsible for the blue fluorescence at 440 nm is in the reduced state and is water-soluble.  It was concluded that NADPH was responsible for the blue fluorescence at 440 nm.  The strong linear relationship between the fluorescence at 440 nm and the rate of photosynthesis suggests the possible use of LIF measurements in the remote estimation of photosynthetic rates.', 'USDA ARS,BELTSVILLE AGR RES CTR,REMOTE SENSING RES LAB,BELTSVILLE,MD 20705.', 'United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)RP CHAPPELLE, EW (通讯作者)，NASA,GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CTR,TERR PHYS LAB,CODE 923,GREENBELT,MD 20771, USA.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 15, 86, 86, 0, 16, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Only a few studies have explored the production of seamless remotely sensed Ta products, and all of them estimated Ta from the gap-filled land surface temperature (LST). This study first estimates the daily minimum, average and maximum Ta of clear-sky pixels from remote sensing data over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and the Ningxia Autonomous Region (NAR), China, during 2016-2020, and then applies five gap-filling methods, including spatial, temporal, spatiotemporal and two multisource fusion-based gap-filling methods, to fill the data gaps in the remotely sensed Ta data. The performances of these methods under different cloud, terrain and landscape conditions are also assessed. The validation results indicate that the Temporal Fourier analysis (TFA) method exhibits high accuracy, good robustness under various cloud and surface conditions, and good ability to describe spatial details of Ta of cloud-cover areas.

A range of statistical methods have been proposed to estimate error statistics for large-scale SM datasets including the: instrumental variable (IV) method, triple collocation analysis (TCA), and quadruple collocation analysis (QCDA). While requiring only two input products, the IV method also imposes an additional assumption that one input product possesses serially uncorrelated errors -thus limiting its scope compared to TC. Likewise, QCDA requires four independent SM data products that are difficult to obtain and may not always be available for analysis. Nonetheless, TCA-based methods still cannot provide truly global error maps for satellite SM products due to the limited number of independent SM products and difficulties with baseline TCA assumptions. Moreover, temporal sampling requirements for TCA are often impractical because of low SM retrieval skill in forested and arid areas - as well as in regions prone to radio frequency interference.Here, we seek to fill significant spatial gaps in TCA results using machine learning (ML) and therefore provide spatially complete error maps for the satellite-based SM data products derived from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) systems. Furthermore, we use SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, a model-agnostic technique for interpreting ML models, to examine the impact of various environmental conditions on the quality of satellite-based SM retrievals.Globally, and across all three products, 72.0% of missing error information in a TCA-based analysis, due to either the lack of valid data or the inability of TCA to provide reliable results, can be reconstructed from the ensemble prediction mean of the ML models. Overall, we found that 22.7% (a.m.) and 34.2% (p.m.) of the Earth\'sSM dynamics (between 60 degrees S to 60 degrees N) have not been investigated properly across all three satellite missions.', '[Kim, Hyunglok] Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Earth Sci & Environm Engn, Gwangju 61005, South Korea.

However, it would result in an unavoidable underestimation, especially for large concentration enhancements. The lognormal matched filter (LMF) has provided a unique and not limited to weak methane plumes theory through lognormal background radiances modeling, but validations on simulated experiments and applications to real data remain to be explored. Moreover, the covariance contamination caused by the enhanced pixels and the surface heterogeneity have detrimental effects on the detection methods for real data application. In this study, we propose the iterative lognormal matched filter (ILMF) method to address these challenges. We evaluate the performance of the ILMF with two ideal simulations and the end-to-end simulation. The results of random simulated enhancement retrievals show that the retrieved enhancement by the ILMF method agrees well with the true enhancement, with an R2 of 0.984 and a small root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 55.856 ppb. The ILMF method reduce the RMSE of retrieved enhancement by 80% compared with the MF method. The results of end-to-end simulations show the underestimation of MF method at different sites regarding the emission rate, as well as the improvement of the ILMF method. Further, we apply the ILMF method to detect and quantify point sources in some methane hotspot regions.

The significant displacements by the expansive soil slope (ESS) lead to severe damage to the slope prevention in the SNWDP, possibly resulting in slope failure with no timely and appropriate preventive measures. In this study, taking the channel head of the middle route of the SNWDP (Henan, China) as a case, we employed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data of 134 Sentinel-1 scenes spanning 2017-2021 to characterize the ground displacement on the ESS and, after that, retrieve the active zone depth (AZD) that is a significant parameter to determine the treatment depth. An elastoplastic deformation model under wetting and heating effects (EDWHE) is proposed to accurately interpret ESS\'s nonlinear deformation, considering the soil lags responding to wetting and heating. The results show that the excavated canal generally has positive LOS displacements, maximum to 18 mm/year, while the filled canal with negative, minimum to -25 mm/year. The InSAR results of our model show a significant improvement compared to traditional models and have a good agreement with GNSS observations. Besides, we find the movement pattern of the ESS sliding toward the slope toe, manifesting the potential risk of progressive landslide. Then, we derive the soil\'s elastic deformation by the EDWHE and observe that the elastic swelling and shrinkage become frequent and drastic in the monsoon season, which is the principal reason for the expansive soil geohazard. Moreover, we employ a time lag approach to retrieve the AZDs with high spatial resolution and clear distribution patterns.

While reduction in AH during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have weakened urban heat islands (UHI), quantitative assessments on this are lacking. Here, a new AH estimation method based on a remote sensing surface energy balance (RS-SEB) without hysteresis from heat storage was proposed to clarify the effects of COVID-19 control measures on AH. To weaken the impact of shadows, a simple and novel calibration method was developed to estimate the SEB in multiple regions and periods. To overcome the hysteresis of AH caused by heat storage, RS-SEB was combined with an inventory-based model and thermal stability analysis framework. The resulting AH was consistent with the latest global AH dataset and had a much higher spatial resolution, providing objective and refined features of human activities during the pandemic. Our study of four Chinese megacities (Wuhan, Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou) indicated that COVID-19 control measures severely restricted human ac-tivities and notably reduced AH. The reduction was up to 50% in Wuhan during the lockdown in February 2020 and gradually decreased after the lockdown was eased in April 2020, similar to that in Shanghai during the Level 1 pandemic response. In contrast, AH was less reduced in Guangzhou during the same period and increased in Beijing owing to extended central heating use in winter. AH decreased more in urban centers and the change in AH varied in terms of urban land use between cities and periods. Although UHI changes during the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be entirely attributed to AH changes, the considerable reduction in AH is an important feature accompanying the weakening of the UHI.', '[Meng, Qingyan; Qian, Jiangkang; Zhang, Linlin; Hu, Xinli; Gao, Jianfeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.

Evapotranspiration (ET) mitigates the urban heat island, reducing the effect of heat waves. It can also be used as a proxy for vegetation water use, making it a crucial tool to plan resilient green cities. To optimize the trade-off between urban greening and water security, reliable and up-to-date maps of ET for cities are urgently needed. Despite its importance, few studies have mapped urban ET accurately for an entire city in high spatial and temporal resolution. We mapped the ET of Berlin, Germany in high spatial (10-m) and temporal (hourly) resolution for the year of 2019. A novel machine learning (ML) approach combining Sentinel-2 time series, open geodata, and flux footprint modeling was applied. Two eddy flux towers with contrasting sur-rounding land cover provided the training and testing data. Flux footprint modeling allowed us to incorporate comprehensive land cover types in training the ML models. Open remote sensing and geodata used as model inputs included Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2, building height, impervious surface fraction, vegetation fraction, and vegetation height. NDVI was used to indicate vegetation phenology and health, as plant transpiration contributes to the majority of terrestrial ET. Hourly reference ET (RET) was calculated and used as input to capture the temporal dynamics of the meteorological conditions. Predictions were carried out using Random Forest (RF) regression. Weighted averages extracted from hourly ET maps using flux footprints were compared to measured ET from the two flux towers. Validation showed that the approach is reliable for mapping urban ET, with a mean R2 of 0.76 and 0.56 and a mean RMSE of 0.0289 mm and 0.0171 mm at the more vegetated site and the city-center site, respectively. Lastly, the variation of ET between Local Climate Zones (LCZs) was analyzed to support urban planning. This study demonstrated the capacity to map urban ET at an unprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution with a novel methodology, which can be used to support the sustainable management of green infrastructure and water resources in an urbanizing world facing climate change.', '[Vulova, Stenka; Rocha, Alby Duarte; Schulz, Christian; Kleinschmit, Birgit] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, Geoinformat Environm Planning Lab, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.

Canopy radiative transfer models, which use canopy traits to predict spectra, provide a powerful means to understand canopy trait variation and these models can be inverted, allowing us to use remotely sensed data to monitor canopy traits. However, a single inversion represents a snapshot in time for a single sensor. In this study, we used a Bayesian approach to assimilate snow-free observations from three different sensors (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2A and MODIS) over the course of 2019 by inverting the ProSAIL radiative transfer model, producing a robust estimate of six canopy traits and their joint uncertainties at each time point. Next, we used a state-space time series model to integrate observations from multiple sensors to capture variation in vegetation optical traits throughout the year. The results demonstrate that our model can capture seasonal variation of surface reflectance with less than 5% RMSE compared with observed reflectance. Moreover, linking observations in time narrows the uncertainty intervals compared to the posterior distributions for individual time points. We are also able to make statistical inferences on dates when no data is available, and provide reasonable and reliable time-series inversion results compared with LAI ground measurements.', '[Zhang, Dongchen; Dietze, Michael] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.', 'Boston UniversityRP Zhang, DC (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.', 'zhangdc@bu.eduRI Zhang, Dongchen/HJH-9065-2023', 'Zhang, Dongchen/0000-0002-0382-617X', 'NASA CMS [20-CMS20-0030]', 'This work is supported by NASA CMS Grant: 20-CMS20-0030.

Although fully supervised deep learning-based methods for building change detection have made progress, they tend to fuse temporal information only at a single level (e.g., input, feature, or decision levels) to mitigate the data distribution differences between time-series images, which is highly prone to introduce a large number of pseudo changes. Moreover, these methods rely on a large number of high-quality pixel-level change labels with high acquisition costs. In contrast, available crowdsourced building data are abundant but are less considered for change detection. For example, OpenStreetMap (OSM), Google Map, and Gaode Map provide lots of available building labels, yet they usually contain noise such as false alarms, omissions, and mismatches, limiting their wide application. In addition, when the building extraction task is transferred to the building change detection task, the temporal and regional differences between different images may lead to undesired pseudo changes. Given these issues, we propose a full-level fused cross-task transfer learning method for building change detection using only crowdsourced building labels and high-resolution satellite imagery. The method consists of three steps: 1) noise-robust building extraction network pretraining; 2) uncertainty-aware pseudo label generation; and 3) fulllevel fused building change detection. We created building extraction and building change detection datasets. The former (building extraction dataset) contains 30 scenes of ZY-3 images covering 27 major cities in China and crowdsourced building labels from Gaode Map for training, while the latter (building change dataset) contains bi-temporal ZY-3 images in Shanghai and Beijing for testing. The results show that the proposed method can identify changed buildings more effectively and better balance false alarms and omissions, compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis indicates that the inclusion of samples from multiple cities with various spatial heterogeneities is helpful to improve the performance. The experiments show that it is promising to apply the proposed method to situations where true labels are completely lacking or limited, thus alleviating the issue of high label acquisition cost.

Current standard approach to estimate DASF from canopy bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) is based on the assumption that in the weakly absorbing 710 to 790 nm spectral interval, leaf scattering does not change much with the concentration of dry matter and thus its variation can be neglected. This results in biased estimates of DASF and consequently leads to uncertainty in DASF-related applications. This study proposes a new approach to account for variations in concentrations of this biochemical constituent, which additionally uses the canopy BRF at 2260 nm. Analysis of the proposed approach based on radiative transfer models suggests significant decrease in relative root mean square error (rRMSE) by nearly a half for one- and three dimensional dense vegetated scenes, and the improvement is insensitive to the reflectivity of background. Robust refinement is also achieved in a larger actual forest scene. When the new approach is adopted to indoor multi-angular hyperspectral measurements on individual tree crowns, the relative error has also reduced, with more improvement seen in needle-leaf than in broadleaf species. Thus, the proposed DASF estimation approach outperforms the current one and can be used more reliably in DASF-related applications, such as retrieval of vegetation biochemical contents, grasping periodic changes of equatorial forests, and other ecological and environmental vegetation monitoring tasks based on spectral invariants theory.', '[Lin, Yi; Liu, Siyuan; Yan, Lei] Peking Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & Geog Informat Syst, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.

Temperature change is most pronounced in the Arctic, and therefore, it is crucial to accurately estimate sea and sea ice surface temperatures in this region. The availability of in situ observations is limited in the Arctic, thus, increasing the need for satellite observations to estimate surface temperatures. We present the first Arctic (>58 & DEG;N) gap-free climate dataset covering the surface temperatures of the ocean, sea ice and the marginal ice zone from 1 January 1982 to 31 May 2021 based on observations from infrared satellite sensors. The underlying algorithm combines the multi satellite observations and performs a statistical optimal interpolation to obtain daily gap-free fields, with a spatial resolution of 0.05 & DEG; in latitude and longitude. In situ observations have been used to derive consistent validation statistics over the ocean and sea ice. Comparison of the derived sea surface temperatures against in situ measurements from drifting buoys, moored buoys and Argo floats shows mean differences of 0.01 & DEG;C, 0.04 & DEG;C and 0.04 & DEG;C and standard deviations of 0.54 & DEG;C, 0.56 & DEG;C and 0.51 & DEG;C, respectively.

The level 3 satellite SSS generally correlates well with Argo -observed SSS but differs in the middle and high latitudes and the tropical convergence zones. The smallest Delta S appears in the subtropical open oceans, where the sea surface features warm SST, rare precipitation, and low wind speed. The variations in mean |Delta S| for the three satellites show a robust dependence on SST, precipitation, and wind, with large Delta S (outside 5%-95% interval) in particular tending to occur in areas of cold SST, heavy rainfall, and high wind speeds. The most pronounced SSS deviations occur in the middle and high latitudes (beyond 40 degrees) due to cold SST. In particular, heavy rainfall in the subpolar regions and strong westerly winds in the mid-latitudes also make the satellite SSS measurements less accurate. In the tropical convergence zones, large SSS deviations are mainly related to heavy rainfall, showing significant surface freshening. The fresh biases related to rainfall are more significant in Level 2 SSS than in Level 3, due to the short period of the convective rainfall.

The objective is to study at which conditions the CP SAR can obtain comparable retrieval accuracy as FP SAR for specific crop types and growth descriptors. Polarimetric decompositions were used to extract CP and FP explanatory variables to quantify crop growth status. Then, the sensitivities of CP and FP variables to different crop descriptors were analyzed, revealing higher sensitivity to height than LAI, VWC, and dry biomass. In order to reduce the information redundancy of sets of CP and FP SAR variables, Partial Least Square (PLS) approach was used to develop new orthogonal SAR parameters, while Step-Wise Regression (SWR) was used to determine the optimal SAR parameters, followed by retrievals of multiple crop growth descriptors using the developed estimators. Validated by the ground measurements, the retrieval performances are found to be highly dependent on polarimetry dimension (CP or FP), crop types, and targeted crop descriptors. With crop growth and enhanced depolarization effects, the CP SAR can capture the increasing volume power and decreasing surface power but at a lower rate than FP SAR. The m-delta and m-chi decompositions provide similar scattering components which differ from the Random Volume Over Ground (RVOG) decomposition. The third Stokes parameter g3 of the CP SAR data that indicates the strength of the circular polarization component is a common important parameter to infer the multiple crop parameters of interest. In agreement with the sensitivity analysis, better retrieval accuracies were obtained for height and dry biomass than VWC and LAI. For short vegetation such as soybean, full polarimetry is required to obtain the estimates of all four crop growth de -scriptors. On the contrary, for tall crop growth parameters, such as canola (height and dry biomass), corn (height, VWC, dry biomass), and wheat (LAI, VWC, dry biomass), the CP SAR features can provide comparable robust retrieval accuracy as the FP SAR features.

In this study, we investigated the time-series evolution of RADARSAT-2 C-band HH, VV, VH and HV radar backscattering coefficients and scattering contributions during the spring melt seasons of 2017 and 2018 over the Niaqunguk (Apex) River, Nunavut, Canada. Meteo-rological observations and optical Planet satellite images were analyzed to support interpretations of SAR data in relation to snowpack warming and melt processes at the high spatial resolution of 6 m. Our results suggest that the cross-polarization (HV and VH) backscatter from snow significantly dropped by-10.7 dB when the air temperatures became positive and snowpack moisture content began to increase (i.e., melt onset). Co -polarization (HH and VV) backscatter from snow also decreased, but by a smaller magnitude of-7.4 dB. Freeman-Durden decomposition analysis suggested that the volume scattering contribution dropped drastically, and surface scattering dominated at the melt onset. The timing of melt onset can be readily inferred from the temporal changes in backscatter signal, which was particularly pronounced in the HV time-series. The back -scatter decrease (e.g., 2.5 dB for HH and 3.4 dB for HV) associated with melt onset was also pronounced for large areas, where both snow-covered and snow-free surfaces were present, and water was masked out. Cross -polarization signal demonstrated better separability between snow-free and snow-covered surfaces than co -polarization signal throughout the melt season. This suggests that the HV backscatter signal is more suitable for snow melt onset and snow/ground detection compared to conventionally used HH and VV, given the in-strument noise floor is sufficiently low to capture the HV signal variations. Our classification results demon-strated slightly higher overall accuracy for HV (83.9%) than for HH (82.7%) signal. However, snow and bare -ground classification accuracies were limited to the late season period when class separabilities were lower compared to the earlier melt season, preventing robust assessment of classification accuracy using HV back -scatter due to limited ground truth data.', '[Antropova, Yulia K.; Richardson, Murray; Millard, Koreen; Smith, Keegan] Carleton Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Ottawa, ON, Canada.

Xf symptoms may be confounded with generic water stress responses. Here, we assessed changes in biochemical, biophysical and photosynthetic traits, inferred using biophysical models, in Xf-affected almond orchards under rainfed and irrigated conditions on the Island of Majorca (Balearic Islands, Spain). Recent research has demonstrated the early detection of Xf-infections by monitoring spectral changes associated with pigments, canopy structural traits, fluorescence emission and transpiration. Nevertheless, there is still a need to make further progress in monitoring physiological processes (e.g., photosynthesis rate) to be able to efficiently detect when Xf-infection causes subtle spectral changes in photosynthesis. This paper explores the ability of parsimonious machine learning (ML) algorithms to detect Xf-infected trees operationally, when considering a proxy of photosynthetic capacity, namely the maximum carboxylation rate (Vcmax), along with carbon-based constituents (CBC, including lignin), and leaf biochemical traits and tree-crown temperature (Tc) as an indica-tor of transpiration rates. The ML framework proposed here reduced the uncertainties associated with the extraction of reflectance spectra and temperature from individual tree crowns using high-resolution hyper -spectral and thermal images. We showed that the relative importance of Vcmax and leaf biochemical constituents (e.g., CBC) in the ML model for the detection of Xf at early stages of development were intrinsically associated with the water and nutritional conditions of almond trees. Overall, the functional traits that were most consis-tently altered by Xf-infection were Vcmax, pigments, CBC, and Tc, and, particularly in rainfed-trees, anthocyanins, and Tc. The parsimonious ML model for Xf detection yielded accuracies exceeding 90% (kappa = 0.80). This study brings progress in the development of an operational ML framework for the detection of Xf outbreaks based on plant traits related to photosynthetic capacity, plant biochemistry and structural decay parameters.', '[Camino, C.; Arano, K.; Dierkes, H.; Beck, P.

These sensors provide multiple spectral bands and frequent revisits, yet they all suffer from clouds. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagers are active sensors that overcome this obstacle, yet their capacity in detecting macroalgae and other floating matters is generally unknown. Here, through statistical analysis and comparison of the Sentinel-2/MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Sentinel-1/SAR imagery, we attempt to fill this knowledge gap. The types of floating matters considered in this study include macroalgae (Ulva Prolifera in the Yellow Sea, Sargassum horneri in the East China Sea, and Sargassum fluitans/natans in the Caribbean Sea), cyanobacteria (Microcystis, Nodularia spumigena, and Trichodesmium), dinoflagellates (green and red Noctiluca), organic matters (sea snots and brine shrimp cysts), and marine debris (driftwood). Of these, the only floating matter that can be definitively detected in Sentinel-1/SAR imagery is U. prolifera, followed by the occasional detection of S. fluitans/natans and driftwood. In all detection cases, the macroalgae features always appear in Sentinel-1/SAR imagery with positive contrast from the surrounding waters. Because of the all-weather measurements, SAR observations can therefore complement those from the optical sensors in monitoring and tracking U. prolifera and S. fluitans/natans in their respective regions.', '[Qi, Lin; Wang, Menghua] NOAA, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.

Monitoring of this species is required by EU directives. Measurement of phytoplankton species composition has historically been made by pigment or microscopic analysis of water samples, which is spatially sparse and temporally infrequent e.g. weekly/monthly. In-water instruments such as flow cytometers can provide very high frequency data but at high acquisition and maintenance cost. Automated in situ above water radiometry has the potential to provide very high frequency data at single locations but requires very careful design of processing algorithms in turbid waters with high non-algal absorption. Spaceborne radiometry could provide both very good spatial coverage and moderate/high frequency of data, e.g. daily/weekly, but accurate determination of phytoplankton species composition is considerably more difficult in turbid waters than in open ocean waters. Prior studies based on a limited number of shipborne reflectance measurements suggested feasibility of P. globosa detection in turbid waters from hyperspectral radiometry. The availability of a new autonomous above water hyperspectral radi-ometer system has enabled further refinement and intensive testing of these techniques. From a time-series of 4356 water reflectance spectra measured near Ostend harbour in Belgian coastal waters from 2020/04/01 to 2020/08/18, two existing algorithms for P. globosa detection were successfully applied. Results show a high biomass P. globosa bloom occurring in late-April/early-May as found every year in water sample analyses for Belgian coastal waters. The high temporal resolution of the radiometric data allows to capture the evolution of the bloom at time scales sufficiently short (hourly and daily) compared to growth/decay and tidal processes. The challenges of extending the methods to future spaceborne instruments are also tested by simulating the impact of errors in sensor inter-band calibration, atmospheric correction and radiometric noise. Results show that because of their spectral coherence, atmospheric correction errors impact only slightly P. globosa detection whereas inaccuracy in inter-band calibration and radiometric noise are much more problematic as they affect each spectral band independently. Because radiometric noise should be reduced in the new generation of hyperspectral sensors and can always be reduced by spatial binning, the inter-band relative calibration uncer-tainty appears to be the main challenge for spaceborne mission design. Indeed, it was demonstrated that inter -band calibration error should be <0.25% and ideally 0.1% at top of the atmosphere highlighting the need for particular attention to inter-band calibration in sensor design and post processing treatments including vicarious calibration.', '[Lavigne, Heloise; Ruddick, Kevin; Vanhellemont, Quinten] Royal Belgium Inst Nat Sci RBINS, Brussels, Belgium.RP Lavigne, H (通讯作者)，Royal Belgium Inst Nat Sci RBINS, Brussels, Belgium.', NULL, 'hlavigne@naturalsciences.be', NULL, 'BELSPO through the Research programme for earth observation STEREO III   HYPERMAQ project [SR/00/335]', 'This work has been funded by BELSPO through the Research programme for   earth observation STEREO III HYPERMAQ project (contract nr SR/00/335).

Both DAC and LIB models are coherent with this non-tidal SNR residual in a 2-days to 2-months time window with correlations reaching 0.7 and high coherences. Several noteworthy atmospheric events are observed in the time series of about one year. During intense events, SNR and models are highly correlated. According to the results obtained in this study, we conclude that the GNSS reflectometry technique is relevant to derive sea level variations at tidal periods but also for studying the behaviour of the sea surface in response to atmospheric forcing at short-term scales.', '[Gravalon, Theo; Seoane, Lucia; Ramillien, Guillaume; Darrozes, Jose] Geosci Environm Toulouse GET, Toulouse, France.

Here, we use a recently developed algorithm, S2Shores (Satellite to Shores), to invert coastal bathymetry from wave kinematics, based on the linear dispersion relation. Wave numbers and celerity are extracted from optical Sentinel-2 imagery, by exploiting the small temporal offset between the image bands of its Multi-Spectral Instrument. Inverted depths are output at 200 m resolution, and individual depth points are merged to create a composite bathymetry using a weighted average of images from 10 different dates. The resulting bathymetry mosaic spans 4000 km along the West African coast. S2Shores is able to detect depths up to 35 m, depending on mean incident wave conditions and cloud cover, which varies by location. Underwater features are well reproduced by S2Shores, such as flow channels in Guinea, the St. Ann\'s Shoal in Sierra Leone, and ebb delta lobes at several outlets along the Niger River Delta. S2Shores results match well (r2 = 0.76, RMSE = 4.9 m) with a bathymetry survey along the Senegalese coast. As a difference with traditional satellite-derived bathymetry methods based on water colour, a wave-based approach allows estimations in turbid areas and relatively deep waters, which suggest that the two approaches are complementary and should be used in combination to cover coastal environments in their diversity. The new possibility offered by this regional coastal atlas opens the door to increased research and planning capabilities and sets an example that can be applied to the rest of the world.', '[Daly, Christopher; Thoumyre, Gregoire; Almar, Rafael] IRD, LEGOS, UMR-5566, 14 Ave Edouard Belin, F-31400 Toulouse, France.

Compared to the prior Ku-band pencil beam scatterometers, this innovative observing mechanism provides more independent backscatter measurements at varying incidence and azimuth angles, as such it brings challenges for the sea surface wind inversion, particularly under rainy conditions. In this paper, the rain effects on the CFOSAT SCATterometer (CSCAT) are investigated using the collocated numerical weather prediction (NWP) wind data and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) microwave imager (GMI) rain data. Similar to the prior Ku-band or C-band scatterometers, the sensitivity of CSCAT radar backscatter to rain substantially varies with wind speed, radar polarization and incidence angle. However, due to the complex observation geometries, rain effects on the CSCAT retrieved winds is more complex than that of prior scatterometers, which may lead to a remarkable underestimation of CSCAT wind speed at high winds and heavy rain conditions. A simple simulation method is used to clarify the relation between the retrieved wind speed and the dependency of radar rain effects on the incidence angle. It is found that the backscatter measurements at low incidence angles, which are generally underestimated at high winds and heavy rainy conditions, have a larger influence on the wind inversion minimization, leading to much lower retrieved wind speeds than those of ECMWF and the pencil beam scatterometer (e.g., Haiyang-2B scattometer). Under low and moderate rain conditions though, a more compensated effect between low and high incidence angle measurements is found, leading to generally unbiased CSCAT high winds, in contrast to the generally underestimated pencil-beam scatterometer winds.', '[Zhao, Xiaokang; Lin, Wenming; Wang, Zhixiong; He, Yijun] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.

In this study, the surface ultraviolet (UV) at 380 nm, which is an important component of the rate-determining step of ozone photochemical production, is involved as an indicator in the newly developed surface ozone retrieval algorithm. And the imputation of missing satellite observations of ozone nitrogen dioxide (NO2) column and surface UV is conducted to obtain spatially continuous surface ozone. Different validation schemes and case studies are used to comprehensively evaluate the new algorithm. With the involvement of the surface UV, the new retrieval algorithm shows the high accuracy (R2 = 0.853 and RMSE = 17.09 mu g/m3) in spatially continuous surface ozone estimation. More significantly, the new algorithm shows outstanding spatial transferability, which has been a critical challenge for machine-learning models on surface ozone estimation.', '[Song, Ge; Li, Siwei; Dong, Lechao; Lin, Hao; Teng, Mengfan; Hu, Senlin; Qin, Yaming; Zeng, Xiaoyue] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

Block-level change detection with high tem-poral resolution image data provides fine detail of urban changes, is suitable for urban management, and has gradually received widespread attention. High-dimensional features are required to express the heterogeneous structure of the blocks. High-dimensional high-frequency time series, namely, multivariate time series, are formed by arranging high-dimensional features chronologically. Classic change detection methods treat multi-variate time series as univariate time series one by one. Few studies have analyzed the change in a multivariate time series by considering all variables as an entirety. Therefore, a graph-based segmentation for multivariate time series algorithm (MTS-GS) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, 1) we construct a similarity matrix to explore the changing patterns of multivariate time series for seasonal change, trend change, abrupt change, and noise disturbance; 2) a multivariate time series graph is defined based on the changing patterns; and 3) the corresponding graph segmentation algorithm is proposed in the paper to detect the abrupt and trend changes under noise and seasonal disturbances. Sentinel-2 images of the rapidly developing third-tier city of Luoyang, Henan province, China, are adopted to validate the algorithm. The F1-score in the spatial domain is 84.1%; the producer\'s and the user\'s accuracy in the temporal dimension are 81.8% and 80.1%, respectively. Seven change types are defined and extracted, showing the development pattern and the efficiency of land use in the city.

This paper describes a method of reducing the adverse effects of such extraneous influences on vegetation and change estimates derived from single-channel SAR data. Empirical corrections for terrain slope and cross-track tendencies were applied and linear least squares difference minimization used to normalize the backscatter differences between scenes.

The data were acquired with different sensors over two \"observational epochs\": ALOS PALSAR in 2009 and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 in 2016/17. The SAR datasets presented significant variations in backscatter intensity beyond those attributable to changes in vegetation cover. The corrective procedures resulted in improved uniformity of observed backscatter dependence on vegetation. Variations in backscattering coefficient between swaths were reduced by as much as 1.75 dB and 25% of the standard deviation in mean backscattering coefficients in common areas and at near- and far-range. This corresponded to a correction in BA estimate of 4.4 m2 ha-1. The method was observed to reduce ambiguities in regrowth estimates at swath boundaries and correct estimates of BA change by as much as 30% over large areas. The resulting estimates of 7-year change in BA provide spatially explicit forest structural information that is assisting in monitoring changes in woody vegetation across NSW.', '[Williams, Mark L.; Milne, Anthony K.] Horizon Geosci Consulting Pty Ltd, Belrose, NSW, Australia.

Presently, satellite ocean color provides unprecedented coverage of the global surface ocean and offers reliable estimates of bulk biological properties; however, existing multispectral sensors have limited ability to provide information about phytoplankton community composition. Satellite ocean color at hyperspectral resolution (e.g., NASA\'s upcoming Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, and ocean Ecosystem sensor, PACE) is expected to improve estimates of phytoplankton community composition from space. Phytoplankton impact ocean color via contributions to absorption and fluorescence (through phytoplankton pigments) and scattering, especially on narrow spectral scales (5-100 nm). Here, a global open ocean dataset of concurrent HPLC pigments and hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) observations is used to model phytoplankton pigment composition from optical data. Phytoplankton pigments are reconstructed from R-rs(lambda) using optimized principal components regression modeling. This work demonstrates that thirteen phytoplankton pigments, representing five phytoplankton pigment groups (e.g., diatoms, dinoflagellates, haptophytes, green algae, and cyanobacteria), can be modeled from hyperspectral R-rs(lambda). Spectral information needed to model each phytoplankton pigment concentration is found throughout the entire visible spectrum and the model results are best at high spectral resolution (<= 5 nm). The resulting model recreates observed relationships among pigment concentrations, providing support for the designation of five pigment-based phytoplankton groups for the global open ocean. This work represents a step toward developing robust, global spectral models for phytoplankton pigment composition.

However, the degree to which incoming solar radiation and the structure of the canopy rather than leaf physiology contribute to SIF variations is still not well characterized. Therefore, we investigated relationships between SIF and variables that at least partly capture the canopy structure component of SIF. For this, we relied on high-quality SIF observations from ground-based instruments, high-resolution airborne SIF imagery and the most recent satellite SIF products to cover large ranges in spatial and temporal resolution and diverse ecosystems. We found that the canopy structure-related near-infrared reflectance of vegetation multiplied by incoming sunlight (NIRvP) is a robust proxy for far-red SIF across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Our findings indicate that contributions from leaf physiology to SIF variability are small compared to the structure and radiation components. Also, NIRvP captured spatio-temporal patterns of canopy photosynthesis better than SIF, which seems to be mostly due to the greater retrieval noise of SIF. Compared to other relevant structural SIF proxies, NIRvP showed more robust relationships to SIF, especially at the global scale. Our results highlight the promise of using widely available NIRvP data for vegetation monitoring and also indicate the potential of using SIF and NIRvP in combination to extract physiological information from SIF.', '[Dechant, Benjamin; Ryu, Youngryel] Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Agr & Life Sci, Seoul, South Korea.

However, its successful application is highly dependent on local experiences that are rarely documented, resulting in practical limitations during implementation. Cost-effective deep learning frameworks for fast deployment are required. This study presents a deep learning adaptation framework, named Auto-UNet++, trying to streamline wetland mapping tasks (including training data labeling and organizing). The framework treats mapping tasks as an intact semantic segmentation pipeline and then integrates automatic strategies into each step to reduce human intervention. These automatic strategies are achieved by standard computer vision techniques, including multi-view (MV) imaging-highly overlapped UAV images over an area (for labeling/voting), unsupervised clustering (for labeling), multi-scale CNN (for feature extraction), and attention mechanism-a CNN design used to select informative features from input (for feature exploration/selection). The framework was tested on playa wetland mapping in the Rainwater Basin, Nebraska, USA, with multispectral UAV datasets. Generally, the multi-scale CNN mapping task achieved a high of 87% overall accuracy and over 90% accuracy in water delineation. The results indicate that the multi-view and attention strategies have the potential to improve segmentation performance, and together with unsupervised learning, save considerable labor/expertise. Interestingly, evidence shows that the band/scale attention (weight) is adaptively associated with the land cover percentages per input image, indicating spatial contexts captured. This finding highlights the potential usages of the attention rule in automatic feature exploration, selection, and model interpretation. The framework illustrating a highly automated deep learning deployment on small MV datasets facilitates cost-effective wetland cover mapping. Although limitations exist, the study demonstrated the possibility of where/how conventional segmentation pipelines can be improved in typical UAV wetland mapping tasks. The framework and findings are useful for similar applications (including non-UAV studies) that only have limited time, labor, and expertise to implement sophisticated semantic segmentation models.', '[Hu, Qiao; Zhang, Ligang] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.

Until now, we have to admit that the long-term statistical evidence for proving the correspondence between earthquake and TIR anomalies is still absent and the power of TIR anomalies for predicting earthquakes is limited. In this study, we use daily nighttime Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) data provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to extract the TIR anomalies of Chinese Mainland (20 degrees-54 degrees N, 73 degrees-135 degrees E). The data from Jan. 2007 to Dec. 2010 is the training dataset to obtain the best parameters for extracting TIR anomalies and the best time-distance-magnitude (TDM) windows for determining the correspondence between earthquakes and TIR anomalies, and the data from Jan. 2011 to Dec. 2017 is the testing dataset. The new 3D Molchan diagram offers a score for each model with different parameters. Unlike the original MD that only deals with the rate of missed events and the size of warning space, the 3D Molchan diagram quantifies the errors including false alarms and missed predictions. We assume that the best parameters and TDM windows are spatially variable for different sub-regions, because the Signal/Noise ratio is spatially variable due to the different geological and meteorological backgrounds. Moreover, we construct a new probability prediction model based on non-seismic binary alarms. Results show that the TIR anomalies is strongly related to normal or reverse earthquakes with magnitude >= 4.0, and the TIR anomalies caused by earthquakes should be persistent in space and time. Moreover, the spatially variable model is superior to the global invariant one. We succeed in transforming the non-seismic binary alarms into probabilistic predictions based on the TIR anomalies and Relative Intensity index, which is defined as the rate of past earthquakes occurring in each spatial cell. Moreover, our new probabilistic model is superior to the spatially inhomogeneous Poisson model. However, this new probability model is still naive and weak, and needs to be improved in the future.', '[Zhang, Ying; Meng, Qingyan; Zhang, Linlin] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China.

NASA\'s ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) provides new data for understanding hydrologic cycling in these forested mountain areas. Evaluation of ECOSTRESS evapotranspiration (ET) has relied primarily on eddy flux towers, but most flux towers are located in flat terrain, sampling relatively homogeneous vegetation. To address this knowledge gap, the accuracy of the ECOSTRESS land surface temperature (L2_LST) and ET (L3_ET_PT-JPL) data were evaluated against data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service\'s Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory: a humid temperate forest ecosystem in the southern Appalachian Mountains of the southeastern U.S. with extensive data from one eddy covariance tower and five climate stations varying in elevation. ECOSTRESS LST showed a strong linear relationship with the weather station near-surface air temperature (R-2 = 0.85; offset =-2.5 degrees C), showing no difference across slope, aspect and elevation, but a higher correlation during the night than the day. ECOSTRESS tended to overestimate ET compared with our site eddy covariance measurements (R-2 = 0.43; RMSE = 146 W m(-2)). To evaluate potential sources of error associated with remotely-sensed inputs to the ECOSTRESS Priestly-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) ET model, we ran PT-JPL using ground-based data from our site. ET estimated with locally-collected data showed much better performance in capturing variability (R-2 similar to 0.70), illustrating the uncertainty contributed to ECOSTRESS by the coarse scale meteorological inputs in areas of complex topography. Notably, both the ECOSTRESS LST and ET captured important topographic gradients and spatially-explicit diurnal variability. The valley floor of the Coweeta Basin was warmer than the higher elevations by 8 degrees C in the day, but cooler at night. On the south facing aspects, LST and ET were higher, consistent with observations. This also highlights the ability of ECOSTRESS and PT-JPL to decouple ET from LST when and where appropriate, as they are normally inverse to one another.

There is often a tradeoff between the spatial and temporal resolutions of imagery acquired from current satellite sensors and as such various spatiotemporal image fusion methods have been explored to circumvent the challenges this situation presents (e.g., STARFM). However, some challenges persist in mapping surface water at the desired fine spatial and temporal resolution. Principally, the spatiotemporal changes of water bodies are often abrupt and controlled by topographic conditions, which are usually unaddressed in current spatiotemporal image fusion methods. This paper proposes the SpatioTemporal Surface Water Mapping (STSWM) method, which aims to predict Landsat-like, 30 m, surface water maps at an 8-day time step (same as the MODIS 8-day composite product) by integrating topographic information into the analysis. In addition to MODIS imagery acquired on the date of map prediction and a pair of MODIS and Landsat images acquired temporally close to the date of prediction, STSWM also uses the surface water occurrence (SWO, which represents the frequency with which water is present in a pixel) and DEM data to provide, respectively, topographic information below and above the water surface. These data are used to translate the coarse spatial resolution water distribution representation observed by MODIS into a 30 m spatial resolution water distribution map. The STSWM was used to generate an 8-day time series surface water maps of 30 m resolution in six inundation regions globally, and was compared with several other state-of-the-art spatiotemporal methods. The stratified random sampling design was used, and unbiased estimators of the accuracies were provided. The results show that STSWM generated the most accurate surface water map in which the spatial details of surface water were well-represented.', '[Li, Xiaodong; Ling, Feng; Zhang, Yihang; Zhou, Pu; Wang, Yalan; Chen, Rui; Du, Yun] Chinese Acad Sci, Innovat Acad Precis Measurement Sci & Technol, Key Lab Environm & Disaster Monitoring & Evaluat, Wuhan 430071, Hubei, Peoples R China.

Discrepancies in retrievals of geophysical surface properties over vegetated areas can result from this incompleteness. This perception motivated to explore EM considerations in how temperature drives L-VOD of a boreal forest. Thereto, a novel physics-based model is developed and evaluated to assess L-VOD sensitivities to canopy temperature and some other model parameters. The L-VOD model is compared to L-VOD derived from close-range L-band brightness temperatures measured through the tree canopy at the Finnish Meteorological Institute\'s Arctic Research Center (FMI-ARC) in Sodankyla center dot (Finland) during a 4-week and a 1-day period in 2019. Furthermore, the model\'s ability to explain L-VOD retrieved from brightness temperatures of the \"Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity\" (SMOS) satellite over the \"Sodankyla center dot grid cell\" is investigated. Experimental L-VOD are maximal at around 0 degrees C and decrease when canopy temperature is moving away from zero degree Celsius. This temperature response, observed at different temporal- and spatial scales, is captured by the proposed L-VOD model and explained by freezing tree sap-water and the dependence of water permittivity on temperature. The demonstrated EM-induced temperature dependence suggest caution with interpreting satellite-based L-VOD, because increased L-VOD around the freezing point is not solely due to increased biomass or rehydration of the vegetation. Further, our study can find future application to compensate L-VOD for EM-induced temperature sensitivity. This potentially leads to improved explanatory power of temperature normalized L-VOD for characterization of forest phenology. Furthermore, we suggest examining the presence and strength of the demonstrated L-VOD temperature response as a practical L-VOD retrieval quality assessment method under steady forest phenology.', '[Schwank, Mike; Naderpour, Reza; Houtz, Derek] Fed Res Inst Forrest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.

Various parametric models have been proposed to simulate urban thermal radiation directionality, but a comprehensive comparison of the performances of the published parametric models, especially over a variety of urban surfaces under different solar radiation conditions, remains lacking. It is also unknown whether the combination of the available hotspot and base shape kernels can be used to derive new parametric models with even better performances compared with existing models. Based on both forward-modelling and satellite datasets, here we systematically evaluate three single-kernel and eight dual-kernel parametric models. The main findings are as follows: (1) Amongst the three single-kernel models, the VIN model has the best overall performance, with an average rootmean-square error (RMSE) of 0.79 and 1.35 K, based on forward-modelling and satellite data, respectively. However, the ROU and RL models outperform the VIN model when the solar zenith angle is less than 30 degrees, and in particular it has a higher accuracy for hotspot description. (2) The dual-kernel models usually perform better than the single-kernel models. Amongst the eight dual-kernel models, those with the hotspot kernel KHotspot_rou (used by the ROU model) are more competent than those using KHotspot_vin (obtained from the Vinnikov model) as the hotspot kernel. The RVI model, in general, has the highest accuracy, with average RMSEs of 0.49 and 0.77 K based on forward-modelling and satellite data, respectively. (3) Compared with the single- and dual-kernel models, the multi-kernel models sometimes have better accuracies but the performance improvements are relatively limited. We also provide recommendations for model selection under various scenarios. Our systematic assessment improves our understanding of urban thermal radiation directionality regimes and potentially enables the improved correction of remotely-sensed urban LSTs, thus helping to advance thermal remote sensing of the urban environment.', '[Jiang, Lu; Zhan, Wenfeng; Huang, Fan; Hong, Falu; Liu, Zihan; Lai, Jiameng; Wang, Chenguang] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Geog Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

Although various statistical models and machine learning models have been developed to enhance prediction accuracy, spatial and temporal non-stationarity, an intrinsic attribute of many geographical processes, is still rarely considered in crop yield modeling. From a statistical point of view, this study respectively provided evidence for the existence of spatial non-stationarity and temporal non-stationarity in winter wheat yield prediction based on geographically weighted regression (GWR) and temporally weighted regression (TWR). Then, a geographically and temporally weighted neural network (GTWNN) model was proposed by integrating artificial neural network (ANN) into geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) using publicly available data sources, including satellite imagery and climate data. For a more credible evaluation, the leave-one-year-out strategy was adopted to make out-of-sample prediction resulting in a total of 12 test years from 2008 to 2019. The experiment results showed that the proposed GTWNN outperformed ANN, GTWR and support vector regression (SVR) achieving the average coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.766, 0.759 and 0.720 at the three prediction times of end of July, end of June and end of May. Moreover, an extended Moran\'s I was adopted to assess the degree of spatiotemporal autocorrelation of the prediction errors. The error aggregation of GTWNN was lower than other models, indicating that GTWNN is applicable to addressing spatial non-stationarity in modeling the relationship between predictors and yield response.

This study designs a ground-based experiment to measure brightness temperatures (BTs) of oil-inwater (OW) emulsions with different concentrations and oil-free water as a function of time in 32 consecutive hours. Compared with a previous thermal experiment to measure oil slicks (i.e., non-emulsified oil) with different thicknesses and considering the similarity between oil slicks and water-in-oil (WO) emulsions, it is found that (1) the diurnal response of brightness temperature difference (BTD, between oil samples and oil-free sample) to oil emulsion types (OW or WO) is similar, making it difficult to classify oil emulsion types using thermal remote sensing; (2) in contrast, BTD under thermal balance during the optimal time window appears to be a function of equivalent oil thickness (EOT) (oil volume per area, mm) regardless of oil emulsion type, suggesting that EOT could be estimated from BTD. Application of such experimental results to Landsat imagery over the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico suggests that although their ability to quantify oil footprint is limited, thermal data show potentials in providing unique information (e.g., estimating EOTs for up to 4 mm without the need of differentiating sub-pixel heterogeneity) to complement optical data in characterizing oil type and oil quantity when the spilled oil is thick (> 0.4 mm).', '[Jiao, Junnan; Lu, Yingcheng; Liu, Yongxue] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Nanjing 210046, Peoples R China.

The long-term collection of data from the Landsat missions provides some of the most valuable information for understanding the processes of global tropical forest disturbance. However, there are substantial uncertainties in the estimation of non-mechanized, small-scale (i.e., small area) clearings in tropical forests with Landsat series images. Because the appearance of small-scale openings in a tropical tree canopy are often ephemeral due to fastgrowing vegetation, and because clouds are frequent in tropical regions, it is challenging for Landsat images to capture the logging signal. Moreover, the spatial resolution of Landsat images is typically too coarse to represent spatial details about small-scale clearings. In this paper, by fusing all available Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, we proposed a method to improve the tracking of small-scale tropical forest disturbance history with both fine spatial and temporal resolutions. First, yearly composited Landsat and Sentinel-2 self-referenced normalized burn ratio (rNBR) vegetation index images were calculated from all available Landsat-7/8 and Sentinel-2 scenes during 2016-2019. Second, a deep-learning based downscaling method was used to predict fine resolution (10 m) rNBR images from the annual coarse resolution (30 m) Landsat rNBR images. Third, given the baseline Landsat forest map in 2015, the generated fine-resolution Landsat rNBR images and original Sentinel-2 rNBR images were fused to produce the 10 m forest disturbance map for the period 2016-2019. From data comparison and evaluation, it was demonstrated that the deep-learning based downscaling method can produce fineresolution Landsat rNBR images and forest disturbance maps that contain substantial spatial detail. In addition, by fusing downscaled fine-resolution Landsat rNBR images and original Sentinel-2 rNBR images, it was possible to produce state-of-the-art forest disturbance maps with OA values more than 87% and 96% for the small and large study areas, and detected 11% to 21% more disturbed areas than either the Sentinel-2 or Landsat-7/8 time-series alone. We found that 1.42% of the disturbed areas indentified during 2016-2019 experienced multiple forest disturbances. The method has great potential to enhance work undertaken in relation to major policies such as the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) programmes.', '[Zhang, Yihang; Ling, Feng; Li, Xiaodong; Du, Yun] Chinese Acad Sci, Innovat Acad Precis Measurement Sci & Technol, Key Lab Monitoring & Estimate Environm & Disaster, Wuhan 430077, Peoples R China.

This study evaluates the feasibility of the IWV trends derived from the newly released fifth generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) for climate change analysis in continental Europe. This is achieved by comparing the trends derived from in-situ ground-based Global Positioning System (GPS)\'s daily IWV series from 1994 to 2019 at 109 stations. The realistic uncertainties and statistical significances of the IWV trends are evaluated with the time series analysis on their noise characteristics and proper noise models. Results show that autoregressive moving average ARMA(1,1) noise model is preferred rather than the commonly assumed white noise (WN) or first-order autoregressive AR(1) noise for about 68% of the ERA5 and GPS IWV series. An improper noise model would misevaluate the trend uncertainty of an IWV time series, compared with its specific preferred noise model. For example, ARMA(1,1) may misevaluate the standard deviations of their trend estimates (0.1-0.3 kg m(-2) decade(-1)) by 10%. Nevertheless, ARMA(1,1) is recommended as the default noise model for the ERA5 and GPS IWV series. However, the preferred noise model for each ERA5 minus GPS (E-G) IWV series should be specifically determined, because the AR(1)-related models can result in an underestimation on its trend uncertainty by 90%. In contrast, power-law (PL) model can lead to an overestimation by up to nine times. The E-G IWV trends are within -0.2-0.4 kg m(-2) decade(-1), indicating that the ERA5 is a potential data source of IWV trends for climate change analysis in continental Europe. The ERA5 and GPS IWV trends are consistent in their magnitudes and geographical patterns, lower in Northwest Europe (0-0.4 kg m(-2) decade(-1)) but higher around the Mediterranean Sea (0.6-1.4 kg m(-2) decade(-1)).', '[Yuan, Peng; Kutterer, Hansjoerg] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Geodet Inst, Englerstr 7, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.

However, due to technological constraints, it is difficult to provide simultaneously high spatial resolution, high temporal frequency, and high quality observation data. Existing mapping solutions are limited by traditional remotely sensed data, that have shorter observation periods, poor spatio-temporal consistency and comparability. Therefore, a new mapping paradigm is needed. This paper develops a framework for intelligent mapping (iMap) of land cover based on state-of-the-art technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, virtual constellations, and spatio-temporal reconstruction and fusion. Under this framework, we built an automated, serverless, end-to-end data production chain and parallel mapping system based on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and produced the first 30 m global daily seamless data cubes (SDC), and annual to seasonal land cover maps for 1985?2020. The SDC was produced through a multi-source spatio-temporal data reconstruction and fusion workflow based on Landsat, MODIS, and AVHRR virtual constellations. Independent validation results show that the relative mean error of the SDC is less than 2.14%. As analysis ready data (ARD), it can lay a foundation for high-precision quantitative remote sensing information extraction. From this SDC, we produced 36-year long, 30 m resolution global land cover map data set by combining strategies of sample migration, machine learning, and spatio-temporal adjustment. The average overall accuracy of our annual land cover maps over multiple periods of time is 80% for level 1 classification and over 73% for level 2 classification (29 and 33 classes). Based on an objective validation sample consisting of FLUXNET sites, our map accuracy is 10% higher than that of existing global land cover datasets including Globeland30. Our results show that the average global land cover change rate is 0.36%/yr. Global forest decreased by 1.47 million km2 from 38.44 million km2, cropland increased by 0.84 million km2 from 12.49 million km2 and impervious surface increased by 0.48 million km2 from 0.57 million km2 during 1985? 2020.', '[Liu, Han; Gong, Peng; Xu, Bing] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.

However, the extensive nonrandom missingness of OMI-NO2 data (e.g., an approximate per-pixel missing proportion of 59% for mainland China in 2015) due to cloud contamination or high reflectance limits applicability of these data in estimation of ground-level NO2. This paper proposes the use of a full residual deep learning method to impute missing satellite-borne NO2 data (OMI-NO2) and to estimate (map) ground-level NO2 with uncertainty (coefficient of variation) at a high spatial (1 x 1 km(2)) and temporal (daily) resolution. For the large study region (mainland China except Hainan Province), the presented method achieved robust performance with a stable learning efficiency (mean test R-2: 0.98 with a small standard deviation of 0.01; mean test RMSE: 0.42 x 10(15) molecules/cm(2)) for imputation of OMI-NO2. In the model, the coordinates and elevation were used to capture the spatial variability of the OMI-NO2 columns, and fused meteorological grid data and planetary boundary layer height and ozone data from GEOS-FP were used to capture spatiotemporal variability of OMI-NO2. The evaluation with ground in situ NO2 measurements showed considerable contribution of the complete (raw observed and imputed) OMI-NO2 columns, meteorology and traffic variables to inference of ground-level NO2 (test R-2: 0.82; test RMSE: 8.80 mu g/m(3)). The complete grids of OMI-NO2 columns showed natural and smooth spatial transitions between the raw observed and imputed values. The surfaces of predicted NO2 concentration not only showed consistent distributions with OMI-NO2 at a regional and temporal scale, but also presented local spatial gradients of ground-level NO2. OMI-NO2 can be downscaled and imputed to be used as an important predictor to improve the estimation of high-resolution ground-level NO2. The reliable estimates of ground-level NO2 concentration with uncertainty can reduce the bias in estimates of NO2 exposure and subsequently evaluations of its health effects.', '[Li, Lianfa; Wu, Jiajie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

In this paper, we propose a new fusion strategy for generating high-quality, all-weather LST data based on cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching and multiresolution Kalman filtering (MKF). CDF matching was employed to improve the quality of the high-resolution (0.01 degrees) LST data downscaled with the retrieved coarse-resolution (0.1 degrees) PMW LST from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) brightness temperature (BT) data set. The MKF approach was employed to produce high-quality, all-weather LST data by fusing the retrieved coarse-resolution AMSR2 LST and high-resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data sets filled with CDFimproved LST data. The spatial patterns in the high-resolution and coarse-resolution LST data were consistent after MKF fusion. The accuracy of coarse-resolution LST data was considerably improved. The biases, root mean square errors (RMSEs) and determination coefficients (R-2) were 0.79-1.47 K, 3.0-3.82 K, 0.88-0.96, respectively. The RMSE of the fused coarse-resolution LST data decreased by 1.51 K/1.82 K and 1.81 K/1.39 K in daytime/nighttime in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and Heihe River Basin (HRB) verification regions compared to the RMSE of the retrieved AMSR2 LST data. The accuracy of high-resolution LST data remained unchanged, but the spatial coverage was complete with exceptions at the orbital gaps. The bias, RMSE and R-2 values of high-resolution LST data were - 0.91- -0.81 K, 3.02-3.32 K, and 0.93-0.97 under all-sky conditions in the TP and HRB verification regions, respectively. Compared to methods in the existing LST fusion studies, the proposed strategy has advantages in terms of LST data quality and validation accuracy. When both coarse-resolution and high-resolution LST data are missing, the spatial coverages of fused all-weather LST data are incomplete.

However, these models do not accurately represent processes in ecosystems characterized by mixtures of green vegetation and senescent plant material (SPM), in particular grasslands. These inaccuracies limit the retrieval of vegetation biophysical and functional properties. Green and senesced plants feature contrasting spectral properties and carry out different functions that current coupled models do not represent separately. Besides, senescent pigments\' absorption features change as SPM decomposes, and neither is this process well parameterized in radiative transfer models. This manuscript aims at overcoming these limitations. On the one hand, we have developed senSCOPE, a version of the Soil-Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) that separately represents light interaction and physiology of green and senesced leaves. On the other, we have characterized new specific absorption coefficients of senescent pigments (K-s) from optical measurements of SPM from a Mediterranean grassland. Sensitivity analyses revealed that compared to SCOPE, senSCOPE 1) predicts variables that respond more linearly to the faction of green leaf area; and 2) keeps high levels of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation in the green leaves, which leads to significant differences in leaf photosynthesis, non-photochemical quenching, and transpiration. Moreover, we compared SCOPE vs. senSCOPE\'s capability to provide estimates of functional and biophysical parameters of vegetation. We assimilated different combinations of reflectance factors (R), chlorophyll sun-induced fluorescence radiance in the O-2-A band (F-760), gross primary production (GPP), and thermal radiance (L-t) measured in a Mediterranean grassland. Besides, we compared the role of three different sets of K-s coefficients in the inversion of senSCOPE, two estimated from SPM. The performance of the inversions was assessed using field data and a pattern-oriented model evaluation approach. Unlike SCOPE, senSCOPE provided unbiased estimates of chlorophyll content (C-ab) during the dry season. The use of SPM-specific K-s improved the representation of R in the near-infrared wavelengths; and, consequently, the estimation of leaf area index (LAI). Compared with field LAI, the coefficient of determination R-2 increased from similar to 0.4 to similar to 0.6, depending on the inversion constraints. Compared with SCOPE, the new model and coefficients together reduced the root mean squared error between observed and modeled R (similar to 40%), F-760 (similar to 30%), and GPP (similar to 5%). Both models failed to represent L-t; in this case, senSCOPE featured larger uncertainties. The modeling approach we propose improves the simulation and retrieval of vegetation properties and function in grasslands. Further work is needed to test the applicability of senSCOPE in different ecosystems, improve the simulation of the thermal spectral domain, and better characterize the optical parameters of SPM.

Contrary to intuitive perception, deriving PM10 is more difficult than PM2.5 from satellite measurements. This is because although the major satellite parameter Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) contain contribution of all suspended particles, it is much more sensitive to fine particles than coarse particles. To address this challenge, a physically based remote sensing method for PM10 is developed using two new semi-empirical physical models: the model of columnar volume-to extinction ratio (VE10) and the model of particle effective density. VE10 is a key parameter bridging the nonlinear relationship between aerosol extinction and volume concentration. A semi-empirical VE10 model is developed based on the fine mode fraction (FMF), and the mean relative error of VE10 modeling is 14.5%. Similarly, the particle effective density depends on the ratio of mass to volume. The particle effective density is effectively characterized by refractive index of matter, with the theoretical error of 13.8%. Both semi-empirical physical models are applied to the derivation of PM10, by using aerosol retrieval products of POLarization and Directionality of the Earth\'s Reflectances (POLDER) produced by the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP) algorithm. As a validation, PM10 mass concentration is estimated over China from Jan. to Oct. in 2013.

To quantify the performance of various passive sensor designs within a common framework we developed an aerosol climatology of the Los Angeles basin and applied observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) to estimate the information content retrievable from a variety of sensors measuring reflected near-infrared solar radiation. In addition to simulating current and planned satellite sensors, we also characterize the sensitivity of the California Laboratory for Atmospheric Remote Sensing - Fourier Transform Spectrometer (CLARS-FTS), located at Mt. Wilson (1.67 km above sea level), which is utilized in this work as a testbed for aerosol profiling remote sensing. We estimate the impacts of spectral coverage, radiance and polarization, spectral resolution, signal to noise ratio (SNR), and number of viewing angles on the information content and retrieval uncertainties of aerosol profiles in the PBL. We found that by adding high spectral resolution (full-width half-maximum of 3 cm(-1) or better), polarimetric measurements with a SNR of at least 212 to radiance measurements with SNR of 300 for both O-2 A and (1)Delta bands, the degrees of freedom for signal (DOFS) of a single CLARS-FTS measurement is raised from 2.1 to 2.8. This improvement is sufficient to simultaneously quantify three key parameters: aerosol optical depth, aerosol peak height, and aerosol layer thickness in the PBL. Current satellite-borne instruments (OCO-2, OCO-3, TEMPO, TROPOMI, and EPIC) and planned instruments (TEMPO, MicroCarb, SPEXone, and MAIA), individually provide a DOFS <= 2.25, which is insufficient to simultaneously quantify all three aerosol profiling parameters in the PBL. Joint radiometric and polarimetric measurements of the O-2 A and B bands with 3 cm(-1) spectral resolution, SNR of 500 for radiance and 353 for polarization, acquired at three viewing angles, can provide sufficient sensitivity to retrieve the three aerosol parameters simultaneously. The inclusion of high spectral resolution radiometric and polarimetric measurements reduces the required number of viewing angles, which is advantageous when the multiangular data are acquired with a pointable instrument. In this case a larger number of viewing angles reduces the spatial coverage that can be achieved for a given target.', '[Choi, Myungje; Sander, Stanley P.; Pongetti, Thomas J.; van Harten, Gerard; Drouin, Brian J.; Diner, David J.; Crisp, David; Eldering, Annmarie; Kalashnikova, Olga V.; Jiang, Jonathan H.; Hyon, Jason J.; Fu, Dejian] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.

Radiative transfer models are widely used to simulate leaf spectra by quantifying photon transfer processes of reflection, transmission and absorption within a plant leaf. Recent advances in spectral invariants theory offer a unique and efficient approach for modeling the canopy-scale radiative transfer processes, but remain underexplored for applications at the leaf scale. In this study, we developed a leaf-scale optical property model based on the spectrally invariant properties (leaf-SIP) of plant leaves. Similar to the canopy-scale model, the leaf-SIP model decouples leaf-scale radiative transfer process into two parts: wavelength-dependent contribution from leaf chemical components and wavelength-independent contribution from leaf structures, described by two spectrally invariant parameters (i.e., a photon recollision probability p and a scattering asymmetry parameter q). We implemented the leaf-SIP model by parameterizing p and q with a measurable leaf morphological trait, the leaf mass per area (LMA). We evaluated the performance of the leaf-SIP model with two in situ datasets (i.e., LOPEX and ANGERS) and the widely used PROSPECT leaf optical model. The results show that the leaf spectra simulated by the leaf-SIP model agreed well with in situ datasets and the simulations of the PROSPECT model, with a small root mean squared error (RMSE), bias, and high coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.026, 0.035, 0.95 and 0.037, 0.049, 0.91 for leaf reflectance and leaf transmittance, respectively. Our results also show that the leaf-SIP model can be used with measured leaf spectra to accurately estimate several key leaf functional traits, such as the leaf chlorophyll content, equivalent water thickness, and LMA. The leaf-SIP model provides an efficient and physical way of accurately simulating leaf spectra and retrieving key leaf functional traits from hyperspectral measurements.', '[Wu, Shengbiao; Zhu, Peng] CEA CNRS UVSQ, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, UMR8212, Gif Sur Yvette, France.

Emerging studies with a focus on greenhouse gases reveal that small rivers can contribute to more than half of the global carbon emissions from inland waters (including lakes and wetlands). However, large-scale extraction of drainage networks is constrained by the coarse resolution of observational data and models, which hinders assessments of terrestrial hydrological and biogeochemical cycles. Recognizing that Sentinel-2 satellite can detect surface water up to a 10-m resolution over large scales, we propose a new method named Remote Sensing Stream Burning (RSSB) to integrate high-resolution observational flow location with coarse topography to improve the extraction of drainage network. In RSSB, satellite-derived input is integrated in a spatially continuous manner, producing a quasi-bathymetry map where relative relief is enforced, enabling a fine-grained, accurate, and multitemporal extraction of drainage network. RSSB was applied to the Lancang-Mekong River basin to derive a 10-m resolution drainage network, with a significant reduction in location errors as validated by the river centerline measurements. The high-resolution extraction resulted in a realistic representation of meanders and detailed network connections. Further, RSSB enabled a multitemporal extraction of river networks during wet/dry seasons and before/after the formation of new channels. The proposed method is fully automated, meaning that the network extraction preserves basin-wide connectivity without requiring any postprocessing, hence facilitating the construction of drainage networks data with openly accessible imagery. The RSSB method provides a basis for the accurate representation of drainage networks that maintains channel connectivity, allows a more realistic inclusion of small rivers and streams, and enables a greater understanding of complex but active exchange between inland water and other related Earth system components.', '[Wang, Zifeng; Liu, Junguo; Meng, Ying] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.

Particular challenges exist in China where tidal flats are changing rapidly along with accelerated economic development in coastal regions. The unique and important ecosystem functions and services that tidal flats provide in coastal regions warrant the necessary of mapping such a particular land cover type in high precision and accuracy. Existing national tidal flat maps of China, which were derived from the 30-m resolution Landsat imagery and auxiliary data, are insufficient to support practical management efforts. In this study, in order to produce an accurate tidal flat map with finer spatial resolution, we employed 28,367 scenes of time series Sentinel-2 images acquired in 2019 and 2020 along the entire coastal line of China. The short revisit cycle (2-5 days) of the Sentinel-2 improved the opportunities of obtaining the highest and lowest tide images, and the finer spatial resolution (10-m) enhanced the capacity of precision tidal flat extraction. A rapid, robust, and automated tidal flat mapping approach is essential to large-scale applications. In this study, we developed an approach by integrating the maximum spectral index composite (MSIC) and the Otsu algorithm (OA), and so named MSIC-OA. By GEE platform, we automated the execution of MSIC-OA to Sentinel-2 images, and produced an up-to-date 10-m spatial resolution tidal flat map of China (China_Tidal Flat, CTF). Validated by massive field-based observations and selected edge-points, the CTF map achieved an overall accuracy of 95% and the F1 score of 0.93. As we calculated, the total area of tidal flats in China was 858,784 ha, and Jiangsu Province accounted the largest proportion (24%) of the national total. This study is the first attempt to delineate tidal flats automatically at a 10-m spatial resolution. The CTF map can provide essential information for management of coastal ecosystems and facilitate the implementations of coastal and marine related Sustainable Development Goals.', '[Jia, Mingming; Wang, Zongming; Mao, Dehua; Ren, Chunying] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Environm, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China.

We use satellite data products from the Terra and Aqua MODerateresolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Landsat-7 and-8 satellites, along with meteorological and streamflow data, and modeled data products to study the relationship between changing snow-cover conditions and the decline of the GSL since 2000 in the context of the historical record of lake levels. The GSL basin includes much of the snow-dominated Wasatch and Uinta mountain ranges to the east of the lake. Snowmelt feeds the Bear, Jordan, and Weber rivers which are the three main rivers that flow into the lake. Snowmelttiming maps, derived from a new MODIS standard snow-cover product, MOD10A1F, show that snow melted-9.5 days earlier in the GSL basin during the study period, extending from 2000 to 2018. Air temperatures derived from 26 meteorological stations and surface temperatures measured by the Aqua MODIS land-surface temperature (LST) products, MYD21A1D and MYD21A1N, show trends of increasing temperature of similar to 0.94 degrees C (alpha = 0.05), and similar to 2.18 degrees C, respectively, with most of the LST trends in the GSL basin being statistically significant (alpha = 0.05). Increasing air temperatures in the basin have led to less precipitation falling as snow, lower snow depth (by-34.5 mm (alpha = 0.01)) and snow-water equivalent (0.02 mm (alpha = 0.01)), and earlier snowmelt. Also during the study period, Global Land surface Evaporation Amsterdam Model data show evaporation increasing by similar to 3.2 mm/yr, with trends in much of the basin being statistically significant (alpha = 0.05). Trends calculated from the various products are generally in agreement indicating higher temperatures, greater evaporation, less snowfall and snow-on-the ground, and earlier snowmelt. Earlier snowmelt contributes to increasing evaporative loss from water flowing toward the lake. Furthermore, a lower mountain snowpack and less precipitation falling as snow (versus rain) is associated with lower stream discharge even if overall precipitation stays the same. The surface-water temperature of the GSL also increased over the study period by similar to 0.69 degrees C, according to the MODIS LST data products, the surface-water elevation of the lake dropped by similar to 1.7 m between 2000 and 2018, and the areal extent of the lake decreased by similar to 901 km(2) as measured using Landsat imagery. Desiccation of the lake is associated with deleterious effects on wildlife, recreational activities, and some local industries. And, importantly, an expanding lake bed can also fuel dust storms that promote dangerous air quality along the Wasatch Front. This work elucidates the key role that satellite remote sensing can play in documenting earlier snowmelt and other changes in the GSL basin that influence the ongoing decline of the Great Salt Lake.', '[Hall, Dorothy K.; Kang, Do Hyuk] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.

Taking advantage of the physical relationship between optical properties and leaf biochemistry, field-based spectroscopy has allowed for the rapid estimation of leaf biochemical constituents and repeated nondestructive measurements through time. Leaf constituent retrieval from leaf optical properties following inversion of the physically-based radiative transfer model PROSPECT is now a popular method, but some cases prompt poor retrieval success and this approach requires a strict inversion procedure. We investigated the performances of different inversion procedures for the estimation of leaf constituents, specifically chlorophyll a and b, carotenoids, water (EWT), and dry matter (LMA) from >1400 broadleaf samples, including the definition of optimal spectral subdomains, and the use of leaf reflectance or transmittance alone. We also developed a strategy to obtain prior information on the leaf structure parameter (N) in PROSPECT, when only reflectance or transmittance is measured, and examined the influence of this prior information in combination with different inversion procedures. We found that using the full domain of reflectance or transmittance only systematically leads to suboptimal estimation of chlorophyll a and b, carotenoids, EWT, and LMA, due to either the combined absorption of multiple constituents or inaccurate estimation of the N parameter. Our study confirms that the selection of optimal spectral subdomains leads to improved estimation of all leaf constituents, from 700 to 720 nm for chlorophyll a and b, 520-560 nm for carotenoids, and from 1700 to 2400 nm for EWT and LMA. Prior information on N, computed directly from the spectra, leads to systematic improved estimation of leaf constituents when only reflectance or transmittance is measured, with reductions in normalized root mean square error from 8 to 37%. We strongly recommend using optimal subdomains when inverting PROSPECT to retrieve leaf constituents, and with the availability of only reflectance or transmittance we further recommend the use of prior information on the N parameter.', '[Spafford, Lynsay] Mem Univ, Environm Sci, St John, NF, Canada.

By analyzing climate model simulations, it has been found that the largest factor in Arctic Amplification comes from enhanced temperature feedbacks, caused by the different vertical atmospheric warming profiles and a larger temperature change for longwave emission per unit of warming at highcompared to low-latitudes. Radiometers on polar-orbiting satellites offer the best mechanism to derive sea surface temperature (SST) in the Arctic, but given that the retrieval algorithms in the infrared (IR) are designed to compensate for the effects of the atmosphere, mainly water vapor (WV), IR satellite-derived SSTs have larger inaccuracies at high latitudes because the atmosphere can be very dry and cold. So, the motivation of this study is to improve the algorithms to obtain more accurate SSTs which can be used to research the feedback mechanisms. To undertake the study, the 5-year matchup database (MUDB) for MODIS (Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) on Aqua has been analyzed to characterize the differences between collocated and simultaneous satellite retrieved skin SSTs (SSTskin) using the R2014 dataset and in situ buoy temperatures, and to identify the main causes of the discrepancies. According to the radiative transfer simulations, the sea surface emissivity is proven to be significant in satellite SSTskin retrievals at high latitudes due to the low atmospheric WV content, especially during winter. An Emissivity-introduced Brightness Temperature Difference (EBT) is developed to correct this emissivity effect in the algorithm. Furthermore, the reference temperature as a weighting factor for differences in brightness temperature (BT) measured in MODIS bands 31 and 32 has also been adjusted. The satellite SSTskin mean bias and standard deviation are reduced by 0.35 K and 0.085 K after the corrections. The approaches presented in this paper are capable to make more appropriate atmospheric corrections for MODIS SSTskin retrieval algorithm, leading to regional optimization of the SST retrievals. We report on the progress towards improving the satellite-derived SSTskin with the expectation that the near two-decadal time series of MODIS SSTskin fields will contribute to studying climate change in the Arctic.', '[Jia, Chong] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Grad Program Meteorol & phys Oceanog, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.

In this paper, we introduce and validate a cost-effective method for mapping understory invasive plant species. We utilized Landsat imagery, spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and a maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling framework to map the spatial extent of Mikania micrantha in Chitwan National Park, Nepal and community forests within its buffer zone. We developed a spectral library from reference and image sources and applied multiple endmember SMA (MESMA) to selected Landsat imagery. Incorporating the resultant green vegetation and shade fractions into Maxent, we mapped the distribution of understory M. micrantha in the study area, with training and testing Area under Curve (AUC) values around 0.80, and kappa around 0.55. In vegetated places, especially mature forests, an increase in green vegetation fraction and decrease in shade fraction was associated with higher likelihood of M. micrantha presence. In addition, the inclusion of elevation as a model input further improved map accuracy (AUC around 0.95; kappa around 0.80). Elevation, a surrogate for distance to water in this case, proved to be the determining factor of M. micrantha\'s distribution in the study area.

Advances in remote sensing sensors and platforms are allowing multi-dimensional and continuous-spatial information to be acquired in a fast and non-destructive way to quantify forest biochemical traits at multiple spatial scales. Here we demonstrate the use of high spectral resolution, hyperspectral data combined with high density three-dimensional information from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) both acquired from an unmanned aerial system (UAS) platform, to quantify and assess the three-dimensional distribution of biochemical pigments on individual tree canopy surfaces. To do so, a DSM based fusion method was developed to integrate the 3D LiDAR point cloud with hyperspectral reflectance data. Regression-based models were then developed to predict a number of biochemical traits (i.e., chlorophyll (Chl) a, b, total Chl and total carotenoids (Cars) content) from a suite of common spectral indices at three vertical canopy levels, and were evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach. One-way ANOVA and Duncan\'s multiple comparison post hoc tests were used to investigate the vertical distribution of biochemical pigments on individual tree canopy surfaces, and in response to age and species. Our results demonstrated that a number of vegetation indices, derived from the hyperspectral data, were strongly correlated with a number of biochemical traits (Adj-R-2 = 0.85-0.91; rRMSE = 5.19-6.38%). In general, models fitted using leaf samples from the upper, middle and lower canopies separately (AdjR(2) = 0.85-0.91; rRMSE = 5.19-6.38%) had similar accuracy to the models developed with pooled data (AdjR(2) = 0.87-0.90; rRMSE = 5.21-6.11%). The differences between separate models and global models were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). However, the distribution of biochemical pigments across vertical layers varied significantly. For dawn redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides) and poplar (Populus deltoides), the results were consistent in that the lower component of the canopy (least light impacted) had the highest chlorophyll and carotenoids biochemical traits. Moreover, the vertical distribution of biochemical traits on individual tree canopy surfaces changed with age likely due to the growth variation from the photosynthetic activity of the canopy. This study indicates the potential of using fused 3D point cloud information with spectral data to monitor physiological activities of forest canopy for carbon accumulation estimation as well as precision forestry applications such as nutrition diagnosis, water regulation and subsequent productivity enhancement of these planted forest systems.', '[Shen, Xin; Cao, Lin; Wu, Xiangqian; Liu, Hao; Wang, Guibin; Cao, Fuliang] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, 159 Longpan Rd, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

The resulting sharp upper-ocean salinity stratification is thought to influence tropical cyclones intensity and biological productivity by inhibiting vertical mixing. Despite recent progresses, the density of in situ data is far from sufficient to monitor the BoB SSS variability, even at the seasonal timescale. The advent of satellite remotely-sensed SSS (SMOS, Aquarius, SMAP) offers a unique opportunity to provide synoptic maps of the BoB SSS every similar to 8 days. Previous SMOS SSS retrievals did not perform well in the BoB. Here, we show that improved systematic error corrections and quality control procedures yield a much better performance of the new \"debiased v4\" CATDS level-3 SSS from SMOS (similar to 0.8 correlation, 0.04 bias and 0.64 root-mean-square difference to more than 28,000 collocated in situ data points over 2010-2019). The SMOS product now performs equivalently to Aquarius, and is slightly inferior to SMAP over the BoB. In particular, SMAP and SMOS are able to capture salinity variations close to the east coast of India (r > 0.8 within 75-150 km of the coast). They thus capture the seasonal freshening there, associated with equatorward advection of the Northern BoB low-salinity water by the East Indian Coastal Current (EICC) after the summer monsoon. The 10-year long SMOS record further allows to describe the BoB interannual SSS variability, which is strongest in boreal fall in relation with the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Positive IOD events induce a weakening of the southward export of freshwater by the EICC, and hence negative SSS anomalies in the Northern BoB and positive ones along the East Indian coast. This confirms results from earlier studies based on modelling, sparse in situ data, or shorter satellite records, but this time from a 10-year long SSS record. Overall, our study indicates that the new SMOS retrieval can be confidently used to monitor the BoB SSS and to study its mechanisms. We end by a brief description of the BoB SSS anomalies associated with the extreme 2019 IOD event and highlight the very good performance over the BoB of a new multi-satellite product developed by the European Space Agency merging SMOS, Aquarius and SMAP data.', '[Akhil, V.

In this study, we tested the capabilities and limitations of a simple methodological framework based on publicly available MODIS Land Reflectance Products to estimate wetland soil surface saturation and inundation spatiotemporal dynamics. Using supervised learning and high-resolution groundwater and surface water elevation data, the framework searches for spectral algorithms, referred to as the wet/dry wetland status classifier (WSC) and the continuous wetland dynamics identifier (WDI), that best predict upper soil layer wetness status in the study wetland. We used Google Earth Engine (GEE) for fast access and processing of the full range of MODIS data. The capabilities of GEE also enabled us to readily conduct a comparative assessment of the MODIS 8-day composite and daily collections and test various pixel-level quality filters to select reliable data at the highest possible temporal resolution. We tested the framework on the internationally-recognized Ramsar site Palo Verde National Park wetland in Costa Rica, and we obtained good results (overall prediction accuracy of 86.6% and kappa coefficient of 0.7 for the WSC; r(2) of 0.71 for the WDI). High-resolution water level data allowed us to assess the challenges, promises and limitations of using MODIS products for wetland hydrology applications. We then applied the WSC and WDI to map the 2000-2016 sub-weekly wetland hydroperiod at 500m resolution, achieving a temporal resolution rarely matched in remote sensing for wetland studies. The analysis of the end-products, combined with the field water elevation data, provided new insights into the drivers controlling the spatiotemporal dynamics of hydroperiod within the Palo Verde wetland and did not reveal any significant temporal trends.

In this study we present two machine learning algorithms, one (multi-layer neural network) for the retrieval of melt pond binary classification and another (multinomial logistic regression) for melt pond fraction using moderate resolution visible satellite imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). To minimize the impact of the anisotropic reflectance characteristics of sea ice and melt ponds, normalized MODIS band reflectance differences from top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) measured reflectances were used. The training samples for the machine learning were based on MODIS reflectances extracted for sea ice, melt ponds and open water classifications based on high resolution (similar to 2 m) WorldView (WV) data. The accuracy assessment for melt pond binary classification and fraction is further evaluated against WV imagery, showing mean overall accuracy (85.5%), average mean difference (0.09), and mean RMSE (0.18). In addition to cross-validation with WV, retrieved melt pond data are validated against melt pond fractions from satellite and ship-based observations, showing average mean differences (MD), root-mean-square-error (RMSE), and correlation coefficients (R) of 0.05, 0.12, and 0.41, respectively. We further investigate a case study of the spectral characteristics of melt ponds and ice during refreezing, and demonstrate an approach to mask out refrozen pixels by using yearly maps of melt onset and freeze-up data together with ice surface temperatures (IST).

However, the frequent occurrence of cloud cover induces a large blank area in current thermal infrared-based LST products. To effectively fill this blank area, a new method for reconstructing the cloud-covered LSTs of Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daytime observations is described using random forest (RF) regression approach. The high temporal resolution of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) LST product assisted in identifying the temporal variations in cloud cover. The cumulative downward shortwave radiation flux (DSSF) was estimated as the solar radiation factor for each MODIS pixel based on the MSG DSSF product to represent the impact from cloud cover on incident solar radiation. The RF approach was used to fit an LST linking model based on the datasets collected from clear-sky pixels that depicted the complicated relationship between LST and the predictor variables, including the surface vegetation index (the normalized difference vegetation index and the enhanced vegetation index), normalized difference water index, solar radiation factor, surface albedo, surface elevation, surface slope, and latitude. The fitted model was then used to reconstruct the LSTs of cloud-covered pixels. The proposed method was applied to the Terra/MODIS daytime LST product for four days in 2015, spanning different seasons in southwestern Europe. A visual inspection indicated that the reconstructed LSTs thoroughly captured the distribution of surface temperature associated with surface vegetation cover, solar radiation, and topography. The reconstructed LSTs showed similar spatial pattern according to the comparison with clear-sky LSTs from temporally adjacent days. In addition, evaluations against Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) NOAH 0.25 degrees 3-h LST data and reference LST data derived based on in-situ air temperature measurements showed that the reconstructed LSTs presented a stable and reliable performance. The coefficients of determination derived with the GLDAS LST data were all above 0.59 on the four examined days. These results indicate that the proposed method has a strong potential for reconstructing LSTs under cloud-covered conditions and can also accurately depict the spatial patterns of LST.', '[Zhao, Wei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.

InSAR and ALS data were collected from Geraldine Forest which is located on rolling to very steep topography in the southeast of New Zealand. These data were combined with an extensive set of plot measurements from which mean top height (H), basal area (G), stem density (N), and total stem volume (TSV) were calculated. InSAR and ALS-based Random Forest models of each variable were developed and compared.   Using the ALS data as a reference, the mean RMSE of the InSAR DSM and DTM surfaces were, respectively, 4.58 and 8.09 m and these errors increased to mean values of, respectively, 6.02 and 10.17 m for slopes of 40-50 degrees.   ALS-based models were substantially more precise than those developed from InSAR for H (R-2 = 0.86 vs. 0.60; RMSE% = 5.47 vs. 10.8%), G (R-2 = 0.56 vs. 0.32; RMSE% = 21.5 vs. 30.4%), N (R-2 = 0.47 vs. 0.09; RMSE% = 32.3 vs. 43.2%), and TSV (R-2 = 0.70 vs. 0.41; RMSE% = 19.4 vs. 30.7%). The base metrics (i.e. ALS height and canopy cover variables) accounted for most of the variance in the ALS models with addition of further metrics providing <= 1% reduction in the RMSE%. Base metrics (i.e. InSAR observables) also accounted for most of the variation in InSAR models. Addition of metrics from a mixed Canopy Height Model (CHM), derived from InSAR Digital Surface Model (DSM) and ALS Digital Terrain Model (DTM), resulted in reductions in RMSE% of 3.1-5.4% for H, G, and TSV models with addition of textural metrics providing further reductions of 0.2-0.3% for H and G models. Addition of metrics from the radar CHM, derived from the InSAR DTM and DSM, and texture metrics reduced the RMSE% of the base model for N by 2.3% and 0.5%, respectively.   The results were generated using a SAR image pair with a height of ambiguity (HOA) that was higher than ideal, which reduced the sensitivity of results to changes in terrain.

These backscatter signals are often exploited to assess the roughness of plowed agricultural fields and water surfaces, and less so to complex, heterogeneous geological surfaces. The bedload of mixed sand- and gravel-bed rivers can be considered a mixture of smooth (compacted sand) and rough (gravel) surfaces. Here, we assess backscatter gradients over a large high-mountain alluvial river in the eastern Central Andes with aerially exposed sand and gravel bedload using X-band TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X, C-band Sentinel-1, and L-band ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 radar scenes. In a first step, we present theory and hypotheses regarding radar response to an alluvial channel bed. We test our hypotheses by comparing backscatter responses over vegetation-free endmember surfaces from inside and outside of the active channel-bed area. We then develop methods to extract smoothed backscatter gradients downstream along the channel using kernel density estimates. In a final step, the local variability of sand-dominated patches is analyzed using Fourier frequency analysis, by fitting stretched-exponential and power-law regression models to the 2-D power spectrum of backscatter amplitude. We find a large range in backscatter depending on the heterogeneity of contiguous smooth- and rough-patches of bedload material. The SAR amplitude signal responds primarily to the fraction of smooth-sand bedload, but is further modified by gravel elements. The sensitivity to gravel is more apparent in longer wavelength L-band radar, whereas C- and X-band is sensitive only to sand variability. Because the spatial extent of smooth sand patches in our study area is typically< 50 m, only higher resolution sensors (e.g., TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X) are useful for power spectrum analysis. Our results show the potential for mapping sand-gravel transitions and local geomorphic complexity in alluvial rivers with aerially exposed bedload using SAR amplitude.', '[Purinton, Benjamin; Bookhagen, Bodo] Univ Potsdam, Inst Geosci, Karl Liebknecht Str 24-25, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.', 'University of PotsdamRP Purinton, B (通讯作者)，Univ Potsdam, Inst Geosci, Karl Liebknecht Str 24-25, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.', 'purinton@uni-potsdam.de', 'Purinton, Benjamin/0000-0001-8504-8115', 'DFG funded IRTG-StRATEGy [IGK2018]; NEXUS through the MWFK Brandenburg,   Germany', 'The authors thank the DLR for TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X scenes received   through proposal XTI_GEOL6727 to B.

SDG indicator 15.1.1 proposes tracking forest area as an indicator for achieving that SDG. Though mangrove forests represent only about 5% of Belize\'s overall forest cover, the critical ecosystem services they provide are recognized in the country\'s Forests Act, which regulates the modification of mangrove ecosystems. Preceding the SDGs, from 2008 to 2009, the Government of Belize piloted a complete moratorium on mangrove removal, building on the Forests Act. As Earth Observation (EO) systems provide a means to track effectiveness of Belize\'s management of its mangrove forests, this paper examines historic and recent changes in mangrove cover across all of Belize, applying statistical adjustments to rates of change derived from Landsat satellite data. Particular attention was paid to the country\'s only World Heritage Site, the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System (BBRRS), where mangrove clearing was prohibited since the site\'s designation in December 1996. The data indicate that within the BBRRS, approximately 89 ha of mangroves were lost from 1996 to 2017, compared to the estimated loss of 2703 ha outside the BBRRS during the same period, and nationwide loss of almost 4100 ha from 1980 to 2017. Thus, compared to the mangroves outside of the BBRRS, the annual rate of mangrove loss within the BBRRS over the period 1996-2017 was merely 4.24 ha per year, versus 129.11 ha per year outside the BBRRS. Furthermore, almost 75% of the 1996-2017 mangrove loss outside the BBRRS were concentrated in three particular geographic zones associated with tourism infrastructure. It was also estimated that Belize\'s overall mangrove cover declined 5.4% over 36 years, from 76,250 ha in 1980 to 72,169 ha in 2017. In terms of its implications, in addition to contributing to SDG 15, this work also addresses SDG Target 14.2 regarding sustainable management of marine and coastal ecosystems.

Sentinel-2 allows us to investigate water resources based on both spatial and temporal high-resolution analyses. We propose a new automatic RBSP approach on the Google Earth Engine platform.

We used the proposed RBSP method to process Sentinel-2 monthly composite images covering a two-year period and generate the monthly surface water extent at the national scale, i.e., over France. Annual occurrence maps were further obtained based on the pixel frequency in monthly water maps. The monthly dynamics provided in SWDF products are evaluated by HR satellite-derived water masks at the national scale (JRC GSW monthly water history) and at local scales (over two lakes, i.e., Lake Der-Chantecoq and Lake Orient, and 200 random sampling points). The monthly trends between SWDF and GSW were similar, with a coefficient of 0.94. The confusion matrix-based metrics based on the sample points were 0.885 (producer\'s accuracy), 0.963 (user\'s accuracy), 0.932 (overall accuracy) and 0.865 (Matthews correlation coefficient). The annual surface water extents (i.e., permanent and maximum) are validated by two HR satellite image-based water maps and an official database at the national scale and small water bodies (ponds) at the local scale at Loir-et-Cher. The results show that the SWDF results are closely correlated to the previous annual water extents, with a coefficient > 0.950. The SWDF results are further validated for large rivers and lakes, with extraction rates of 0.929 and 0.802, respectively. Also, SWDF exhibits superiority to GSW in small water body extraction (taking 2498 ponds in Loir-et-Cher as example), with an extraction rate improved by approximately 20%. Thus, the SWDF method can be used to study interannual, seasonal and monthly variations in surface water systems. The monthly dynamic maps of SWDF improved the degree of land surface coverage by 25% of France on average compared with GSW, which is the only product that provides monthly dynamics. Further harmonization of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 and the introduction of enhanced cloud detection algorithm can fill some gaps of no-data regions.', '[Yang, Xiucheng; Qin, Qiming] Peking Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & Geog Informat Syst, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.

In recent decades, high spatial resolution imagery has shown considerable potential for deriving accurate land cover maps of urban environments. Applying traditional water indices directly on this type of data, however, leads to severe misclassifications as there are many materials in urban areas that are confused with water. Furthermore, threshold parameters must generally be fine-tuned to obtain optimal results. In this paper, we propose a new open surface water detection method for urbanized areas. We suggest using inequality constraints as well as physical magnitude constraints to identify water from urban scenes. Our experimental results on spectral libraries and real high spatial resolution remote sensing images demonstrate that by using a set of suggested fixed threshold values, the proposed method outperforms or obtains comparable results with algorithms based on traditional water indices that need to be fine-tuned to obtain optimal results. When applied to the ASTER and ECOSTRESS spectral libraries, our method identified 3677 out of 3695 non-water spectra. By contrast, NDWI and MNDWI only identified 2934 and 2918 spectra. Results on three real hyperspectral images demonstrated that the proposed method successfully identified normal water bodies, meso-eutrophic water bodies, and most of the muddy water bodies in the scenes with F-measure values of 0.91, 0.94 and 0.82 for the three scenes. For surface glint and hyper-eutrophic water, our method was not as effective as could be expected. We observed that the commonly used threshold value of 0 for NDWI and MNDWI results in greater levels of confusion, with F-measures of 0.83, 0.64 and 0.64 (NDWI) and 0.77, 0.63 and 0.59 (MNDWI). The proposed method also achieves higher precision than the untuned NDWI and MNDWI with the same recall values. Next to numerical performance, the proposed method is also physically justified, easy-to implement, and computationally efficient, which suggests that it has potential to be applied in large scale water detection problem.', '[Chen, Fen; Chen, Xingzhuang; Jiang, Huajun; Xu, Wenbo] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Resources & Environm, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China.

Here, we introduce a machine-learning model, the Mixture Density Network (MDN), that largely outperforms existing algorithms when applied across different bio-optical regimes in inland and coastal waters. The model is trained and validated using a sizeable database of co-located Chla measurements (n = 2943) and in situ hyperspectral radiometric data resampled to simulate the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and the Ocean and Land Color Imager (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-2A/B and Sentinel-3A/B, respectively. Our performance evaluations of the model, via two-thirds of the in situ dataset with Chla ranging from 0.2 to 1209 mg/m(3) and a mean Chla of 21.7 mg/m(3), suggest significant improvements in Chla retrievals. For both MSI and OLCI, the mean absolute logarithmic error (MAE) and logarithmic bias (Bias) across the entire range reduced by 40-60%, whereas the root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE) and the median absolute percentage error (MAPE) improved two-to-three times over those from the state-of-the-art algorithms. Using independent Chla matchups (n < 800) for Sentinel-2A/B and -3A, we show that the MDN model provides most accurate products from recorded images processed via three different atmospheric correction processors, namely the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS), POLYMER, and ACOLITE, though the model is found to be sensitive to uncertainties in remote-sensing reflectance products. This manuscript serves as a preliminary study on a machine-learning algorithm with potential utility in seamless construction of Chla data records in inland and coastal waters, i.e., harmonized, comparable products via a single algorithm for MSI and OLCI data processing. The model performance is anticipated to enhance by improving the global representativeness of the training data as well as simultaneous retrievals of multiple optically active components of the water column.', '[Pahlevan, Nima; Smith, Brandon] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.

Recently, methods for estimating the spatial distribution of AFCS using remotely sensed datasets and multiple prediction techniques have been found to be useful, particularly given the prohibitive costs of acquiring the necessary sample sizes for sufficiently precise pure field-based estimation of this variable. The objective of the study was to assess and compare the capabilities of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, L-band radar data and UltraCam images in combination with four commonly used prediction techniques for estimating mean AFCS per unit area: multiple linear regression (MLR) and the nonparametric k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest (RF) algorithms. Our study area was a part of Hyrcanian deciduous forests in two managed and unmanaged stands at Shast Kalateh forest. We used a systematic sample consisting of 308 circular field plots of 0.1 ha located at the intersections of a 150 x 200 m grid with a random starting point and remote sensing-derived metrics as auxiliary data. We used 67% of the sample plots for training purposes and the remaining 33% for validation. Also, we used the model-assisted estimators to statistically rigorously estimate mean AFCS per unit area and its standard error (SE).   Among the remotely sensed datasets, considered singly, the ALS data with R-2* = 0.34, rRMSE = 47.42% and relative efficiency (RE) = 1.51 produced the greatest accuracy and precision for AFCS estimation. RE can be interpreted as the factor by which the sample size for the pure field-based estimator would have to be increased to obtain the same precision as for the model-assisted estimator using auxiliary data. Among the remotely sensed datasets considered in combination, the ALS and PALSAR dataset with R-2* = 0.41, rRMSE = 44.80% and RE = 1.70 produced the greatest prediction accuracy and precision and increased the proportion of variability explained relative to ALS and PALSAR separately by 7% and 36%, respectively. Contrary to our expectation, the combination of PALSAR and UltraCam data decreased the precision of AFCS estimates. All the remotely sensed datasets, singly and in combination, with the most accurate prediction techniques for each combination produced estimates of AFCS that were within the 95% confidence interval for the field-based estimate.', '[Poorazimy, Maryam; Shataee, Shaban; Mohammadi, Jahangir] Gorgan Univ Agr Sci & Nat Resources, Dept Forestry, Gorgan, Golestan, Iran.

Understanding drought impacts on ecosystem functioning requires accurate quantification of vegetation sensitivity to changes in water supply condition. This is complicated by the seasonal variation in plant structural and physiological response to water stress, especially for semi-arid grasslands with characteristic strong spatial and temporal variability in carbon uptake. Here, we use complementary satellite soil moisture (SM) and total water storage (TWS) observations to delineate plant-accessible water supply variations for natural grasslands in the Missouri basin, USA. We evaluate how water supply influences the spatiotemporal variations in grassland productivity as a function of seasonal timing and climate condition. We identify a 128-day period from mid-June to early October when grassland growth is sensitive to soil moisture changes. We find the strongest SM sensitivity after the peak of the growing season associated with high temperature and VPD. SM limitation can extend to early and late growing season under warm conditions, while grassland sensitivity to SM is generally stronger in the late growth stage than in the green-up period given similar temperature and soil moisture. We find that complementary to the surface SM observations, TWS provides plant-available water storage information from the deeper soil, and both SM and TWS exert a lagged impact on grassland productivity. We find that the lag between the inter-annual variation of SM and associated plant response increases through the season, and overall there is a transition from SM-limitation to TWS-limitation on productivity during the late growing period when the TWS level is near the seasonal low. Future global change projections should account for a seasonally varying vegetation-moisture relationship to accurately assess the impact of the water supply constraint on plant productivity in a warming climate.', '[Geruo, A.; Velicogna, Isabella; Zhao, Meng] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.

Here, we propose an improved Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (QAA) (denoted as TC2) for retrieving Chla concentrations from remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) which can be applied to Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) images in turbid case-2 waters. TC2 has two main extensions when compared with QAA. First, TC2 makes an additional assumption to separate the total non-water absorption at 665 nm (a(nw)(665)) into phytoplankton absorption (a(ph)(665)) and yellow matter (a(ym)(665)), which is the sum of colored dissolved matter (CDOM) and detritus. Second, for selecting the position of the near-infrared (NIR) band which is used to estimate the signal of total backscattering coefficient (b(b)(lambda(0))) at QAA reference band (lambda(0)), we take into account the assumption that the absorption of pure water should be dominant at this band, as well as the impact of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the NIR band on the Chla concentration estimating model. When applied to in situ R-rs(lambda) and OLCI match-up R-rs(lambda) data in this study, TC2 provided more accurate Chla estimation than previous Cha concentration retrieval algorithms for turbid case-2 waters. TC2 has the potential for use as a simple and effective algorithm for monitoring Chla concentrations in the turbid case-2 waters at a global scale from space.', '[Liu, Ge; Song, Kaishan; Wen, Zhidan; Fang, Chong; Wang, Zongming; Shang, Yingxin] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agr Ecol, Changchun 130102, Jilin, Peoples R China.

Such mapping requires a range of spatial data. This paper examines the use of remote sensing and spatial ecosystem service modelling to examine nature\'s contribution to targets under SDG 6, also highlighting synergies with other key SDGs and trade-offs with agriculture.   We use a wide range of remotely sensed and globally available datasets (for land cover, climate, soil, population, agriculture) alongside the existing and widely used spatial ecosystem services assessment tool, Co$tingNature. With these we identify priority areas for sustainable management to realise targets under SDG 6 (water) at the country scale for Madagascar and at the basin scale for the Volta basin, though the application developed can be applied to any country or major basin in the world. Within this SDG 6 priority areas footprint, we assess the synergies and trade-offs provided by this land for SDG 15 (biodiversity) and SDG 13 (climate action) as well as SDG 2 (zero hunger).   Results highlight the co-benefits of sustainably managing nature\'s contribution to SDG 6, such as the protection of forest cover (for SDG target 15.2), carbon storage as a contribution to the Paris climate agreement and nationally determined contributions (SDG 13) and biodiversity (for SDG target 15.5) but also trade-offs with the zero hunger goal (for SDG 2). Such analyses allow for better understanding of land management requirements for realising multiple SDGs through protection and restoration of green infrastructure. We provide a freely available tool, within the Co$tingNature platform, based on a variety of remotely sensed products, that can be used by SDG practitioners to carry out similar analyses and inform decision-making at national or sub-national levels globally.', '[Mulligan, Mark; van Soesbergen, Arnout] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, Bush House NE 4-01,40 Aldwych, London WC2B 4BG, England.

Remote sensing with high spectral and spatial resolutions via aerial platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) provides a potential alternative technique for the monitoring of heterogeneous crops in smallholder agriculture. Although this new type of remote sensing data with high spectral and spatial resolutions provides the possibility of fine classification, it also brings some challenges, such as bands contaminated with severe noise, the nonuniform distribution of the discriminative spectral information, and the spectral variability of crops. In this study, we attempted to resolve these problems by developing a robust spectral-spatial agricultural crop mapping method based on conditional random fields (SCRF), which learns the sensitive spectral information of the crops by a spectrally weighted kernel, and uses the spatial interaction of pixels to improve the classification performance. Data from a manned aircraft platform and a UAV platform were chosen to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm can effectively use the relative utility of each spectral band to detect the bands contaminated with severe noise, and it uses the spectrally weighted kernel to consider the sensitive spectral information of the crops. The algorithm with only a spectrally weighted kernel showed an improvement of more than 4% over the classical support vector machine and random forest methods. Moreover, the spatial information was proved to be of crucial importance for crop classification, and both the object-oriented method and the proposed SCRF method can improve the classification performance in terms of both visualization and the quantitative metrics by considering the spatial information. Compared with the object-oriented method, SCRF can deliver a better classification performance, with an accuracy improvement of more than 2%.', '[Zhao, Ji] China Univ Geosci, Sch Comp Sci, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.

Despite their importance, there still lack annual maps of high-resolution Global Artificial Impervious Areas (GAIA) with longer than 30-year records, due to the high demand of high performance computation and the lack of effective mapping algorithms. In this paper, we mapped annual GAIA from 1985 to 2018 using the full archive of 30-m resolution Landsat images on the Google Earth Engine platform. With ancillary datasets, including the nighttime light data and the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data, we improved the performance of our previously developed algorithm in arid areas. We evaluated the GAIA data for 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015, and the mean overall accuracy is higher than 90%. A cross-product comparison indicates the GAIA data are the only dataset spanning over 30 years. The temporal trend in GAIA agrees well with other datasets at the local, regional, and global scales. Our results indicate that the GAIA reached 797,076 km(2) in 2018, which is 1.5 times more than that in 1990.

However, a spatial-detailed and high-precision remote sensing method for the identification of desert vegetation-habitat complexes and characterization of their biophysical processes remain scarce. Here, we developed an innovative cross-wavelet transform (XWT)-based approach coupled with logistic regression to extract critical vegetation-habitat interaction characteristics in order to identify, map, and understand their complex ecological processes. Fine intraannual profiles between the green vegetation (GV) fraction and habitat fractions including dark material (DA), saline land (SA), sand land (SL) were unmixed by Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) from 16-period Gaofen-1 (GF-1) wide field of view (WFV) images in Minqin County, after which XWT was performed to extract feedback characteristics as feature parameters. Major principal components (PCs) were obtained from those feature parameters to reduce dimensions and solve multi-collinearity, logistic regression was applied for mapping. The results demonstrate that the proposed procedure efficiently reproduced desert vegetation-habitat complexes with high accuracy (overall accuracy: 87.33%; Kappa coefficient: 0.86) in the entire Minqin County, representing a 3.42% overall accuracy increase relative to a previously published decision tree (DT) method. The new method also had a lower quantity and allocation disagreement. Moreover, this procedure not only achieved comparable accuracy to that of an optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) and superior to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based U-net model, but also explored biophysical processes and complex relationships with better interpretability. Therefore, the developed approach has the potential for accurately monitoring the highly heterogeneous dryland landscape and characterizing the land degradation processes in the spectral endmember space of fine spatial-temporal remote sensing data.', '[Sun, Qiangqiang; Zhang, Ping; Sun, Danfeng] China Agr Univ, Coll Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.

Anisotropic characteristic is a possible factor that influences the VIIRS DNB radiance at night and its time series analysis. This study aims to investigate the relationship between viewing angles and VIIRS DNB radiance of Suomi NPP satellite in urban areas. First, twenty-nine points were selected globally to explore the angle variation of Suomi NPP satellite views at night. We found that the variation of the satellite viewing zenith angle (VZA) is consistent (e.g. between 0 degrees and 70 degrees) since the range of VZA is fixed depending on the sensor design, and the range of viewing azimuth angle (VAA) increases with the increase of latitude. Second, thirty points in cities of Beijing, Houston, Los Angeles, Moscow, Quito and Sydney, were used to investigate the angle-radiance relationship. We proposed a zenith-radiance quadratic (ZRQ) model and a zenith-azimuth-radiance binary quadratic (ZARBQ) model to quantify the relationship between satellite viewing angles and artificial light radiance, which has been corrected by removing the moonlight and atmospheric impact from VIIRS DNB radiance products. For all the thirty points, the ZRQ and ZARBQ analysis have averaged R2 of 0.50 and 0.53, respectively, which indicates that the viewing angles are important factors influencing the variation of the artificial light radiance, but extending zenith to zenith-azimuth does not much better explain the variation of the observed artificial light. Importantly, based on the data analysis, we can make the hypothesis that building height may affect the relationship between VZA and artificial light, and cold and hot spot effects are clearly found in tall building areas. These findings are potentially useful to reconstruct more stable time series VIIRS DNB images for socioeconomic applications by removing the angular effects.', '[Li, Xi; Ma, Ruiqi; Li, Deren; Liu, Shanshan; Zhao, Lixian] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.

Mainly, satellite optical vegetation indices and LiDAR data have been used to this purpose. These two techniques are limited by cloud cover and are sensitive only to the top of vegetation. In addition, the vegetation attenuation to the soil microwave emission, represented by the vegetation optical depth (VOD), has been applied for biomass estimation using frequencies ranging from 4 to 30 GHz (C- to K-bands). Atmosphere is transparent to microwaves and their sensitivity to canopy layers depends on the frequency, with lower frequencies having greater penetration depths. In this regard, L-band VOD (1.4 GHz) is expected to enhance the ability to estimate carbon stocks. This study compares the sensitivity of different VOD products (from L, C, and X-bands) and an optical vegetation index (EVI) to the above-ground carbon density (ACD). It quantifies the contribution of ACD and forest cover proportion to the VOD/EVI signals. The study is conducted in Peru, southern Colombia and Panama, where ACD maps have been derived from airborne LiDAR. Results confirm the enhanced sensitivity of L-band VOD to ACD when compared to higher frequency bands, and show that the sensitivity of all VOD bands decreases in the densest forests. ACD explains 34% and forest cover 30% of L-band VOD variance, and these proportions gradually decrease for EVI, C-, and X-band VOD, respectively. Results are consistent through different categories of altitude and carbon density. This pattern is found in most of the studied regions and in flooded forests. Results also show that C-, X-band VOD and EVI provide complementary information to L-band VOD, especially in flooded forests and in mountains, indicating that synergistic approaches could lead to improved retrievals in these regions. Although the assessment of vegetation carbon in the densest forests requires further research, results from this study support the use of new L-band VOD estimates for mapping the carbon of tropical forests.', '[Chaparro, David; Vall-Llossera, Merce; Camps, Adriano] Univ Politecn Cataluna, CornmSensLab, Jordi Girona 1-3, E-08034 Barcelona, Spain.

To correctly focus FMCW SAR images, it is necessary to accurately know some system parameters, including the frequency sweep rate of the signal transmitted by the radar. It may happen, however, that this frequency sweep rate is not very accurately measured by the radar provider, and thus an incorrect value of this parameter is used during the SAR data focusing procedure. This may produce serious geometric distortion effects in the focused FMCW SAR images. To circumvent these problems, in this work we present a procedure that estimates the frequency sweep rate actually employed by the FMCW radar, thus providing a key information that can be then profitably used to achieve the correct focusing of the SAR data acquired by the radar system at hand. More specifically, we propose an algorithm that exploits on one side the focused SAR images corrupted by the geometric distortion effects induced by the inaccurate knowledge of this radar parameter, and on the other side the very precise in-situ measurements of the positions of a limited number of Corner Reflectors (CRs) properly deployed over the observed scene.

Tundra fires exert considerable influence on local ecosystem functioning and contribute to climate change through biogeochemical (e.g. carbon cycle) and biogeophysical (e.g. albedo) effects. These treeless landscapes are characterized by a high degree of variation in fuel loading at scales much finer than moderate (30 m) satellite observations. However, because of the remoteness of the tundra and its lower contribution to carbon release compared to boreal forests, most frequently tundra fuels are poorly characterized, limiting the effective development of tundra-specific fire occurrence and behavior models. This study presents an approach to mapping the fractional coverages of major fuel type components in Alaskan tundra circa 2015 combining field data and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager observations. We adopt a multi-step Random Forest method to estimate the fractional vegetation cover of woody, herbaceous, and nonvascular components at subpixel level. We demonstrate the strong capability of exploiting multi-seasonal spectral information to identify these component types, with R-squared values around 0.95 and root mean squared errors below 10% for predicting their fractional cover. Our mapping products depict the spatial distribution of woody, herbaceous, and nonvascular components at subpixel resolution across Alaskan tundra, which can function as a critical input for studying wildland fire risk and behavior in the tundra. The distributions of these fuel components align well with climate-based tundra ecoregions although climate variables are not included in our models.', '[He, Jiaying; Loboda, Tatiana V.; Chen, Dong] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

A novel method is proposed to estimate the temporal change in water levels and water volumes for lakes with only remotely sensed data. First, the surface profiles, including the ground and the underwater bottom, were extracted from the MABEL (Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar) photon-counting lidar raw data via a new surface detecting algorithm. Second, the lake boundaries between land and water in different years were identified using a thresholding method based on the annual median Landsat composite. Third, water levels were calculated by matching the lidar surface profiles with the lake boundaries based on the nearby georeferenced coordinates. Finally, the water volumes in different years were estimated via the contours (i.e., lake boundaries) with different elevations. Lake Mead was selected as the study area, which is the largest reservoir in the United States in terms of water capacity. With only one day measuring lidar points in February 2012 and over 20 years of Landsat images (from 1987 to 2007), the water levels and water volumes in different years were estimated and compared with the in-situ data. Our results performed well in accordance with the in-situ measurements; the R-square of the water levels and water volumes were both over 0.99; the RMSE of the interannual variations of water levels and water volumes were 0.96 m and 0.31 km(3), respectively. The MABEL was used as a technology demonstrator for the satellite photon-counting laser altimeter and had similar data to the ICESat-2 dataset. Future ICESat-2 datasets will broaden this method to estimate water volumes for remote lakes from the 1980s, where no in-situ data are available (such as the Tibetan Plateau and polar regions with thousands of remote and wild lakes), which could not be achieved in previous studies.', '[Ma, Yue; Xu, Nan; Li, Song] Wuhan Univ, Sch Elect Informat, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.

Various ground-based methods exist to measure intercepted snow load, however all are based on single-tree measurements and are difficult to implement. No research has focussed on detecting large areal intercepted snow loads and no studies have assessed the use of satellite observations. In this study, four remote sensing indices (NDSI, NDVI, albedo, and land surface temperature (LST)) were retrieved from Landsat images to study their sensitivity to canopy intercepted snow and the possibility of using them to detect the presence of intercepted snow. The results indicate that presence of intercepted snow on canopy increased NDSI and albedo, but decreased NDVI. Intercepted snow presence also decreased the areal variability of NDSI and NDVI while increasing that of albedo. For these three indices, the differences between snow-free and snowcovered canopies were correlated to topography and forest canopy cover. Of these indices, NDSI changed the greatest. Intercepted snow noticeably decreased the LST difference between forest and open areas in springtime while the influence in wintertime was relatively smaller. An intercepted snow detection approach that uses both NDSI and NDVI to classify pixels into either snowcovered canopy or other (snow-free canopy and non-forest areas) is proposed here. A case study applying this approach compared remote sensing detection to simulations by the snow interception and sublimation model implemented in the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform (CRHM). This used local meteorological observations from the pine, spruce and fir forest covered Marmot Creek Research Basin in the Canadian Rockies. The remote sensing detection of intercepted snow agreed well with CRHM simulations for continuous forests (83%) and less well for sparse forests (72%) and clearings with small trees (70%). Therefore, the approach is suitable for intercepted snow detection over continuous evergreen canopies.

The earliest developers of land-cover maps recognized the importance of evaluating the quality of their maps, and the methods and reporting format of these early accuracy assessments included features that would be familiar to practitioners today. Specifically, practitioners have consistently recognized the importance of obtaining high quality reference data to which the map is compared, the need for sampling to collect these reference data, and the role of an error matrix and accuracy measures derived from the error matrix to summarize the accuracy information. Over the past half century these techniques have undergone refinements to place accuracy assessment on a more scientifically credible footing. We describe the current status of accuracy assessment that has emerged from nearly 50 years of practice and identify opportunities for future advances. The article is organized by the three major components of accuracy assessment, the sampling design, response design, and analysis, focusing on good practice methodology that contributes to a rigorous, informative, and honest assessment. The long history of research and applications underlying the current practice of accuracy assessment has advanced the field to a mature state.

Solar radiation over complex terrain has large spatial and temporal variation because of terrain shading and high cloud heterogeneity. While most existing GIS-based solar radiation models only work under clear sky condition, this research presents a solar radiation model which considers both terrain shading and anisotropic cloud attenuation and diffuse radiation using MODIS atmospheric products. Specifically, we use skyshed map, sky cloud maps, and sky weight map to represent angular distribution of sky obstruction, anisotropic cloud properties, and diffuse radiance over hemispherical sky, respectively. Combining skyshed map, sky weight map and sky cloud maps, we develop a solar radiation model where 3D geometrical relationships among sun, cloud, and terrain are considered and anisotropic diffuse radiance and cloud attenuation are modeled. Model results are evaluated using field observations in the Kunlun Mountains of western China. At Terra and Aqua overpass time, our model performs well with a mean relative bias (MRB) of -0.2%. It underestimates in clear and partly cloudy sky with a MRB of -5.86% and -4.79% and has a mean absolute relative bias (MARB) of 8.11% and 21.59% respectively. It overestimates under overcast sky with a MRB of 1.68% and has a MARB of 31.71%. Our model performs better when compared with existing instantaneous solar radiation products. For daily solar radiation, our model shows good performance with a MRB of 1.43% and MARB of 17.02%.

In particular, disaster related applications (e.g., flood monitoring or rapid damage mapping), which are highly time- and data-critical, require methods that produce accurate cloud and cloud shadow masks in short time while being able to adapt to large variations in the target domain (induced by atmospheric conditions, different sensors, scene properties, etc.). In this study, we propose a data-driven approach to semantic segmentation of cloud and cloud shadow in single date images based on a modified U-Net convolutional neural network that aims to fulfil these requirements. We train the network on a global database of Landsat OLI images for the segmentation of five classes (\"shadow\", \"cloud\", \"water\", \"land\" and \"snow/ice\"). We compare the results to state-of-the-art methods, proof the model\'s generalization ability across multiple satellite sensors (Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+, Landsat OLI and Sentinel-2) and show the influence of different training strategies and spectral band combinations on the performance of the segmentation. Our method consistently outperforms Fmask and a traditional Random Forest classifier on a globally distributed multi-sensor test dataset in terms of accuracy, Cohen\'s Kappa coefficient, Dice coefficient and inference speed. The results indicate that a reduced feature space composed solely of red, green, blue and near-infrared bands already produces good results for all tested sensors. If available, adding shortwave-infrared bands can increase the accuracy. Contrast and brightness augmentations of the training data further improve the segmentation performance. The best performing U-Net model achieves an accuracy of 0.89, Kappa of 0.82 and Dice coefficient of 0.85, while running the inference over 896 test image tiles with 44.8 s/megapixel (2.8 s/megapixel on GPU). The Random Forest classifier reaches an accuracy of 0.79, Kappa of 0.65 and Dice coefficient of 0.74 with 3.9 s/megapixel inference time (on CPU) on the same training and testing data.

However, it is not clear which is the optimal (e.g. coarsest possible) spatial resolution to capture those fluxes accurately. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) can address this by collecting very high spatial resolution ( < 1 m, VHR) imagery. The objective of this study is to model ET and GPP dynamics using VHR optical and thermal imagery and quantify the influence of the spatial heterogeneity in the flux simulations and validations. The study was conducted at a deciduous willow bioenergy eddy covariance (EC) flux site in Denmark. Flight campaigns were conducted during the growing seasons of 2016 and 2017 with a hexacopter equipped with RGB, multispectral and thermal infrared cameras. A \'top-down\' modeling approach consisting of the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory model and a light use efficiency model sharing the same canopy biophysical constraints was used to estimate ET and GPP. Model outputs were benchmarked by EC flux observations with the source weighted footprint. Our results indicate that our model can well estimate the instantaneous net radiation, ET, GPP, evaporative fraction, light use efficiency and water use efficiency with root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) of 31.6 W.m(-2), 41.2 W.m(-2), 3.12 mu mol.C.m(-2).s(-1), 0.08, 0.16 g.C.MJ(-1) and 0.35 g.C.kg(-1), respectively. Further, it is found that using a footprint model to sample different areas of VHR imagery can be a tool to provide better diurnal estimates to benchmark with EC data. Moreover, these VHR maps (0.3 m) allowed us to quantify metrics of spatial heterogeneity by using semivariogram analysis and by aggregating model inputs into different spatial resolutions. For instance, we find that in this site, the aggregation of simulated GPP using the source weighted mean of the EC footprint was about 30% lower in RMSD than using the arithmetic mean of the footprint. This demonstrates the accuracy of the modeled VHR spatial patterns. Nevertheless, we also find that imagery resolution consistent with the canopy size (around 1.5 m in our study) is sufficient to capture the spatial heterogeneity of the fluxes as transpiration and canopy assimilation of CO2 are processes regulated at the tree crown level. Our results highlight the importance of considering the land surface heterogeneity for flux modeling and the source contribution within the EC footprint for model benchmarking at appropriate spatial resolutions.', '[Wang, Sheng; Garcia, Monica; Bauer-Gottwein, Peter; Bandini, Filippo; Paz, Veronica Sobejano; Ibrom, Andreas] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.

Data assimilation (DA) aims at optimally combining these data sources through statistical merging. To properly parameterize such merging, one needs to obtain accurate knowledge of model and observation uncertainties, which is the crux of a successful DA system. In this paper, we propose a new Monte Carlo based adaptive Kalman filtering framework (MadKF) that estimates model and observation uncertainties (Q and R) and updates soil moisture forecasts simultaneously. Spatially distributed uncertainties are estimated by applying triple collocation analysis (TCA) to Monte Carlo simulations of the model open-loop, the model analysis, and the observation time series at each grid cell. Error cross-covariances, which are inevitable between these time series, are diagnosed from their ensembles and used to iteratively correct biases they cause in Q and R estimates, and hence, in the Kalman filter gain. The proposed MadKF is tested in a synthetic environment and by assimilating real satellite soil moisture retrievals from the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) into the Antecedent Precipitation Index (API) model forced with daily aggregated satellite precipitation. Synthetic experiments indicate a good convergence of Q and R estimates. Internal DA diagnostics, i.e., the innovation auto-correlation (IAC) and the variance of the normalized innovations, asymptotically converge to their desired values, which indicates that the filter is operating near its optimum and reliably estimates analysis uncertainty. Real-data experiments assimilating ASCAT observations into the API model further indicate that the MadKF is robust against observation error auto-correlations, which typically cause problems in conventional IAC-tuning based adaptive filtering approaches. A performance evaluation over 264 in situ sites within the contiguous United States shows that the MadKF leads to a significant skill gain in surface soil moisture estimation.

Key contributions of urban remote sensing include but are not limited to characterization of urban areas, urban land cover changes and thermal remote sensing of urban climates. Today, the proliferation of new sensors, long time series of the satellite record, joint analysis of Earth observation data with ancillary data sets, widespread availability of high-performance computing facilities, and slow but increasing use of remote sensing data and methods in non-remote sensing fields together offer new opportunities to generate scientific knowledge for an urbanizing planet. Simultaneously, the scale and pace of contemporary urbanization require new information about urban areas from both the science and policy communities. This paper examines remote sensing contributions to the scientific understanding of urban areas over the last 50 years until today. Based on this assessment and current needs by user communities, we identify four strategic directions for future urban remote sensing research: high temporal frequency analysis, characterization of urban heterogeneity, characterization of urban form and structure in two and three dimensions, and linking remote sensing with emerging urban data. Advances in these four areas are likely to generate significant new insights that will be useful to both science and policy.', '[Zhu, Zhe] Univ Connecticut, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.

It takes measurements at a temporal resolution of 10 min for full disk view. Although designed as a meteorological satellite, the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard H8 has three visible (460, 510 and 640 nm), one near infrared (860 nm) and two shortwave infrared bands (1610 and 2257 nm) to observe the Earth system. In this study, the Floating Algae Index (FAI) developed for ocean color satellites (Hu, 2009) is adapted to process AHI data for the first time and applied for waters of Lake Taihu, China. For a total of 18 near-cloud-free images, a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.92 was obtained between the algae area derived from AHI FAI and that from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) FAI, and the mean percentage difference is similar to 5% in algae coverage. More concurrent images (n = 80) were collected for a comparison between AHI and Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), as GOCI is also a geostationary satellite, resulting in a correlation coefficient of 0.91 and percentage deviation of similar to 8% in observed algae coverage. These results indicate that H8/AHI can obtain reliable observations of floating algae at ultrahigh temporal resolutions (10 min). Especially, such ultrahigh-frequency measurements show that part of Lake Taihu (e.g., Meiliang Bay) experienced more frequent events of floating algae (mostly > 60%) than that observed by GOCI (generally < 40%).

We find vast areas outside of designated flood hazard zones are overwhelmed. Furthermore, we map pre-cyclone land subsidence using multitemporal interferometric processing of large SAR datasets acquired by Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) and Sentinel-1A/B satellites. We find that subsidence of up to 49 mm/yr and 34 mm/yr during the ALOS (Jul-2007-Jan-2011) and Sentinel-1A/B (Dec-2015 to Aug-2017) acquisition periods affect various parts of Houston-Galveston area.

On the one hand, the number of space-borne scatterometers is increasing in recent years. On the other hand, the homogenization of wind products from different scatterometers and producers remains a challenge, which potentially prevents the beneficial use of multiple scatterometers for numerical weather prediction, studying air-sea interactions or monitoring and forecasting the ocean. In this study, the inconsistencies in scatterometer wind products are analyzed and differences are attributed to the different aspects of scatterometer wind measurements and processing in order to guide further research towards consistent scatterometer wind products. More in particular, the collocated C-band MetOp/ASCAT and Ku-band SCATSAT-1/OSCAT-2 data allow a unique opportunity for close and abundant global collocations of different scatterometer wind products. The Ku-band wind data are independently produced by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The comparison shows that the KNMI OSCAT-2 wind product rejects more \"poor\" quality data than the JPL wind product, while both quality control (QC) schemes have merits and may be combined in a future development. Furthermore, the JPL OSCAT-2 wind speeds differ generally more from the ASCAT winds than the KNMI OSCAT-2 winds, especially for wind speeds above 17 m/s. It is confirmed that the wind speed differences between C- and Ku-band scatterometers are mainly caused by the effect of Sea Surface Temperature (SST). While the wind direction characteristics of the OSCAT-2 wind products are closely related to the inversion algorithms used, the geophysical model function (GMF) used in the wind inversion is the dominant factor for the remarkable differences between OSCAT-2 wind speeds produced by KNMI and JPL. The error characteristics and inconsistencies of ASCAT and OSCAT-2 wind products presented in this manuscript provide guidance for data users and will promote further improvements in the consistency of scatterometer wind products.', '[Wang, Zhixiong; Zhang, Biao; He, Yijun; Lin, Wenming; Li, Xiuzhong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

Existing remote sensing-based methods to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP), which is an important variable to indicate crop photosynthetic function and stress, typically rely on empirical or semi-empirical approaches, which tend to over-simplify photosynthetic mechanisms. In this work, we take advantage of all parallel developments in mechanistic photosynthesis modeling and satellite data availability for an advanced monitoring of crop productivity. In particular, we combine process-based modeling with the soil-canopy energy balance radiative transfer model (SCOPE) with Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 optical remote sensing data and machine learning methods in order to estimate crop GPP. With this approach, we by-pass the need for an intermediate step to retrieve the set of vegetation biophysical parameters needed to accurately model photosynthesis, while still accounting for the complex processes of the original physically-based model. Several implementations of the machine learning models are tested and validated using simulated and flux tower-based GPP data. Our final neural network model is able to estimate GPP at the tested flux tower sites with r(2) of 0.92 and RMSE of 1.38 gC d(-1) m(-2), which outperforms empirical models based on vegetation indices. The first test of applicability of this model to Landsat 8 data showed good results (r(2) of 0.82 and RMSE of 1.97 gC d(-1) m(-2)), which suggests that our approach can be further applied to other sensors. Modeling and testing is restricted to C3 crops in this study, but can be extended to C4 crops by producing a new training dataset with SCOPE that accounts for the different photosynthetic pathways. Our model successfully estimates GPP across a variety of C3 crop types and environmental conditions even though it does not use any local information from the corresponding sites. This highlights its potential to map crop productivity from new satellite sensors at a global scale with the help of current Earth observation cloud computing platforms.', '[Wolanin, Aleksandra; Guanter, Luis] Helmholtz Ctr, GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Remote Sensing 1 4, Potsdam, Germany.

Using MERRA-2 upper-air pressure, temperature, and humidity profiles, rather than the currently used NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS) real-time data, as input into the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM), reduces the global clear-sky observation-minus-model (O-M) BT biases in the infrared bands centered at 3.7, 8.6, 11, and 12 mu m of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite onboard Suomi-NPP. The improvements are largely due to more accurate water vapor (total amount and/or vertical distribution) at low latitudes in MERRA-2, which brings the modeled BTs closer to observations. Additional stand-alone simulations, performed using R\'FTOV model and MERRA-2 aerosol profiles, further reduce the ACSPO global O-M BT biases and the dependence of O-M BT biases on the dust aerosol optical depth. The potential skill of MERRA-2 aerosol reanalysis for reducing dust-caused regional biases in the ACSPO global regression SST product is also demonstrated.

They are located in a region underlain by the Salado Formation on the eastern edge of the Delaware Basin. The sinkhole collapses were associated with intense hydrocarbon drilling and production activities in the Hendrick oilfield. Production records and prior investigations imply the sinkholes developed after salt dissolution due to freshwater intrusion, cavity formation, roof failure, and successive upward cavity migration. High-resolution (1 m) aerial photography shows the ensuing expansion of Wink Sink #2 from 2002 through 2010 and relative stability of the ground surface after 2010. Very high-resolution (25 cm) staring spotlight mode TerraSAR-X reveals the spatiotemporal details of Wink sinkhole deformations. The vicinities around the two existing sinkholes (Wink Sinks #1, #2) deformed at a rate of 5 cm/yr in line-of-sight (LOS) direction from October 2015 to March 2016, and the deformation was possibly caused by the gradual deposit of the debris from overlying unconsolidated Alluvium and Santa Rosa sandstones infilling the cavity after the sinkhole collapse. Specifically, the largest deformation of 53 cm/yr in LOS direction was found 1 km east of Wink Sink #2. Our study suggests that severe drought in 2011 widened and created fractures as well as ground fissures in the rocks overlying and underlying the salt formation due to the increased effective stress. Fractures, ground fissures, and the abandoned unplugged boreholes or improperly completed wells opened one or more vertical pathways of freshwater from groundwater flow and precipitation toward the salt bed, finally causing the rapid salt dissolution and the opening of new cavities. To explain the onset of a rapid subsidence near the Wink sinkholes, our study considers the combined effect of natural perturbation (i.e., drought, rock fractures, ground fissures, subsurface drainage, precipitation) and anthropogenic effects (i.e., improper well control).

This simple physical concept is at the base of a novel technique presented in this study. We invert observations obtained by the airborne Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) in the sunglint region, where each pixel\'s radiance is dominated by the signal originating from the wave slopes oriented precisely to cause specular reflection. The SWIR wavelength ensures minimization of aerosol interference when radiance travels through the atmosphere; strong absorption by the water body then limits the penetration depth to the first micrometer or so, effectively probing the SML. The resulting Degree of Linear Polarization (DoLP) is then governed by the refractive index via the Fresnel law for the specific pixel geometry, independently of the windspeed. The selected dataset concerns several field deployments from both low- and high-altitude aircraft, including total reflectance measurements with the sole purpose of accounting for the residual aerosol effect. Stable retrievals from transects above pure seawater yielded values of refractive index that match the values published in the literature within an accuracy of 5 x 10(-4).

There is a vast amount of research using remote sensing (RS) techniques for the assessment of the current condition of a forest, but only a small number of these are concerned with detection and classification of dead trees. Among the available RS techniques, only the airborne laser scanner (ALS) enables dead tree detection at the single tree level with high accuracy.   The main objective of the study was to identify spruce, pine and deciduous trees by alive or dead classifications. Three RS data sets including ALS (leaf-on and leaf-off) and color-infrared (CIR) imagery (leaf-on) were used for the study. We used intensity and structural variables from the ALS data and spectral information derived from aerial imagery for the classification procedure. Additionally, we tested the differences in the classification accuracy of all variants contained in the data integration. In the study, the random forest (RF) classifier was used. The study was carried out in the Polish part of the Bialowieia Forest (BF).   In general, we can state that all classifications, with different combinations of ALS features and CIR, resulted in high overall accuracy (OA >= 90%) and Kappa (kappa > 0.86). For the best variant (CIR_ALS(WSn-FH)), the mean values of overall accuracy and Kappa were equal to 94.3% and 0.93, respectively. The leaf -on point cloud features alone produced the lowest accuracies (OA = 75-81% and x = 0.68-0.76). Improvements of 0-0.04 in the Kappa coefficient and 0-3.1% in the overall classification accuracy were found after the point cloud normalization for all variants. Full -height point cloud features (F) produced lower accuracies than the results based on features calculated for half of the tree height point clouds (H) and combined FH.   The importance of each of the predictors for different data sets for tree species classification provided by the RF algorithm was investigated. The lists of top features were the same, independent of intensity normalization. For the classification based on both of the point clouds (leaf on and leaf-off), three structural features (a proportion of first returns for both half -height and full -height variants and the canopy relief ratio of points) and two intensity features from first returns and half -height variant (the coefficient of variation and skewness) were rated as the most important. In the classification based on the point cloud with CIR features, two image features were among the most important (the NDVI and mean value of reflectance in the green band).', '[Kaminska, Agnieszka; Lisiewicz, Maciej; Sterenczak, Krzysztof; Kraszewski, Bartlomiej; Sadkowski, Rafal] Forest Res Inst, Lab Geomat, 3 Braci Lesnej St, PL-05090 Raszyn, Poland.', 'Forest Research InstituteRP Sterenczak, K (通讯作者)，Forest Res Inst, Lab Geomat, 3 Braci Lesnej St, PL-05090 Raszyn, Poland.', 'k.sterenczak@ibles.waw.plRI Kamińska, Agnieszka/R-3333-2018; Lisiewicz, Maciej/Y-3668-2018;   Kraszewski, Bartłomiej/U-9482-2017; Lisiewicz, Maciej/AAE-3930-2022;   Sadkowski, Rafal/U-4203-2018', 'Kamińska, Agnieszka/0000-0003-2190-3789; Lisiewicz,   Maciej/0000-0003-0676-8291; Kraszewski, Bartłomiej/0000-0001-6161-7619;   Lisiewicz, Maciej/0000-0003-0676-8291; Sterenczak,   Krzysztof/0000-0002-9556-0144; Sadkowski, Rafal/0000-0002-4182-9777;   Sadkowski, Rafal/0000-0001-5386-8266', 'project \"LIFE + ForBioSensing PL Comprehensive monitoring of stand   dynamics in Bialowieia Forest supported with remote sensing techniques\"   - EU Life Plus programme [LIFE13 ENV/PL/000048]; National Fund for   Environmental Protection and Water Management in Poland   [485/2014/WN10/OP-NM-LF/D]', 'This work was financially supported by the project \"LIFE + ForBioSensing   PL Comprehensive monitoring of stand dynamics in Bialowieia Forest   supported with remote sensing techniques\" which is co-funded by the EU   Life Plus programme (contract number LIFE13 ENV/PL/000048) and The   National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management in   Poland (contract number 485/2014/WN10/OP-NM-LF/D).', 61, 38, 39, 3, 60, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

This algorithm uses a scene-based processing and sliding window technique to derive MUX surface reflectance (SR) at continental scale. Unlike other optical sensors, MUX instrument imposes constraints for atmospheric correction due to the absence of spectral bands for aerosol estimation from imagery itself. To overcome this limitation, the proposed algorithm performs a further processing of atmospheric products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors as input parameters for radiative transfer calculations. The success of CMPAC algorithm was fully assessed and confirmed by comparison of MUX SR data with the Landsat-8 OLI Level-2 and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET)-derived SR products. The spectral adjustment was performed to compensate for the differences of relative spectral response between MUX and OLI sensors. The results show that MUX SR values are fairly similar to operational Landsat-8 SR products (mean difference < 0.0062, expressed in reflectance). There is a slight underestimation of MUX SR compared to OLI product (except the NIR band), but the error metrics are typically low and scattered points are around the line 1:1. These results suggest the potential of combining these datasets (MUX and OLI) for quantitative studies. Further, the robust agreement of MUX and AERONET-derived SR values emphasizes the quality of moderate atmospheric products as input parameters in this application, with root-mean-square deviation lower than 0.0047. These findings confirm that (i) CMPAC is a suitable tool for estimating surface reflectance of CBERS MUX data, and (ii) ancillary products support the application of atmospheric correction by filling the gap of atmospheric information. The uncertainties of atmospheric products, negligence of the bidirectional effects, and two aerosol models were also identified as a limitation. Finally, this study presents a framework basis for atmospheric correction of CBERS-4 MUX images. The utility of CBERS data comes from its use, and this new product enables the quantitative remote sensing for land monitoring and environmental assessment at 20 m spatial resolution.', '[Martins, Vitor S.; Kaleita, Amy] Iowa State Univ, Agr & Biosyst Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA.

However, collecting wall-towall laser altimetry data at regional and global scales is cost prohibitive. As a result, studies employing lidar for large area estimation typically collect data via strip sampling, leaving large swaths of the forest unmeasured by the instrument. The goal of this research was to develop and examine the performance of a coregionalization modeling approach for combining field measurements, strip samples of airborne lidar and Landsat-based remote sensing products to predict aboveground biomass (AGB) in interior Alaska\'s Tanana Valley. The proposed modeling strategy facilitates mapping of AGB density across the domain. Additionally, the coregionalization framework allows for estimation of total AGB for arbitrary areal units within the study area a key advance to support diverse management objectives in interior Alaska. This research focuses on characterization of prediction uncertainty in the form of posterior predictive coverage intervals and standard deviations. Using the framework detailed here, it is possible to quantify estimation uncertainty for any spatial extent, ranging from point level predictions of AGB density to estimates of AGB stocks for the full domain. The lidar-informed coregionalization models consistently outperformed their counterpart lidar-free models in terms of point-level predictive performance and total (mean) AGB precision. Additionally, including a Landsat-derived forest cover covariate further improved precision in regions with lower lidar sampling intensity. Findings also demonstrate that model-based approaches not explicitly accounting for residual spatial dependence can grossly underestimate uncertainty, resulting in falsely precise estimates of AGB. The inferential capabilities of AGB posterior predictive distribution (PPD) products extend beyond simply mapping AGB density. We show how PPD products can provide insight regarding drivers of AGB heterogeneity in boreal forests, including permafrost and fire, highlighting the range of potential applications for Bayesian geostatistical methods to integrate field, airborne and satellite data.', '[Babcock, Chad] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.

Many observations show that their kinematics is driven by climatic forcings and earthquakes. In this study, we document the complex interaction between those two forcings on the slow-moving landslide kinematics, based on the retrieval of landslide displacements over 28-years using optical satellite images. To overcome the decorrelation effect over this large time-span, and possible misalignment between images, we develop a method that uses the redundancy of displacement fields from image pairs to derive a robust time-series of displacement. The method is tested on the 28-year long SPOT1/5-Pleiades archive, over an area in Peru affected by both earthquakes and rainfall. Errors are estimated on stable areas and by comparison with one 13-year long and eleven 3-year long GPS time-series on the Maca landslide. The methodology diminishes by up to 30% the uncertainty and reduces significantly the gaps due to decorrelation. The data set allows detecting 3 major landslides, moving at a rate of 35 to 50 m over 28 years, and smaller landslides with lower displacement rates. Time-series obtained over the three main landslides provide interesting results of their long-term kinematics, primarily driven by precipitation. We propose simple statistical hydro-kinematic models, relating yearly motion to seasonal rainfall, to explain the observed time-series. We found that annual precipitation is controlling the landslide displacements after a certain rainfall threshold is reached. Besides this control, we show the possible impact of a local Mw 5.4 earthquake in 1991 on the kinematics of the Maca landslide. Our results suggest that the earthquake accelerated the landslide and has an effect during several years on the precipitation threshold required for triggering a motion. These results suggest that the rainfall threshold can vary in time following strong earthquakes shaking.', '[Bontemps, Noelie; Lacroix, Pascal; Doin, Marie-Pierre] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, IRD, IFSTTAR,ISTerre, F-38000 Grenoble, France.', 'Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA);   Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de   Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Gustave-Eiffel;   Universite de SavoieRP Bontemps, N (通讯作者)，Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, IRD, IFSTTAR,ISTerre, F-38000 Grenoble, France.', 'noelie.bontemps@univ-grenoble-alpes.frRI Lacroix, Pascal/HSG-9318-2023', 'Lacroix, Pascal/0000-0003-1282-9572; Doin,   Marie-Pierre/0000-0002-9546-4005', 'french spatial Agency (CNES); ESA through the Alcantara project   \"Monitoring and Detection of Landslides from optical Images time-451   Series\" [ESA 15/P26]; Labex OSUGC (Investissements d\'avenir) [ANR10   LABX56]', 'Authors acknowledge the support of the french spatial Agency (CNES).

By establishing a methodology to accurately and efficiently quantify SDT structural loss over time, these estimated structural loss rates would improve the performance of a variety of models and potentially provide new insight as to the manner in which SDTs undergo degradation in various conditions. The specific objective of this study were: 1) utilize the TreeVoIX algorithm to estimate the volume of 29 SDTs scanned with terrestrial lidar; 2) develop a novel, voxel-based change detection algorithm capable of providing automated structural loss estimates with multitemporal terrestrial lidar observations; and 3) estimate and characterize the structural loss rates of Pinus taeda and Quercus stellata in southeastern Texas.   A voxel-based change detection methodology was developed to accurately detect and quantify structural losses and incorporated several methods to mitigate the challenges presented by shifting tree and branch positions as SDT decay progresses. The volume and structural loss of 29 SDTs, composed of Pinus taeda and Quercus stellata, were successfully estimated using multitemporal terrestrial lidar observations over elapsed times ranging from 71 to 753 days. Pine and oak structural loss rates were characterized by estimating the amount of volumetric loss occurring in 20 equal-interval height bins of each SDT.

However, the spatial scale-mismatch issue between site and satellite observations hampers the use of such invaluable ground measurements in validation practice. Here, we propose an approach (Grading and Upscaling of Ground Measurements, GUGM) that integrates a spatial representativeness grading criterion and a spatial upscaling strategy to resolve this scale-mismatch issue and maximize the utility of time-series of site-based LAI measurements. The performance of GUGM was carefully evaluated by comparing this method to both benchmark LAI and other widely used conventional approaches. The uncertainty of three global LAI products (i.e. MODIS, GLASS and GEOV1) was also assessed based on the LAI time-series validation dataset derived from GUGM. Considering all the evaluation results together, this study suggests that the proposed GUGM approach can significantly reduce the uncertainty from spatial scale mismatch and increase the size of the available validation dataset. In particular, the proposed approach outperformed other widely used approaches in these two respects. Furthermore, GUGM was successfully implemented to validate global LAI products in various ways with advantaging frequent time-series validation dataset. The validation results of the global LAI products show that GLASS has the lowest uncertainty, followed by GEOV1 and MODIS for the overall biome types. However, MODIS provides more consistent uncertainties across different years than GLASS and GEOV1. We believe that GUGM enables us to better understand the structure of LAI product uncertainties and their evolution across seasonal or annual contexts. In turn, this method can provide fundamental information for further LAI algorithm improvements and the broad application of LAI product time-series.', '[Xu, Baodong; Li, Jing; Liu, Qinhuo; Zeng, Yelu; Zhao, Jing; Yang, Le] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

Much of the innovation has been focused on use of sophisticated workflows that consist of a logical sequence of processes and rules, multiple statistical functions, and parameter sets that must be calibrated to accurately classify disturbance. For many algorithms, calibration has been local to areas of interest and the algorithm\'s classification performance has been good under those circumstances. When applied elsewhere, however, algorithm performance has suffered. An alternative strategy for calibration may be to use the locally tested parameter values in conjunction with a statistical approach (e.g., Random Forests; RF) to align algorithm classification with a reference disturbance dataset, a process we call secondary classification. We tested that strategy here using RF with LandTrendr, an algorithm that runs on one spectral band or index. Disturbance detection using secondary classification was spectral band- or index-dependent, with each spectral dimension providing some unique detections and different error rates. Using secondary classification, we tested whether an integrated multispectral LandTrendr ensemble, with various combinations of the six basic Landsat reflectance bands and seven common spectral indices, improves algorithm performance. Results indicated a substantial reduction in errors relative to secondary classification based on single bands/indices, revealing the importance of a multispectral approach to forest disturbance detection. To explain the importance of specific bands and spectral indices in the multispectral ensemble, we developed a disturbance signal-to-noise metric that clearly highlighted the value of shortwave infrared reflectance, especially when paired with near-infrared reflectance.', '[Cohen, Warren B.] US Forest Serv, USDA, PNW Res Stn, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.

In combination with a real time short-term wave prediction model safety related marine operations windows can be increased. This focuses on Quiescent Period Prediction during large sea states, and the ability of pre-emptive wave-by-wave tuning of marine energy converters leads to improved efficiencies. This study presents a new method of converting X-band radar sequence into approximate surface elevation in near real time using synthetic wave trough profile estimations, forgoing the use of a linear stochastic model. The artificial wave trough method applies a second order Stokes wave to trough regions where radar shadows occur, these shadows are caused as a result of high surround wave crest height where no surface information is gathered. The calculated surface elevation is validated against in situ sensor data at two locations, a correlation (r) of 0.69 is shown for the Signature 1000 sensor location, while a lower correlation of 0.56 is observed at the wave buoy location. When the phase-averaged wave parameters (H-m0 and T-p) derived from 20 min wave spectra for the entire duration of the measurement campaign are compared, a reasonable agreement of 0.62 and 0.41 for the AD2CP and wave buoy location is achieved.

Under the assumption that single-mission products are free from spurious temporal artifacts and can be used as benchmark time series, multi-mission CDRs should reproduce the main trend patterns observed by single-mission series when computed over their respective periods. This study introduces and applies quantitative metrics to compare trend distributions from different data records. First, contingency matrices compare the trend diagnostics associated with two satellite products when expressed in binary categories such as existence, significance and signs of trends. Contingency matrices can be further summarized by metrics such as Cohen\'s is index that rates the overall agreement between the two distributions of diagnostics. A more quantitative measure of the discrepancies between trends is provided by the distributions of differences between trend slopes. Thirdly, maps of the level of significance P of a t-test quantifying the degree to which two trend estimates differ provide a statistical, spatially-resolved, evaluation. The proposed methodology is applied to the multi-mission Ocean Colour-Climate Change Initiative (OCCCI) Chla data. The agreement between trend distributions associated with OC-CCI data and single-mission products usually appears as good as when single-mission products are compared. As the period of analysis is extended beyond 2012 to 2015, the level of agreement tends to be degraded, which might be at least partly due to the aging of the MODIS sensor on-board Aqua. On the other hand, the trends displayed by the OC-CCI series over the short period 2012-2015 are very consistent with those observed with VIIRS. These results overall suggest that the OC-CCI Chla data can be used for multi-annual time series analysis (including trend detection), but with some caution required if recent years are included, particularly in the central tropical Pacific. The study also recalls the challenges associated with creating a multi-mission ocean color data record suitable for climate research. (C) 2017 The Authors.

An ideal yield dataset would not only extend globally and across multiple years, but would also have enough spatial granularity to characterize productivity at the field and sub field level. Rapid increases in satellite data acquisition and platforms such as Google Earth Engine that can efficiently access and process vast archives of new and historical data offer an opportunity to map yields globally, but require efficient and robust algorithms to combine various data streams into yield estimates. We recently introduced a Scalable satellite-based Crop Yield Mapper (SCYM) that combines crop models simulations with imagery and weather data to generate 30 m resolution yield estimates without the need for ground calibration. In this study, we tested new large-scale implementations of SCYM, focusing on three regions with varying crops, field sizes and landscape heterogeneity: maize in the U.S. corn belt (390,000 km(2)), maize in Southern Zambia (86,000 km(2)), and wheat in northern India (450,000 km(2)). As a benchmark, we also tested a simpler empirical approach (PEAKVI) that relates yield to the peak value of a time series of spatially aggregated vegetation indices, similar to methods used in current operational monitoring. Both SCYM and PEAKVI were applied to data from all Landsat\'s sensors and MODIS for more than a decade in each region, and evaluated against ground-based estimates at the finest available administrative level (e.g., counties in the U.S.). We found consistently high correlations (R-2 >= 0.5) between the spatial pattern of ground- and satellite-based estimates in both U.S. maize and India wheat, with small differences between methods and source of satellite data. In the U.S., SCYM outperformed PEAKVI in tracking temporal yield variations, likely owing to its explicit consideration of weather. In India, both methods failed to track temporal yield changes, with various possible explanations discussed. In Zambia, the PEAKVI approach applied to MODIS tracked yield variations much better (R-2 > 0.5) than any other yield estimate, likely because the frequent cloud cover in this region confounds the other approaches. Overall, this study demonstrates successful approaches to yield estimation in each region, and illustrates the importance of distinguishing between accuracy for spatial and temporal variation. The 30 m resolution of Landsat-based SCYM does not appear to offer large benefits for tracking aggregate yields, but enables finer scale analyses than possible with the other approaches.

However, the spatial patterns of the dynamics are still unknown. The archived Landsat images provide an unprecedented opportunity to detect land cover changes over the past three decades. In this study, we used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) trajectory to detect major land cover dynamics in Beijing. Then, we classified the land cover types in 2015 with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud calculation. By overlaying the latest land cover types and the spatial distribution of land cover dynamics, we determined the main types where a land cover change occurred. The overall change detection accuracy for three types (vegetation loss associated with negative change in NDVI, vegetation gain associated with positive change in NDVI, and no changes) is 86.13%. We found that the GEE is a fast and powerful tool for land cover mapping, and we obtained a classification map with an overall accuracy of 86.61%. Over the past 30 years, 1402.28 km(2) of land was with vegetation loss and 109038 km(2) of land was revegetated in Beijing.

We also found that 1162.71 km(2) of land was converted to urban and built-up, whereas 918.36 km(2) of land was revegetated to cropland, shrub land, forest, and grassland.

For NDVI, the overall impact of the reprocessing is relatively small and differences show no seasonality. Trends in the differences over the years are related to changes in calibration coefficients. Systematic differences between VGT1-C3 and VGT2-C3 surface reflectance are well below 1%, with largest bias between VGT1 and VGT2 for the NIR band and the NDVI (VGT2 > VGT1, especially for larger NDVI values). Both the comparison with METOP/AVHRR (surface reflectance and NDVI) and TERRA/MODIS (NDVI) reveal trends over time: systematic bias between VGT2 and METOP/AVHRR tends to decrease over time, while comparison with TERRA/MODIS indicates an increasing bias between VGT2 and MODIS. VGT2 NDVI seems to be gradually evolving to slightly larger values, which is consistent with the change in overpass time of VGT2 and the different illumination conditions caused by the orbital drift of the sensor. Results demonstrate however the SPOT/VGT-C3 archive is more stable over time compared to the previous archive, although bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) normalization is recommended in order to correct for bidirectional effects.', '[Tote, Carolien; Swinnen, Else; Sterckx, Sindy; Clarijs, Dennis; Maes, Ronny] Flemish Inst Technol Res VITO, Remote Sensing Unit, Boeretang 200, B-52400 Mol, Belgium.

The Modified Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (MTVDI) proposed in our earlier work is developed using a time domain solution method rather than the traditional spatial domain solution method, because of limitations arising from a traditional temperature-vegetation index (TVX) method. In the procedure herein proposed, the MTVDI parameterization scheme is transformed from regional scale to pixel scale, and the boundary conditions defining maximum water stress are determined pixel by pixel using the surface energy balance principle. All the parameters required for the retrieval of MTVDI are pixel specific, thereby avoiding the limitations of the traditional spatial domain solution method. Previous studies demonstrate the applicability of the TVX method with data from only a few days of clear sky conditions. In contrast, our proposed MTVDI is demonstrated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products over the course of a full year, and the soil moisture status over the Southern Great Plains (SGP) region is monitored continuously. Finally, the volumetric surface soil water content (theta(nu)) is estimated using a calibration procedure from the MTVDI retrievals. The results show that the accuracy of both MTVDI retrievals and theta(nu) estimates obtained in this work has reached a level comparable with those produced in previous studies. Across all sites, the correlation coefficient (r) between the MTVDI and theta(nu) measurements is 0.60.

Remote sensing data from earth observation satellites has been well established as a method for mapping the extent and elevation profile of the intertidal zone; however the majority of these applications are local in nature, and based on analysis of a limited number of individual image observations.   In this paper we outline an automated methodology to model the intertidal extent and topography of the Australian coastline, that leverages a full time series of Landsat observations from 1987 to 2015 managed in the Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC). Our approach reframes the analysis from time of acquisition into the tidal domain through the use of a continental scale tidal model, combined with a median pixel compositing of Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) stacks, to robustly estimate the tidal extent and elevation profile across the observed tidal range. We demonstrate the ability of a median-based compositing approach to deal effectively with data quality, modelling outliers and other issues that commonly affect single scene methodologies. Our new framework enables us to produce a continental-scale intertidal model, detailing intertidal zone topography at a 25 m spatial scale.   We then demonstrate the potential of the modelling framework to derive digital elevation data based on tidal model attribution, validating our models against in-situ GPS observations, before discussing issues that must be addressed to move this capability to a continental scale. The ability of the model to examine coastal stability is introduced, in the context of the conceptual reframing of the data into the tidal domain, with a view to furthering this application in future versions of the model.

Time series analyses of remotely sensed data enable the retrospective generation of baseline data depicting both forest disturbance and recovery, enabling a more holistic examination of forest dynamics. In this research, we utilize the outputs of the Composite2Change, or C2C, algorithm that lever-ages the extensive Landsat archive to produce annual, gap-free, surface reflectance composites to date and label disturbance types and to characterize vegetation recovery over the >650 million ha of Canada\'s forested ecosystems. From 1985 to 2010, 57.5 Mha or 10.75% of Canada\'s net forested ecosystem area (exclusive of water) were disturbed by either wildfire or harvest, representing an annual rate of disturbance of approximately 0.43% per year. Wildfire accounted for 2.5 times more area disturbed than harvest. On average, wildfire disturbed 1.6 Mha annually and had greater inter-annual variability with a standard deviation of 1.1 Mha, compared to the 0.65 Mha disturbed annually by harvesting (sigma = 0.1 Mha). Herein, we defined a longer-term measure of spectral recovery (the number of years it took for a pixel to attain 80% of its pre-disturbance Normalized Burn Ratio or NBR value), which indicated that harvested areas are recovering more consistently over time relative to areas disturbed by wildfire, with 78.6% of harvested areas requiring <= 10 years to recover, compared to only 35.5% of wildfire areas. A shorter-term (5-year) measure of spectral recovery, also based on the NBR, indicated that vegetation in wildfire areas returned more rapidly than harvested areas; however, when the magnitude of the disturbance was incorporated into the metric, with magnitude typically larger and more variable for wildfire areas, harvested areas were found to be recovering more rapidly on average in the short-term. Overall, < 1% of the areas disturbed by wildfire and harvest were identified as non-recovering by all three spectral measures of recovery used in our analysis. Regionally, trends in disturbance and recovery largely echoed trends found at the national level, although the relative amounts and rates of wildfire or harvest varied by ecozone. Time series Landsat composites provide an opportunity to characterize relative trends in disturbance and recovery at a national scale, by disturbance type and ecozone, in a spatially explicit manner and at a level of spatial detail that is relevant to both forest management and science.

However, human activities in lakes and their watersheds may have direct and indirect impacts on aquatic optical properties. Therefore, identifying key drivers that can be controlled (human) from those that cannot (climate) represents an important objective. In the present study, we develop an algorithm to estimate the concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in Lake Hongze (the fourth largest freshwater lake in China) using MODIS/Aqua images with concurrent data collected from six cruise surveys. The algorithm resulted in root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 7.64-7.86 mg/L for SPM ranging from 10 to 80 mg/L. The algorithm was applied to 1602 cloud-free MODIS/Aqua images from 2002 to 2015. Our results show: (1) inter-annual and seasonal variations of SPM concentrations in lake Hongze are divided into two distinct periods between 2002 and 2011 and 2012-2015, with the transition associated to intensive dredging activities that were initiated in 2012. (2) SPM concentrations exhibit four typical patterns of spatial distribution which depend on local meteorological (wind speed and wind direction) and hydrological conditions (catchment rainfall and Huai River flowrate). Based on these results, a new spatial zoning of the lake is derived to support government and agency monitoring. The study shows additive and synergistic effects of climate change and human activities on SPM concentrations over short and long timescales and the possibility to monitor these changes by remote sensing in shallow optically complex lakes.

We have developed a method for simultaneous mapping of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), also including water vapor (H2O), using ground-based remote sensing on a landscape-sized scale by utilizing Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometers (IFTS) with high spectral resolution and imaging rates. The approach uses calculated libraries of transmission spectra at the spectroscopic resolutions of the IFTS, based on the HITRAN database of spectroscopic lines and our own line-by-line radiative transfer model (LBLRTM). For each species, 1024 spectra have been made, resulting in 10243 combinations of column densities. Using an adaptive grid, solutions are found for each line of sight at a spectral resolution of up to 0.25 cm(-1) using the full spectral region of the detector. The modeling is multi-layered, calculating temperatures of the background, air, and any additional gas layers, also accounting for reflected cold sky. Background distances can be mapped from the amount of water vapor in each line of sight. The described approach can be used to identify sources, quantify gas distributions, and to calculate fluxes. Visualizations can produce gas distribution images, as well as air motion videos, which are used to map fluxes using the same data set, without the need for additional instruments for wind measurements.

The accuracies of the analyzed SCE maps were evaluated against in-situ snow data measured at ground stations along with the SCE maps from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Data Record (NOAA-CDR) product. The evaluation showed the JASMES product to have a more temporally stable producer\'s accuracy (PA; 1-omission error) than NOAA, which is a key factor in the analysis of long-term SCE trends. Comparison of seasonal NH SCE trends from the two products showed NOAA to have opposite trends to those of JASMES in the fall and winter seasons, and to have overestimated SCE decreasing trends in the spring and summer. These tendencies are consistent with the increasing spatial and temporal resolutions of information over time, which were used in generating the NOAA snow analysis. An estimation of unbiased SCEs based on the accuracies of SCE maps also endorses the long-term trends of the JASMES product The JASMES NH seasonal SCE exhibited negative slopes in all seasons but was only statistically significant in the summer (JJA) and fall (SON). Delayed snow cover onset was observed to be the main driver of decreasing annual snow duration (SCD) trends. The spatial pattern of annual SCD trends exhibited noticeable asymmetry between continents, with the largest significant decreases observed over western Eurasia with relatively few statistically significant decreases over North America.

However, the relationship between satellite-derived clear-sky skin temperature and various downscaled air temperature products for snow covered sub-Arctic alpine regions remain poorly understood, such that trend analysis or air temperature product integration is difficult. We compared monthly average air temperatures from two independent downscaled temperature products to MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) and air temperature at nine meteorological stations situated above tree-line in the southwest Yukon, Canada, between May and August 2008 for a full range of snow cover fractions. We found that both down scaled products generally agreed with LST for the low elevation, snow-free, vegetation classes. However, a systematic cold bias in Average LST emerged for snow fractions greater than approximately 40%, and this bias increased in magnitude as snow cover increased. In these situations the downscaled air temperatures were 57 degrees C warmer than Average LST for snow fractions of >90%, and this pattern was largely independent of the number of measurements of LST within a month. Maximum LST was similar to average air temperatures for high snow fractions, but Minimum LST was colder by 10 degrees C or more for all snow fractions. Consequently, the average of Maximum and Minimum LST produces the cold bias, compared to air temperature, for high snow cover fractions. Air temperature measured at nine meteorological monitoring stations located between elevations of 1408-2690 m, on land cover classes Barren, Sparsely Vegetated or Permanent Snow and Ice, confirmed the cold bias results when incorporating Minimum LST in monthly averages. For snow fractions of <40% the RMSE for all of the temperature products was <2.5 degrees C when compared to station air temperature and all biases were positive and <2.0 degrees C. For snow fractions of >40%, the average LST bias became strongly negative at -4.5 degrees C, and the RMSE increased to 6.1 degrees C, whereas the downscaled products bias and RMSE were similar to those from snow fractions of <40%. A weak warm bias for all the temperature products occurred for small snow fractions over non-forested land cover classes. Downscaled air temperature fields show physically real differences from Average LST in spring and summer, caused by snow cover and the interplay of Maximum and Minimum LST. These findings indicate that the integration of MODIS 1ST with downscaled air temperature products or local air temperature requires the incorporation of snow cover. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Instead of detailed analytical physical TIR models requiring too much input information and computational capacities, simplified parametric approaches capable to mimic and correct with precision the angular effects on 1ST will be deemed suitable for practical satellite applications. In this study, we present a simple two parameters model, so-called RL (Roujean-Lagouarde), which shows capabilities to properly depict the directional signatures of both urban and vegetation targets within an accuracy better than 1 degrees C This latter value is the RMSE (root mean square error) obtained as the best adjustment of the RL model against in situ datasets. Then the RL approach was compared to a synthetic dataset generated by the model Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) in which large variability in meteorological scenarios, canopy structure and water status conditions was accounted for. Results indicate RMSE <= 0.6 degrees C which is a very hopeful result. Besides, the RL model performs even better than the popular parametric model of Vinnikov that encompasses two unknowns. The ability of RL model to better reproduce the hotspot phenomenon explains this feature.   The RL model appears as a potential candidate for future operational processing chains of TIR satellite data because it fulfills the requirements of both simple analytical formulation and limited number of input parameters. Efforts nevertheless remain to be done on inversion methodologies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Although many global and regional broadband surface albedo products have been generated from satellite observations, most of them contain albedo over land-surfaces only, and the albedo over ocean and sea-ice surfaces is usually left blank or estimated based on the lambertian-assumption. In this paper, we extend the BRDF-based direct-estimation algorithm for mapping the shortwave surface albedo of the Arctic sea-ice zone with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Firstly, a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) database for sea ice was generated based on simulations of the asymptotic radiative transfer (ART) and the three components ocean water albedo (TCOWA) model. Secondly, a linear regression relationship between top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and surface broadband albedo was developed for different angular bins. Finally, the direct-estimation coefficients derived by the angular bin regression were stored in a pre-calculated look up table (LUT). When the MODIS LIB swath data are available, the corresponding coefficients are searched based on the solar/view geometry. Therefore, the shortwave surface albedo can be estimated from single-angular observations. Compared with the in situ measurements from the Tara polar ocean expedition in 2007, the results indicate that the.albedo estimated by the BRDF-based direct-estimation algorithm has an R-2 value of 0.67 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.068. The validation results show that the BRDF-based direct-estimation algorithm is suitable for mapping shortwave surface albedo of the Arctic sea-ice zone, which corrects the reflectance anisotropic effect with prior physical BRDF database and makes it possible to generate long-term Arctic surface albedo products with higher spatial and temporal resolutions.

The accuracy of a landslide susceptibility map is affected by false negative and false positive errors which can decrease the reliability of this useful product. In particular, false negative errors, are generally worse in terms of social and economic losses with respect to the losses associated with false positives. In this paper, we present a new technique to improve the accuracy of landslide susceptibility maps using Permanent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR) data. The proposed approach uses two different data sets acquired in ascending and descending geometry. The PS velocity measured along the line of sight is re-projected into a new velocity along the steepest slope direction (V-Slope). Integration between the LSM and the ground deformation velocity map along the slope was performed using an empirical contingency matrix, which takes into account the average V-Slope and the susceptibility degree obtained using the Random Forests algorithm. The Results show that the susceptibility degree increased in 56.41 km(2) of the study area. The combination of PSInSAR data and the landslide susceptibility map (LSM) improved the prediction reliability of slow moving landslides, which particularly affect urbanized areas. The use of this procedure can be easily applied in different areas where PSI data sets are available. This approach will help planning and decision-making authorities produce reliable landslide susceptibility maps, correcting some of the LSM errors. (C) 2016 The Authors.

In this study, our goal was to use airborne lidar and imagery to build accurate high -resolution shrub biomass maps for an important research landscape in the American Arctic. In a leave-one-out cross-validation analysis, optimized lidar-derived canopy volume was a good single predictor of harvested shrub biomass (R-2 = 0.62; RMSD = 219 g m(-2); slope = 1.08). However, model accuracy was improved by incorporating additional lidar-derived canopy metrics and airborne spectral metrics in a Random Forest regression approach (pseudo R-2 = 0.71; RMSD = 197 g m(-2): slope = 1.02). The best Random Forest model was used to map shrub biomass at 0.80 m resolution across three lidar collection footprints (similar to 12.5 km(2) total) near Toolik Field Station on Alaska\'s North Slope. We characterized model uncertainty by creating corresponding maps of the coefficient of variation in Random Forest shrub biomass estimates. We also explore potential benefits of incorporating lidar-derived topographic metrics, and consider tradeoffs inherent in employing different data sources for high -resolution vegetation mapping efforts. This study yielded maps that provide valuable, high -resolution spatial estimates of aboveground shrub biomass and canopy volume in a rapidly changing tundra ecosystem. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, regional analyses of agricultural land use typically focus on subsets of the total global network. In this paper, we seek to address the following questions: Does the globally observed scale-free property of agricultural networks hold over smaller spatial domains? Can similar properties be observed at kilometer to meter scales? Does the observed scale-free structure persist as agricultural networks evolve over the growing season? We analyze 9 intensively cultivated Landsat scenes on 5 continents with a wide range of vegetation distributions. We find that networks of vegetation fraction within the domain of each of these Landsat scenes exhibit substantial variability - but generally still possess similar scaling properties to the global distribution of agriculture. We also find similar results when comparing Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery for 3 agricultural regions in Europe, as well as in an IKONOS image of an agricultural region of China. To illustrate an application of spatial network analysis, we show an example of network disruption. We compare two networks with similar rank-size distributions that behave differently when nodes are progressively removed. We suggest that treating agricultural land cover as spatial networks can provide a straightforward way of characterizing the connectivity and evolution of complex spatial distributions of agriculture across a wide range of landscapes and at spatial scales relevant for practical agricultural applications.

However, it can be difficult to distinguish cyclic variations due to geophysical processes from those that are artefacts of the observation technique. Here, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the origin of cyclicity in volcanic observations by analysing daily, global satellite measurements of volcanic SO2 loading by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and thermal infrared anomalies detected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We use a fast Fourier Transform (FFT) multi-taper method (MTM) to analyse multiple phases of activity at 32 target volcanoes, utilising measurements obtained from three NASA satellite instruments (Aura - OMI, Aqua - MODIS and Terra - MODIS), and identify a common cycle (period of similar to 2.3 days), which is not considered to be of volcanic origin. Based on the presence of this cycle in multiple satellite datasets, we attribute it to variations in viewing angle during the 16-day orbit repeat cycle of sun-synchronous satellites maintained in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). A 5-point averaging correction procedure is tested on satellite observations from Kilauea volcano, Hawaii, and is found to reduce the impact of higher frequency cycles and reveal the presence of longer-period geophysical signals. In addition to the identification of a signal common to different measurement techniques, an underlying cyclical pattern was found in the OMI SO2 observations (periods of similar to 7.9 and 32 days) generated by the OMI Row Anomaly (ORA). We conclude that identification of the presence and magnitude of non-geophysical cyclic behaviour, which can suppress natural cycles in time-series data, and implementation of appropriate corrections, is crucial for accurate interpretation of satellite observations. The use of data averaging to suppress non-geophysical cycles imposes limits on the length of natural cycles that can be confidently identified in moderate resolution satellite observations from polar-orbiting spacecraft.

In this paper, we describe and test procedures devised to separate returns of ice from open water a crucial step in the estimation of local sea levels for freeboard calculations. The two data sets used in these tests, one each from winter and summer, were acquired by a Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL) implemented to support prelaunch development of retrieval approaches. Our approach first identifies likely open water returns using surface photon and background count rates as proxy indicators of apparent surface reflectance. Since these measured rates are noisy estimates of expected reflectance, relative surface heights are used to refine the selection of the candidate sea surface samples. Results show that winter freeboard distributions are consistent with expected regional variability, and the nearly identical repeat-track freeboard distributions during summer show retrieval consistency. From coincident lidar coverage, variability of sea level samples identified in the MABEL and Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) lidar profiles are 1.6 cm and 2.6 cm, with the overall difference between the distributions at 0.00 +/- 0.15 m. This demonstrates the viability of the algorithms. The parameters used in these procedures will serve as a baseline and as a guide for understanding algorithm reliability. It is expected that they will be adjusted post-launch to reflect the on-orbit performance of ATLAS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Kwok, R.; Cunningham, G.

The calculation of PRI from leaf-level spectral reflectance measurements is unambiguous. Interpretation of the value of this index is more complicated, as it is affected by leaf structure and its carotenoid and chlorophyll content. Generally, a change in leaf-level PRI indicates a change in its photosynthetic capacity. At the scales of the canopy and beyond, various non-physiological factors modulate the leaf-level PRI signal inducing large angular and spatial variations in PRI. Specifically, previous studies have shown that within-canopy illumination variations and shadowing effects directly affect the PRI of a canopy. When observing a forest with a resolution finer than the size of a tree crown, large areas of shaded and sunlit foliage become visible. The spectral distribution of irradiance in these canopy regions is different from the average top-of-canopy irradiance used in the calculation of the canopy PRI. Thus, the leaf and canopy PRI can become decoupled. To date, no thorough analytical and empirical analysis of how the spectrally variable within-canopy light conditions cause apparent, non-physiological variation in canopy PRI has been published. In this study, we propose a new method to assess these PRI variations in structured vegetation from high spatial resolution (pixel size smaller than 1 m) imaging spectroscopy data. We used airborne imaging spectroscopy of boreal forest stands to evaluate the spectral irradiance in different locations inside the canopy and calculated a correction term for the canopy PRI estimates defined using top-of-canopy irradiance. We determined the maximum value of the correction term by sampling the most sunlit and shaded road surface locations adjacent to tree crowns. Results indicated that under the particular illumination view geometry, irradiance variations decreased the canopy PRI by as much as 0.06 (relative change >100%). The correction depended only slightly on atmospheric correction parameters. Finally, we reduced the illumination-related apparent variation in canopy PRI using the two-leaf canopy photosynthesis modeling scheme, canopy shadow fraction and the maximum correction term. In a test scene, the average illumination-corrected PRI was 0.027 smaller than non-corrected canopy PRI and showed no correlation with the shadow fraction, indicating a lack of down-regulation at the time of measurement. In theory, approach can be applied to all canopy level PRI measurements from towers, aircrafts and satellites under any observation geometry. However, further validation, preferably using in situ leaf reflectance data from different biomes, would be required before the algorithm can be routinely applied. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Relative changes (%) in AOD between the first and last seven years (i.e. 2001-2007 and 2008-2014 respectively) are discussed at annual and seasonal levels. AOD trends are calculated using the weighted least squares regression approach and weights are assigned to the AOD values corresponding to the expected errors. Statistically significant trends are reported at 95% confidence level. The results inferred from both the sensors are found to be in quite acceptable agreement. Increasing trends are found in the economically growing parts of Asian landmass and the surrounding oceanic regions, especially Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. On the other hand, decreasing trends are observed over parts of Europe, South America and North America. The study also focuses on examining the AOD trends over the ten most populous nations of the world. In terms of aerosol loadings, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nigeria turned out to be the most polluted amongst the most populous countries.

Our approach has been for agricultural and water management applications at the regional and local scale. Despite being a rather small area, we were able to observe different signal behaviours corresponding to major land cover classes in Mediterranean areas i.e.: dryland and irrigated crops, forests and natural vegetation (grass-shrubs). The area also allowed assessing the impact of topography. The first result of the study is that the results are very dependent on the normalizations used to make the data comparable, thus their impact must be carefully analysed. In this study, we applied two different normalisation methods (called ZV35 and ZV) and different moving average windows (1, 10 and 30 days) in order to enhance seasonal effects. Using no smoothing window, ASCAT is the soil moisture product that correlates best with the LSM over all cover classes, whatever the method. Using smoothing window, AMSR-E tends to outperform other soil moisture products with the ZV method. The ZV35 method is not able to identify a small heavily irrigated area. The reason for these different results is that ZV35, tends to eliminate the monthly scale soil moisture memory and therefore becomes more sensitive to precipitation and less sensitive to the monthly evolution of superficial soil moisture. The comparison shows in general good agreement for all soil moisture products with the LSM on the temporal series simulated over flat, non irrigated areas which are not close to the sea. SMOS has difficulties in areas close to the sea and in areas with steep relief and the current version of the L2 Operational Algorithm (V5.51) depicts few values in forested areas. ASCAT, in its turn, shows some limitations over agricultural and natural vegetation where it shows an increase of soil moisture from June to October probably due to increase of penetration depth in dry soil moisture conditions. AMSR-E LPRM shows a clear vegetation cycle over all the land cover classes. From all the remote sensing products, SMOS is the only one able to see irrigation and the only that does not show clear vegetation or roughness effects. In this study, we were able to assess the impact of higher resolution soil moisture products to map irrigated areas. (C) 2016 The Authors.

This paper explores the potential of the new TerraSAR-X beam mode Staring Spotlight (ST) to investigate looting within a workflow of radar backscattering change detection. A bespoke time series of five single polarisation, ascending mode, ST scenes with an unprecedented azimuth resolution of 0.24 m was acquired over the archaeological site of Apamea in western Syria, from October 2014 to June 2015 with a regular sampling of one image every two months. Formerly included in the Tentative List of UNESCO, the site has been heavily looted from at least early 2012 to May 2014, as confirmed by Google Earth Very High Resolution (VHR) optical imagery. Building upon the theory of SAR imaging, we develop a novel conceptual model of \'looting marks\', identify marks due to occurrence of new looting and discriminate them from alteration (e.g. filling) of pre-existing looting holes. \'Looting marks\' appear as distinctive patterns of shadow and layover which are visible in the ground-range reprojected ST image and generated by the morphology of the holes. The recognition of looting marks within ratio maps of radar backscatter (sigma(0)) between consecutive ST scenes allows quantification of the magnitude, spatial distribution and rates of looting activities. In agreement with the estimates based on Google Earth imagery, the ST acquired in October 2014 shows that similar to 45% of the site was looted. In the following eight months new looting happened locally, with holes mainly dug along the margins of the already looted areas. Texture values of similar to 0.31 clearly distinguish these holes from the unaltered, bare ground nearby. Hot spots of change are identified based on the temporal variability sigma(0), and colour composites indicate where repeated looting and alteration of existing holes occurred. Most looting marks are observed north of the two main Roman decumani. Looting intensified almost steadily from December 2014, with over 1500 new marks in February-April 2015. The estimated rates of looting increased from 214 looting marks/month in October-December 2014 to over 780 marks/month in April June 2015, and numerically express the dynamic nature of the phenomenon to which Apamea is still exposed. The method of identifying looting marks in VHR radar images therefore proves a reliable opportunity for archaeologists and image analysts to measure remotely the scale of looting and monitor its temporal evolution.

The study was undertaken in Addis Ababa city, Ethiopia. Ground-based data and high resolution images were used as reference data in LULC classification. To more accurately quantify landscape patterns and their changes, we applied new locally optimized separability enhancement indices and decision rules (SEI-DR approach) to address commonly observed classification accuracy problems in urban environments. We tested the SEI-DR approach using eight Landsat images acquired between 1985 and 2010. Two approaches were applied to quantify surface heat intensity (SHIn) and to examine its spatial patterns over 25 years: thermal gradient analysis and hot spot analysis. A Simultaneous Autoregressive Spatial error model (SARerr) was used to explore relationships between surface temperature and biophysical variables describing urban surfaces. Compared to Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, accuracy improvement achieved through use of the SEI-DR procedure was, respectively, 6% and 5% and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The Surface Heat Intensity (SHIn) analysis showed increasing contrast (1985-2010) between urban centers and the outskirt. On average, outskirts were cooler than central urban areas by up to 3.7 degrees C. We detected statistically significant differences in intra-urban thermal aggregation (P < 0.01) and the differences ranged from 4.4 degrees C to 5.3 degrees C. Increasing heat intensity was observed between 1985 and 2010. However, we observed no clear evidence of urban areas being warmer than rural. Built-up surfaces and bare soil showed similar positive relationships with surface temperature (P < 0.01), while vegetation showed a negative relationship (P < 0.05). We conclude that with rapid urbanization, thermal intensity increased but relationships with vegetation suggest that options for mitigating urban warming in tropical climates may be available. The development of a new urban classification method, use of hotspot analysis, and the investigations of the UHI for an African city fill important research gaps for studies of urban thermal variation.

We propose that water index methods based on data normalised to surface reflectance, using thresholds optimised for a large selection of data, provide a simple yet accurate method for automated water classification across large regions. In order to select the best index for this task a comprehensive comparative analyses was required. We assessed the accuracy of seven water index methods for classifying water in 30 m resolution Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI imagery from eastern Australia. These indexes were the Automated Water Extraction Index for images with shadows (AWEI(shadow)) and without shadows (AWEI(no shadow)), tasselled cap wetness (TCWcrist), two variations of the normalised difference water index (NDWIMcFeeters and NDWIXu), a water index created using canonical variates analysis from top-of atmosphere data (WI2006), and a new water index created with linear discriminant analysis from data processed to surface reflectance (WI2015). A wide variety of water (50,868), non-water (36,833) and mixed (16,499) validation pixels were selected from Landsat images across the states of New South Wales and Queensland. Water area and the colour of water and non-water features were determined for each validation pixel using coincident high resolution imagery and TM/ETM+ reflectance. A single optimum threshold for classifying each index into water and non-water was determined using pure pixels. In general the WI2015, WI2006 and AWEI(shadow) performed the best, with all indexes achieving overall accuracies of 95-99% for pure pixels, and 73-75% for mixed pixels. Omission errors were more common than commission errors, and water area was usually underestimated, especially where water was green-brown in colour, and/or where water bodies were small or had long perimeters with many mixed pixels. The accuracy of each index was highly dependent on the composition of the validation pixels, with no index performing best across all water and non-water pixel types. All indexes and thresholds were found to perform consistently across images from the TM, ETM + and OLI sensors, facilitating the automated classification of water to similar levels of accuracy for the growing archive of Landsat data.

However, information on the distribution of these platforms over vast areas of the sea is extremely poor partly because of business secrecy, national interests including security, and partly from bureaucratic inertia. Until recently, the automatic and accurate identification of platforms using optical imagery was challenging due to their subtle characteristics (i.e., low contrast and small size) and prevalent cloud cover. The Landsat-8 satellite, with its increasing Operational Land Imager (OLI) dataset with uniform quality and global coverage, may assist researchers in assessing the worldwide distribution of offshore platforms. Here we describe an automated method, based on time-series of OLI imagery, for extracting offshore platforms (AMEOP) which addresses the aforementioned problems. Specifically, two strategies (time-series and multi-refinement) were designed to address the challenges presented by heavy cloud cover over the sea. Three features documented in the OLI imagery time-series (contextual feature, and position- and size-invariance) were used to accurately discriminate offshore platforms from false positives. The AMEOP was applied to the Gulf of Thailand and 370 offshore platforms were automatically identified using 198 OLI images. Validation using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and Chinese high-resolution satellite imagery demonstrated an omission error of 3.8% and a commission error below 1.0%. The AMEOP was also successfully extended to the Persian Gulf and northern Gulf of Mexico, 2346 and 2411 offshore platforms were respectively identified. We believe that the methodology presented herein provides a robust and cost-effective technique for improving the identification of offshore platforms over large areas of the sea; and that the accumulation of OLI data, together with the SAR images, has great potential for mapping and tracking of offshore platforms on a global scale, as well as for providing an early warning of oil spills around platforms and the improved estimation of their greenhouse gas emissions.

Based on a time series of remotely sensed PM2.5 concentrations, this study analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of this crucial pollutant in China from 1999 to 2011 using trend analysis and standard deviation ellipse analysis, and carried out a health risk assessment of human exposure to PM2.5. The results showed that PM2.5 concentrations increased significantly from 1999 to 2011 in China, especially in the central and eastern parts of the country. The proportion of areas with PM2.5 concentrations higher than 35 mu g/m(3) increased year by year, and the areas with PM2.5 concentrations lower than the annual primary standard of 15 mu g/m(3) decreased continuously. The areas most polluted by PM2.5 were south of Hebei, north of Henan and west of Shandong provinces, with changes in the overall spatial distribution of the pollutant occurring faster along a south-north axis than along an east-west axis, and also faster along an east-south axis than along a west-north axis. Based on the PM2.5 concentrations in China from 1999 to 2011, a two-tier standard (level-I and level-II) was proposed for delineated areas to assist in nationwide air pollution control. It was also found that the proportion of the population exposed to PM2.5 concentrations greater than 35 mu g/m(3) increased year by year, and increased faster than the proportion of population exposed to PM2.5 concentrations in the range 15-35 mu g/m(3). The health risk in the central and eastern areas of the country was the highest. Based on these results, PM2.5 pollution poses an increasingly serious risk to human health across China and there is an immediate need to implement its regional control. In addition, more attention should be paid at the national scale in terms of pollution risk, rather than focusing narrowly on a city scale. (C). 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) has shown promise when measured at short timesteps to remotely estimate dynamics in xanthophyll pigment interconversion a plant photoprotective mechanism that results in lowered photosynthetic efficiency. To gain a better understanding of this dynamic spectral response to environmental conditions, we investigated PRI over two seasons (2013 and 2014) in rainfed soft white spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Highly temporally resolved (measurement frequency = five minutes) in-situ radiometric measurements of PRI were collected at field plots of varying nitrogen (N) and soil water conditions (n = 16). To represent the diurnal magnitude of xanthophyll pigment inter conversion, we use a delta PRI (Delta PRI) derived from a midday PRI (xanthophyll de-epoxidation state) and an early morning PRI (xanthophyll epoxidation state). We hypothesize that Delta PRI can empirically deconvolve the diurnally changing (facultative) from the seasonally changing (constitutive) component of the PRI signal. In this study, Delta PRI demonstrated less sensitivity than an uncorrected PRI to leaf area index (LAI) and leaf chlorophyll content throughout the growing season. Delta PRI! was correlated with continuous, unattended crop responses associated with vapor pressure deficit (0.50 > R-2 > 0.48), stomatal conductance (R-2 = 0.47), and air temperature (0.42 > R-2 > 35). Further, the sensitivity with which Delta PRI responded to solar radiation under varying N treatments and periods of soil water availability (surplus, depletion, and deficit) suggests that crop growth may be inhibited by a xanthophyll cycle mediated stress response, detectable by Delta PRI A major implication of these findings is that highly temporally and spatially resolved Delta PRI data could be used to track plant status in response to changing environmental conditions.

Robust and efficient pixel-based band ratios have proven to be accurate for automatically delineating clean glacier ice, however such classifications are restricted on debris-covered ice due to its spectral similarity with surrounding terrain. Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) has emerged as a new analysis technique within remote sensing. It offers many advantages over pixel-based classification techniques due to the ability to work with multiple data sources and handle data contextually and hierarchically. By making use of OBIA capabilities we automatically classify dean ice and debris-covered ice in the challenging area surrounding Mount Manaslu in Nepal using optical (Landsat 8), topographic (void-filled SRTM) and SAR coherence (ALOS PALSAR) data. Clean ice was classified with a mean accuracy of 93% whilst debris-covered ice was classified with an accuracy of 83% when compared to manually corrected outlines, providing a total glacier accuracy of 91%. With further developments in the classification, steep tributary sections of ice could be contextually included, raising the accuracy to over 94%. One prominent advantage of OBIA is that it allows some post-processing and correction of the glacier outlines automatically, reducing the amount of manual correction needed. OBIA incorporating SAR coherence data is recommended for future mapping of debris-covered ice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Mapping the distributions of these species is important to understanding the ecology of coastal environments, managing marine ecosystems (e.g., spatial planning), predicting consequences of climate change and the potential for carbon production. We demonstrate how combining seafloor mapping technologies (LiDAR and multibeam bathymetry) and models of wave energy to map the distribution and relative abundance of seaweed forests of Ecklonia radiata can provide complete coverage over hundreds of square kilometers. Using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), we associated observations of E. radiata abundance from video transects with environmental variables. These relationships were then used to predict the distribution of E. radiata across our 756.1 km(2) study area off the coast of Victoria, Australia. A reserved dataset was used to test the accuracy of these predictions. We found that the abundance distribution of E. radiata is strongly associated with depth, presence of rocky reef, curvature of the reef topography, and wave exposure. In addition, the GLMM methodology allowed us to adequately account for spatial autocorrelation in our sampling methods. The predictive distribution map created from the best GLMM predicted the abundance of E. radiata with an accuracy of 72%. The combination of LiDAR and multibeam bathymetry allowed us to model and predict E. radiata abundance distribution across its entire depth range for this study area. Using methods like those presented in this study, we can map the distribution of macroalgae species, which will give insight into ecological communities, biodiversity distribution, carbon uptake, and potential sequestration.

Due to multiple, spatially and temporally varying influences on surface water temperature, (e.g., solar radiation, water depth, tidal stage, turbidity, and industrial activities) multi-temporal remote sensing observations might effectively be used to link these drivers with observations. However, while low- to moderate-resolution sensors provide temporally continuous observations, large pixel sizes have proven problematic in coastal regions where shoreline influences on pixel radiance contaminate the radiation signal leaving the water surface. To alleviate this problem, we used a dense stack of Landsat TM/ETM+ thermal imagery organized by day of year of acquisition, thus producing a climatology of water temperature. We use these data to analyze the spatial patterns of water surface temperature climatology (e.g., average maximum and minimum temperatures) for the past thirty years. We also explore the impact of power plant thermal effluent on water surface temperature climatology of the Chesapeake Bay tributaries. Finally, we divide the Landsat record into 5-year intervals, and calculate the water surface temperature climatology for each period. Trends in water surface temperature over the Landsat record were then compared against air temperature records available from coastal NOAA weather stations. The resulting data exhibit broad scale patterns, such as water surface climatology differences between the main stem of the Bay and its tributaries. The results also include the influence of urbanization and industrialization such as increases in impervious surface area and thermal effluent from power plants. Trends of increasing water surface temperature and air temperature were found for more than 92% of the Bay. While water temperature was always similar to 2-3 degrees cooler than the air temperature, water temperature has been increasing more rapidly than air temperature in some areas, particularly in the main stem of the Bay and in the Potomac estuary. Therefore, there is a detectable impact of global change on the Chesapeake Bay in the form of an increase in water temperature, which can only partially be explained by increasing air temperatures.

The proposed methodology depends on choosing a proper deformation trend(s) to accurately describe the earthquake deformation signature by studying the deformation time series of a single GPS station. The modeled deformation trend is subtracted from the unwrapped phase maps to separate the main deformation signature from the imposed errors. Some deformation components, not described by the model(s), will leak to the residual phase maps which will be subjected to temporal and spatial filtering. The final corrected unwrapped phase maps are estimated by restoring the modeled deformation trend to the filtered residual phase maps and finally the deformation time series is estimated using a least squares technique. The proposed methodology was designed to retrieve complex and fine surface deformations in areas that have been affected by large dominating deformation signatures and contain at a least single GPS station. The methodology was tested using Envisat-ASAR C-band images and validation was carried out using GPS stations resulting in a mean RMS error of 6.9 mm. The estimated deformation time series shows a differential postseismic deformation pattern that can be attributed to an off Boso peninsula motion triggered by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake.

Species composition and green vegetation (GV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), impervious, and soil cover fractions were mapped using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis with a spectral library derived from 7.5 m imagery. Temperature-Emissivity Separation (TES) was accomplished using the MASTER TES algorithm. Pixel-based accuracy exceeded 50% for 23 species and land cover classes and approached 75% based on pixel majority in reference polygons. An inverse relationship was observed between CV fractions and LST. This relationship varied by dominant plant species/vegetation class, generating unique LST GV clusters. We hypothesize clustering is a product of environmental controls on species distributions, such as slope, aspect, and elevation as well as species-level differences in canopy structure, rooting depth, water use efficiency, and available soil moisture, suggesting that relationships between LST and plant species will vary seasonally. The potential of HyspIRI as a means of providing these seasonal relationships is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Our findings show that both LDA and MESMA are able to discriminate among species to a high degree of accuracy in most ecosystems, with LDA performing slightly better. Spectral dimension reduction generally improved these results, particularly in conjunction with MESMA. Within each ecosystem, both the number and identities of functional types present, as well as the spatial distribution of dominant species, played a strong role in classification accuracy. In a pooled ecosystem classification, using CDA and LDA, we discriminated among 65 classes with an overall accuracy of 70% for the validation library, using only a 6% training sample. Our results suggest that a spaceborne imaging spectrometer such as HyspIRI will be able to map dominant plant species on a broader scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Spacebome differential Interferometry SAR has proven a remarkable potential in wetland applications, including water level monitoring in high spatial resolution. However, due to the absence of ground observations for calibration and validation, long term monitoring of water depth, which is essential to evaluate ecosystem health of wetlands, is difficult to be estimated from spacebome InSAR data. We present a new differential synthetic aperture radar method for temporal evolution of water depth in wetlands. The presented technique is based on distributed scatter interferogram technique in order to provide a spatially dense hydrological observation for coastal wetlands, which are characterized by high temporal decorrelation. This method adapts a strategy by forming optimum interferogram network to get a balance between maximum interferometric information preservation and computational cost reduction, and implements spatial adaptive filtering to reduce noise and enhance fringe visibility on distributed scatterers. Refined InSAR observation is tied to absolute reference frame to generate long term high resolution water level time-series using stage data. We transform water level time-series to long term observation of water depth with assistance of a dense measurement network of water depth. We present water depth time-series obtained using the data acquired from 2007 to 2010 by the ALOS satellite, which supplied significant information to evaluate ecological performance of wetland restoration in the Yellow River Delta.

Both methods are based on Bayesian theory and were trained using data from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) lidar onboard the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite. Results were evaluated by comparing to independent CALIPSO-CALIOP observations and to a one-year ground-based cloud dataset composed from five different remote sensing systems over the observation site in Cabauw in the Netherlands. In addition, results were compared to two different cloud masks; one derived from the geostationary Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) sensor and one from the Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility Clouds (CMSAF), Albedo and Radiation dataset from AVHRR data (CLARA-A1). It was demonstrated that the probabilistic methods compare well with the referenced satellite datasets and for daytime conditions they provide even better performance than the reference methods. Among the two probabilistic approaches, it was found that the formulation based on a Naive Bayesian formulation (denoted PPS-Prob Naive) performed clearly superior to the formulation based on a linear summation of conditional cloud probabilities (denoted PPS-Prob SPARC) for daytime conditions. For the study based on the observations over the Cabauw site, the overall daytime Kuipers Skill Score for PPS-Prob Naive was 0.84, for PPS-Prob SPARC 0.79, for CLARA-A1 0.74 and for SEVIRI 0.66. Corresponding results for night-time conditions were less favourable for the probabilistic formulations (Kuipers Skill Score 0.74 for PPS-Prob Naive, 0.68 for PPS-Prob SPARC, 0.80 for CLARA-A1 and 0.79 for SEVIRI) but still relatively close to the reference dataset The Cabauw distribution of cloudiness occurrences in different octa categories was reproduced very closely by all methods, including the probabilistic formulations. Results based on Cabauw observations were also largely in good agreement with results deduced from comparisons with the CALIPSO-CALIOP cloud mask.   The PPS-Prob Naive approach will be implemented in an upcoming version of the Polar Platform System (PPS) cloud software issued by the EUMETSAT Nowcasting Satellite Application Facility (NWC SAF). It will also be used in the second release of the CMSAF CLARA cloud climate data record based on historic AVHRR GAC data (to be denoted CIARA-A2). (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Remote sensing of urban expansion across large areas provides information on the spatial and temporal patterns of growth that are essential for understanding differences in socioeconomic and political factors that spur different forms of development, as well the social, environmental, and climatic impacts that result. However, mapping urban expansion globally is challenging: urban areas have a small footprint compared to other land cover types, their features are small, they are heterogeneous in both material composition and configuration, and the form and rates of new development are often highly variable across locations. Here we demonstrate a methodology for monitoring urban land expansion at continental to global scales using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The new method focuses on resolving the spectral and temporal ambiguities between urban/non-urban land and stable/changed areas by: (1) spatially constraining the study extent to known locations of urban land; (2) integrating multi-temporal data from multiple satellite data sources to classify c. 2010 urban extent; and (3) mapping newly built areas (2000-2010) within the 2010 urban land extent using a multi-temporal composite change detection approach based on MODIS 250 m annual maximum enhanced vegetation index (EVI). We test the method in 15 countries in East-Southeast Asia experiencing different rates and manifestations of urban expansion. A two-tiered accuracy assessment shows that the approach characterizes urban change across a variety of socioeconomic/political and ecological/climatic conditions with good accuracy (70-91% overall accuracy by country, 69-89% by biome). The 250 m EVI data not only improve the classification results, but are capable of distinguishing between change and no-change areas in urban areas. Over 80% of the error in the change detection can be related to definitional issues or error propagation, rather than algorithm error. As such, these methods hold great potential for routine monitoring of urban change, as well as for providing a consistent and up-todate dataset on urban extent and expansion for a rapidly evolving region.

The performance of the estimations obtained from regression models is usually assessed with figures of merit such as the standard error of calibration, the standard error of prediction or the ratio of performance deviation. All of these parameters are estimated during the model building and validation stages to evaluate the global model performance. Beyond these global indicators, the evaluation of the uncertainty that affects predictions is a major trend in analytical chemistry and chemometrics but not yet in hyperspectral imagery. Several approximate expressions and resampling methods have been proposed to estimate the prediction uncertainty when using multivariate calibrations from laboratory spectra. Based on these propositions, this paper studies a process of mapping and analyzing the uncertainties that affect soil property predictions obtained from VNIR/SVVIR airborne data using several methods.

The different cases yielded insights into the sources of uncertainty and showed that uncertainty analysis can guide the user to better sampling, better calibration and ultimately better mapping.

However, the applications are significantly limited by the persistent presence of atmospheric contamination and snow cover in the NDVI time series. Several approaches have been developed for smoothing and fitting the time series of biweekly NDVI composites but the capabilities of depicting land surface dynamics are method dependent. Using a time series of daily EVI2 (two band enhanced vegetation index) from AVHRR long term data record (LTDR) (19821999), this study reconstructed a global dataset of spatially and temporally consistent and continuous daily vegetation index. Specifically, the EVI2 outliers were removed and missing observations were filled explicitly based on biophysical properties of vegetation growing cycles. The EVI2 temporal trajectory was then reconstructed using a hybrid piecewise logistic model which is biophysically meaningful in describing vegetation growth. Moreover, the confidence for each annual time series in each individual pixel was quantified by determining both the proportion of good quality satellite observations and the agreement index of model fitting during a vegetation growing season. Finally, verification was performed, which indicated that the reconstructed EVI2 trajectory reflects well the field observations of seasonal green vegetation cover and the flux tower measurements of interannual gross primary productivity variation.

First, mean and standard deviation values of image object training sites were evaluated, and used as the basis for forming preliminary land cover class thresholds for each subregion. Then, a combination of additional refined thresholds, hierarchical rules, and a supervised nearest neighbor algorithm (eCognition Feature Space Optimization) employing several features as primary inputs (mean, standard deviation, seasonal change detection, brightness, maximum difference, area, roundness, brightness, compactness, shape index, and length/width) was utilized, resulting in the definition and classification of ten habitat classes: Forest/Woodland, Riparian Forest, Open Wood Savanna, Open Wood Savanna subject to prolonged flooding, Open Grass Savanna, Agriculture, Swampy Grassland, Swampy Mixed Savanna, Vazantes, and Water. This classification was achieved with an overall accuracy of 80% for the entire Pantanal. The produced habitat spatial distribution maps will provide vital information for determining refuge zones for terrestrial species, and connectivity of aquatic habitats during the dry season, as well as providing crucial baseline data to aid in monitoring changes in the region, and to help define conservation strategies for habitat in this wetland.

However, previous DTC model-based methods require four or more LST observations in one diurnal cycle and neglect the angular effect of remotely sensed LSTs. This research proposes a hybrid method combining a DTC model with a linear temperature mixing model to interpolate DTCs over consecutive days. We call this method the diurnal linear hybrid model (DLHM). This model treats the DTC of a mixed pixel as a weighted linear combination of the DTC of each component, which is considered invariant in the neighborhood, and then employs the multi-temporal and multi-angular LST observations of multiple pixels and the corresponding angular component fractions to formulate enough observations to retrieve the DTC parameters of each component With this method, the DTCs of the mixed pixels in the neighborhood can be reconstructed using four or fewer LST observations per day, wherein the angular effect is considered. Simulated data and actual daily MODIS acquisitions are utilized to perform DIEM, and S-VISSR-derived LSTs and another interpolation method based on a surface energy balance model (ZHAN12)are used to evaluate the model. The mean absolute differences (MADs) compared with S-VISSR/LSTs are 1.64 K in October and 2.48 K in March, while those compared with ZHAN12/LSTs are 1.13 K in October and 2.38 K in March. The neglect of atmospheric attenuation in DLHM, the angular effect, and the aberrant values of S-VISSR/LSTs are the primary sources of the biases. The atmospheric condition, surface cover, and missing data also affect the model performance. A two-endmember strategy is found to be more stable and results in a higher accuracy than a four-endmember strategy over agricultural areas. The DTCs of vegetation, moist soil, high albedo and dark impervious surfaces in the four seasons are retrieved by DLHM and inter-compared to show the relationship between DTC and environmental conditions and land surface properties. This method can be useful in modeling long time series of LSTs and has the potential for studying the urban thermal environment on a diurnal scale. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Model-based inference does not require probability samples and when used with synthetic estimation can circumvent small or no-sample difficulties associated with probability-based inference. The study focused on estimating proportion forest area using Landsat data for a study area in Minnesota, USA, and aboveground biomass using airborne laser scanning data for a study area in Hedmark County, Norway. For both study areas, model-based inference was used to estimate the components necessary for constructing confidence intervals for population means for non-sampled areas. The estimates were compared to simple random sampling, model-assisted, and model-based estimates that would have been obtained if the areas had been sampled.

In the United States the U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program monitors the forested land base with field data collected over a permanent network of sample plots. Although these plots are visited repeatedly through time there are large temporal gaps (e.g. 5-10 years) between remeasurements such that many forest canopy disturbances go undetected. In this paper we demonstrate how Landsat time series (LTS) can help improve FIA\'s capacity to estimate disturbance by 1.) incorporating a new, downward looking response variable which is more sensitive to picking up change and 2.) providing historical disturbance maps which can reduce the variance of design-based estimates via post-stratification. To develop the LTS response variable a trained analyst was used to manually interpret 449 forested HA plots located in the Uinta Mountains of northern Utah, USA. This involved recording cause and timing of disturbances based on evidence gathered from a 26-year annual stack of Landsat images and an 18-year, periodically spaced set of high resolution (similar to 1 m) aerial photographs (e.g. National Aerial Image Program, NAIP and Google Earth). In general, the Landsat data captured major disturbances (e.g. harvests, fires) while the air photos allowed more detailed estimates of the number of trees impacted by recent insect outbreaks. Comparing the LTS and FIA field observations, we found that overall agreement was 73%, although when only disturbed plots were considered agreement dropped to 40%. Using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, we compared distributions of live and disturbed tree size (height and DBH) and found that when LTS and FIA both found non-stand clearing disturbance the median disturbed tree size was significantly larger than undisturbed trees, whereas no significant difference was found on plots where only FIA detected disturbance. This suggests that LTS interpretation and FIA field crews both detect upper canopy disturbances while RA crews alone add disturbances occurring at or below canopy level. The analysis also showed that plots with only LTS disturbance had a significantly greater median number of years since last FIA measurement (6 years) than plots with both FIA and LTS disturbances (2.5 years), indicating that LTS improved detection on plots which had not been field sampled for several years. Next, to gauge the impact of incorporating LTS disturbances into the FIA estimation process we calculated design-based estimates of disturbance (for the period 1995-2011) using three response populations 1.) LTS observations, 2.) FIA field observations, and 3.) Combination of FIA and LTS observations. The results showed that combining the FIA and LTS observations led to the largest and most precise (i.e. smallest percent standard error) estimates of disturbance. In fact, the estimate based on the combined observations (486,458 ha, +/-47,101) was approximately 65% more than the estimate derived solely with FIA data (294,295 ha, +/-44,242). Lastly, a Landsat forest disturbance map was developed and tested for its ability to post-stratify the design-based estimates. Based on relative efficiency (RE), we found that stratification mostly improved the estimates derived with the LTS response data. Aside from insects (RE = 1.   26), the estimates of area affected by individual agents saw minimal gain, whereas the LTS and combined FIA + LTS estimates of total disturbance saw modest improvement, with REs of 1.43 and 1.50 respectively. Overall, our results successfully demonstrate two ways LTS can improve the completeness and precision of disturbance estimates derived from FIA inventory data.

The spatio-temporal resolution, the accuracy and the spatial coverage among the data differ widely. For example, ICESat, a spacebome laser profiler, has a high temporal resolution but sparse spatial coverage which places the nearest ground track to the calving front of the Kangerlussuag Glacier in East Greenland, our study site, 30 km up stream. On the other hand, stereoscopic DEMs provide almost continuous spatial coverage, but at a lower accuracy. This is a typical scenario for many rapidly changing outlet glaciers in Greenland where a fusion of the disparate data sets is highly desirable to construct detailed spatio-temporal histories of elevation change. We present in this paper how our recently developed SERAC method (Surface Elevation Reconstruction And Change detection) is well suited to cope with this fusion problem. More specifically, we describe a novel approach to adjust stereoscopic DEMs to the laser altimeny point cloud, based on height corrections determined from the time-series of elevation changes calculated by SERAC. These corrections are then used in a height adjustment of the DEMs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Cyanobacteria blooms are a major concern in this region due to water quality issues interfering with the conservation of the whole ecosystem. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations can be extremely high (up to about 500 mg/m(3) in some cases) during cyanobacteria blooms, which are often associated with a surface accumulation of algae. The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) was used to acquire 52 images covering the summers of 2004 to 2011. These images were analyzed to map Chl-a concentrations and the presence of scum using two different band ratio algorithms applied to atmospherically-corrected data. The results identify wind speed as the main driving factor in the surface accumulation of algae, as well as in the spatial distribution of Chl-a. The utility of microwave images was also assessed, as since any cloud cover obviously hampers the use of optical data. Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) images were collected synchronously with the MERIS data and the normalized radar cross-section (NRCS) signal was corrected for the contribution of wind for the purposes of correlating the results with the MERIS-derived Chl-a concentrations. In general, there was a stepwise decrease in the NRCS for high values of Chl-a (>50 mg/m3) with wind speeds in the range of 2 to 6 m/s. Under these conditions, our results demonstrate that optical and microwave signals can be used in combination to improve our understanding of cyanobacteria blooming.

More specifically, the objectives of this study include investigating the daily, seasonal, and interannual variations of PRI and LUE; linking PRI variations to the main influencing meteorological and eco-physiological variables; and evaluating the performance of PRI as a remote-sensing proxy of LUE under different environmental conditions. The data analysis was performed at different time scales within the season using moving temporal windows and between years. On a seasonal scale, statistical analyses revealed positive relationships between PRI and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (aPAR) and negative relationships between PRI and LUE. Over shorter periods of a few days, the signs of these relationships remained unchanged; however, their correlations were strongly improved. The highest correlations were most often observed over periods characterized by clear or slightly overcast skies. However, all the periods of clear skies did not involve improvements in the relations of PRI vs. aPAR or PRI vs. LUE. Temporal variations of the intercept (called PRI in this study) of PRI vs. aPAR regressions suggest the presence of a temporal trend that may reflect seasonal changes of the biochemical characteristics of the canopy. Regardless of the cause of this trend, it is important to note that once PRI was subtracted from the measured PRI, the correlations between the corrected PRI and LUE for each year were significantly improved, and a stable multi-year model was obtained. Nevertheless, further studies are required to explain the temporal changes of PRI during the season and to develop a more accurate disentangling approach that would make PRI-based remote-sensing of ecosystem light-use efficiency less sensitive to confounding factors related to spatial and temporal changes in the structural and biochemical properties of the canopy.

The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data used in this study consists of seven independent data sets: one ascending and one descending ERS-1/2 and ENVISAT frames, together spanning July 1995-September 2010, and three RADARSAT-2 frames spanning February 2009-October 2012. During the July 1995-October 2012 period we observe fast ground subsidence with a maximum rate of about 2 cm/year in the Greater Vancouver region that includes the Fraser River Delta and the cities of Burnaby, Richmond, Surrey, New Westminster and Vancouver. The rapidly accelerating subsidence is observed beneath the Vancouver International Airport, SkyTrain terminal as well as several agricultural and industrial locales. These time series suggest that the subsidence rate at the studied regions does not decrease with time, as suggested in previous studies, but remains steady or increases. These results also demonstrate the importance of acquiring and appropriately estimating longer time series, as previous studies on the same Greater Vancouver area may have misinterpreted the long term ground deformation rate and direction and underestimated the potential hazard. The long term impact of this subsidence on urban infrastructure can be significant and needs to be investigated further.

A new approach is developed to estimate aerosol scattering reflectance from satellite data based on a look-up table of in situ water-leaving reflectance. A decision rule is set to determine the water-leaving component of the total satellite-measured radiance from the table under an assumption that aerosol scattering reflectance follows the Angstrom law. The epsilon spectrum, obtained from the ratio of aerosol scattering reflectance, is used to select the two closest aerosol models for determining the corrected epsilon values, which is adjusted to new values according to the reference wavelength. The actual aerosol scattering reflectance is obtained from the mean value of the reflectance and the new epsilon spectrum. The performance of the model is evaluated using the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) imagery, showing that the component of aerosol scattering reflectance can be completely separated from the total satellite-measured radiance, and effects of non-zero water-leaving reflectance can be eliminated over highly turbid waters. The accuracy is validated by in situ measured aerosol optical thickness (AOT) using a handheld multi-band sun photometer and the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measured AOT data during the 2006 winter cruise and 2007 autumn cruise over the East China Sea (ECS). The analysis gives the mean relative errors of 23.73% and 32.04%, respectively. Our analysis shows that aerosol scattering reflectance can be significantly overestimated over turbid waters when using the atmospheric correction method based on the black ocean assumption (BOA). It may also have some errors over oceanic waters because a small 1% bias of satellite-measured reflectance in the near-infrared (NIR) bands will lead to a relatively large error of similar to 10% in aerosol scattering reflectance in Band 1. This error will spread to water-leaving reflectance, possibly leading to negative values of water-leaving reflectance. This amplifying effect of aerosol scattering reflectance can be limited by matching aerosol models using epsilon spectrum in our model. Because the assumption of aerosol scattering reflectance following the Angstrom law can eliminate effects of different types of waters including open ocean, coastal regions, lakes and rivers, our model offers a potentially universal algorithm for estimating aerosol scattering reflectance from satellite remote sensing data.

The atmospheric influences on the MODIS data are removed using an improved shortwave infrared band-based (ISWIR-based) model, which is capable of retrieving spectral remote sensing reflectance within 19% uncertainty. The K-d(490) data was quantified from the MODIS images after atmospheric correction using the SSA model and Wang\'s model. The study results indicate that the SSA model produces 31.51% uncertainty in deriving K-d(490) from MODIS data, which is 12.1% higher than Wang\'s model.

In a scenario of climate change and increased anthropogenic pressure, detailed monitoring of the water resources provides a fundamental tool to assess the ecosystem health and identify potential threats.   Donana wetlands, in Southwest Spain, dry out every summer and progressively flood in fall and winter to a maximum extent of 30,000 ha. The wetland filling up process was monitored in detail during the 2006-2007 hydrologic cycle by means of twenty-one Envisat/ASAR scenes, acquired at different incidence angles in order to maximize the observation frequency. Flood mapping from the two uncorrelated ASAR channel data alone was proved unfeasible due to the complex casuistic of Donana cover backscattering. This study addresses the synergistic utilization of the ASAR data together with Donana\'s digital elevation model and vegetation map in order to achieve flood mapping. Filtering and clustering algorithms were developed for the automated generation of Donana flood maps from the ASAR images. The use of irregular filtering neighborhoods adapted to the elevation contours drastically improved the ASAR image filtering. Edge preservation was excellent, since natural edges closely follow terrain contours. Isotropic neighborhoods were assumed of a single class and their intensities were averaged. As a result, intensity fluctuations due to speckle and texture over areas of the same cover type were smoothed remarkably.   The clustering and classification algorithm operate on individual sub-basins, as the pixel elevation is more accurately related to the cover classes within them. Vegetation and elevation maps plus knowledge of Donana backscattering characteristics from preceding studies were initially used to select seed pixels with high confidence on their class membership. Next, a region growing algorithm extends the seed regions with new pixels based on their planimmetric adjacency and backscattering Mahalanobis distance to the seeds.   During the seed region growth, new pixels\' possible classes are not constrained to their cover type according to the vegetation map, so the algorithm is able to capture temporal changes in the vegetation spatial distribution. Comparison of the resultant classification and concurrent ground truth yielded 92% of flood mapping accuracy. The flood mapping method is applicable to the available ASAR images of Donana from six other hydrologic cycles. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

To accurately detect dispersion of bio-optical properties, remote sensors require ample signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to sense small variations in ocean color without saturating over bright pixels, an atmospheric correction that can accommodate significant water-leaving radiance in the near infrared (NIR), and spatial and temporal resolution that coincides with the scales of variability in the environment. Several current and historic space-borne sensors have met these requirements with success in the open ocean, but are not optimized for highly red-reflective and heterogeneous waters such as those found near river outflows or in the presence of sediment resuspension. Here we apply analytical approaches for determining optimal spatial resolution, dominant spatial scales of variability (\"patches\"), and proportions of patch variability that can be resolved from four river plumes around the world between 2008 and 2011. An offshore region in the Sargasso Sea is analyzed for comparison. A method is presented for processing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua and Terra imagery including cloud detection, stray light masking, faulty detector avoidance, and dynamic aerosol correction using short-wave- and near-infrared wavebands in extremely turbid regions which pose distinct optical and technical challenges. Results show that a pixel size of similar to 520 m or smaller is generally required to resolve spatial heterogeneity in ocean color and total suspended materials in river plumes. Optimal pixel size increases with distance from shore to similar to 630 m in nearshore regions, similar to 750 m on the continental shelf, and similar to 1350 m in the open ocean. Greater than 90% of the optical variability within plume regions is resolvable with 500 m resolution, and small, but significant, differences were found between peak and nadir river flow periods in terms of optimal resolution and resolvable proportion of variability.

The only available long-term biological dataset at large spatial and temporal scales is remotely-sensed chlorophyll observations (an index of phytoplankton biomass) derived using satellite measurements of ocean colour. Yet such observations have rarely been compared with in situ data in the Red Sea. In this paper, satellite chlorophyll estimates in the Red Sea from the MODIS instrument onboard the Aqua satellite are compared with three recent cruises of in vivo fluorometric chlorophyll measurements taken in October 2008, March 2010 and September to October 2011. The performance of the standard NASA chlorophyll algorithm, and that of a new band-difference algorithm, is found to be comparable with other oligotrophic regions in the global ocean, supporting the use of satellite ocean colour in the Red Sea. However, given the unique environmental conditions of the study area, regional algorithms are likely to fare better and this is demonstrated through a simple adjustment to the band-difference algorithm.

Most radiative transfer models use discrete ordinate method or finite volume method for solving the transport equation. Both of the methods have their own algorithms to discretize the 4 pi space, under the constraint of satisfying geometric symmetry and specific moments. This paper introduces a new direction discretization and oversampling scheme, IUSD, and compares it with the other methods in simulating satellite signals. This method considers the constraint of geometric shape of angular sector, and iteratively discretizes the 4 pi space under this constraint. The result shows that IUSD is quite competitive in the accuracy of simulating remote sensing images. Furthermore, the new method provides a flexibility for adding any oversampling angular region, with any number of additional directions, using an optimal approach in terms of the total number of directions. Several case studies are presented. It turns out that the regional oversampling has significant influence for strong anisotropic scattering. This method has been implemented in the latest code of DART 3D radiative transfer model. DART is available for scientific purpose upon request. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Sun-induced fluorescence has the potential to provide a synoptic global view of aspects of phytoplankton biology that go beyond biomass by observing the quantum yield of fluorescence. While several algorithms have been developed to retrieve the quantum yield, they are prone to biases from different sources. In this study, we assessed the accuracy of several ocean color algorithms to estimate phytoplankton chlorophyll or absorption when they are used together with Sun-induced fluorescence algorithms. Our analysis led us to develop a new type of algorithm for retrieving variability in the quantum yield of fluorescence. Based on a three dimensional lookup table, this algorithm avoided many of the biases present in older algorithms and provided distributions of the quantum yield that showed significant differences compared to previous methods. This algorithmic approach also has the advantage of being robust with respect to sensor characteristics and to the set of underlying proxies that are used, namely phytoplankton biomass, the absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter, and the incident irradiance. As such, it would be suitable for merging data from multiple satellite ocean color sensors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

However, smoke plume rise forecasts and characterizations of fire intensity require additional information, including the FRP over the fire area (FRPf) and per fire area (or fire radiative flux), both of which can be calculated through a bi-spectral retrieval of sub-pixel fire area and temperature. This study, the second in a two-part series, examines the sources of error and the corresponding uncertainties in a sub-pixel algorithm that calculates FRPf for fire pixels identified at 1 km(2) nominal spatial resolution by the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire detection algorithm (collection 5). Radiative transfer simulations are incorporated to account for atmospheric effects as a function of Earth-satellite geometry at 3.96 and 11 mu m (MODIS fire detection channels), and show that the 11 mu m channel is highly sensitive to variations in column water vapor amount. By investigating several fire events in California, considerable variations in retrieved fire area, occasionally by more than 50%, are observed when comparing the mid-latitude summer climatology and observation-based atmospheric profiles that are used in the sub-pixel retrieval algorithm. While regions of dry, brown vegetation may also increase the potential for error via the surface emissivity assumption, the algorithm is much more sensitive to errors in 11 mu m background brightness temperature, where an error of only 1.0 K may alter the retrieved fire area by an order of magnitude or more. An independent application, using the Texas wildfire event of September 2011, reveals that the sub-pixel retrieval can even become irrelevant for 17.6% of the available MODIS fire pixels as a result of noise in the background region causing the 11 mu m background brightness temperature to become wanner than the fire pixel, especially during daytime scenes. The various sources of uncertainty in the estimates of FRPf and fire area can be reduced through the summation of individual pixel-level retrievals for large clusters of fire pixels, which can be defined based on the resolution of a mesoscale model grid. In comparison to the standard MODIS pixel-based FRP, the flux of FRPf, defined as total FRPf divided by the retrieved fire area, is shown to have a stronger and statistically significant correlation with surface (10-meter) wind speed and air temperature, especially for large fire pixel clusters, where the respective linear correlation coefficients are 0.55 and 0.77. These strong relationships suggest that, while additional studies are warranted, the flux of FRPf may offer the potential for improved characterizations of the meteorological effects on fire intensity compared to the standard pixel-based FRP.

The spatial distribution of these habitats influence the abundance and interactions of animal species, and the change or destruction of habitat can cause the disturbance of key biological processes. This study uses multi-temporal L-band ALOS/PALSAR, C-band RADARSAT-2, and ENVISAT/ASAR data to map ecosystems and create a lake distribution map of the Lower Nhecolandia subregion in the Brazilian Pantanal. First, backscattering analysis was conducted on individual training objects to gain a better understanding of the backscattering characteristics of each class. Then, a Level 1 object-based image analysis (OBIA) classification based on hierarchical principles first classified the region into \"Lakes\" and \"Not Lakes\". This was followed by a Level 2 classification defining six vegetation habitats (Forest Woodland, Open Wood Savanna, Open Grass Savanna, Agriculture, Swampy Grassland and Vazantes) which was achieved at an overall accuracy of 83%. A Level 3 classification defined the \"Lakes\" class into a) Fresh (baias) and Brackish (salinas) lakes (accuracy results of 98%); and a further classification level dividing the fresh lakes, b) Fresh lakes with floating and emergent vegetation (baias), and Fresh lakes with the presence of Typha (salobras), and including the Brackish lakes (salinas) (overall accuracy results of 81%). The results of this study provide the first fine spatial resolution classification showing the spatial distribution of terrestrial and aquatic habitats for the entire subregion of Lower Nhecolandia using dual season, dual polarization C and L-band SAR imagery. The produced maps will provide valuable habitat information to help define conservation strategies and aid further research in the area. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Data with a finer spatial resolution should improve regional estimations of GPP (gross primary productivity), since they better capture the variation in a heterogeneous landscape. The main objective of this study was to investigate if MODIS 500 m reflectance data can be used to drive empirical models for regional estimations of GPP in Nordic forests. The performance of the proposed models was compared with the MODIS 1 km GPP product. Linear regression analyses were made on 8-day averages of eddy covariance GPP from three deciduous and ten coniferous sites in relation to MODIS 8-day composite data and 8-day averages of modeled incoming PPFD (photosynthetic photon flux density). Time series of EVI2 (two-band enhanced vegetation index) were calculated from MODIS 500 m reflectance data and smoothed by a curve fitting procedure. For most sites, GPP was fairly strongly to strongly related to the product of EVI2 and PPFD (Deciduous: R-2=0.45-0.86, Coniferous: R-2=0.49-0.90). Similar strengths were found between GPP and the product of EVI2 and MODIS 1 km daytime LST (land surface temperature) (R-2=0.55-0.81, 0.57-0.77) and between GPP and EVI2, PPFD and daytime LST in multiple linear regressions (R-2=0.73-0.89,0.65-0.93). One year of data was collected from all coniferous sites to derive a general empirical model for GPP versus (1) the product of EVI2 and PPFD (R-2=0.70), (2) the product of EVI2 and daytime LST (R-2=0.62) and (3) EVI2, PPFD and daytime LST (R-2=0.72). These three models were then validated at six sites for the remaining years by linearly relating eddy covariance GPP to modeled GPP, which resulted in fairly strong to strong relationships for most sites (R-2=0.49-0.91, RMSE=0.63-1.22 gC m(-2) day(-1), R-2=0.53-0.73, RMSE=0.90-1.43 gC m(-2) day(-1) R-2=0.56-0.87, RMSE=0.79-1.11 gC m(-2) day(-1)). In comparison, similar validation strengths were found for the latest collection 5.1 of the MODIS 1 km GPP product (R-2=0.59-0.88, RMSE=0.80-1.16 gC m(-2) day(-1)). The main conclusion is that the suggested empirical models driven by MODIS 500 m reflectance data can be used for regional estimations of Nordic forest GPP, while preserving a finer resolution than the MODIS 1 km GPP product.

Consequently, the large horizontal distance between typhoon eyes on the sea surface and on the cloud top implies that the vertical wind shear profile is considerably more complex than generally expected.

The predictability of the vegetation cycle is analysed with a model based on a reconstruction approach that fully relies on the dataset. Two parameters deduced from the growth of the forecast error are considered: the horizon of effective predictability, H-E, which is the horizon at which a satisfying prediction can be effectively forecasted at a given level of error, and the level of noise.   Predictability is therefore analysed with regard to the horizon of prediction and the spatial scale; the influence of the model\'s dimensions is also discussed. The analysis clearly indicates that the signal predictability increases, and the level of noise decreases with an expanding area. However, even though the signal is more regular, its complexity increases within the narrowing entangled trajectory, setting the level of error of any prediction at a minimum of 15%, which matches the level of noise characteristic of the AVHRR-NDVI data series.   The forecasting error quickly increases with the horizon of prediction, setting the optimum horizon of predictability in the range of 2 to 4 decades, with high intra-annual variability. At the short horizon of 1 decade, a resolution of 16 km(2) is reasonable to achieve an accuracy of approximately 20%. At the longer horizon of 3 decades, only low resolutions (256 km(2) or lower) give an accuracy equal to or better than 35%. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Single trees are automatically detected by a 3D segmentation technique applied directly to laser point clouds, which uses the normalized cut segmentation combined with a stem detection method. A subsequent classification identifies tree species using salient features that are defined on single 3D tree segments and utilize the additional information extracted from the reflected laser signal by the waveform decomposition. The stem volume and diameter at breast height (DBH) are estimated by a multiple linear regression analysis which uses tree shape parameters derived from the 3D model of the trees. Experiments were conducted in the Bavarian Forest National Park with full waveform LiDAR data. The data were captured with the Riegl LMS Q-560 system at a point density of 25 points/m(2) under leaf-off and leaf-on conditions. The analysis of waveform data in the tree structure shows that the intensity and pulse width discriminate stem points, crown points and ground points significantly. The unsupervised classification of deciduous and coniferous trees is in the best case 93%. If a supervised classification is applied the accuracy is slightly increased to 95%. Concerning stem volume estimation, in the case of coniferous trees the study shows a low RMSE of about 0.46 m(3) to 0.43 m(3) both for the watershed segmentation and the new normalized cut segmentation. In the case of deciduous trees RMSE has increased by 14% in leaf off condition and by 4% in leaf on condition for the normalized cut segmentation. A similar trend can be confirmed for DBH estimation as well, even demonstrating a larger benefit from 3D segmentation. The study results proved that the 3D segmentation approach is not only capable of detecting more small trees in the lower forest layer but also can allow to derive more promising features of single trees used for yielding better performance in species classification and estimation of forest structural parameters, especially for deciduous trees.

Minimally disturbed reference areas provide a useful guide, but suitable benchmarks are usually difficult to identify. We describe a method that uses a unique conceptual framework to identify reference areas from multitemporal sequences of ground cover derived from Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery. The method does not require ground-based reference sites nor GIS layers about management. We calculate a minimum ground cover image across all years to identify locations of most persistent ground cover in years of lowest rainfall. We then use a moving window approach to calculate the difference between the window\'s central pixel and its surrounding reference pixels. This difference estimates ground-cover change between successive below-average rainfall years, which provides a seasonally interpreted measure of management effects. We examine the approach\'s sensitivity to window size and to cover-index percentiles used to define persistence. The method successfully detected management-related change in ground cover in Queensland tropical savanna woodlands in two case studies: (1) a grazing trial where heavy stocking resulted in substantial decline in ground cover in small paddocks, and (2) commercial paddocks where wet-season spelling (destocking) resulted in increased ground cover. At a larger scale, there was broad agreement between our analysis of ground-cover change and ground-based land condition change for commercial beef properties with different a priori ratings of initial condition, but there was also some disagreement where changing condition reflected pasture composition rather than ground cover. We conclude that the method is suitably robust to analyse grazing effects on ground cover across the 1.3 x 10(6) km(2) of Queensland\'s rangelands. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, in many studies, there are usually a limited number of field plots associated with each vegetation type, making it difficult to fit reliable statistical models for each vegetation type. To address this problem, this study used mixed-effects modeling to integrate airborne lidar data and vegetation types derived from aerial photographs for biomass mapping over a forest site in the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California, USA. It was found that the incorporation of vegetation types via mixed-effects models can improve biomass estimation from sparse samples. Compared to the use of lidar data alone in multiplicative models, the mixed-effects models could increase the R-2 from 0.77 to 0.83 with RMSE (root mean square error) reduced by 10% (from 80.8 to 72.2 Mg/ha) when the lidar metrics derived from all returns were used. It was also found that the SAF (Society of American Forest) cover types are as powerful as the NVC (National Vegetation Classification) alliance-level vegetation types in the mixed-effects modeling of biomass, implying that the future mapping of vegetation classes could focus on dominant species. This research can be extended to investigate the synergistic use of high spatial resolution satellite imagery, digital image classification, and airborne lidar data for more automatic mapping of vegetation types, biomass, and carbon.

In particular, InSAR data from satellite radar sensors are gaining increasing attention for their cost-effectiveness and unique technical features, making possible the monitoring of large areas, even revisiting the past. Moreover, more advanced InSAR techniques (PSInSAR (TM), SqueeSAR (TM)) developed in the last decade are capable of providing millimeter precision, comparable to optical leveling, and a high spatial density of displacement measurements, over long periods of time without need of installing equipment or otherwise accessing the study area.   Thanks to the high density and quality of the measurements the PSInSAR data can be successfully used in geophysical inversion, to measure the permeability of oil reservoirs and/or to evaluate the possibilities and risks due to seismic faulting in the sequestration of CO2. In these cases, the precision, the sub weekly frequency of the measurements and the time required for the data to be available are the most important aspects, more relevant than the spatial resolution.   Until recently, the main limitation to the application of InSAR was the relatively long revisiting time (24 or 35 days) and the quite long waiting period for the delivery of the acquired data. The new Sentinel-1 mission, based on a constellation of two satellites, is expected to reduce such limitations guaranteeing a revisit cycle of 6 days on a global scale and in particular over Europe and Canada and providing a high level of service reliability with near-real-time delivery of data within 24 h, important for risk management applications. The new X band satellite SAR constellations like Cosmo Skymed and TerraSAR X have also a short revisiting time, from 4 to 11 days. However, their coverage is limited to well definite areas, and an expensive decision has to be made if to initiate the observations on any target. Sentinel 1, instead, yields global and costless observations and thus, after the end of the commissioning phase, will always produce present and past ground motion for any target.   It\'s important to underline that the millimeter accuracy, applying the InSAR analysis with Sentinel-1, will be achieved within a shorter observation time frame, thanks to the increased number of acquired images per year (Attema et al. 2010, De Zan et al., 2008). Results from ground based radar show that this improved precision is indeed achievable from C to Ku band, provided that an accurate model of the delay due to atmospheric water vapor is available or that precise reference points are close by.

Special attention is paid to the impact of the improved resolution of new X-band radar imagery on the PSI results, in terms of quality and quantity of useful information. This evaluation is supported by theoretical modelling as well as by the comparison of results from x-band (CSK) and C-band (ENVISAT) PSI for two areas of interest: one in Italy and the other in Switzerland. It is demonstrated that with respect to medium resolution ENVISAT PS processing, fewer CSK high resolution images are sufficient to achieve comparable precision of the mean displacement velocity estimates. This, together with the shorter revisit times provided by the CSK( constellation, can be very important when dealing with emergency situations. Furthermore, it is quantified that from about 3 to 11 times greater PS densities are obtained with the higher resolution X-band data. This implies more information about ground surface displacements as well as improved landslide monitoring and slope instability investigation capabilities. Furthermore, ground displacement measurements can be interpreted without local knowledge of the focus area or in situ controls, and, nonetheless, guide single hillslope instability assessments with support of Google Earth and its high resolution optical imagery. This \"blind\" approach will allow one to monitor remote and poorly known regions at high risk of potentially disastrous slope failures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In recent years, land surface albedo products have been generated using data from various satellites. However, some problems exist in those products due to either the failure of the current retrieving procedures resulting from persistent clouds and/or abrupt surface changes, or the reduced temporal or spatial coverage, which may limit their applications. Rapidly generated albedo products that help reduce the impacts of cloud contamination and improve the capture of events such as ephemeral snow and vegetation growth are in demand.   In this study, we propose a method for estimating the land surface albedo from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data using a short temporal window. Instead of executing the atmospheric correction first and then fitting the surface reflectance in the current MODIS albedo procedure, the atmospheric properties (e.g., aerosol optical depth) and surface properties (e.g., surface bidirectional reflectance) were estimated simultaneously. Validations were carried out using various data sources including ground measurements (e.g., from the Surface Radiation (SURFRAD) Network and Greenland Climate Network (GC-Net)) and MODIS AERONET-based Surface Reflectance Validation Network (MODASRVN) data. The results showed comparable albedo estimates with both MODIS data and ground measurements, and the MODASRVN instantaneous surface reflectance was in good agreement with the reflectance estimation from our method. Aerosol optical depth (ADD) retrievals over SURFRAD and MODASRVN sites were also compared with ground measurements. Validation results showed estimation accuracies similar to those of MODIS aerosol products. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, such increase is variable in space and time, due to the role that the different plant life-forms can play after the fire disturbance. In addition, the absence of reliable species richness information can be a limitation for decision making when postfire management actions are needed. In this study we used QuickBird imagery to develop multiscale, spatially explicit predictive models of species richness in a burned area 1 year after a fire. The study area is an abandoned dehesa (a Quercus suber (cork oak) open woodland with shrubs) of central Spain, which had been affected by a large summer fire. Two 90 x 180 m macroplots were established, where species richness and percentage cover of various plant life-forms were measured at three spatial scales (1, 25, and 100 m(2)). Total plant species richness was related to reflectance and spectral contrast derived from the multispectral bands of QuickBird and to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), by using regression tree analysis (RTA) and boosted regression trees (BRT). Furthermore, for the biophysical support of such models, plant species richness was related to field-based compositional data, and life-form percentage cover to satellite data. Results indicated that the relationship between species richness, reflectance and spectral contrast was strong and scale-dependent (1 m(2): adjusted R-2=0.50; 25m(2): adj. R-2=0.65; 100 m(2): adj. R-2=0.79), whereas NDVI played a minor role at all scales. At the finest sampling scale, a low range of species richness was related to a high variability of spectral and texture responses, due to the excess of spatial detail of the pixel size. At 25 m2, a higher range of species richness was related to a low variability of spectral and texture responses; this was probably due to the fact that the sampling size only captured certain portions of plant individuals or life-form associations. At the largest sampling scale (100 m(2)), the highest variability of species richness was adequately related to the spectral and texture responses, due to the spatial fit between the sampling plot size and both the pixel- and plant-sizes. Species richness was closely linked to life-form percentage cover (mainly to herbaceous plant cover), and life-form cover was adequately explained by satellite data, giving a biophysical support to our predictive models. Reflectance and spectral contrast were good predictive tools of total plant species richness at the largest sampling scale, but their predictive power diminished at the smaller scales. This was explained by the range of species richness measured at each scale, the spatial arrangement of species, and the ratio of the spatial resolution (both for pixels from satellite data and for ground sampling plots) to the size of the objects. These results contribute to improve our knowledge about the link between high spatial resolution remotely sensed data and species richness at different sampling scales. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

To the best of our knowledge, this paper, presents the first attempt to obtain forest variables at plot level based on TerraSAR-X stereo SAR images (non-interferometric data). The study set consisted of 109 circular test plots for which forest variables were observed by performing tree-specific measurements. The statistical features were calculated for each test plot from the elevation values extracted from stereo SAR data. This was followed by predicting field-observed plot-level forest variables from the features derived from stereo SAR data using the Nearest Neighbors approach which employs the Random Forest technique in selection of the nearest neighbors. The relative errors (RMSE%) for predicting the stem volume, basal area, mean forest canopy height, and mean diameter values were 34.0%, 29.0%, 14.0%, and 19.7%, respectively. The results indicate that there was no clear saturation level in stem volume estimation. In this case study, stem volumes were predicted up to about 400 m(3)/ha. In the light of these results, stereo SAR data appears to be an interesting remote-sensing technique for future forest inventories. For example, stereo SAR data could have high potential in forest inventories as the SAR-based features can be adapted to the methods currently used in inventories. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Because of extensive urban development in the past fifty years, this ecologically significant community type is highly degraded and fragmented. To conserve endangered CSS communities, monitoring internal conditions of communities is as crucial as monitoring distributions of the community type in the region. Vegetation type mapping and field sampling of individual plants provide ecologically meaningful information about CSS communities such as spatial distribution and species compositions, respectively. However, both approaches only provide spatially comprehensive information but no information about internal conditions or vice versa. Therefore, there is a need for monitoring variables which fill the information gap between vegetation type maps and field-based data. A number of field-based studies indicate that life-form fractional cover is an effective indicator of CSS community health and habitat quality for CSS-obligated species. This study investigates the effectiveness of remote sensing approaches for estimating fractional cover of true shrub, subshrub, herb, and bare ground in CSS communities of southern California. Combinations of four types of multispectral imagery ranging from 0.15 m resolution scanned color infrared aerial photography to 10 m resolution SPOT 5 multispectral imagery and three image processing models - per-pixel, object-based, and spectral mixture models - were tested.   An object-based image analysis (OBIA) routine consistently yielded higher accuracy than other image processing methods for estimating all cover types. Life-form cover was reliably predicted, with error magnitudes as low as 2%. Subshrub and herb cover types required finer spatial resolution imagery for more accurate predictions than true shrub and bare ground types. Positioning of sampling grids had a substantial impact on the reliability of accuracy assessment, particularly for cover estimates predicted using multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) applied to SPOT imagery. Of the approaches tested in this study, OBIA using pansharpened QuickBird imagery is one of the most promising approaches because of its high accuracy and processing efficiency and should be tested for more heterogeneous CSS landscapes. MESMA applied to SPOT imagery should also be examined for effectiveness in estimating factional cover over more extensive habitat areas because of its low data cost and potential for conducting retrospective studies of vegetation community conditions.

At present, there are mainly two sources of precipitation estimates: raingauge stations and remote sensing technology. However, a large number of studies demonstrated that traditional point measurements based on raingauge stations cannot reflect the spatial variation of precipitation effectively, especially in ungauged basins. The technology of remote sensing has greatly improved the quality of precipitation observations and produced reasonably high resolution gridded precipitation fields. These products, derived from satellites, have been widely used in various parts of the world. However, when applied to local basins and regions, the spatial resolution of these products is too coarse. In this paper, we present a statistical downscaling algorithm based on the relationships between precipitation and other environmental factors in the Qaidam Basin such as topography and vegetation, which was developed for downscaling the spatial precipitation fields of these remote sensing products. This algorithm is demonstrated with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 dataset, the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and SPOT VEGETATION. The statistical relationship among precipitation, DEM and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is a proxy for vegetation, is variable at different scales: therefore, a multiple linear regression model was established under four different scales (0.25 degrees, 0.50 degrees, 0.75 degrees and 1.00 degrees, respectively). By applying a downscaling methodology, TRMM 3B43 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees precipitation fields were downscaled to 1 x 1 km pixel precipitation for each year from 1999 to 2009. On the basis of three criteria, these four downscaled results were compared with each other and the regression model established at the resolution of 0.50 degrees was selected as the final downscaling algorithm in this study. The final downscaled results were validated by applying the observations for a duration of 11 years obtained from six raingauge stations in the Qaidam Basin. These results indicated that the downscaled result effectively captured the trends in inter-annual variability and the magnitude of annual precipitation with the coefficient of determination r(2) ranging from 0.72 to 0.96 at six different raingauge stations.

SWE estimates from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) passive microwave data were analyzed for six winter seasons, 2004-2009. A second, independent estimate of SWE was calculated for these same time periods using a hydrologic model of the watershed with a temperature index snow model driven using the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) gridded estimates of precipitation. The results demonstrate that passive microwave SWE values from SSM/I and AMSR-E are comparable. The AMSR-E sensor had improved performance in the early winter and late spring, which suggests that AMSR-E is better at detecting shallow snowpacks than SSM/I. The timing and magnitude of SWE values from the snow model and the passive microwave observations were sometimes similar with a correlation of 0.53 and accuracy between 55 and 62%. However, the modeled SWE was much lower than the AMSR-E SWE during two winter seasons in which TRMM data estimated lower than normal precipitation. Modeled runoff and reservoir storage predictions improved significantly when peak AMSR-E SWE values were used to update the snow model state during these periods. Rapid decreases in passive microwave SWE during precipitation events were also well aligned with flood flows that increased base flows by 170 and 940%. This finding supports previous northern latitude studies which indicate that the passive microwave signal\'s lack of scattering can be used to detect snow melt. The current study\'s extension to rain on snow events suggests an opportunity for added value for flood forecasting.

MERIS full resolution chla concentrations and in situ data were obtained on the Galician (NW Spain) shelf and in three adjacent rias (embayments), sites of extensive mussel culture that experience frequent harmful algal events. Regionally focused algorithms (Regional neural network for rias Babcas or NNRB) for the retrieval of chla in the Galician rias optically complex waters were tested in comparison to sea-truth data. The one that showed the best performance was applied to a series of six MERIS (FR) images during a summer upwelling cycle to test its performance. The best performance parameters were given for the NN trained with high-quality data using the most abundant cluster found in the rias after the application of fuzzy c-mean clustering techniques (FCM). July 2008 was characterized by three periods of different meteorological and oceanographic states. The main changes in chla concentration and distribution were clearly captured in the images. After a period of strong upwelling favorable winds a high biomass algal event was recorded in the study area. However, MERIS missed the high chlorophyll upwelled water that was detected below surface in the ria de Vigo by the chla profiles, proving the necessity of in situ observations. Relatively high biomass \"patches\" were mapped in detail inside the rias. There was a significant variation in the timing and the extent of the maximum chla areas. The maps confirmed that the complex spatial structure of the phytoplankton distribution in the rias Baixas is affected by the surface currents and winds on the adjacent continental shelf. This study showed that a regionally specific algorithm for an ocean color sensor with the characteristics of MERIS in combination with in situ data can be of great help in chla monitoring, detection and study of high biomass algal events in an area affected by coastal upwelling such as the rias Baixas.

In this study, we assessed the uncertainty in NPP estimates of the Vertically Generalized Productivity Model using a Monte Carlo approach. We did not consider the uncertainty stemming from the basic model formulation, but restricted the uncertainty analysis to input terms, which were generated by, or related to, remote sensing. The study was based on global monthly remote sensing data from 2005. We found that the typical distribution of uncertainty around the model output could be approximated by a lognormal probability density function. On average, NPP value in a grid cell was overestimated by 6%, relative to the mean of the corresponding uncertainty distribution. The random component of uncertainty in NPP, expressed as the coefficient of variation, amounted to an average of 108%. The systematic positive errors in individual grid cells built up to an overestimate of 2.5 Pg C in the annual global NPP of 46.1 Pg C. The largest individual contributor to the random uncertainty in NPP was the input term that describes the physiological state of phytoplankton. However, the biggest contribution to the systematic uncertainty in the model output came from the parameter that represents changes in the rate of chlorophyll-normalized photosynthesis with depth. Therefore, improvements in the accuracy of these two terms would have the largest potential to decrease the input-related uncertainty in the model NPP estimates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The LSA SAF LSTs were compared with ground LST measurements in the conventional temperature-based (T-based) method. We also validated the LSA SAF LST product by using an alternative radiance-based (R-based) method, with ground LSTs calculated from MSG-SEVIRI channel 9 brightness temperatures (at 10.8 mu m) through radiative transfer simulations using atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles together with surface emissivity data. Two lakes were also used for validation with the R-based method. Although the LSA SAF LST algorithm works mostly within the uncertainty expectation of +/- 2 K, both validation methods showed significant biases for the LSA SAF LST product, up to 1.5 K in some cases. These biases, with the LSA SAF LST product overestimating reference values, were also observed in previous studies. Nevertheless, the present work points out that the biases are related to the land surface emissivities used in the operational generation of the product. The use of more appropriate emissivity values for the test sites in the LSA SAF LST algorithm led to better results by decreasing the biases by 0.7 K for the shrubland validation site. Furthermore, we proposed and checked an alternative algorithm: a quadratic split-window equation, based on a physical split-window model that has been widely proved for other sensors, with angular-dependent coefficients suitable for the MSG coverage area. The T-based validation results for this algorithm showed LST uncertainties (robust root-mean-squared-errors) from 0.2 K to 0.5 K lower than for the LSA SAF LST algorithm after the emissivity replacement. Nevertheless, the proposed algorithm accuracies were significantly better than those obtained for the current LSA SAF LST product, with an average accuracy difference of 0.6 K. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

ICESat altimetry data are used to provide precise lake elevations of the Tibetan Plateau (IF) during the period of 2003-2009. Among the 261 lakes examined ICESat data are available on 111 lakes: 74 lakes with ICESat footprints for 4-7 years and 37 lakes with footprints for 1-3 years. This is the first time that precise lake elevation data are provided for the 111 lakes. Those ICESat elevation data can be used as baselines for future changes in lake levels as well as for changes during the 2003-2009 period. It is found that in the 74 lakes (56 salt lakes) examined, 62 (i.e. 84%) of all lakes and 50 (i.e. 89%) of the salt lakes show tendency of lake level increase. The mean lake water level increase rate is 0.23 m/year for the 56 salt lakes and 0.27 m/year for the 50 salt lakes of water level increase. The largest lake level increase rate (0.80 m/year) found in this study is the lake Cedo Caka. The 74 lakes are grouped into four subareas based on geographical locations and change tendencies in lake levels. Three of the four subareas show increased lake levels. The mean lake level change rates for subareas I, II, III, IV, and the entire TP are 0.12, 0.26, 0.19, -0.11, and 0.2 m/year, respectively. These recent increases in lake level, particularly for a high percentage of salt lakes, supports accelerated glacier melting due to global warming as the most likely cause. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

These measures of canopy architecture are compared with canopy height information retrieved from the airborne laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS). Both the escape probability and the directional reflectance approaches achieve good results, with correlation coefficients in the range 0.54-0.82, although escape probability results are usually slightly better. This suggests that MODIS 500 m BRDF data can be used to extrapolate canopy heights observed by widely-spaced satellite LIDAR swaths to larger areas, thus providing wide-area coverage of canopy height.

A procedure to monitor an inundation event using multitemporal COSMO-SkyMed data is presented in this paper. The methodology is based on an automatic image segmentation technique and on the use of a well-established electromagnetic model to correctly explain the radar return from the image segments. It is applied to a series of five COSMO-SkyMed images regarding an event chosen as a test bed, i.e., a flood occurred in Northern Italy in 2009. In order to associate the segments to the classes of flooded or non-flooded areas, some reference multi-temporal backscattering trends have been assumed with the aid of the theoretical model. Using these reference trends as a training set, a classification algorithm has been developed to generate a map of the flood evolution. Although the methodology needs to be further tested on different case studies, our investigation demonstrates the feasibility and the utility of a combined use of an electromagnetic scattering model and an advanced image processing technique for inundation monitoring.

China\'s Lake Taihu, which is located in the Yangtze River delta in one of the world\'s most urbanized and heavily populated areas, contains consistently highly turbid waters in addition to frequent large seasonal algae blooms in various lake regions. Thus, satellite data processing requires use of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) atmospheric correction algorithm. Specifically for Lake Taihu, an iterative SWIR-based atmospheric correction algorithm has been developed and proven to provide reasonably accurate water-leaving radiance spectra data. Using MODIS-Aqua measurements, the blue-green algae bloom in Lake Taihu in 2007 has been studied in detail, demonstrating the importance and usefulness of satellite water color remote sensing for effectively monitoring and managing a bloom event. Seasonal and interannual variability, as well as spatial distributions, of lake water properties were studied and assessed using the MODIS-Aqua measurements from 2002 to 2008. Results show that overall waters in Lake Taihu are consistently highly turbid all year round, with the winter and summer as the most and least turbid seasons in the lake, respectively. Extremely turbid waters in the winter are primarily attributed to strong winter winds that lead to significant amounts of total suspended sediment (TSS) in the water column. In addition, MODIS-Aqua-measured water-leaving radiance at the blue band is consistently low in various bay regions in Lake Taihu, indicating high algae concentration in these regions. Climatological water property maps, including normalized water-leaving radiance spectra nL(w)(lambda), chlorophyll-a concentration, and water diffuse attenuation coefficient at the wavelength of 490 nm (K-d(490)), are derived from all MODIS-Aqua data from 2002 to 2008 for Lake Taihu, showing overall spatial distribution features for the lake water property.

In this study, focusing on the Galician rias (NW Spain), algorithms based on neural network (NN) techniques were developed for the retrieval of chla concentration in optically complex waters, using Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) data. There is considerable interest in the accurate estimation of chla for the Galician rias, because of the economic and social importance of the extensive culture of mussels, and the high frequency of harmful algal events. Fifteen MERIS full resolution (FR) cloud-free images paired with in situ chla data (for 2002-2004 and 2006-2008) were used for the development and validation of the NN. The scope of NN was established from the clusters obtained using fuzzy c-mean (FCM) clustering techniques applied to the satellite-derived data. Three different NNs were developed: one including the whole data set, and two others using only points belonging to one of the clusters. The input data for these latter two NNs was chosen depending on the quality level, defined on the basis of quality flags given to each data set. The fitting results were fairly good and proved the capability of the tool to predict chla concentrations in the study area. The best prediction was given for the NN trained with high-quality data using the most abundant cluster data set. The performance parameters in the validation set of this NN were R-2 = 0.86, mean percentage error (MPE) = -0.14, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.75 mg m(-3), and relative RMSE = 66%. The NN developed in this study detected accurately the peaks of chla, in both training and validation sets. The performance of the Case-2-Regional (C2R) algorithm, routinely used for MERIS data, was also tested and compared with our best performing NN and the sea-truthing data. Results showed that this NN outperformed the C2R, giving much higher R-2 and lower RMSE values.   This study showed that the combination of in situ data and NN technology improved the retrieval of chla in Case 2 waters, and could be used to obtain more accurate chla maps. A local-based algorithm for the chla retrieval from an ocean colour sensor with the characteristics of MERIS would be a great support in the quantitative monitoring and study of harmful algal events in the coastal waters of the Rias Baixas. The limitations and possible improvements of the developed chla algorithms are also discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The utilized sigma degrees data set was collected by a truck mounted scatterometer over a corn field and is supported by a comprehensive set of ground measurements, including soil moisture and vegetation biomass. Comparison of sigma degrees measurement against simulations by the Integral Equation Method (IEM) surface scattering model (Fung et al., 1992) shows that the sigma degrees measurements are dominated either by an attenuated soil return or by scattering from vegetation depending on the antenna configuration and growth stage. Further, the measured sigma degrees is found to be sensitive to soil moisture even at peak biomass and large incidence angles, which is attributed to scattering along the soil-vegetation pathway.   For the simulation of C-band sigma degrees and the retrieval of soil moisture two methods have been applied, which are the semi-empirical water cloud model (Attema & Ulaby, 1978) and a novel method. This alternative method uses the empirical relationships between the vegetation water content (W) and the ratio of the bare soil and the measured sigma degrees to correct for vegetation. It is found that this alternative method is superior in reproducing the measured sigma degrees as well as retrieving soil moisture. The highest retrieval accuracies are obtained at a 35 degrees incidence angle leading to RMSD\'s of 0.044 and 0.037 m(3) m(-3) for the HH and VV-polarization, respectively. In addition, the sensitivity of these soil moisture retrievals to W and surface roughness parameter uncertainties is investigated. Published by Elsevier Inc.', '[Joseph, A. T.; O\'Neill, P.

In this paper, a novel approach for automated dark-spot detection using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity imagery is presented The key to the approach is making use of a spatial density feature to differentiate between dark spots and the background. A detection window is passed through the entire SAR image. First, intensity threshold segmentation is applied to each window. Pixels with intensities below the threshold are regarded as potential dark-spot pixels while the others are potential background pixels. Second, the density of potential background pixels is estimated using kernel density estimation within each window Pixels with densities below a certain threshold are the real dark-spot pixels. Third, an area threshold and a contrast threshold are used to eliminate any remaining false targets. In the last step, the individual detection results are mosaicked to produce the final result. The proposed approach was tested on 60 RADARSAT-1 ScanSAR intensity Images which contain verified oil-spill anomalies. The same parameters were used in all tests For the overall dataset, the average of commission error, omission error, and average difference were 70%, 6.1%, and 04 pixels, respectively The average number of false alarms was 0 5 per unit image and the average computational time for a detection window was 1.2 s using a PC-based MATLAB platform. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is fast, robust and effective. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The basic approach uses three components: 1) below-sea-surface spectral downward scalar irradiance calculated from a radiative transfer model (STAR) and corrected for clouds using TOMS UV reflectivities; 2) surface-ocean spectral diffuse attenuation coefficients and absorption coefficients for chromophoric dissolved organic matter retrieved from SeaWiFS ocean color using the SeaUV/SeaUVc algorithms: and (3) spectral apparent quantum yield for the photochemical reaction considered. The output of the model is a photochemical rate profile, Psi(PR)(z), where z represents depth.   We implemented the model for carbon monoxide (CO) photochemistry using an average apparent quantum yield spectrum and generated a monthly climatology of depth-resolved CO photoproduction rates in the global ocean. The climatology was used to compute global budgets and investigate the spatial and seasonal variabilities of CO photoproduction in the ocean. The model predicts a global CO photoproduction rate of about 41 TgC yr(-1), in good agreement with other recent published estimates ranging from 30 to 84 TgC yr(-1). The fate of photochemically derived CO and its role in global biogeochemical cycles remains uncertain however, with biological consumption and sea-air exchange competing for its removal in the surface ocean. Knowledge of the vertical distribution of CO photoproduction is critical in the quantification of the relative magnitudes of these sink mechanisms. The depth-resolution capabilities of this model, together with US Naval Research Laboratory climatology for mixed layer depths allowed further estimation that >95% of the total water-column CO photoproduction occurs within the mixed layer on a global, yearly basis. Despite this compelling figure, the model also suggests significant spatio-temporal variability in the vertical distribution of CO photoproduction in the subtropical gyres, where up to 40% of water-column CO can be produced below the mixed layer during summertime.   While the approach can be applied to other photochemical fluxes (e.g. DIC formation or DMS removal), accurate quantification of such processes with remote sensing will be limited until the mechanisms regulating observed oceanic variability in the apparent quantum yields are better understood. Minor modification to this model can also make it applicable for the determination of the effects of UV and visible solar radiation on sensitive biological systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

However, combining ecological ground truth information and remote sensing datasets for mapping approaches is complicated by the complexity of ecological datasets. In this study, we present a new approach that uses high spatial resolution hyperspectral datasets to map vegetation units of a semiarid rangeland in Central Namibia. Field vegetation surveys provide the input to the workflow presented in this study. The collected data were classified by hierarchical cluster analysis into seven vegetation units that reflect different ecological states occurring in the study area. Spectral indices covering vegetation and soil characteristics were calculated from hyperspectral remote sensing imagery and used as environmental variables in a constrained ordination by applying redundancy analysis (RDA). The resulting statistical relationships between vegetation data and spectral indices were transferred into images of ordination axes, which were subsequently used in a supervised fuzzy c-means classification approach relying on a k-NN distance metric. Membership images for each vegetation unit as well as a confusion image of the classification result allowed a sound ecological interpretation of the resulting hard classification map. Classification results were validated with two independent reference datasets. For an internal and external validation dataset, overall accuracy reached 98% and 64% with kappa values of 0.98 and 0.53, respectively. Critical steps during the mapping workflow were highlighted and compared with similar mapping approaches. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The algorithm retrieves aerosol optical depth (AOD), fine-mode fraction (FMIF), and aerosol type in 500 m x 500 m resolution. All the products are retrieved over clear water which is defined by surface reflectance ratio between 640 nm and 860 nm (SRR) less or equal to 2.5, while only AOD is retrieved over turbid water (SRR>2.5) due to high surface reflectance. To develop optimized algorithm for the target area of GOCI, optical properties of aerosol are analyzed from extensive observation of AERONET sunphotometers to generate lookup table. Surface reflectance of turbid water is determined from 30-day composite of Rayleigh- and gas corrected reflectance. By applying the present algorithm to MODIS top-of-the atmosphere reflectance, three different aerosol cases dominated by anthropogenic aerosol contains black carbon (BC), dust, and non-absorbing aerosol are analyzed to test the algorithm. The algorithm retrieves AOD, and size information together with aerosol type which are consistent with results inferred by RGB image in a qualitative way. The comparison of the retrieved AOD with those of MODIS collection 5 and AERONET sunphotometer observations shows reliable results. Especially, the application of turbid water algorithm significantly increases the accuracy in retrieving AOD at Anmyon station. The sensitivity study between MODIS and GOCI instruments in terms of relative sensitivity and scattering angle shows promising applicability of the present algorithm to future GOCI measurements.

The shelf edge front in the NW part of the Black Sea separates biologically productive and often eutrophicated shelf waters from the open sea waters. A large mesoscale eddy (diameter about 120 km) was formed away from the shelf front southwest of Crimean peninsula in the spring 2005. The eddy moved towards the shelf break and repeatedly attached itself to the shelf edge front causing its disturbance and formation of a cross-shelf jet and a Chl-a rich filament spiralling around the eddy periphery. The jet represented an important cross-shelf transport mechanism sustaining an average cross-frontal flux of shelf waters of 0.3 Sv over period of 40 days. The total transport of water in our case study was equivalent to 40% of the overall volume of water on the shelf. Formation of the filament significantly increased the length of contact between shelf and deep sea waters from 70 km at the base of filament to about 800 km along its sides, thus providing a highly efficient mixing mechanism.

Digital change detection was applied on three pairs of multi-temporal NDVI images from Landsat TM/ETM+ to detect significant reductions in the photosynthetic activity of forested areas during disturbed growing seasons. An image segmentation gap-fill procedure was developed in order to compensate missing scan lines in Landsat ETM+ \"SLC-off\" images. To account for a potential dependence of local outbreak levels on elevation, a digital elevation model was included in the defoliation recognition process. The resulting damage distribution map allowed for the assessment of outbreak intensity and distribution at the stand level and was combined with tree-ring data and historical documents to produce a multi-evidence outbreak detection. Defoliation events in the tree-ring data were recognized as significant deviations from temperature related growth.   Our outbreak detection scheme allowed for the reconstruction of nine major insect outbreaks over the past two centuries. The reconstruction proved reliable but only robust for severe defoliation events. Low-intensity incidents were not captured. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) systems, of all remote sensing technologies, have been demonstrated to yield the most accurate estimates of aboveground biomass for forested areas over a wide range of biomass values. However, these systems are limited by considerations including large data volumes and high costs. Within the constraints imposed by the nature of the satellite mission, the GeoScience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) aboard ICESat has provided data conferring information regarding forest vertical structure for large areas at a low end user cost. GLAS data have been demonstrated to accurately estimate forest height and aboveground biomass especially well in topographically smooth areas with homogeneous forested conditions. However in areas with dense forests, high relief, or heterogeneous vegetation cover, GLAS waveforms are more complex and difficult to consistently characterize. We use airborne discrete return LiDAR data to simulate GLAS waveforms and to subsequently deconstruct coregistered GLAS waveforms into vegetation and ground returns. A series of waveform metrics was calculated and compared to topography and vegetation information gleaned from the airborne data. A model to estimate maximum relief directly from waveform metrics was developed with an R-2 of 0.76 (n = 110), and used for the classification of the maximum relief of the areas sensed by GLAS. Discriminant analysis was also conducted as an alternative classification technique. A model was also developed estimating forest canopy height from waveform metrics for all of the data (R-2 = 0.81, n = 110) and for the three separate relief classes: maximum relief 0-7 m (R-2 = 0.83, n = 44), maximum relief 7-15 m (R-2 = 0.88, n = 41) and maximum relief > 15 m (R-2 = 0.75, n = 25). The moderate relief class model yielded better predictions of forest height than the low relief class model which is attributed to the increasing variability of waveform metrics with terrain relief. The moderate relief class model also yielded better predictions than the high relief class model because of the mixing of vegetation and terrain signals in waveforms from high relief footprints. This research demonstrates that terrain can be accurately modeled directly from GLAS waveforms enabling the inclusion of terrain relief, on a waveform specific basis, as supplemental model input to improve estimates of canopy height.

The retrieval is conceptually based on an analytical asymptotic radiative transfer model which predicts spectral bidirectional snow reflectance as a function of the grain size and ice absorption. The snow grains are modeled as fractal rather than spherical particles in order to account for their irregular shape. The analytical form of solution leads to an explicit and fast retrieval algorithm. The time series analysis of derived grain size shows a good sensitivity to snow melting and snow precipitation events. Pre-processing is performed by a Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm, which includes gridding MODIS data to 1 km resolution, water vapor retrieval, cloud masking and an atmospheric correction. MAIAC cloud mask is a new algorithm based on a time series of gridded MODIS measurements and an image-based rather than pixel-based processing. Extensive processing of MODIS TERRA data over Greenland shows a robust discrimination of clouds over bright snow and ice. Because in-situ grain size measurements over Greenland were not available at the time of this work, the validation was performed using data of Aoki et al. (Aoki, T., Hori, M., Motoyoshi, H.. Tanikawa, T., Hachikubo, A., Sugiura, K., et al. (2007). ADEOS-II/GLI snow/ice products - Part II: Validation results using GLI and MODIS data. Remote Sensing of Environment, 111, 274-290) collected at Barrow (Alaska, USA), and Saroma, Abashiri and Nakashibetsu (Japan) in 2001-2005. The retrievals correlate well with measurements in the range of radii similar to 0.1-1 mm, although retrieved optical diameter may be about a factor of 1.5 lower than the physical measured diameter. As part of validation analysis for Greenland, the derived grain size from MODIS over selected sites in 2004 was compared to the microwave brightness temperature measurements of SSM/I radiometer which is sensitive to the amount of liquid water in the snowpack. The comparison showed a good qualitative agreement, with both datasets detecting two main periods of snowmelt. Additionally, MODIS grain size was compared with predictions of the snow model CROCUS driven by measurements of the automatic weather stations of the Greenland Climate Network. We found that the MODIS value is on average a factor of two smaller than CROCUS grain size. This result agrees with the direct validation analysis indicating that the snow reflectance model may need a \"calibration\" factor of similar to 1.5 for the retrieved grain size to match the physical snow grain size. Overall, the agreement between CROCUS and MODIS results was satisfactory, in particular before and during the first melting period in mid June. Following detailed time series analysis of snow grain size for four permanent sites, the paper presents maps of this important parameter over the Greenland ice sheet for the March-September period of 2004.

There have been relatively few evaluations of the utility of shortwave infrared remote sensing data, and in particular hyperspectral remote sensing data, for fire detection. We used an Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) scene acquired over the 2003 Simi Fire to identify the hyperspectral index that was able to most accurately detect pixels containing fire. All AVIRIS band combinations were used to calculate normalized difference indices, and kappa was used to compare classification ability of these indices for three different fire temperature ranges. The most accurate index was named the Hyperspectral Fire Detection Index (HFDI). The HFDI uses shortwave infrared bands centered at 2061 and 2429 nm. These bands are sensitive to atmospheric attenuation, so the impacts of variable elevation, solar zenith angle, and atmospheric water vapor concentration on HFDI were assessed using radiative transfer modeling. While varying these conditions did affect HFDI values, relative differences between background HFDI and HFDI for 1% fire pixel coverage were maintained. HFDI is most appropriate for detection of flaming combustion, and may miss lower temperature smoldering combustion at low percent pixel coverage due to low emitted radiance in the shortwave infrared. HFDI, two previously proposed hyperspectral fire detection indices, and a broadband shortwave infrared-based fire detection index were applied to AVIRIS scenes acquired over the 2007 Zaca Fire and 2008 Indians Fire. A qualitative comparison of the indices demonstrated that HFDI provides improved detection of fire with less variability in background index values. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Urban remote sensing is complicated, however, by very high spectral and spatial complexity. In this paper, Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) was applied to map urban land cover using HyMap data acquired over the city of Bonn, Germany. MESMA is well suited for urban environments because it allows the number and types of endmembers to vary on a per-pixel basis, which allows controlling the large spectral variability in these environments. We employed a hierarchical approach, in which MESMA was applied to map four levels of complexity ranging from the simplest level consisting of only two classes, impervious and pervious, to 20 classes that differentiated material composition and plant species. Lower levels of complexity, mapped at the highest accuracies, were used to constrain spatially models at higher levels of complexity, reducing spectral confusion between materials. A spectral library containing 1521 endmembers was created from the HyMap data. Three endmember selection procedures, Endmember Average RMS (EAR), Minimum Average Spectral Angle (MASA) and Count Based Endmember Selection (COB), were used to identify the most representative endmembers for each level of complexity. Combined two-, three- or four-endmember models - depending on the hierarchical level - were applied, and the highest endmember fractions were used to assign a land cover class. Classification accuracies of 97.2% were achieved for the two lowest complexity levels, consisting of impervious and pervious classes, and a four class map consisting of vegetation, bare soil, water and built-up. At the next level of complexity, consisting of seven classes including trees, grass, bare soil, river, lakes/basins, road and roof/building, classification accuracies remained high at 81.7% with most classes mapped above 85% accuracy. At the highest level, consisting of 20 land cover classes, a 75.9% classification accuracy was achieved. The ability of MESMA to incorporate within-class spectral variability, combined with a hierarchical approach that uses spatial information from one level to constrain model selection at a higher level of complexity was shown to be particularly well suited for urban environments.

The need for connecting protected areas via existing habitat centers, or relatively undisturbed core areas, is greater than ever as exurbanization expands. Our objective was to make use of nationally available data sets on roads as well as information derived from satellite imagery, including impervious cover of the built environment and forest canopy density, to identify core habitat of the northeastern and mid-Atlantic USA. The identified core habitat areas, which covered 73,730 km(2) across 1177 discrete units, were stratified in terms of land ownership and management, and then analyzed in a landscape context using connectivity metrics derived from graph theory. The connectivity analysis made use of a suitability surface, derived from the land cover information, which approximated the costs incurred by hypothetical animals traversing the landscape. We show that protected areas are frequently identified as core habitat but are typically isolated, albeit sometimes buffered by adjacent multi-use lands (such as state or national forests). Over one third of the core habitat we identified has no protection, and another 42% is subject to motorized recreation or timber extraction. We provide maps showing the relative importance of core habitat areas for potentially connecting existing protected areas, and also provide an example of the vulnerability of connectivity to projected future residential development around one greater park ecosystem.

We analyzed the spectral response and temporal progress of two types of disturbances of spruce forest (bark beetle outbreak and clear-cuts) in the central part of Sumava Mountains at the border between the Czech Republic and Germany, Central Europe. The bark beetle (Ips typographus [L]) outbreak in this region in the last 20 years resulted in regional-scale spruce forest decay. Clear-cutting was done here to prevent further bark-beetle propagation in the buffer zones.   The aim of the study is to identify the differences in spectral response between the two types of forest disturbances and their temporal dynamics. General trends were analyzed throughout the study area, with sampled disturbance areas selected to assess the relationship between field vegetation data and their spectral response. Thirteen Landsat TM/ETM+ scenes from 1985 to 2007 were used for the assessment. The following spectral indices were estimated: NDMI, Tasseled Cap (Brightness, Greenness, Wetness), DI, and DI\'. The DI\', Wetness, and Brightness indices show the highest sensitivity to forest disturbance for both disturbance types (clear-cuts and bark beetle outbreak). The multitemporal analysis distinguished three different stages of development. The highest spectral differences between the clear-cuts and the bark beetle disturbances were found in the period between 1996 and 2004 with increased levels of forest disturbance (repeated measures ANOVA, Scheffe post hoc test; p <= 0.05). Clear-cut disturbance resulted in significantly higher spectral differences from the original forest and occurred as a more discrete event in comparison to bark beetle outbreak.

The p-theory has recently gained interest in the vegetation reflectance modeling community as an efficient tool for characterizing scattering in clumped foliage structures. In this short communication paper, we report empirical data of the relationship of canopy leaf area index (LAI), diffuse non-interceptance and photon recollision probability for 1032 coniferous and broadleaved forest plots measured in Finland. Our results indicate that the relationship of canopy LAI and diffuse non-interceptance is near-universal in boreal stands i.e. it does not depend on stand age, tree species or growth conditions. This allows improving parameterizations used by canopy reflectance models which utilize the photon recollision probability concept. Our results also suggest that establishing species-specific p-LAI functions for northern European forests requires more research on the influence of micro- and macroscale foliage grouping on photon recollision probability.

However, variation in canopy structure affects our ability to estimate foliar properties from airborne spectrometer data, yet these structural affects remain poorly quantified. Using leaf spectral (400-2500 nm) and chemical data collected from 162 Australian tropical forest species, along with partial least squares (PLS) analysis and canopy radiative transfer modeling, we determined the strength of the relationship between canopy reflectance and foliar properties under conditions of varying canopy structure.   At the leaf level, chlorophylls, carotenoids and specific leaf area (SLA) were highly correlated with leaf spectral reflectance (r=0.90-0.91). Foliar nutrients and water were also well represented by the leaf spectra (r=0.79-0.85). When the leaf spectra were incorporated into the canopy radiative transfer simulations with an idealistic leaf area index (LAI)=5.0, correlations between canopy reflectance spectra and leaf properties increased in strength by 4-18%. The effects of random LAI (=3.0-6.5) variation on the retrieval of leaf Properties remained minimal, particularly for pigments and SLA (r=0.92-0.93). In contrast, correlations between leaf nitrogen (N) and canopy reflectance estimates decreased from r=0.87 at constant LAI=5 to r=0.65 with randomly varying LAI=3.0-6.5. Progressive increases in the structural variability among simulated tree crowns had relatively little effect on pigment, SLA and water predictions. However, N and phosphorus (P) were more sensitive to canopy structural variability. Our modeling results suggest that multiple leaf chemicals and SLA can be estimated from leaf and canopy reflectance spectroscopy, and that the high-LAI canopies found in tropical forests enhance the signal via multiple scattering. Finally, the two factors we found to most negatively impact leaf chemical predictions from canopy reflectance were variation in LAI and viewing geometry, which can be managed with new airborne technologies and analytical methods.

This uncertainty largely arises from a lack of observations in the coastal zones. Remote sensing offers an avenue for expanding these observations by allowing for the extrapolation of relatively limited data sets of dissolved CO2 (pCO(2sw)). In this paper, predictive algorithms for PCO2sw that could be applied to remote sensing products were created from a field data set collected from September-October, 2005 in Hudson Bay, Canada. The field data showed that an effective PCO2sw interpolation algorithm could be created using sea surface temperature (SST) as a predictor, and that a slight improvement of the algorithm could be achieved if measurements of absorption due to Coloured dissolved organic material (a(CDOM)) were included. Unfortunately, satellite retrievals of a(CDOM) did not match well with in situ observations, and so only SST (obtained from the MODIS Aqua sensor) was used to create monthly Maps of PCO2sw for the period of August-October. To estimate fluxes of CO2, Constructed surfaces of PCO2sw were combined with estimates of as transfer velocity derived from QuikSCAT wind retrievals, and PCO2air based on field observations. The results of these calculations revealed that Hudson Bay acts as a source of CO2 during August and September, but reverts to a sink of CO2 in October as the water temperature decreases. Overall, a positive flux of 1.60 TgC was estimated for the region during the ice-free season. This result is in contrast to most Arctic or sub-Arctic continental shelf seas, where usually strong absorptions of CO2 are observed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Else, Brent G.

These optical properties were implemented and tested in a coupled atmosphere-snow radiative transfer model. The modeled surface spectral albedo and radiance distribution were compared with surface measurements. The results Show that the reflected radiance and irradiance over snow are sensitive to the snow grain size and its vertical profile. When inhomogeneity of the particle size distribution in the vertical is taken into account, the measured spectral albedo can be matched, regardless of the particle shapes. But this is not true for the modeled radiance distribution, which depends a lot on the particle shape. The usual \"equivalent spheres\" assumption significantly overestimates forward reflected radiances, and underestimates backscattering radiances, around the principal plane. Oil average, the aggregate shape assumption has the best agreement with the measured radiances to a mean bias within 2%. The snow optical properties with the aggregate assumption were applied to the retrieval of snow grain size over the Antarctic plateau. The retrieved grain sizes of the top layer showed similar and large seasonal variation in all years, but only small year to year variation. Using the retrieved snow grain sizes, the modeled spectral and broadband radiances showed good agreements with MODIS and CERES measurements over the Antarctic plateau. Except for the MODIS 2.13 mu m channel, the mean relative model-observation differences are within few percent. The modeled MODIS radiances using measured surface reflectance at Dome C also showed good agreement in visible channels, where radiation is not sensitive to snow grain size and the measured Surface bidirectional reflectance is applicable Over the Antarctic plateau. But modeled radiances using local, surface-measured reflectance in the near infrared yielded large errors because of the high sensitivity to the snow grain size, which varies spatially and temporally. The CERES broadband shortwave radiance is moderately sensitive to the snow grain size, comparable to the MODIS 0.86 mu m channel. The variation of broadband snow reflectance due to the season a I variation in snow grain size is about 5% in a year over the Antarctic plateau. CERES broadband radiances simulated with grain sizes retrieved using MODIS are about 2% larger than those observed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Unlike earlier techniques, which parameterize the PDF (usually as normal bivariate distributions), this approach does not constrain the surface slopes\' PDF to the shape of a particular analytical distribution. This may help to understand the real information content of L-band scattered signals, which is currently unclear. After validating the algorithm by means of end-to-end simulations, we have applied it to real data. The tests on real data show that the retrievals are robust, consistent with the results obtained with standard GNSS-reflection techniques, and in agreement with independent sources of information. Moreover, the retrieved slopes\' PDF present non-Gaussian features, such as skewness. A more in-depth analysis to check whether the skewness is a geophysical signature or an artifact of the technique, shows that it maps with the up-/down-asymmetries introduced by surface forces. In particular, this is the first time that GNSS-reflections have sensed and identified the up- and down-wind signature on the surface, putting and end to the 180 degrees ambiguity that was usually attributed to GNSS observations of directional roughness.

GOES burned areas exhibit diurnal variability with a temporal scale of half hours. The cumulative burned area during 9:00-16:00 local solar time accounts for 65%-81% of the total daily burned area. The diurnal variability is strongest in croplands compared to shrublands, grasslands, savannas, and forests. Analysis on a seasonal scale indicates that over 56% of burning occurs during summer (June-August). On average, the total annual burned area during the last seven years is 2.12 x 10(4) +/- 0.41 x 10(4) km(2). The algorithm developed in this study can be applied to obtain burned area from the detections of GOES active fires at near real time, which can greatly improve the estimates of biomass burning emissions needed for predicting air quality.

The leaf area index (LAI) is also updated dynamically by MODIS LAI production and the MODIS land surface temperature (LST) products are assimilated into CoLM. The scheme was tested and validated by observations from four automatic weather stations (BTS, DRS, MGS, and DGS) in Mongolian Reference Site of CEOP during the period of October 1, 2002 to September 30, 2003. Results indicate that data assimilation improves the estimation of soil temperature profile about 1 K. In comparison with simulation, the assimilation results of soil heat fluxes also have much improvement about 13 W m(-2) at BTS and DGS and 2 W m(-2) at DRS and MGS, respectively. In addition, assimilation of MODIS land products into land surface model is a practical and effective way to improve the estimation of land surface variables and fluxes. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Because liquid water absorbs in the shortwave infrared, the normalized difference infrared index (NDII), calculated from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper band 4 (0.76-0.90 mu m wavelength) and band 5 (1.55-1.65 mu m wavelength), can be used to determine canopy equivalent water thickness (EWT), which is defined as the water volume per leaf area times the leaf area index (LAI). Alternatively, average canopy EWT can be determined using a landcover classification, because different vegetation types have different average LAI at the peak of the growing season. The primary contribution of this study for the Soil Moisture Experiment 2004 was to sample vegetation for the Axizona and Sonora study areas. Vegetation was sampled to achieve a range of canopy EWT; LAI was measured using a plant canopy analyzer and digital hemispherical (fisheye) photographs. NDII was linearly related to measured canopy EWT with an R-2 of 0.601. Landcover of the Arizona, USA, and Sonora, Mexico, study areas were classified with an overall accuracy of 70% using a rule-based decision tree using three dates of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper imagery and digital elevation data. There was a large range of NDII per landcover class at the peak of the growing season, indicating that canopy EWT should be estimated directly using NDII or other shortwave-infrared vegetation indices. However, landcover classifications will still be necessary to obtain total vegetation water content from canopy EWT and other data, because considerable liquid water is contained in the non-foliar components of vegetation.

Our algorithm considers both the surface energy partitioning process and environmental constraints on ET. We use ground-based meteorological observations and remote sensing data from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to estimate global ET by (1) adding vapor pressure deficit and minimum air temperature constraints on stomatal conductance; (2) using leaf area index as a scalar for estimating canopy conductance; (3) replacing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index with the Enhanced Vegetation Index thereby also changing the equation for calculation of the vegetation cover fraction (F-C); and (4) adding a calculation of soil evaporation to the previously proposed RS-PM method.   We evaluate our algorithm using ET observations at 19 AmeriFlux eddy covariance flux towers. We calculated ET with both our Revised RS-PM algorithm and the RS-PM algorithm using Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO v. 4.0.0) meteorological data and compared the resulting ET estimates with observations. Results indicate that our Revised RS-PM algorithm substantially reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) of the 8-day latent heat flux (LE) averaged over the 19 towers from 64.6 W/m(2) (RS-PM algorithm) to 27.3 W/m(2) (Revised RS-PM) with tower meteorological data, and from 71.9 W/m(2) to 29.5 W/m(2) with GMAO meteorological data. The average LE bias of the tower-driven LE estimates to the LE observations changed from 39.9 W/m(2) to - 5.8 W/m(2) and from 48.2 W/m(2) to - 1.3 W/m(2) driven by GMAO data. The correlation coefficients increased slightly from 0.70 to 0.76 with the use of tower meteorological data. We then apply our Revised RS-PM algorithm to the globe using 0.05 degrees MODIS remote sensing data and reanalysis meteorological data to obtain the annual global ET (MODIS ET) for 2001. As expected, the spatial pattern of the MODIS ET agrees well with that of the MODIS global terrestrial gross and net primary production (MOD17 GPP/NPP), with the highest ET over tropical forests and the lowest ET values in dry areas with short growing seasons. This MODIS ET product provides critical information on the regional and global water cycle and resulting environment changes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Air temperature was estimated for 436 image acquisitions during the 2005 rainy season over West Africa and evaluated against in situ data from a field test site in Dahra, Northern Senegal. The methodology was adjusted using data from the test site resulting in RMSE=2.55 K, MBE=-0.30 K and R-2=0.63 for the estimated versus observed air temperatures. A spatial validation of the method using 12 synoptic weather stations from Senegal and Mali within the Senegal River basin resulted in overall values of RMSE=2.96 K, MBE=-1.11 K and R-2=0.68. The daytime temperature curve is interpolated using a sine function based on the multiple daily air temperature estimates from the SEVIRI data. These estimates (covering the 8:00-20:00 UCT time window) were in good agreement with observed values with RMSE=2.99 K, MBE=-0.70 K and R-2=0.64.

The short interval of 15 min between images makes it possible to extend traditional spectral classification with a detection of changes between images. This improves the detection of clouds and cloud shadows in instantaneous images, because these often display more variation in time than the surface. It therefore allows a more accurate mapping of surface snow cover, as is shown by a validation of the results with ground observations and other satellite data. The accurate classification of each single image allows the generation of temporal composite snow maps in near real-time, which is for example of interest for numerical weather prediction models.

Considerable strides have been made to improve large-area LULC datasets, but little emphasis has been placed on thematically detailed crop mapping, despite the considerable influence of management activities in the cropland sector on various environmental processes and the economy. Time-series MODIS 250 in Vegetation Index (VI) datasets hold considerable promise for large-area crop mapping in an agriculturally intensive region such as the U.S. Central Great Plains, given their global coverage, intermediate spatial resolution, high temporal resolution (16-day composite period), and cost-free status. However, the specific spectral-temporal information contained in these data has yet to be thoroughly explored and their applicability for large-area crop-related LULC classification is relatively unknown. The objective of this research was to investigate the general applicability of the time-series MODIS 250 in Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets for crop-related LULC classification in this region. A combination of graphical and statistical analyses were performed on a 12-month time-series of MODIS EVI and NDVI data from more than 2000 cropped field sites across the U.S. state of Kansas. Both MODIS VI datasets were found to have sufficient spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions to detect unique multi-temporal signatures for each of the region\'s major crop types (alfalfa, com, sorghum, soybeans, and winter wheat) and management practices (double crop, fallow, and irrigation). Each crop\'s multi-temporal VI signature was consistent with its general phenological characteristics and most crop classes were spectrally separable at some point during the growing season. Regional intra-class VI signature variations were found for some crops across Kansas that reflected the state\'s climate and planting time differences. The multi-temporal EVI and NDVI data tracked similar seasonal responses for all crops and were highly correlated across the growing season. However, differences between EVI and NDVI responses were most pronounced during the senescence phase of the growing season. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

A map of percent impervious surface with a standard error of 7.95% was generated using a normalized spectral mixture analysis of July 2002 Landsat TM imagery. Our analysis indicates there is a strong linear relationship between LST and percent impervious surface for all seasons, whereas the relationship between LST and NDVI is much less strong and varies by season.

Moderate resolution sensors (with pixel size ranging from 250 in to 7 km) provide frequent estimates of biophysical variables to characterize vegetation such as the leaf area index (LAI). However, the computation of LAI from moderate resolution remote sensing data induces a scaling bias on the LAI estimate if the moderate resolution pixel is heterogeneous and if the transfer function that relates remote sensing data to LAI is non-linear.   This study provides a model to evaluate and correct the scaling bias. The model is built first for a univariate semi-empirical transfer function relating LAI directly to NDVI. The scaling bias is a function of (i) the degree of non-linearity of the transfer function quantified by its second derivative and (ii) the spatial heterogeneity of the moderate resolution pixel quantified by the variogram of the high spatial resolution (20 in) NDVI image. Then, the model is extended to a bivariate transfer function where LAI is related to red and near infrared reflectances.   The scaling bias depends on (i) the Hessian matrix of the transfer function and (ii) the variograms and cross variogram of the red and near infrared reflectances. The scaling bias is investigated on several distinct landscapes from the VALERI database. Adjusting for scaling bias is critical on crop sites which are the most heterogeneous sites at the landscape level. Regarding the univariate transfer function, the magnitude of the scaling bias increases rapidly with pixel size until this size is larger than the typical spatial scale of the data. For the bivariate transfer function, it results from the addition of several components that may add up or cancel each other out. It is thus more difficult to analyze.   The accuracy of the model to estimate the scaling bias is discussed. It depends mainly on the ability of the variograms and cross variogram to represent the local dispersion variances and covariance within the moderate resolution pixel. The model is generally highly accurate at 1000 in spatial resolution for the univariate transfer function and less accurate for the bivariate transfer function. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The sensor observation in any grid cell is only partially derived from the location of the cell, with the average overlap between observations and their grid cells being less than 30%. This mismatch between grid cells and observations has strong implications for the use of reference data for the validation of MODIS products or the training of MODIS algorithms. When generating multidate composites, gridding artifacts introduce bias when spectral compositing criteria are used. Also, results indicate that the ability to generate consistent long-term remote sensing records is dependent on both consistent sensing scenarios (spectral bands, view angle distributions, geolocation error) as well as consistent compositing approaches. The band-to-band registration for the different spatial resolutions of gridded MODIS data can be poor if the different resolutions of data are gridded before aggregation. In all cases it is imprecise to characterize the subpixel properties of the coarser resolution bands using the finer resolution bands due to poor correspondence in the areas from which the observations are derived. All of the band-to-band registration problems are minimized when the MODIS data are aggregated to coarser resolutions. When validating algorithm accuracy, available data on the observation dimensions and the offsets between the grid cell and the observation should be included to ensure the quality of validation results. If this information is not available, MODIS data should be aggregated to coarser resolutions to improve the correspondence between the location of observations and grid cells. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

These products were analyzed for consistency between Terra and Aqua retrievals over the following data subsets in North America: single 8-day composite over the whole continent and annual time series over three selected MODIS tiles (1200 X 1200 km). The potential for combining retrievals from the two sensors to derive improved products by reducing the impact of environmental conditions and temporal compositing period was also explored. The results suggest no significant discrepancies between large area (from continent to MODIS tile) averages of the Terra and Aqua 8-day LAI and surface reflectances products. The differences over smaller regions, however, can be large due to the random nature of residual atmospheric effects. High quality retrievals from the radiative transfer based algorithm can be expected in 90-95% of the pixels with mostly herbaceous cover and about 50-75% of the pixels with woody vegetation during the growing season. The quality of retrievals during the growing season is mostly restricted by aerosol contamination of the MODIS data. The Terra-Aqua combined 8-day product helps to minimize this effect and increases the number of high quality retrievals by 10-20% over woody vegetation. The combined 8-day product does not improve the number of high quality retrievals during the winter period because the extent of snow contamination of Terra and Aqua observations is similar. Likewise, cloud contamination in the single-sensor and combined products is also similar. The LAI magnitudes, seasonal profiles and retrieval quality in the combined 4-day product are comparable to those in the single-sensor 8-day products. Thus, the combined 4-day product doubles the temporal resolution of the seasonal cycle, which facilitates phenology monitoring in application studies during vegetation transition periods. Both Terra and Aqua LAI products show anomalous seasonality in boreal needle leaf forests, due to limitations of the radiative transfer algorithm to model seasonal variations of MODIS surface reflectance data with respect to solar zenith angle. Finally, this study suggests that further improvement of the MODIS LAI products is mainly restricted by the accuracy of the MODIS observations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Radiative transfer modelling is performed using a fast atmospheric transmittance model and a delta-Eddington approximation for scattering. Using aerosol single scattering properties appropriate to simulation of Saharan dust gives qualitatively good simulations of dust-affected brightness temperatures. From these simulations, we show that aerosol-free brightness temperatures are tightly clustered around the principal axis (explaining 99% of variance) in a 3-dimensional brightness-temperature difference space (the axes being 3.9 mu m minus 8.7 mu m, 3.9 mu m minus 12 mu m, and 11 mu m minus 12 mu m); in contrast, brightness temperatures affected by aerosol are simulated to be significantly off-axis when transformed into this space. Although the detailed effects of aerosol on brightness temperatures are not quantitatively reproduced by our simulations, this off-axis characteristic is empirically found to be also true of Saharan-dust-affected brightness temperatures in observations. The second principal component of the brightness-temperature difference space is identified as a useful index for Saharan dust. Comparisons with independent satellite measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD, at 0.55 mu m) show that the new Saharan dust index (SDI) is loosely correlated with AOD (r=0.34). The correlation is loose because the SDI is also sensitive to the height distribution of aerosol, which affects the aerosol\'s thermal emission. The SDI is used to develop an empirical correction scheme for SST retrievals affected by Saharan dust. Application of the SDI correction scheme removes an independent error of 0.2 K from SEVIRI SSTs validated against buoys from all latitudes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Remote sensing allows consideration of the processes controlling erodibility on the same spatial continuum to avoid time-consuming and expensive fieldwork. Multi-angular spectral reflectance appears to provide a holistic framework for the measurement and calculation of soil surface characteristics remotely using ground-based radiometers and current and future generations of angular sensors on airborne and satellite platforms. To investigate the utility of this framework, a ground-based study was performed using three soils susceptible to wind erosion that were modified using rainfall simulation and wind tunnel abrasion experiments. Measurements of those changes were made and recorded using digital images. Multi-angular spectral measurements of reflectance were also made and inverted against a bi-directional soil spectral reflectance model. Comparison of the measurements and calculations showed good agreement with small errors in accuracy. Optimised values of the model parameters produced the single scattering albedo and a description of the reflectance scattering behaviour of the soil surfaces that included an estimate of roughness. The model parameters removed the effect of illumination and viewing geometry on the spectral reflectance. The combination of single-scattering albedo spectra and model parameters for each treatment provided information about the composition and structure of the soil surface changes. The main changes detected at the soil surface included the presence of a crust produced by rain-splash, the production of loose erodible material covering a rain crust and the selective erosion of the soil surface. Redundancy analysis showed that much of the variation in the values of the soil reflectance model parameters was explained by the scattering properties and the roughness parameter of the soil surfaces. Variation in the soil surface reflectance was not explained solely by soil type. Instead, low intensity rainfall combined with short and long duration abrasion explained a significant portion. These findings provide a source of considerable variation in experimental and operational spectral reflectance measurements that has perhaps hitherto been largely ignored. The results demonstrated the readily available information on the composition and structure of the soil surface without interfering with natural processes. The directional soil reflectance methodology appears to have potential for use in improving the understanding of erodibility and ultimately for identifying and quantifying soil erosion.

The variations of this temperature difference are described as a function of local wind speed and incoming solar radiation provided by a local area atmospheric model. The daily sea surface temperature variability is also assessed by computing the temperature difference between the daily maximal and minimal values (Delta Tday-night). The data show that the smaller the wind speed and the larger the solar radiation, the larger Delta Tpb-b. The temperature difference reached the highest value (similar to 5 degrees C) on a hot day (more than 600 W/m(2)) of May 2003 in weak wind condition (around 3 m/s). For strong winds (speed > 6 m/s) the dependence on both the wind and solar radiations vanishes as the temperature difference approaches zero because the near-surface water becomes thermally homogenous due to the wind-induced vertical mixing. Strong diurnal warming of the sea surface, as derived by the pseudo-bulk estimates, and a strong near-surface stratification were found during the spring/summer season. Monthly mean statistics show that the diurnal cycle of the pseudo-bulk and bulk temperature starts to become significant already in February and March. Subsequently (from April to August) both the diurnal warming and the stratification are maximal (monthly means of Delta Tday-nigh, similar to 1-2 degrees C and of Delta Tpb-b similar to 0.5 degrees C), while in fall and early winter the Delta Tpb-b values are quite small (monthly means near 0 degrees C) and the Delta Tday-night monthly means are bounded by 0.5-1.5 degrees C. Maximal amplitudes of the diurnal cycle can exceed 4 degrees C (mostly in spring-summer) for both the pseudo-bulk and bulk temperatures. However, the monthly means Of Delta Tday-night is generally twice as large for the pseudo-bulk estimates (similar to 2 degrees C) with respect to the bulk layer (similar to 1 degrees C). The diurnal warming of the sea surface, as derived by the pseudo-bulk temperature, occurs at about 14:30 local time, that is more than 2 h after the maximal sun elevation and an hour earlier than the bulk temperature maximum at 20-40 cm depth.

We examined the potential of using a multi-angle spectral sensor to predict forest vertical structure as measured by an airborne lidar system. Data were acquired from AirMISR (Airborne Multi-Angle Imaging Spectrometer) and airborne LVIS (Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor) for a 7000 ha study site near Howland Maine, consisting of small plantations, multi-generation clearings and large natural forest stands. The LVIS data set provided a relatively direct measure of forest vertical structure at a fine scale (20 m diameter footprints). Multivariate linear regression and neural network models were developed to predict the LVIS forest energy height measures from 28 AirMISR multi-angle spectral radiance values. The best model accurately predicted the maximum canopy height (as measured from LVIS) using AirMISR data (rmse-0.92 m, R-2 =0.89). The models developed in this study achieved high accuracies over a study site with an elaborate patchwork of forest communities with exceptional diversity in forest structure.

Therefore, sub-pixel classification is often preferred, where a pixel is resolved into various class components (also called class proportions or fractions). While, under most circumstances, land cover information in this form is more effective than crisp classification, sub-pixel classification fails to account for the spatial distribution of class proportions within the pixel. An alternative approach is to consider the spatial distribution of class proportions within and between pixels to perform super-resolution mapping (i.e. mapping land cover at a spatial resolution finer than the size of the pixel of the image). Markov random field (MRF) models are well suited to represent the spatial dependence within and between pixels. In this paper, an MRF model based approach is introduced to generate super-resolution land cover maps from remote sensing data. In the proposed MRF model based approach, the intensity values of pixels in a particular spatial structure (i.e., neighborhood) are allowed to have higher probability (i.e., weight) than others. Remote sensing images at two markedly different spatial resolutions, IKONOS MSS image at 4 in spatial resolution and Landsat ETM+ image at 30 in spatial resolution, are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed MRF model based approach for super-resolution land cover mapping. The results show a significant increase in the accuracy of land cover maps at fine spatial resolution over that obtained from a recently proposed linear optimization approach suggested by Verhoeye and Wulf (2002) (Verhoeye, J., Wulf, R.

The approach is illustrated using I in resolution data collected in and near northeastern Yellowstone National Park. Ground validation data for tarps and for disturbed soils on mine tailings demonstrate the ability of the filtering procedure to reduce the proportion of false alarms (i.e., pixels wrongly classified as target), and its robustness under low signal to noise ratios. In almost all scenarios, the proposed approach outperforms traditional anomaly detectors (i.e., RX detector which computes the Mahalanobis distance between the vector of spectral values and the vector of global means), and fewer false alarms are obtained when using a novel statistic S-2 (average absolute deviation of p-values from 0.5 through all spectral bands) to summarize information across bands. Image degradation through addition of noise or reduction of spectral resolution tends to blur the detection of anomalies, increasing false alarms, in particular for the identification of the least pure pixels. Results from a mine tailings site demonstrate the approach performs reasonably well for highly complex landscape with multiple targets of various sizes and shapes. By leveraging both spectral and spatial information, the technique requires little or no input from the user, and hence can be readily automated. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we evaluate the effects of channel morphology on depth retrieval by coupling a radiative transfer model to various morphologic scenarios. Upwelling radiance L-u spectra generated for a range of depths (2-150 cm) and benthic cover types (limestone, periphyton, and gravel) were linearly mixed to simulate subpixel bed topography and substrate heterogeneity. For sloping bottoms, solar-streambed geometry modified L-u relative to a level bottom, especially for beds sloping steeply away from the sun. Aggregate pixel scale L-u spectra were compared to a database of simulated spectra to determine the radiance-equivalent depth of a uniform bottom (REDUB). REDUB spectra for hypothetical stepped streambeds indicated underestimation of the actual area-weighted mean depth, but the ln (L-u,L-560/L-u,L-690) REDUB ratio consistently reproduced the pixel-scale mean for beta distributions of depths. Similarly, when both dark periphyton and bright limestone substrates occurred within a pixel, REDUB spectra produced large errors while the ratio proved robust. Along channel banks, pixels will inevitably be mixed, and our simulations indicated that although bank fractions estimated by spectral mixture analysis were highly accurate for vegetated cutbanks, gravel bars were sensitive to the selection of both aquatic and terrestrial end members and subject to relatively large fraction errors. These theoretical results were tested using a ratio-based relative depth map and two-end member mixture models derived from a hyperspectral image of the Lamar River in Yellowstone National Park, which also served to illustrate the importance and applicability of our simulations. The primary conclusions of this study are that 1) the ratio-based algorithm is well-suited to complex river channels; 2) channel morphology and sensor spatial resolution must be considered jointly during data collection and analysis; and 3) the accuracy and precision of depth estimates are influenced by channel morphology and thus vary spatially.

Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) has been frequently used to derive subpixel vegetation information from remotely sensed imagery in urban areas, where the underlying landscapes are assumed to be composed of a few fundamental components, called endmembers. A critical step in SMA is to identify the endmembers and their corresponding spectral signatures. A common practice in SMA assumes a constant spectral signature for each endmember. In fact, the spectral signatures of endmembers may vary from pixel to pixel due to changes in biophysical (e.g. leaves, stems and bark) and biochemical (e.g. chlorophyll content) composition. This study developed a Bayesian Spectral Mixture Analysis (BSMA) model to understand the impact of endmember variability on the derivation of subpixel vegetation fractions in an urban environment. BSMA incorporates endmember spectral variability in the unmixing process based on Bayes Theorem. In traditional SMA, each endmember is represented by a constant signature, while BSMA uses the endmember signature probability distribution in the analysis. BSMA has the advantage of maximally capturing the spectral variability of an image with the least number of endmembers. In this study, the BSMA model is first applied to simulated images, and then to Ikonos and Landsat ETM+ images. BSMA leads to an improved estimate of subpixel vegetation fractions, and provides uncertainty information for the estimates. The study also found that the traditional SMA using the statistical means of the signature distributions as endmember signatures produces subpixel endmember fractions with almost the same and sometimes even better accuracy than those from BSMA except without uncertainty information for the estimates. However, using the modes of signature distributions as endmembers may result in serious bias in subpixel endmember fractions derived from traditional SMA. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

These measurements were carried out from a fixed oilrig under open sea conditions in the Mediterranean Sea during the WInd and Salinity Experiment 2000 (WISE 2000). The SSE retrieval methodology uses quasi-simultaneous measurements of the radiance coming from the sea surface and the downwelling sky radiance, in addition to the sea surface temperature (SST). The radiometric data were acquired by a CIMEL ELECTRONIQUE CE 312 radiometer, with four channels placed in the 8-14 mum region. The sea temperature was measured with high-precision thermal probes located on oceanographic buoys, which is not exactly equal to the required SST. A study of the skin effect during the radiometric measurements used in this work showed that a constant bulk-skin temperature difference of 0.05+/-0.06 K was present for wind speeds larger than 5 m/s. Our study is limited to these conditions. Thus, SST used as a reference for SSE retrieval was obtained as the temperature measured by the contact thermometers placed on the buoys at 20-cm depth minus this bulk-skin temperature difference.   SSE was obtained under several observation angles and surface wind speed conditions, allowing us to study both the angular and the sea surface roughness dependence. Our results were compared with SSE models, showing the validity of the model of Masuda et al. [Masuda, K., Takashima, T., & Takayama, Y. (1988) Emissivity of pure seawaters for the model sea surface in the infrared window regions. Remote Sensing of Environment, 24, 313-329.] for observation angles up to 50degrees. For larger angles, the effect of double or multiple reflections on the sea surface produces discrepancies between measured and theoretical SSEs, and more complex models should be used to get accurate SSE values, such as the model of Wu and Smith [Wu, X., & Smith, W.L.

Remote sensing technologies introduce a potentially scientific basis for examining urban composition and monitoring its changes over time. The vegetation-impervious surface-soil (V-I-S) model, in particular, provides a foundation for describing urban/suburban environments and a basis for further urban analyses including urban growth modeling, environmental impact analysis, and socioeconomic factor estimation. This paper develops a normalized spectral mixture analysis (NSMA) method to examine urban composition in Columbus Ohio using Landsat ETM+ data. In particular, a brightness normalization method is applied to reduce brightness variation. Through this normalization, brightness variability within each V-I-S component is reduced or eliminated, thus allowing a single endmember representing each component. Further, with the normalized image, three endmembers, vegetation, impervious surface, and soil, are chosen to model heterogeneous urban composition using a constrained spectral mixture analysis (SMA) model. The accuracy of impervious surface estimation is assessed and compared with two other existing models. Results indicate that the proposed model is a better alternative to existing models, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 10.1% for impervious surface estimation in the study area.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) offers a unique combination of spectral, temporal, and spatial resolution compared to previous global sensors, making it a good candidate for large-scale crop type mapping. However, because of subpixel heterogeneity, the application of traditional hard classification approaches to MODIS data may result in significant errors in crop area estimation. We developed and tested a linear unmixing approach with MODIS that estimates subpixel fractions of crop area based on the temporal signature of reflectance throughout the growing season. In this method, termed probabilistic temporal unmixing (PTU), endmember sets were constructed using Landsat data to identify pure pixels, and uncertainty resulting from endmember variability was quantified using Monte Carlo simulation. This approach was evaluated using Landsat classification maps in two intensive agricultural regions, the Yaqui Valley (YV) of Mexico and the Southern Great Plains (SGP). Performance of the mixture model varied depending on the scale of comparison, with R-2 ranging from roughly 50% for estimating crop area within individual pixels to greater than 80% for crop cover within areas over 10 km(2). The results of this study demonstrate the importance of subpixel heterogeneity in cropland systems, and the potential of temporal unmixing to provide accurate and rapid assessments of land cover distributions using coarse resolution sensors, such as MODIS.

The detectability of understory burns in these woodlands was assessed with a sensitivity analysis approach, based on a hybrid geometrical-optical radiative transfer model. Model input data were obtained from a variety of sources, including field biometry and spectroradiometry, and satellite data. The effects of variable tree percent cover, leaf area index, stand density, burn scar age, illumination and observation geometry, and spectral region, were taken into account. Detectability of understory burns was defined as the spectral separability of burned and unburned understory, measured with the Jeffries-Matusita distance, for all possible combinations of the green, red, and near-infrared channels of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) sensor. Single channels, or pairwise combinations of channels perform poorly at detecting understory burns, but a large improvement in detectability is obtained for the combination of the three spectral domains. The detectability of understory burns is largely insensitive to the effects of stand structure and illumination/observation geometry, and depends primarily on burn scar age. Our results agree with those of previous satellite-based studies of burns scar detectability in African savanna woodlands. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The hyperspectral data were gathered for shrubs, grasses, weeds, and agricultural crop species from the four ecoregions of African savannas using a I -nm-wide hand-held spectroradiometer but was aggregated to I 0-nm-wide bandwidths to match the first spaceborne hyperspectral sensor, Hyperion. After accounting for atmospheric widows and/or areas of significant noise, a total of 168 narrowbands in 400-2500 nm was used in the analysis.   Rigorous data mining techniques consisting of principal component analysis (PCA), lambda-lambda R-2 models (LL (RM)-M-2), stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA), and derivative greenness vegetation indices (DGVI) established 22 optimal bands (in 400-2500 nm spectral range) that best characterize and classify vegetation and agricultural crops. Overall accuracies of over 90% were attained when the 13-22 best narrowbands were used in classifying vegetation and agricultural crop species. Beyond 22 bands, accuracies only increase marginally up to 30 bands. Accuracies become asymptotic or near zero beyond 30 bands, rendering 138 of the 168 narrowbands redundant in extracting vegetation and agricultural crop information. Relative to Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) broadbands, the best hyperspectral narrowbands provided an increased accuracy of 9-43% when classifying shrubs, weeds, grasses, and agricultural crop species.

The EL methods, using the two end-members that represent the scene reduced this difference to about 4%, and in some cases, even to 0.1% It was found that selecting the calibration targets over low water vapor content improved the results. Applying EL oil radiance data provided a severe difference of more than 200% in areas located outside the calibration target water vapor zone. Only over similar water vapor zones were the EL methods found to reasonably recover the surface reflectance. Examining the spectral variability in the calibration targets showed that using, of spectral features targets with relative spectral similarity is almost as effective as using spectrally featureless targets for the EL process. Applying EL, using external spectral information of possible known targets, revealed a relatively high difference, as compared to the true reflectance data. However, thematic analysis using a SAM classifier proved that even under non-ideal conditions, the EL correction can yield a reasonable spatial mapping capability relative to those obtained under real reflectance domains. It was concluded that EL must be run oil reflectance data (generated from absolute based method) over low water vapor zones to provide the most precise reflectance information. Also, it Was found that it is not mandatory to select calibration targets that are totally featureless or characterized by low or high albedo response. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

These conditions were obtained by using a new non-intrusive methodological approach that increases the temperature and prolongs the drought period by using roofs that automatically cover the vegetation after the sunset or when it rains. On average, warming increased air temperature by 0.7 degreesC and soil temperature by 1.6 degreesC, and the drought treatment reduced soil moisture by 22%. We measured spectral reflectance at the canopy level and at the individual plant level seasonally during 4 years. Shrubland NDVI tracked the community development and activity. In control and warming treatments, NDVI increased with the years while it did not change in the drought treatment. There was a good relationship between NDVI and both community and individual plant biomass. NDVI also decreased in summer seasons when some species dry or decolour. The NDVI of E. multiflora plant individuals was lower in autumn and winter than in the other seasons, likely because of flowering. Shrubland PRI decreased only in winter, similarly to the PRI of the most dominant species, G. alypum. At this community scale, NDVI was better related than PRI to photosynthetic activity, probably because photosynthetic fluxes followed canopy seasonal greening in this complex canopy, which includes brevideciduous, annual and evergreen species and variable morphologies and canopy coverage. PRI followed the seasonal variations in photosynthetic rates in E. multiflora and detected the decreased photosynthetic rates of drought treatment. However, PRI did not track the photosynthetic rates of G. alypum plants which have lower LAIs than E. multiflora. In this community, which is in its early successional stages, NDVI was able to track biomass, and indirectly, CO2 uptake changes, likely because LAI values did not saturate NDVI. Thus, NDVI appears as a valid tool for remote tracking of this community development. PRI was less adequate for photosynthetic assessment of this community especially for its lower LAI canopies. PRI usefulness was also species-dependent and could also be affected by flowering. These results will help to improve the interpretation of remote sensing information on the structure and physiological status of these Mediterranean shrublands, and to gain better insight on ecological and environmental controls on their ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange. They also show the possibility of assessing the impacts of climate change on shrubland communities. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides improved capabilities to observe snow cover from space and has been successfully using a normalized difference snow index (NDSI), along with threshold tests, to provide global, automated binary maps of snow cover. The NDSI is a spectral band ratio that takes advantage of the spectral differences of snow in short-wave infrared and visible MODIS spectral bands to identify snow versus other features in a scene. This study has evaluated whether there is a \"signal\" in the NDSI that could be used to estimate the fraction of snow within a 500 in MODIS pixel and thereby enhance the use of the NDSI approach in monitoring snow cover. Using Landsat 30-m observations as \"ground truth,\" the percentage of snow cover was calculated for 500-m cells. Then a regression relationship between 500-m NDSI observations and fractional snow cover was developed over three different snow-covered regions and tested over other areas. The overall results indicate that the relationship between fractional snow cover and NDSI is reasonably robust when applied locally and over large areas like North America. The relationship offers advantages relative to other published fractional snow cover algorithms developed for global-scale use with MODIS. This study indicates that the fraction of snow cover within a MODIS pixel using this approach can be provided with a mean absolute error less than 0.1 over the range from 0.0 to 1.0 in fractional snow cover.

The data used were obtained by the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) with a spatial resolution of 2 m in the winter of 1994. The convex geometry method was used to select the endmembers: sunlit crown, sunlit snow, and shadow. Along transects for these flux tower sites, the fraction of sunlit snow was found to have a higher correlation with the field-measured canopy LAI than the fraction of sunlit crown or the fraction of shadow. An empirical equation was obtained to describe the relation between canopy LAI and the fraction of sunlit snow. There is a strong correlation between the estimated LAI and the field-measured LAI along transects (with R-2 values of 0.54, 0.71, and 0.60 obtained for the SOBS, SYJP, and SOJP sites, respectively). The estimated LAI for the whole tower site is consistent with that obtained by the inversion of a canopy model in our previous study where values of 0.94, 0.92, and 0.63 were obtained for R-2 for the SOBS, SYJP and SOJP sites, respectively.   The CAST 2-m summer data over the SOBS site was also employed to investigate the possibility of deriving canopy LAI from the summer data using linear mixture analysis. At a spatial resolution of 10 m, the correlation between the field-measured LAI and the estimated LAI along transects is small at R-2 less than 0.3, while R-2 increases to 0.6 at a spatial resolution of 30 m. The difficulty in canopy LAI retrieval from the summer data at a spatial resolution of 10 m is likely due to the variation of the understory reflectance across the scene, although spatial misregistration of the CAST data used may also be a possible contributing factor.

The scale dependence of biophysical variation (e.g., mixtures of vegetation cover types), as depicted in Landsat observations, was assessed for the common land-cover types bordering the Tapajos National Forest, Central Brazilian Amazon. We first collected hyperspectral signatures of vegetation and soils contributing to the optical reflectance of landscapes in a 600-km(2) region. We then employed a spectral mixture model AutoMCU that utilizes bundles of the field spectra with Monte Carlo analysis to estimate sub-pixel cover of green plants, senescent vegetation and soils in Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) pixels. The method proved useful for quantifying biophysical variability within and between individual land parcels (e.g., across different pasture conditions). Image textural analysis was then performed to assess surface variability at the inter-pixel scale. We compared the results from the textural analysis (inter-pixel scale) to spectral mixture analysis (sub-pixel scale). We tested the hypothesis that very high resolution, sub-pixel estimates of surface constituents are needed to detect important differences in the biophysical structure of deforested lands. Across a range of deforestation categories common to the region, there was strong correlation between the fractional green and senescent vegetation cover values derived from spectral unmixing and texture analysis variance results (r(2) > 0.85, p < 0.05). These results support the argument that, in deforested areas, biophysical heterogeneity at the scale of individual field plots (sub-pixel) is similar to that of whole clearings when viewed from the Landsat vantage point.

Hyperspectral models developed to estimate plant water content have had limited application under field conditions and have not been rigorously validated. A physical model using a spectrum matching technique was applied to hyperspectral data to directly calculate the canopy equivalent water thickness (EWT) using a look-up table approach. The objective of this study was to test the validity of this algorithm using plant water content information collected under field conditions and to relate this to the needs of precision agriculture. Image data were acquired over two experimental test sites in Canada, near Clinton, Ontario and Indian Head, Saskatchewan, using the Probe-1 airborne hyperspectral sensor. Plant biomass samples were collected simultaneously from plots spanning fourteen fields of various crop types (wheat, canola, corn, beans, and peas). The model was validated against EWT estimated from biomass samples, as well as more conventional measures of crop water status. The model accurately predicts water content in the range found with all crop types pooled together, with an index of agreement (D) of 0.92 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 26.8% of the average. On an individual crop basis, the model proved to be a poor predictor for wheat crops (RMSE = 69.9%). When wheat fields were removed from the overall analysis, the RMSE was 17.9% and the D was 0.87. While the model provided a reasonably accurate prediction of EWT for broadleaf crops like beans, corn, canola, and peas (D = 0.88, 0.69, 0.88, and 0.84, respectively), the error margin in the prediction was too large for to precisely detect within-crop variation for the low variability found in corn and bean crops in this study. EWT is related to plant biomass and leaf area index (LAI), both quantities of interest to precision agriculture. Crown Copyright (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Ecological and sedimentological related investigations of these environments require monitoring methods that provide rapid spatially representative data on sediment grain size distribution. Remote sensing has the potential to provide synoptic information of intertidal environments. Previous in situ and laboratory-based reflectance investigations have demonstrated that for effective quantification of sediment grain size distributions, remote sensing platforms must include measurements within the short-wave infrared (SWIR). In addition, the timing of image acquisition, in relation to tidal cycles and sediment moisture content, is critical in optimising the spectral differences between the coarser sand and finer \'mud\' fraction of sediments. Daedalus 1268 Airborne Thematic Mapper (ATM) has been identified as an appropriate platform and sensor for providing accurate synoptic maps of estuarine sediment distributions. This paper presents the results from the application of ATM 1.75 m resolution data to the mapping of surface sediment grain-size distributions across intertidal areas of Ribble Estuary, Lancashire, UK. ATM imagery was acquired after the intertidal area was exposed to strong summer drying conditions. Pre-processing and linear unmixing of the imagery collected of the intertidal zone following a period of drying allowed accurate sub-pixel determinations (1.75 in resolution) of sediment clay (r(2)=0.79) but less accurate for sand (r(2)=0.60). The results also demonstrate deterioration in the image calibration with increasing sediment moisture content and microphytobenthos cover. However, recombining the subpixel end member abundances through multivariate regression analysis improved the image calibration significantly for both sediment clay and sand content (r(2) >0.8) for imagery collected in both dryer and wetter conditions. These results demonstrate that ATM data, or similar, can be used to gain quantitative information on intertidal sediment distributions and such data has application to a wide variety of estuarine research.

The goal is to identify aerosol types and cloud contaminated pixels. This information is of importance when selecting appropriate atmospheric correction algorithms for retrieving ocean parameters such as phytoplankton concentrations. The methodology is based on the use of Topological Neural network Algorithms (TNA, so-called Kohonen maps). The pixels of the remotely sensed image are characterised by a vector whose components are the spectral TOA measurement and the standard deviation of a small spatial structure. The method is a three-step method. The first step is an unsupervised classification built from a learning data set; it clusters pixel vectors which are similar into a certain number of groups. Each group is characterised by a specific vector, the so-called reference vector (rv), which summarises the information contained in all the pixels belonging to that group. The second step of the method consists of labeling the reference vectors with the help of an expert in ocean optics. The groups are then clustered into classes corresponding to physical characteristics provided by the expert. The third step consists of analyzing full images and classifying them by using the classifier which has been determined during the first two steps. The method was applied to the Cape Verde region, which exhibits important seasonal variability in terms of aerosols, cloud coverage and ocean chlorophyll-a concentration. We processed POLDER data to test the algorithm. We considered four classes: pixels contaminated by clouds; two types of pixels containing mineral dusts; and pixels containing maritime aerosols only. The method was able to take into account the information given by the expert and apply it to unlabeled pixels. This methodology could easily be extended to a larger number of classes, the major problem being to find adequate expertise to label the classes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

A major contribution in the surface-related variability is caused by the non-Lambertian nature of the Earth surface reflectance and the fact that the illumination/observation geometry varies considerably between successive observations of the same area (with a polar orbiting sensor). In principle, if the surface boundary condition can be specified with sufficient accuracy by means of a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), the two contributions can be unfolded and aerosol information retrieved. This approach has been tested using combined datasets made of satellite measured \"top of atmosphere\" (TOA) radiance and corresponding ground estimation of the aerosol optical thickness. Studying a time series of data, taking into account geometrical conditions and assuming the ground BRDF to be constant during the time period, a coupled surface/atmosphere model was used to investigate the retrieval of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) over several sites. By fitting a subset of satellite observations associated with ground photometer data, a best fit of BRDF model parameters could be determined. This surface characterization is then used to reduce the model unknowns to AOT only and thereby to permit its retrieval from the satellite data alone, by means of a simple inversion process. The study was conducted on three European AERONET sites and using satellite data from both the VEGETATION and Sea viewing Wide Field of view (SeaWiFS) sensors. In all cases, the AOT retrieved from satellite was in good agreement with the measurements. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Reliable methods of detecting such changes are necessary if these landscapes are to be properly managed. One approach is to use satellite remote sensing systems. Various studies have shown that the asynchronous seasonality of C3 and C4 species allows the relative abundance of each photosynthetic type to be estimated using temporal trajectory indices (TTIs) of sensor-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In this study, we compared three approaches for predicting C4 species cover at Grasslands National Park (GNP) (Saskatchewan, Canada). TTIs related to Approach I were calculated from plots of NDVI vs. day-of-year (DOY). TTIs related to Approach II were calculated from plots of normalized cumulative NDVI vs. growing degree day (GDD). TTIs related to Approach III were calculated as ratios of early-season NDVI to late-season NDVI. Our analyses were conducted at two separate ecological scales. A within-community analysis used field-sampled data from upland grassland to compare techniques at sampling resolutions of 0.5, 2.5, 10, and 50 m. An across-community analysis compared techniques using a vegetation survey of the GNP region and TTIs calculated from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data (1 km). At both scales, TTIs related to the timing of specific phenological events were the best predictors of C4 species cover. While all techniques performed well in the within-community study, Approach III performed best. Here, the predictive ability of each approach was weak at a resolution of 0.5 in but stronger at 2.5, 10, and 50 m resolutions. We also found that the optimal sampling dates for Approach III fell within a certain GDD range. This is encouraging for the a priori selection of sample dates, which would make the need for full seasonal time series redundant. In the across-community analysis, the AVHRR-derived Approach II TTIs were better able to discriminate among grasslands of different C4 composition than any other technique (overall accuracy = 74%). However, for some C4 cover classes, the predictive accuracy of this approach was low. While these results are encouraging for the use of spectral data in monitoring the C4 cover of northern prairie, various research issues remain. At the within-community level, these include (a) further attempts to define objective criteria for the a priori identification of sampling dates for Approach III, and (b) and the extension of such studies to other growing seasons and community types/grassland regions. At the across-community level, these include the expansion of such techniques to a larger geographical region that contains a wider range in C4 cover values and land use types (e.g. ungrazed vs. grazed grasslands).

The West Siberian wetlands is the largest in the world and remote sensing techniques can play an important role for monitoring the wetland.   High spatial resolution satellite data are effective for monitoring land cover type changes, but can\'t cover a wide area because of a narrow swath width. On the other hand, global scale data are indispensable in covering a large area, but are too coarse to get the detailed information due to the low spatial resolution. It is necessary to devise a method for the fusion of the data with different spatial resolutions for monitoring the scale-differed phenomena.   In this paper, firstly, a SPOT HRV image near Plotnikovo mire was used to map four wetland ecosystems (birch forest, conifer forest, forested bog and open bog) supplemented by field observation. Then, spectral mixture analysis was performed between NOAA AVHRR and SPOT HRV data acquired on the same day.   Secondly, field observations were scaled up with these different spatial resolution satellite data. Each of the wetland ecosystem coverage fraction at the sub-pixel level was provided by spectral mixture analysis. Field observation shows that the mean rate of CH4 emission from forested bog and open bog averaged 21.1 and 233.1 (mg CH4/m(2)/day), respectively. The methane emission from the area was estimated by multiplying these average methane emission rates and the fraction coverage in each AVHRR pixel.   Finally, the total methane emission over AVHRR coverage was estimated to be 9.46 (10(9) g CH4/day) and the mean methane emission over AVHRR coverage was calculated as 59.3 (mg CH4/m(2)/day). We could conclude that this mean value is within the probabilistic variability as compared with the airborne measurement results.

It is applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data acquired over Southern Africa during the August to October 2000 period. This method relies first on atmospheric correction of the middle-thermal infrared radiances which uses National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) humidity, pressure and temperature profiles and second on constructing and using a database of night emissivities ratio (Temperature Independent Spectral Indices of Emissivity, TISIE). The middle infrared reflectances (3-5 pm) are then derived from day-time measurements and mean TISIE values. By hemispheric integration (over a 16-day period), they lead to middle infrared directional emissivity which, combined with TISIE again, leads to thermal infrared emissivity and surface temperature. The reflectance accuracies are assessed by looking at targets of known reflectance (water and sun-glint). The emissivities in the thermal infrared are assessed by checking the spectral invariance of the derived surface temperature in the 3-5- and 8-12-mum region. Other consistency checks are performed leading to the conclusion that the reflectance, emissivity and surface temperature are derived within 0.015, 0.01 and 1 K, respectively. Finally, a direct application of the MODIS middle infrared surface reflectances to the fire detection problem is developed and the results compared to the Landsat 7 high spatial resolution data.

It shows that accuracies as good as with Landsat TM can be produced with IRS-1c LISS-3 data, and that defoliation in pine could be assessed with only a slightly lower accuracy than in spruce. As in previous studies of spruce defoliation, the near-infrared (NIR) band was best correlated with spruce defoliation. Among the single bands, the NIR band was also best correlated with pine defoliation, although the relationship was even stronger with the ratios between NIR and red, and NDVI. Compared to spruce, assessment of pine defoliation appeared to be more sensitive to the presence of species other than pine. The strength of the relationship between LISS-3 data and defoliation increased significantly (from r=-.73 to r=-.91 for NIR/red, note however the reduced sample size), when only plots with more than 80% pine, rather than 70%, were included in the analysis. An attempt to normalize satellite data for species composition did not raise correlation coefficients for spruce data, and only slightly for pine data. Topographic normalization on the other hand, strongly increased the correlation coefficients between NIR radiance and spruce defoliation. A large part of the pine plots were located on near-horizontal ground; thus, topographical normalization only slightly increased correlation coefficients. This study verifies that high-resolution satellite data provide a means to assess the overall needle loss situation on a forest stand level provided that: the stands are fairly homogenous, not too open, dominated by spruce (> 60%) or pine (>70%), located in level or moderately undulating terrain (<15° slope), and express a needle loss range of at least 20%. The utility of IRS LISS data in addition to earlier evaluated Landsat TM data strongly improves the possibility to perform operational satellite-based monitoring in areas with frequent cloud cover.

Those indices are, however, the combined response to variations of several vegetation and environmental properties, such as Leaf Area Index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content, canopy shadows, and background soil reflectance. Of particular significance to precision agriculture is chlorophyll content, an indicator of photosynthesis activity, which is related to the nitrogen concentration in green vegetation and serves as a measure of the crop response to nitrogen application. This paper presents a combined modeling and indices-based approach to predicting the crop chlorophyll content from remote sensing data while minimizing LAI (vegetation parameter) influence and underlying soil (background) effects. This combined method has been developed first using simulated data and followed by evaluation in terms of quantitative predictive capability using real hyperspectral airborne data. Simulations consisted of leaf and canopy reflectance modeling with PROSPECT and SAILH radiative transfer models. In this modeling study, we developed an index that integrates advantages of indices minimizing soil background effects and indices that are sensitive to chlorophyll concentration. Simulated data have shown that the proposed index Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index/Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI) is both very sensitive to chlorophyll content variations and very resistant to the variations of LAI and solar zenith angle. It was therefore possible to generate a predictive equation to estimate leaf chlorophyll content from the combined optical index derived from above-canopy reflectance. This relationship was evaluated by application to hyperspectral CASI imagery collected over corn crops in three experimental farms from Ontario and Quebec, Canada. The results presented here are from the L\'Acadie, Quebec, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada research site. Images of predicted leaf chlorophyll content were generated. Evaluation showed chlorophyll variability over crop plots with various levels of nitrogen, and revealed an excellent agreement with ground truth, with a correlation of r(2)=.81 between estimated and field measured chlorophyll content data.

Colour satellite imagery provides, at low cost, complete maps of areas that are difficult to map by traditional hydrographic means due to their size and their rough underwater morphology. In order to calibrate SPOT images to derive bathymetric maps, a simple method applied to shallow waters of a moderately turbid tidal inlet has been carried out. Its development is based on a set of field measurements, including the reflectance of the water and of the bottom sediment, the vertically averaged diffuse attenuation coefficient, and the concentrations of inorganic particles in suspension, of chlorophyll a and pheopigments and of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). From these data, it appears, first, that the water reflectance is directly linked to the depth, and second, that the water reflectance varies slowly with the turbidity in this area for total suspended matter (SM) concentrations lower than 9 mg l(-1). The extinction of light with depth has been characterized in the inlet. The relationship obtained is slightly different from that observed in clear waters. The bathymetric models established for the clearest waters do not calculate the depth accurately. In the contrary, reflectance code adapted to Case II water type, calibrated with in situ measurements, allows us to retrieve depth down to 6 m and for total SM concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 9 mg l(-1). This relationship has been applied to five SPOT images of the mouth of Arcachon lagoon. The accuracy of the derived map has been assessed by in situ depth measurements. The mean difference between measured depths and computed depths is about 20%. This accuracy is adequate to assess the inlet morphodynamics quantitatively, which is necessary for middle-term to short-term mathematical modeling of the 3D inlet evolution.

Our Field study encompassed measurements of ground damage and canopy gap fractions along a chronosequence of postharvest regrowth of 0.5 - 3.5 years. We found that canopy damage and regrowth rates varied according to the logging method used, either conventional logging or reduced impact logging. Areas used to stage felled trees prior to transport, log decks, had the largest gap fractions immediately following cutting. Log decks were quickly colonized by early successional plant species, resulting in significant gap fraction decreases within 1.5 years after site abandonment. Although log decks were the most obvious damage areas on the ground and in satellite imagery, they accounted for only 1-2% of the total harvested area of the blocks studied. Other forest damage features such as tree-fall gaps, skid trails, and roads were difficult to recognize in Landsat reflectance data or through textural analysis. These landscape features could be only crudely resolved in the most intensively logged forests and within about 0.5 years following harvest. We found that forest damage within any of the landscape strata (decks, roads, skids, tree falls) could not be resolved with Landsat reflectance or texture data when the canopy gap fraction was < 50%. The basic Landsat ETM+ imagery lacks the resolution of forest structural features required for quantitative studies of logging damage. Landsat textural analyses may be useful for broad delineation of logged forests, but detailed ecological and biogeochemical studies will probably need to rely on other remote sensing approaches. Until spatial gradients of canopy damage and regrowth resulting from selective logging operations in tropical forests in the Amazon region are resolved, the impacts of this land use on a continental scale will remain poorly understood.

Users also have the flexibility of choosing acquisitions during either ascending or descending orbits. However, the condition of agricultural targets can change diurnally, and consequently, care must be taken in choosing between RADARSAT-1\'s dawn and dusk orbits, In temperate regions. early morning dew, is often present on the crop canopy at the time of the satellite overpass. Consequently, this study used fine mode dawn, dusk image pairs acquired over western Canada to examine the potential effect of dew on operational crop mapping. The data consistently demonstrated that backscatter increased when dew was present on the canopy. However. overall crop separability did not appear to be affected by the presence of dew. These results indicate that although choice of orbit is less important for crop classification, the probability of dew on the canopy must be carefully considered when users are extracting quantitative crop information from radar imagery.

Remote sensing can be used to provide information on the spatial pattern of land cover features, but analysis and classification of such imagery suffers from the problem of class mixing within pixels. Soft classification techniques can estimate the class composition of image pixels. However, their output provides no indication of how such classes are distributed spatially within the instantaneous field-of-view (IFOV) represented by the pixel. Techniques to provide an improved spatial representation of land cover targets larger than the size of a pixel have been developed. However, the mapping of subpixel scale land cover features has yet to be investigated. We recently described the application of a Hopfield neural network technique to super-resolution mapping of land cover features larger than a pixel, using information of pixel composition determined from soft classification, and now show how our approach can be extended in a new way to predict the spatial pattern of subpixel scale features. The network converges to a minimum of an energy function defined as a goal and several constraints. Prior information on the typical spatial arrangement of the particular land cover ty.. gy. pes is incorporated into the energy function as a semivariance constraint. This produces a prediction of the spatial pattern of the land cover in question, at the subpixel scale. The technique is applied to synthetic and simulated Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery, and compared to results of an existing super-resolution target identification technique. Results show that the new approach represents a simple, robust, and efficient tool for super-resolution land cover pattern prediction from remotely sensed imagery. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The investigation is prompted by the need for obtaining spatially distributed data on LAI to be used as input for carbon modelling of northern boreal forests. Detailed field data have been collected in a coniferous forest area in Uppland, central Sweden, dominated by Norway spruce and Scots pine. A forest canopy reflectance model (Kuusk and Nilson, 2000) has been used to simulate stand reflectances in the Landsat ETM+ wavelength bands as a means of investigating the theoretical reflectance response to LAI changes. The analysis shows that the response to changes in LAI is strongest in the visible wavelength bands, particularly Channel 3, whereas only weak response is noted in the NIR band and for some vegetation indices [simple ratio (SR) and NDVI]. Modelled reflectances are influenced by various other factors, particularly ground reflectance and leaf biochemical properties. Observed reflectances from the Landsat ETM+ sensor have been compared with reflectance modelling results and with field-based LAI estimates. The results indicate that LAI estimation using inverse canopy reflectance modelling may be difficult, given the large number of input parameters required and the current level of uncertainty in these parameters. Statistical relationships between LAI and observed ETM+ reflectances are strongest in ETM+ Channel 7. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

The procedure can be used with models characterised by any degree of complexity and driven by any kind of data. It provides two useful tools to analyse models: uncertainty analysis (UA), which allows the assessment of the uncertainty associated with model output, and sensitivity analysis (SA), which is useful to determine how much each source of uncertainty contributes to model output uncertainty. Uncertainty modelling, i.e. finding suitable tools to represent uncertainty, is a key step in performing UA and SA. A general error model for quantitative raster data is described.

These errors often cause large relative errors at a pixel and cause pixelization or \"speckling\" across the image, which is particularly obvious in the SeaWiFS chlorophyll standard product. Using simulations and current SeaWiFS algorithms, we show the effect of digitization-noise errors on the SeaWiFS ocean-color data products. It is found that the SeaWiFS mission goals, namely to estimate water-leaving radiances to within +/-5% and chlorophyll-a concentrations to within +/- 35% for Case I waters, cannot always be met. For maritime aerosol conditions the errors in the estimated chlorophyll concentrations over oligotrophic waters can easily reach +/- 60% and the absolute values over adjacent pixels can vary 2-3 fold. Several schemes can be used to reduce this type of error, among which the spatial smoothing of the atmospheric-correction bands is recommended. This is because the errors in these bands are propagated and exaggerated to the visible bands and to the chlorophyll product through the atmospheric-correction process. The smoothing scheme, however, will cause more pixels to be discarded over cloud edges. Ultimately, a significant increase in both digitization bits and sensitivity is essential to achieve the stated mission goals. Such improved specifications are available on MODIS.

Evidence is presented to show that uncertainties caused by the directional mismatch may be reduced if the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (RBDF) estimated from AVHRR data is used to map AVHRR reflectances to the ATSR-2 geometrical configuration. A stochastic model is developed to study the impact on the correlation between ATSR-2 and AVHRR radiances caused by 1) the response of vegetation to rainfall in a semi-arid region, 2) errors in the BRDF model used to map AVHRR reflectances to ATSR-2 geometry, 3) spatial nonuniformity of the target, and 4) variations in the column water vapor. The model shows that spatial nonuniformity contributes most of the error, but that the cross-calibration to 1% or better is possible provided that the coefficient of spatial variation is 2.5% or less and the sensor remains stable. However, determination of the rate of calibration drift is problematic, with errors of the order of 20% in the rate of drift even when the data span a full year. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2001.

In this article, pure vegetation spectra were extracted from a set of open and closed canopies by unmixing the green vegetation signal from the background component. Canopy model-simulation and reflectances derived from graph-based linear extrapolation were used to unmix and derive a \"true\" vegetation signal, equivalent to a perfect absorber (free boundary) canopy background reflectance condition. Optical-biophysical relationships were then derived for a variety of canopy structures with differences in foliage clumping, horizontal heterogeneity, and leaf type. A 3-dimensional canopy radiative transfer model and a hybrid geometric optical-radiative transfer model (GORT) were used to simulate the directional-hemispherical reflectances from agricultural, grassland, and forested canopies (cereal and broadleaf crop, grass, needleleaf, and broadleaf forest). The relationships of the extracted red and near-infrared reflectances and derived vegetation indices (VIs) to various biophysical parameters (leaf area index, fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, and percent ground cover) were examined for the pure vegetation spectra. The results showed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) relationships with biophysical parameters to become more asymptotic over the pure vegetation conditions. The extraction of pure vegetation signals had little effect on the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), which had values equivalent to those obtained with the presence of a background signal. NDVI values were fairly uniform across the different canopy types, whereas the SAVI values had pronounced differences among canopy types, particularly between the broadleaf and cereal/needleleaf structural types. These results were useful not only in selecting suitable vegetation indices to characterize specific canopy biophysical parameters, but also in understanding a \"true\" VI behavior, free of background noise.

This discrimination is achieved by computing thermal band emissivities from a temperature-emissivity separation algorithm, and then classifying surface features based on spectral emissivity contrast. In a study of rangelands and winter wheat fields in central Oklahoma, the contrast, or range, of these spectral emissivities is diagnostic of the presence or absence of surface vegetative cover. A large range of emissivities, approximately greater than 0.03, is indicative of bare soil, while a low range, less than 0.02, is indicative of vegetative cover. When knowledge of the emissivity range is combined with a vegetation index, such as NDVI, the surface may be classified by a ternary system: bare soil, green vegetation, and senescent vegetation. Discrimination between bare soil and soil covered with senescent vegetation using emissivity contrast should be feasible in other settings. The benefit of this technique is that heat flux predictions can be based on a more accurate surface representation than otherwise provided by visible and near-infrared land classification schemes.

One of the primary limitations of AVHRR data for feature tracking is the lack of temporal continuity, since it is only possible to obtain coverage from the same satellite once every 12 hours. Thus, for the highly variable flows that are often encountered in coastal areas, undersampling can be a serious problem. With the availability of imagery every half hour from the new imager on the GOES-8 and -10 satellites. the possibility of tracking features on shorter time scales should be considered. Also, the higher sampling rate of the GOES imager could be particularly beneficial in obtaining cloud-free coverage of the ocean. However, unlike the AVHRR, which has 1-km resolution, the new imager on GOES has 4-km resolution in the infrared channels. Thus, even for relatively vigorous currents, It will take at least several hours for a feature to be advected over a distance of one pixel, and considerably longer to generate displacements that can be estimated reliably. Also, one of the basic assumptions in conducting ocean feature tracking has been that it is the submesoscale features that serve as the primary tracers of the flow. As pixel size increases, the ability to resolve and track features at these scales clearly comes into question. Additionally, as with AVHRR imagery, the ability to accurately navigate successive images is crucial to making reliable estimates of the feature displacements. These and other related issues are discussed, and three examples of feature tracking using imagery from the imager on GOES-8 are presented, together with qualitative verifications in each case. Finally, a new method for rapidly renavigating satellite imagery is presented.

We find that one interannual NDVI variation signal over the United Stares, exhibits a strong relationship with the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Index, which is a measure of the phase and amplitude of the Southern Oscillations (SOs). The corresponding spatial patterns of NDT anomaly are also extracted for mapping the possible impacts of ENSO activity. The NDVI anomaly patterns approximately agree with the main documented precipitation and temperature anomaly patterns associated with ENSO, but also show additional patterns not related to ENSO. This study shows that ENSO activity effects may have regionally significant effects for vegetation in the United States.

However, a communication gap exists between the remote sensing and ecological communities in terms of the capabilities of the former and the needs of the latter. In this article, we present a summary of ecological research needs for remotely sensed data. Based on these needs, we present a review of some of the most promising MVA remote sensing methods for fulfilling these requirements.

The test sites are located in the boreal forest zone in Finland. SSM/I data from snow-free periods (from May to September) are used in the study, together with a digital high-resolution land use map as reference data. A stepwise algorithm is developed, in which the surface emissivity is estimated for each of the pixels in the first stage of the algorithm. By using a training data set (50% of all data), empirical coefficients for the subpixel land use and forest stem volume are determined. The results for subpixel land use classification (retrieval of fractions of individual land use categories contained within study pixels) are promising. When there are two or three categories to retrieve, the rms errors range from 3% to 9%, and the respective relative errors from 3% to 32%. When there are six categories to retrieve, the performance is less satisfactory with relative errors exceeding 100% for some categories. For the retrieval of forest stem volume, a similar approach is sued. The validation data set shows rms errors (standard errors) of approximately 20 m(3)/ha when the mean estimated forest stem volume is around 70 m(3)/ha. When compared to reported Landsat TM-based biomass estimates for a study area in Finland, the r(2) (coefficient of determination) values are comparable. The methods are also validated for a wider use by limiting the training data set to either northern or southern Finland, since the surface and forest types in these areas are systematically different (subgroups of boreal forests). The results show that the methods are applicable to remote areas with less training data. This is especially true for the stem volume estimation and limited (two or three classes) subpixel land use classification. These can be considered as promising results for a course resolution, high-frequency microwave instrument such as the SSM/I.

In particular, the planned EOS/MODUS global LST accuracy of 1 degrees C must be confirmed by independent measurements for a range of cover types. Simple flat surfaces are the most easily instrumented and characterized and so provide a logical starting point. Such surfaces include inland water, sand, snow, ice, and playa. Validation with water is straight-forward, but other land surfaces are more difficult to measure accurately. The analysis we present is based on a sequence of MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS) images collected over a playa (silt dry lake bed). Atmospheric effects in the MAS images are corrected by an in-scene method and are then converted to a time sequence of temperature maps. These form the basis for estimating the spatial and temporal sampling requirements to achieve a surface measurement accuracy of better than 0.5 degrees C for 1 km(2) MODIS pixels. We conclude that a grid of thermistors appears to be the most practical instrumentation method for such a large area. Depending on the environmental conditions, between 4 and 16 points are required per km(2), and we recommend that these be sampled at intervals ranging from 1 min to 2.5 min. A MAS underflight validation is possible if it is synchronized to within several minutes of the MODIS overpass. Finally, radiometers should be used at several of the thermistor locations to verify the skin temperature corrections and to characterize the temperature transients and angular effects.

Separation of these two fluorescence bands was achieved by an iterative nonlinear curve fit procedure utilizing the asymmetric double sigmoidal spectral function. The subsequent ratio of the deconvoluted curve intensities exhibited a significant relation between protein concentration and fluorescence. UV band fluorescence from vegetation treated with varying levels of nitrogen fertilization decreased relative to the blue fluorescence as a function of protein levels. These studies indicate that in vivo UV band fluorescence can be utilized as a nondestructive tool to remotely sense variations in protein concentration due to nitrogen supply. Strong similarities were noted in the UV band fluorescence characteristics of intact vegetation to both membrane-bound and soluble plant proteins containing aromatic amino acids. Pure ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase in aqueous solution exhibited UV fluorescence characteristics with excitation and emission distributions similar to those of intact vegetation. Because of its high concentration (up to 70% of the soluble leaf proteins), roe believe this protein contributes to the UV band fluorescence emnnating from the intact leaf. In, addition, similar fluorescence characteristics were observed for two other prominent enzymatic plant proteins; namely, adenosine 5\'-tri-phosphatase and carboxylase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxcylase. These results indicate that UV band fluorescence emanating from the intact leaf could originate front several plant proteins that contain aromatic amino acids.

Recent studies have demonstrated that synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can be used to estimate above-ground standing biomass. To date, these studies have relied on extensive ground-truth measurements to construct relationships between biomass and SAR backscatter. In this article toe discuss the use of models to help develop a relationship between biomass and radar backscatter and compare the predictions ruth measurements. A gap-type forest succession model was used to simulate growth and development of a northern hardwood-boreal transitional Sorest typical of central Maine, USA. Model results of species, and bole diameter at breast height (dbh) of individual trees in a 900 m(2) stand I were used to run discontinuous canopy backscatter models to determine radar backscatter coefficients for a wide range of simulated forest stands. Using model results, relationships of copolarized backscatter to forest biomass were developed and applied to an airborne SAR (AIRSAR) image over a forested area in Maine. A relationship derived totally from model results was found to underestimate biomass. Calibrating the modeled backscatter with limited AIRSAR backscatter measurements improved the biomass estimation when compared to field measurements. The approach of rising a combination of forest succession and remote sensing models to develop algorithms for inferring forest attributes produced comparable results with techniques using only measurements. Applying the model derived algorithm to SAR imagery produced reasonable results when mapped biomass was limited to 15 kg/m(2) or less.

The accuracy of each classification method and data type (TM vs. SPOT) is expressed as an error matrix from which K statistics and their large sample variances are derived. The values of the K statistics are used to compare the performance of the classification methods, two at time, by means of a Z statistic. Results from this research show that the iterative classification approach is superior to any other classification for both types of remotely sensed data.

Selected imagery from this and a southern station installed previously at Aspendale, Victoria provide a valuable new perspective on oceanographic phenomena occurring in this ecologically significant region. This perspective could not be attained using conventional ship-board and in situ oceanographic sampling techniques. A rich spectrum of mesoscale oceanographic features is revealed in the analyzed imagery, and various features such as western boundary current meanders, frontal shear waves, eddies, and jets are described. The temporal and spatial variability of these features appears strongly linked to that of the larger-scale Coral Sea current circulation. Several of the features identified are unique to the region, others resemble features observed in other western boundary current systems, but are significantly modified by the complex regional topography, and by the presence of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Evidence has been found for a number of processes which have significant implications for the origin and maintenance of CBR ecosystems, including shelf edge exchange processes, stratified slope water intrusions onto the shelf, and boundary layer mixing around reefs. Such processes provide a mechanism for injection of cool nutrient-rich waters into the reef matrix. The imagery provides a clear picture of a well-organized, but spatially complex, frontal system existing in the southern Coral Sea, which is associated with enhanced commercial and recreational fishing activity in the region.

As an alternative approach, we empirically evaluated a technique that uses the ratio of euphotic depth (Z(eu)) to mixed-layer depth (Z(m)) as a parameter to predict the relative abundance of three major algal groups-diatoms, dinoflagellates, and coccolithophores in the surface layer of the temperate North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans. The ratio can be ascertained without in situ measurements; Z(eu) can be estimated from ocean color imagery, and Z(m) can be derived from hydrographic models. Diatoms were found to dominate the phytoplankton community, in terms of cell concentration, at stations possessing significantly greater values of the ratio Z(eu):Z(m) than those stations where dinoflagellates dominated This is contrary to the generally accepted view that diatoms occupy less stratified water columns than dinoflagellates.

A video camera, borehole sighted with the laser, records an image for locating flight lines. CPS data are used to locate flight line positions on the landscape. Laser data were used to measure vegetation canopy topography, height, cover and distribution and to measure microtopography of the land surface and gullies with depths of 15-20 cm. Macrotopography of landscape profiles for segments up to 4 km were in agreement with available topographic maps but provided more detail. Larger gullies with and without vegetation, and stream channel cross sections and their associated floodplains have also been measured and reported in other publications. Landscape segments for any length could be measured for either micro- or macrotopography. Airborne laser altimeter measurements of landscape profiles can provide detailed information on landscape properties or specific needs that will allow better decisions on the design and location of structures (i.e., roads, pipe, and power lines) and for improving the management and conservation of natural and agricultural landscapes.RP RITCHIE, JC (通讯作者)，USDA ARS,BELTSVILLE AGR RES CTR,HYDROL LAB,BARC W,BLDG 007,BELTSVILLE,MD 20705, USA.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 17, 33, 33, 0, 6, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE PUBL CO INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

The study area was situated at Les Arcs, a ski resort, with elevations ranging from 1600 m to 2600 m. Ground data included snow depth, liquid water content, and snow and air temperature. A SPOT image was available for December and aerial photographs for the following July. In December there was almost no snow, while in April the area was completely snow covered. Because of the highly varying topography, a DEM (digital elevation model) was used to correct the image geometrically and radiometrically. A simple scheme was developed for these corrections. The snow was slightly wet in April and many features appearing on the image are due to the snow itself or to the snow-ground interface. In particular, the ski runs are clearly visible due to the different structure of the packed snow. Only a small area could be compared between December and April due to technical problems in December. It appears that the snow-free and snow-covered signatures are very similar for this particular terrain, which is a golf course in summer; that is, smooth wet soil with short grass.

A large portable field chamber (volume of 3.25 m(3) and an area of 2.67 m(2)) enclosed the canopy, and CO2 and water vapor concentrations were measured at 2-s intervals for 60 s with an infrared gas analyzer operated in differential mode.

Other estimates of CT were obtained from a fixed infrared thermometer at the weather station and from low flying aircraft. Diurnal measurements were completed on 10 April 1989 when the wheat was in midflowering (Zadoks scale 65). Diurnal trends in CER showed differences between fully irrigated and deficit-irrigated plots. The small differences in ET and CT between irrigated and deficit-irrigated plots suggested minimum plant stress on deficit-irrigated plots, at least during the early part of the day. The cumulative daytime photosynthesis showed the irrigated plots averaged 28.9 g CO2 m(-2) while the deficit-irrigated plots showed a 52% reduction in CER. The CT ranged from about 7 degrees C near sunrise through a maximum of 27 degrees C and then decreased to 15 degrees C at sundown. The average cumulative daytime chamber ET was 8.41 mm and 7.69 mm for the fully and deficit-irrigated plots, respectively, which compared with reference ET of 8.91 mm and aircraft estimate of 8.93 mm.

Canopy reflectance was studied in relation to phenological development stages, dry and wet soil spectral reflectance, and green peak and red minimum reflectance characteristics of single barley leaves. Different leaves in the canopy were spectrally similar and the parameters of the green peak and the red minimum were stable. Based on reflectance characteristics, the growing season could be divided into four distinct Feekes scale phenological periods: 1) F = 1-3, emergence sprouting to initial tillering. The spectral characteristics of leaves could not be identified in canopy reflectance and multitemporal measurements of reflectance at constant soil moisture content are needed to extract optimal information on crop development. The best early season spectral information on plants was obtained in the visible region with a dry soil background; wet soil as a background gave high contrast between canopy and soil reflectance in the near infrared region of the spectrum. 2) F = 4-10.4, tiller elongation to ear emergence. Spectral characteristics of leaves could be identified in total canopy reflectance, except the red edge parameters which were influenced by canopy structure. Measuring spectral reflectance of the canopy during this period gave information on plant parameters independent of background reflectance. 3) F = 10.5-11.2, grain filling. During this period only small changes in reflectance were registered. A shift in the green peak towards longer wave-lengths indicated that ear reflectance and senescent tissue became relatively more important in total canopy reflectance than leaf reflectance. 4) F = 11.2-11.4, canopy senescence period corresponding to grain dry down.

In this study, we developed an effective Building Height Estimation method by synergizing Photogrammetry and Deep learning methods (BHEPD) to leverage Chinese multi-view GaoFen-7 (GF-7) images for high-resolution building height estimation. In particular, BHEPD incorporates the StereoNet model and is capable of generating an edge-preserving digital surface model (DSM) from GF-7 images. This improvement enhances the accuracy of heights estimation, particularly for high-rise, high-density, and multi-scale buildings. BHEPD extracted over 700,000 building heights in local areas of Tianjin, Lanzhou, Chongqing, Ningbo, Guangzhou, Foshan, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong. The estimated building heights in the different cities are highly consistent with the reference building height data obtained from field-measured building height data, building floor data, and airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. The R-2 varies from 0.75 to 0.90, while the root mean square error (RMSE) ranges from 4.06 m to 8.06 m. The validation of the estimated building heights over 106,366 buildings using airborne LiDAR height data yielded R-2 and RMSE of 0.90 and 6.72 m for Shenzhen and 0.89 and 4.06 m for Hong Kong, respectively. Furthermore, a comparison with the building height estimation based on the traditional DSM generation method (i.e., semi-global matching (SGM) algorithm) confirmed the superiority of BHEPD in alleviating the underestimation of high-rise buildings (>60 m). Overall, BHEPD shows great potential for high-resolution building height estimation and can be expected to reduce the manual workload involved in collecting building height information on large scale.', '[Chen, Peimin; Huang, Huabing; Liu, Jinying; Liu, Chong] Sun Yat sen Univ, Sch Geospatial Engn & Sci, Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China.

However, spectral diversity approaches relate image spectra to plant community diversity by only incorporating variation among adjacent pixels, considering each pixel as a homogeneous entity composed of one class, and disregarding the within-pixel variability. Although such approaches might work for remotely-sensed data with fine spatial resolution, they might not be viable solutions to estimate plant diversity using coarse-resolution data from forthcoming spaceborne imagers. To address the limitations associated with spectral diversity approaches, we proposed a novel approach, known as endmember diversity, for remote estimation of plant diversity through quantifying spectral diversity at the sub-pixel level and taking into account the within-pixel variability. The approach consisted of deriving the number and abundance of distinct spectral entities within each pixel via spectral unmixing. In doing so, we considered the spectral signature of each pixel as a mixture of distinct spectral entities, commonly known as endmembers. We then used the per-pixel endmembers and their abundance to calculate different spectral diversity metrics for every pixel. We assessed the performance of the endmember diversity approach at estimating plant taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity based on two experiments using a simulated spectral dataset and a real-world spaceborne DESIS (DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer) dataset. In both experiments, we found significant associations between endmember diversity and in situ plant diversity. Additionally, our method applied to DESIS data outperformed a conventional spectral diversity metric based on the coefficient of variation when applied to 1-m airborne imaging spectroscopy data. Collectively, our results demonstrate the capability of forthcoming spaceborne imagers to monitor local plant diversity.', '[Rossi, Christian] Dept Geoinformat, Swiss Natl Pk,Runatsch 124 Chaste,Planta-Wildenber, CH-7530 Zernez, Switzerland.

Modeling this behavior remains challenging. Indeed, satellite remote sensing based Penman-Monteith (PM) ET models tend not to directly consider soil moisture constraints on evaporation and transpiration due to a lack of consistent soil moisture data. To address this issue, we modified a PM model to include satellite enhanced surface and root zone soil moisture from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. The resulting model was used to produce global 9-km daily ET estimates, including contributing fluxes from soil evaporation, transpiration and evaporation of canopy-intercepted precipitation. The global PM ET estimates were assessed using in situ sap flow and AmeriFlux measurements, upscaled FLUXCOM latent heat flux, as well as against other independent global ET data products (GLEAM, GLDAS, SSEBop, and LandFlux-EVAL). The modelled transpiration showed similar seasonal variation and positive correlation to in situ sap flow measurements available from several forest sites (R-2 = 0.85; p < 0.01). When compared against AmeriFlux data, the PM ET estimates showed favorable agreement with annual ET measurements extracted from 34 diverse sites (R-2 = 0.58; p < 0.01; RMSE = 227 mm yr(-1)). The PM 8-day ET results also reflected a similar hemispheric seasonality as the global FLUXCOM record (R-2 = 0.94-0.98; p < 0.01), while comparisons against other global ET products showed moderate mean differences of between 49 and 107 mm yr(-1 )(11-25%) over the global domain. Our PM ET estimates varied up to 52% in response to SMAP surface soil moisture dynamics, displaying stronger surface (0-5 cm depth) than root zone (0-100 cm) soil moisture sensitivity. While PM ET sensitivity to soil moisture was greater in arid climate regions, it was also significant in humid climate zones, with analysis indicating that the inclusion of soil moisture predominantly acts as a sustaining influence on ET, especially in moisture limited drylands. PM ET sensitivity to temperature was stronger in humid forest regions relative to other climate and land cover regimes. Overall, the model results clarify the influence of soil moisture heterogeneity on the global ET pattern as informed by satellite-based estimates of surface and root zone soil moisture. Potential enhancements to the spatial and vertical resolution of soil moisture inputs are expected to enable further ET improvements through more realistic model representation of soil and plant available water.', '[Kim, Youngwook] United Arab Emirates Univ, Biol Dept, Coll Sci, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates.

Producing symptoms that resemble water stress or nutrient deficiency, infection by these vascular pathogens restricts water and nutrient flow through the xylem. Hyperspectral, narrow-band multispectral, and thermal imagery acquired at a high spatial resolution can detect disease symptoms, even before they are visible, potentially allowing growers to distinguish infected plants from those affected by confounding environmental stresses. Nevertheless, operational detection of vascular disease using high-resolution commercial satellite multispectral images remains to be evaluated. Here, we assessed the capacity of high-resolution Worldview-2 and -3 multispectral imagery to detect Xf and Vd infections in olive and almond orchards in Spain, Italy, and Australia between 2011 and 2021. We compared the accuracy of detecting both pathogens using the satellite imagery with results obtained using aerial highresolution hyperspectral and thermal imaging, with model-inverted plant traits, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), and thermal data as a reference. Our results using spectral plant traits to examine disease progression at all stages showed that traits and their importance varied as a function of disease severity. Worldview-2 and -3 detected the disease incidence with overall accuracies ranging from 0.63 to 0.83 and kappa coefficients (& kappa;) ranging from 0.29 to 0.68. Nevertheless, detecting the early stages of disease with multispectral satellite data yielded poorer results, with & kappa; values of 0.22-0.45, compared with & kappa; values of 0.3-0.69 obtained from hyperspectral data. Typical multispectral bandsets available from satellite sensors cannot measure important plant traits such as the blue index NPQI, xanthophyll proxy PRIn, SIF, and anthocyanin levels, thus explaining the poorer results obtained from multispectral satellite data for the early detection of vascular diseases. Adding a thermal-based crop water stress indicator to the satellite data improved the overall accuracies by 10-15% and increased & kappa; by >0.2 units.

The Sentinel-2 mission was designed for systematic global mapping of these variables at 20 m resolution using imagery from the MultiSpectral Instrument. The Simplified Level 2 Prototype Processor (SL2P) is available as a baseline mapping solution. Previous validation over limited sites indicates that SL2P generally satisfies user requirements for all three variables over crops, but underestimates LAI over forests. In this study, Sentinel-2 fAPAR, fCOVER, and LAI products, from SL2P, were validated over 281 sites representative of most North American forest ecozones and also compared to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) products. In addition to meeting the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites Stage 3 validation requirements for these areas, our study also explores the relationship between bias in SL2P products and canopy clumping and provides empirical bias correction functions for each variable.   SL2P was implemented within the Landscape Evolution and Forecasting Toolbox in Google Earth Engine both for efficiency and due to bugs in the Sentinel Application Platform implementation. SL2P was found to under-estimate LAI by 20% to 50% over forests with LAI > 2; in agreement with other studies and with comparisons to MODIS and CGLS products. SL2P bias for fCOVER and fAPAR transitions from similar to 0.1 at low values to similar to -0.1 at high values. Precision error, at one standard deviation, was similar to 0.5 for LAI and slightly less than similar to 0.1 for fCOVER and fAPAR. Total uncertainty was dominated by bias for LAI and was slightly greater than precision error for fCOVER and fAPAR. Target user requirements were satisfied for 51% of LAI, 37% of fCOVER and 31% of fAPAR comparisons to in-situ measurements. For all variables, accuracy exhibited weak to moderate linear relationships to clumping (r2 <= 0.52), but scatter plots indicated larger negative LAI biases over northern latitude sites where canopies exhibited greater clumping. With the exception of evergreen broadleaf forests, empirical bias correction using in-situ data reduced accuracy error by 40% for fCOVER, 57% for fAPAR and, 92% for LAI and increased the agreement rate with uncertainty requirements by up to 8%.

This characteristic makes the LST at different angles incomparable and limits its application. Multi-angle data are usually required to model or retrieve the angular anisotropy, but most of the TIR images are observed from one single angle. This study investigates the relationship between fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) and thermal radiance, and proposes a practical method for angular normalization of LST using an FVC-radiance space LST angular normalization (called the FRAN method) to perform LST angular normalization for two-component (leaf and soil) vegetated canopy using only single-angle, single-temporal TIR data. In this method, the single-angle data are used to construct the space and build a linear relationship between FVC and radiance. Nadir radiance and LST are obtained by using FVC data at nadir. The validity and accuracy of the FRAN method are tested by using simulated dataset. Results show that 60%-70% of the angular effect of LST can be corrected, and the maximum LST correction reaches 2.0 K. The LST biased error distribution changes to unbiased distribution after angular normalization. The method sensitivity to the vertex of FVC-radiance space and the parameter in FVC calculation is analyzed. The FRAN method is applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, and obtains the maximum correction of LST as 1.2 K. Viewing zenith angle and land cover affect the corrected LST. The FRAN method has the potential for practical angular normalization of LST with single-angle data.', '[Teng, Yuanjian; Ren, Huazhong; Zhu, Jinshun; Jiang, Chenchen; Zeng, Hui] Peking Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & Geog Informat Syst, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.

This paper presents a robust framework for deriving continuous probability of detection functions and quantification uncertainty models for example aerial measurement techniques based on controlled release data. Using extensive fully-and semi-blinded controlled release experiments to test Bridger Photonics Inc.\'s Gas Mapping LiDAR (GML)TM, as well as available semi-and non-blinded controlled release data for Kairos LeakSurveyorTM and NASA/JPL AVIRIS-NG technologies, robust POD functions are derived that enable calcu-lation of detection probability for any given source rate, wind speed, and flight altitude. Uncertainty models are separately developed that independently address measurement bias, bias variability, and measurement precision, allowing for a distribution of the true source rate to be directly calculated from the source rate estimated by the technology. Derived results demonstrate the potential of all three technologies in methane detection and miti-gation, and the developed methodology can be readily applied to characterize other techniques or update POD and uncertainty models following future controlled release experiments. Finally, the analyzed results also demonstrate the importance of using controlled release data from a range of sites and times to avoid under-estimating measurement uncertainties.', '[Conrad, Bradley M.; Tyner, David R.; Johnson, Matthew R.] Carleton Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Energy & Emiss Res Lab, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.', 'Carleton UniversityRP Johnson, MR (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Energy & Emiss Res Lab, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.', 'Matthew.Johnson@carleton.caRI Conrad, Bradley M/T-7730-2018; Johnson, Matthew/F-2672-2010', 'Conrad, Bradley M/0000-0003-3678-7434; Johnson,   Matthew/0000-0002-3637-9919', 'Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) [EIP2-MET-001]; Natural Sciences and   Engineering Research Council of Canada [06632, 522658]; Environment and   Climate Change Canada (ECCC) [300071420]; Environmental Defense Fund', 'This work was supported by Natural Resources Canada (NRCan, grant number   EIP2-MET-001) , Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of   Canada (grant numbers 06632 and 522658) , Environment and Climate Change   Canada (ECCC, contract number 300071420) , and Environmental Defense   Fund.', 51, 4, 4, 1, 2, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) permits filaments to be observed at O[1-km] resolution, but extensive coherent structures are more apparent in weaker winds. A wind speed adjustment is proposed for filaments (i.e., contiguous SAR contrasts) of at least 10 km in length. Measures of dependence (distance correlation and the linear and nonlinear components of Pearson correlation) are examined to identify a broad peak in the relationship between filament contrast and weak or moderate values of surface wind speed, where a variable wind speed exponent is employed to maximize these measures. Three locations of recent North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) sightings in the Gulf of St. Lawrence are sampled between 2008 and 2020 by 324 Radarsat-2 SAR scenes and 10-m wind speed from the ERA5 reanalysis. The inverse relationship between SAR contrast magnitude and wind speed is quantified, and a reduced correlation is obtained for all three domains when SAR contrast is weighted by wind speed to the power of 0.8. A more uniform emphasis on ocean surface structure within a SAR scene, or across multiple scenes, can thus be considered in the search for prey aggregations of the North Atlantic right whale.', '[Danielson, Richard E.; Shen, Hui; Tao, Jing; Perrie, William] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Bedford Inst Oceanog, Dartmouth, NS, Canada.', 'Bedford Institute of Oceanography; Fisheries & Oceans CanadaRP Danielson, RE (通讯作者)，Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Bedford Inst Oceanog, Dartmouth, NS, Canada.', 'rick.danielson@dfo-mpo.gc.ca', 'Tao, Jing/0000-0003-0370-7127; Perrie, Will/0000-0002-3598-2791; SHEN,   HUI/0000-0003-4403-7617; Danielson, Richard/0000-0002-2025-0707', 'Competitive Science Research Fund (CSRF); Fisheries and Oceans Canada', 'Comments from Hilary Moors-Murphy, Catherine Brennan, Kevin Sorochan,   three anonymous reviewers, and the associate editor contributed much to   our presentation.

SIF response to crop physiological alterations under water stress is complicated by concurrent non-physiological changes. The non-physiological variation stems from crop structure, leaf optical traits (i.e. pigments, leaf water content, and dry matter), and sun-target geometry. This study aims to disentangle the physiological effect from the non-physiological effect on SIF variations caused by water stress, providing more direct insights into the mechanism of SIF response to stress. We parameterized the radiative transfer model (RTM) SCOPE with top-ofcanopy (TOC) reflectance and SIF measurements to decouple the joint effects on TOC SIF in sugar beet. SIF and reflectance data were acquired over irrigated and water-stressed plots using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) on two consecutive days. The non-physiological response was quantified with SCOPE by fitting the model parameters to the TOC reflectance measurements. Subsequently, fluorescence emission yield (phi F) was estimated using SIF measurements to represent the actual physiological status. The results demonstrate that SIF variation caused by water stress both at 687 nm and 760 nm was affected by both the physiological alterations in phi F and the non-physiological changes. At both 687 nm and 760 nm, the non-physiological contribution to SIF variations was lower than the contribution of phi F variation induced by water stress. The lower non-physiological contribution was mainly due to the weak combined effect of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by leaf chlorophyll (fAPARchl) and the fluorescence escape fraction (fesc) on SIF responses. This study provided direct insights into the plant physiological status under water stress and further indicated the ability of the approach of combining RTMs, canopy reflectance, and SIF measurements to support the scalable quantitative use of SIF from the leaf to the ecosystem level.', '[Wang, Na; Clevers, Jan G.

Such phenology signals importantly regulate large-scale biogeochemical cycles and regional climate. PlanetScope CubeSats data with a 3-m resolution and near-daily global coverage provide an unprecedented opportunity to monitor both fine-and ecosystem-scale phenology variability along large environmental gradients. However, a scalable method that accurately characterizes leaf phenology from PlanetScope with biophysically meaningful metrics remains lacking. We developed an index -guided, ecologically constrained autoencoder (IG-ECAE) method to automatically derive a deciduousness metric (percentage of upper tree canopies with leaf-off status within an image pixel) from PlanetScope. The IG-ECAE first estimated the reflectance spectra of leafy/leafless canopies based on their spectral indices charac-teristics, then used the derived reflectance spectra to guide an autoencoder deep learning method with additional ecological constraints to refine the reflectance spectra, and finally used linear spectral unmixing to estimate the relative abundance of leafless canopies (or deciduousness) per PlanetScope image pixel. We tested the IG-ECAE method at 16 tropical forest sites spanning multiple continents and a large precipitation gradient (1470-2819 mm year -1). Among these sites, we evaluated the PlanetScope-derived deciduousness against corresponding measures derived from WorldView-2 (n = 9 sites) and local phenocams (n = 9 sites). Our results show that PlanetScope-derived deciduousness agrees: 1) with that derived from WorldView-2 at the patch level (90 m x 90 m) with r2 = 0.89 across all sites; and 2) with that derived from phenocams to quantify ecosystem-scale sea-sonality with r2 ranging from 0.62 to 0.96. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of IG-ECAE in characterizing the wide variability in deciduousness across scales from pixels to forest ecosystems, and from a single date to the full annual cycle, indicating the potential for using high-resolution satellites to track the large-scale phenological patterns and response of tropical forests to climate change.', '[Wang, Jing] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Ecol, Shenzhen Campus, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China.

The TP has been undergoing a rapid warming, which accelerates glacial melting, and causes more natural hazards. Although the warming on the TP has been widely investigated, there is no complete picture of its thermal status during the past decades for lack of high-quality, long-term, spatiotemporal-continuous observations. The number of weather stations are rather limited and are mainly located in the east of the TP. The analysis based on these stations is confronted with the spatial representativeness problem. On the other hand, Satellites can monitor the earth seamlessly in space and time, but reliable land surface temperatures (LSTs) have only been available in recent 20 years, and moreover their physical meaning also differs from that of the most commonly used surface air temperatures (SATs). For climate change research, the period length of these satellite LSTs is too short to obtain a definitive conclusion. In this study, the entire algorithm consists of two primary steps. One is to develop an stacking-based ensemble learning algorithm to convert LSTs to SATs with the random forest model as both base learner and meta learner. The other is to construct a Bayesian-based temporal extension algorithm to merge satellite SATs and station SATs to obtain long-term, spatiotemporal-continuous SATs. After validating the reliability of these SATs and the warming trends based on them, 60 years (1961-2020) of SATs on the TP are implemented to examine the warming status of the TP. The spatial pattern of temperature trends illustrates that the warming occurs almost everywhere on the TP, and lots of areas with intensive warming, cannot be detected only based on station ob-servations, especially in the western part of the TP. Similarly, ERA5-Land and CRU datasets underestimate the warming in these areas. The newly-derived warming rate arrives at 0.03 degrees C/year and is 50% greater than those computed based on ERA5-Land and CRU dataset, implying an unexpected severe threat to the cryosphere.', '[Qin, Jun; He, Min; Lu, Ning; Yao, Ling; Jiang, Hou; Wu, Jin; Zhou, Chenghu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China.

The impact of cloud cover leads to spatially incomplete of thermal infrared (TIR)-based LST products, which seriously hinders the applications of LST products in various fields. Several methods have been developed to reconstruct LST under cloudy conditions in previous studies, but there is a lack of an effective method for the reconstruction of cloudy LST at the spatial resolution of Landsat pixel (30 m). In this study, a novel method was proposed to reconstruct LST under cloudy conditions from Landsat 8 data. The LST reconstruction method includes four main steps: (1) identification of cloud-free, cloud-shadow, cloudobscured, and cloud-covered pixels by integrating the Fmask method with a cloud-shape matching method; (2) calculation of annual temperature cycle (ATC)-based reference LST by fitting an ATC model to all available Landsat 8 LST product during 2013-2020; (3) estimation of LST residual from spatially adjacent similar pixels; and (4) estimation of reconstructed LST in terms of the sum of ATC-based reference LST and LST residual. The performance of the LST reconstruction method was evaluated using Landsat 8 LST images under clear-sky conditions as reference data. The root mean squared error (RMSE) between reconstructed LST and Landsat 8 reference LST ranges from 0.9 K to 2.5 K. The LST reconstruction method was further applied to reconstruct actual Landsat 8 LST images under cloudy conditions. Compared with original Landsat 8 LST images, the spatial distribution of reconstructed LST images is more complete. The pattern of reconstructed LST images reflects the spatial variability of LST well. The accuracy of the LST reconstruction method was validated against in situ LST measurements at six SURFRAD (Surface Radiation Budget Network) sites. The overall bias and RMSE between reconstructed LST and in situ LST at all sites are approximately -0.3 K and 3.5 K, respectively. The LST reconstruction method has great potentials to improve the applications of Landsat LST product in urban thermal environment monitoring and crop water stress monitoring.', '[Zhu, Xiaolin; Duan, Si-Bo; Li, Zhao-Liang] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Key Lab Agr Remote Sensing, Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.

NASA\'s Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) atmospheric-and Lunar-BRDF-corrected Black Marble product (VNP46A2) provides daily global night-time radiances with high temporal consistency. However, timely and continuous monitoring of NTL changes based on the dense daily DNB time series is still lacking. In this study, we proposed a novel Viewing Zenith Angle (VZA) stratified COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD) algorithm (VZA-COLD) to detect NTL change at 15 arc-second spatial resolution with daily updating capability based on NASA\'s Black Marble prod-ucts. Specifically, we divided the clear observations into four VZA intervals (0-20 degrees, 20 degrees-40 degrees, 40 degrees-60 degrees, and 0-60 degrees) to mitigate the temporal variation of the NTL data caused by the combined angular effects of viewing geometry and the complex surface conditions (e.g., building heights, vegetation canopy covers, etc.). Single-term harmonic models were continuously estimated for new observations from each VZA interval, and by comparing the model predictions with the actual DNB observations, a unified set of NTL changes can be captured continuously among the different VZA intervals. The final NTL change maps were generated after excluding the consistent dark pixels. Results showed that the VZA-COLD algorithm reduced the DNB data temporal variations caused by disparities among different viewing angles and surface conditions, and successfully detected NTL changes for six globally distributed test sites with an overall accuracy of 99.71%, a user\'s accuracy of 87.18%, and a producer\'s accuracy of 68.88% for the NTL change category.', '[Li, Tian; Zhu, Zhe; Zhao, Yongquan] Univ Connecticut, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.

The main goal of this article is to provide a realistic and comprehensive characterization of the sea ice and its snow cover that explains the microwave observations during a whole year using a radiative transfer model. For this purpose, we construct a unique dataset of passive microwave observations, to mimic the future Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR), along with the active microwave scatterometer data (ASCAT). CIMR database is used to classify sea ice microwave signatures in their spectral dimension with a machine learning technique while ASCAT data are used to help interpret the results of the classification. Classification results are then interpreted with a state-of-art sea ice and Snow Microwave Radiative Transfer model (SMRT) for all highlighted signatures and all seasons. Results make it possible to identify the specific behaviors from the observation co-variabilities for SIC, SIT, and snow structure. Our analysis underlined the role of the depth hoar over multi-year ice, for the interpretation of scattering signals in winter. Scattering signals that appear in late summer are explained by the presence of superimposed ice.

The Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) based approach has been used extensively around the world for mapping snow, and they displayed high accuracy in open areas. However, capturing snow cover in forests remains problematic due to the obstruction effects of the forest canopy, which causes the snow cover area to be seriously underestimated. In this paper, we present a new algorithm based on machine learning (ML) technology to improve the accuracy of binary snow cover (BSC) mapping in forests, using the remotely sensed surface reflectance and ground truth data. A time-lapse photography network with a two-hour resolution was established in the eastern Qilian Mountains in northwestern China to obtain the ground truth data both in forests and open areas. We trained Random Forests (RF) with the 500-m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance data from bands 1-7 to generate BSC results (RF-BSC). Then we evaluated RF-BSC and the NDSI-derived BSC maps with three different NDSI thresholds (i.e., 0.10, 0.29, and 0.40) against ground truth data. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm has a high performance in forest BSC mapping in this area, compared to the NDSI-threshold approach. The RF-BSC can retrieve 67% of all real forest snow pixels, while the NDSI-based BSC can only detect 8-14%. We also find that the performance of the algorithm seems to be sensitive to changes in solar illumination conditions and forest coverage.

Several methods have been developed for haze removal, which is an ill-posed problem. However, most of these methods involve various strong assumptions coupled with manually-determined parameters, which limit their generalization to different scenarios. Moreover, temporal information amongst time series images has rarely been considered in haze removal. In this paper, the temporal information is proposed to be incorporated for more reliable haze removal, and guided by this general idea, a temporal information injection network (TIIN) is developed. The proposed TIIN solution for haze removal extracts the useful information in the temporally neighboring images provided by the regular revisit of satellite sensors. The TIIN method is suitable for images with various haze levels. Moreover, TIIN is also applicable for temporal neighbors with inherent haze or land cover changes due to a long-time interval between images. The proposed method was validated through experiments on both simulated and real haze images as well as comparison with five state-ofthe-art benchmark methods.

Published TCT coefficients for the Landsat sensor series have mainly been derived using top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and sparse data sets. Studies to derive TCT coefficients for Landsat surface reflectance (SR) are lacking. In this study, the TCT coefficients were derived independently for Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) SR and TOA reflectance using the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization (GSO) method. To ensure that the derived TCT coefficients are robust and broadly applicable, representative samples of soil, vegetation, and water were selected from summer and autumn Landsat-8 OLI Analysis Ready Data (ARD) sampled from 40.4 million 30 m pixel locations across the conterminous United States (CONUS). Given that the blue band is susceptible to atmospheric contamination due to its shorter wavelength, two groups of TCT coefficients were derived: one from 6 bands (Blue, Green, Red, NIR, SWIR1, SWIR2) and one from 5 bands without the blue band. As TCT results cannot be validated in a formal way, the TCT components for CONUS summer TOA and SR composites were generated and compared with National Land Cover Database (NLCD) land cover classes to provide a synoptic assessment and provide confidence in the results. In addition, three ARD tiles selected to encompass a mix of land cover types, predominantly, desert in Nevada, wetland and urban in Florida, and agriculture in North Dakota, were used to analyze the seasonal variation of the TCT components. The results demonstrate that the derived Landsat-8 TCT coefficients can effectively characterize brightness, greenness, and wetness components across the CONUS, and show good consistency for discrimination of land cover types and track seasonal surface variations. There was no significant difference between each TCT component derived using the 6-band and 5-band TCT coefficients considering a large sample of CONUS pixels. Therefore, the 5-band TCT coefficients provided in this study are recommended for use, as the blue band is atmospherically sensitive and difficult to atmospherically correct reliably.', '[Zhai, Yongguang] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Water Conservancy & Civil Engn Coll, Hohhot, Peoples R China.

In these methods (theta) over bar. is most commonly estimated using a single empirical relationship with evaporative fraction Lambda(SEB) or evaporative index Lambda(PET). Methods have been proposed recently to estimate these relationships based on regional climate, soil, and vegetation characteristics, but those methods have not yet been applied to estimate (theta) over bar from remote sensing data. The objective of this study is to evaluate the. estimates from remote sensing when the Lambda(SEB) vs. (theta) over bar and Lambda(PET) vs. (theta) over bar relationships are inferred from regional characteristics using the previously proposed methods. Four study regions are considered including the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed in Arizona, the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site and Lower Arkansas River Valley in Colorado, the Little Washita and Fort Cobb Experimental Watersheds in Oklahoma, and the Mississippi Delta region in Mississippi. The (theta) over bar estimates from the regionally adapted relationships are compared to (theta) over bar estimates from the single empirical relationship and to in situ (theta) over bar measurements. The estimates from the regionally adapted relationships consistently outperform the estimates form the single empirical relationship. The performance typically improves as more regional information is used in the relationships and reduces the root mean squared error of (theta) over bar by an average of 45% among the four regions. The regional method typically performs better for the arid and semiarid regions with root mean squared errors of 0.05 cm(3) cm(-3) and 0.04 cm(3) cm(-3), respectively.

Climate change is predicted to alter the distribution of cool season (C-3) and warm season (C-4) grasses, however, the lack of spatial distributions and temporal variations of grass functional type information severely limits our understanding of climate impacts on grasslands. This study classified C-3 and C-4 grasses per pixel according to the peak of growing season generated from Enhanced Vegetation Index time series. From 2003 to 2017, the C-3-C-4 composition of Australian rain-fed grasslands and pastures was mapped at 500 m resolution on an annual basis across a wide geographical range (10 degrees S - 45 degrees S), and revealed extreme inter-annual fluctuations. Over the 15-year period, the satellite-derived ratio of C-4 to C-3 grasses significantly increased (p < 0.05), indicating a long-term shift in community composition that was confirmed with 182,911 Atlas of Living Australia ground observations. The most pronounced changes occurred in mid-latitude transitional areas where C-3 and C-4 grasses co-dominate. Our climate analysis indicated the inter-annual fluctuations of C-4/C-3 grass ratios were significantly associated (p < 0.05) with warm/cool season rainfall ratios, and not with temperature or annual rainfall. This suggests that an increase in the warm/cool season rainfall ratio favors C-4 grasses and a decrease in the warm/cool season rainfall ratio favors C-3 grasses. Our findings reveal spatially-detailed dynamics of grasslands and demonstrate large-scale grassland compositional changes over 15 years. The grass composition maps should help improve ecological forecasting of grass distributions and enable researches on grassland ecosystem responses to climate change that are relevant to both adaptation of rangeland agricultural and fire management practices. Our study should also help predict grass distribution under future climate conditions, and assist in the accurate modelling of global water, carbon, and energy exchanges between the land surface and atmosphere.', '[Xie, Qiaoyun; Huete, Alfredo; Hall, Christopher C.] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Sci, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.

Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) data have been shown sensitive to vegetation canopy characteristics across many ecosystems, thereby potentially providing an accurate and cost-effective tool to quantify shrub canopy cover. This study evaluated the sensitivity of L-band Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) data to the aboveground biomass and Leaf Area Index (LAI) of dwarf birch and alder in the Trail Valley Creek watershed, Northwest Territories, Canada. The sigma degrees VH /sigma degrees VV ratio showed strong sensitivity to both LAI (R2 = 0.72 with respect to in-situ measurements) and wet aboveground biomass (R2 = 0.63) of dwarf birch. Our ALOS-2-derived maps revealed high variability of birch shrub LAI and biomass across spatial scales. The LAI map was fed into the sparse Gash model to estimate shrub rainfall interception, an important but under-studied component of the Arctic water balance. Results suggest that on average across the watershed, 17 +/- 3% of incoming rainfall was intercepted by dwarf birch (during summer 2018), highlighting the importance of shrub rainfall interception for the regional water balance.

Comprehensive knowledge about these intensities is a crucial factor for sustainable decisionmaking in landscape policy. For meadows, the management intensity can be described by proxies such as the mowing frequency, usually, a higher number of cuts indicate higher intensities. Dense time series of medium resolution (10-30 m) remote sensing data are suitable for the detection of mowing events. However, existing studies revealed a general lack of consensus about the most appropriate input data set for a consistent and reliable mowing detection. We systematically evaluated the synergistic use of acquisitions from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 to detect the occurrence, frequency, and date of mowing events as an indicator of grassland management intensity. Dense time series of NDVI (Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8), gamma 0 backscatter, backscatter cross-ratio, backscatter secondorder texture metrics as well as 6-day interferometric coherence (Sentinel-1) were used as input features. All possible combinations of input features were tested to train a one-dimensional convolutional neural network, which enables enhanced exploitation of the temporal domain of the data. The evaluation was conducted on 64 meadows for an overall of 257 mowing events from 2017 to 2019 in Germany. Our results revealed that the combination of input features improves the detection performance. The highest overall accuracy was reached by a combination of NDVI, backscatter cross-ratio, and interferometric coherence with an F1-Score of 0.84. The mowing frequency was predicted with a mean absolute error of 0.38 events per year, while the date of the events was missed by 3.79 days on average. NDVI time series alone mostly underperformed in comparison to optical/SAR combinations but clearly outperformed input-sets that were solely based on SAR features. The proposed model performed well for meadows with low to medium management intensities but further testing is recommended for highly intensive managed parcels. The results clearly demonstrate the additional value of fusing time series of the three present Earth observation systems that deliver a freely available global coverage of the land surface at medium resolution.', '[Lobert, Felix; Schwieder, Marcel; Gocht, Alexander; Erasmi, Stefan] Thunen Inst Farm Econ, Bundesallee 63, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany.

We developed a random forest model to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations at 1 km(2) resolution in and around industrialized Gauteng Province, South Africa, by combining satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD), meteorology, land use, and socioeconomic data. We then compared PM2.5 concentrations in the study domain before and after the implementation of the new national air quality standards. We aimed to test whether machine learning models are suitable for regions with sparse ground observations such as South Africa and which predictors played important roles in PM2.5 modeling. The cross-validation R-2 and Root Mean Square Error of our model was 0.80 and 9.40 mu g/m(3), respectively. Satellite AOD, seasonal indicator, total precipitation, and population were among the most important predictors. Model-estimated PM2.5 levels successfully captured the temporal pattern recorded by ground observations. Spatially, the highest annual PM2.5 concentration appeared in central and northern Gauteng, including northern Johannesburg and the city of Tshwane. Since the 2016 changes in national PM2.5 standards, PM2.5 concentrations have decreased in most of our study region, although levels in Johannesburg and its surrounding areas have remained relatively constant. This is anadvanced PM2.5 model for South Africa with high prediction accuracy at the daily level and at a relatively high spatial resolution. Our study provided a reference for predictor selection, and our results can be used for a variety of purposes, including epidemiological research, burden of disease assessments, and policy evaluation.', '[Du, Linlin; Wang, Wenhao; Zhu, Qingyang; Bi, Jianzhao; Scovronick, Noah; Liu, Yang] Emory Univ, Gangarosa Dept Environm Hlth, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.

The retrievals have been problematic even when the passive signatures at different spatial scales match well since they depend upon the accuracy of vegetation information such as the vegetation water content (VWC). The VWC used in the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) single channel retrieval algorithm (SCA) is derived from remotely sensed, climatologically-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which does not respond to real-time vegetation dynamics and is prone to saturation. This study explored the differences and seasonal trend in passive signatures and SM at satellite- and field-scales and investigated uncertainties in retrievals arising from different approaches used to estimate VWC from optical and radar indices. It used high temporal resolution, ground-based data collected during the SMAP Validation-Microwave Water, Energy Balance Experiment in 2016 (SMAPVEX16-MicroWEX) during a growing season of corn and soybean. Overall, the brightness temperatures (TB) from SMAP matched well with the upscaled, ground-based TB, with a root mean square differences (RMSDs) of about 5 K. In contrast, the SMAP SM retrievals were worse during rapid vegetation growth in the mid-season, with higher RMSDs compared to the upscaled in situ SM, than those in the late-season. In addition, the ground-based TB from corn and soybean were similar in the early and the late seasons, while their emission differences were > 40 K in the mid season. This indicates the importance of accurate VWC information, particularly during the early and late growing seasons, to account for sub-pixel heterogeneities in agricultural regions. VWC obtained from five optical and radar indices were used in the SMAP SCA for soil moisture retrieval for the entire growing season of corn. The NDVI-based VWC provided SM retrievals that were consistently lower compared to those using in situ VWC, with a higher RMSD of 0.030 m3/m3 and a negative bias of 0.020 m3/m3 for VWC > 4 kg/m2. The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)-derived VWC resulted in lower SM retrieval RMSD of 0.022 m3/m3 when compared with in situ SM. Among the three radar indices, vertically polarized cross-pol ratio (CRvv)-derived VWC provided similar RMSDs in retrieved SM as the NDWI-derived VWC during the growing season. The radar vegetation index (RVI)derived VWC improved in the late season compared to the in situ VWC and resulted in SM retrievals with RMSDs similar to the CRvv-derived retrievals. Results presented here suggest that SMAP SCA SM retrievals could be improved through the use of near-real time NDWI and CRvv-derived vegetation information. Microwave data are available regardless of cloud cover, so the guaranteed availability of CRvv to capture seasonal and interannual variability is advantageous.', '[Judge, Jasmeet; Preston, Daniel; Allen, Samantha; Rush, Patrick] Univ Florida, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Ctr Remote Sensing, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.

L-band ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 ScanSAR HH, HV, and HH/HV ratio were used to detect various deforestation stages based on their different radar scattering characteristics. The three main stages considered in this approach were as follows: (1) forest was cut, and felled trees were left on the ground, (2) felled trees were burned, and (3) felled (and burned) trees were removed. Two types of forest fires occurred in tropical rain forests and dry and open forests were considered. Multi-temporal data and image normalization techniques are used to suppress commission errors induced by the effects of seasonality and rainfall. Detection accuracies were eval-uated at 11 validation sites distributed over various forest types in Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. The user\'s and producer\'s accuracies of the proposed forest monitoring algorithm were estimated to be 85.0% and 63.8%, respectively. An additional broader performance assessment using data from 191 sites showed an esti-mated total user\'s accuracy of 71.1%. The results indicate that detection accuracies depend on temporal se-quences, with slower, gradual transitions from forest to other land cover hampering detection performance. The developed algorithm is used in the JICA-JAXA Forest Early Warning System in the tropics (JJ-FAST), which provides forest change information for 77 countries every 42 days under all weather conditions.

For coarse resolution infrared or microwave instruments, NN algorithms have been used at the pixel level. New neural architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) use the Deep Learning (DL) approach to solve complex problems at the image scale. For instance, CNNs have been applied to high resolution instruments (SAR or in the visible domain) to detect surface waters or vegetation. High resolution data is better suited for image processing techniques because spatial features are stronger and pixel noise can be an important issue. CNNs applications are generally related to image classification or segmentation, less for regression problems dealing with the estimation of a variable in each pixel of the image. The objective of this paper is to better understand how and on which conditions CNNs work, and how beneficial they can be for coarse resolution instruments such as IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer). The CNN and DL approaches are tested in a regression mode, to estimate the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) at the image scale. The CNN technique is compared to a traditional pixel-based NN: both have a SST retrieval error of 0.3 K. An instrument noise and a missing data sensitivity studies are conducted. It is shown that the use of the CNN approach in this simpleexperiment context is beneficial only under some conditions: when the variable to retrieve has enough spatial coherency (simple smoothness or presence of spatial features in the images), and when the instrument noise at the pixel scale is larger than a threshold. This study is a preliminary illustration of what can be expected from CNNs for coarse resolution instruments such as IASI.', '[Aires, Filipe; Boucher, Eulalie; Pellet, Victor] CNRS, Observ Paris, Lerma, Paris, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French   Research Universities; Universite PSL; Observatoire de ParisRP Aires, F (通讯作者)，CNRS, Observ Paris, Lerma, Paris, France.', 'filipe.aires@obspm.fr.frRI pellet, victor/HHN-1169-2022', 'pellet, victor/0000-0001-6996-0032', 'TOSCA program', 'The authors would like to thank the Centre National d\' OEtudes Spatiales   and, in particular, C.

Particularly, many applications could be developed in several fields of research (ecology, water and carbon cycle, etc.) from VOD products retrieved from the SMOS and SMAP observations at L-band, and from the combined AMSR-E (2002-2011)/AMSR2 (2012-present) observations at C-and X-bands. One of the main difficulties in retrieving VOD is that the microwave observations are sensitive to both the soil (mainly soil moisture) and vegetation (mostly VOD) features. The AMSR-E/2 sensors provide only mono-angular observations at two polarizations. These dual-channel observations may be strongly correlated so that retrieving SM and VOD simultaneously can be an ill-posed problem. Here, to overcome this problem, we proposed and evaluated a new retrieval approach from AMSR2 observations at X-band to produce a new X-VOD product. The X-VOD retrievals were based on the inversion of the X-MEB model, an extension of the L-MEB model (L-band microwave emission of the biosphere) to the X-band. The main originality in comparison to previous algorithms is that (i) only VOD was retrieved while SM was estimated from a reanalysis data set (ERA5-Land); (ii) model inversion was based on an innovative approach to initialize the cost function; and (iii) new values for the soil and vegetation X-MEB model parameters were calibrated. To evaluate the methodology, we performed the VOD retrievals over the whole African continent over 2014-2016, including a dry (2015) and a wet (2014) year. In a first step, we calibrated a set of three parameters: effective scattering albedo (omega), soil roughness (H-R) and VOD first guess (VODini). Several datasets of vegetation indices as Above-Ground Biomass (AGB), Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were chosen as reference data to optimize these model parameters. Globally-constant values (omega = 0.06 and H-R = 0.6) were found to achieve high spatial and temporal correlations between retrieved X-VOD and the reference vegetation parameters. Comparison with other X-VOD products suggested IB X-VOD had competitive advantages in terms of both spatial and temporal performances. In particular, spatial correlation with three biomass datasets was found to be higher than for previous X-VOD products (R-2 similar to 0.76-0.83) and temporal correlation with LAI or NDVI showed obvious improvements, especially in dense vegetation.', '[Wang, Mengjia; Sun, Rui] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

We thus designed a Temporal Coherence Index (TCI) based on the concept of information entropy. We test it on both synthetic and real landscapes showing its capacity to isolate which time series correspond to homogeneous targets based only on the MODIS measurements themselves.

In the era of big ocean data, making full use of multisource satellite observations to accurately detect and predict global subsurface thermohaline structure and advance our understanding of the ocean interior processes is extremely challenging. This study proposed a new deep learning-based method-bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural networks-for predicting global ocean subsurface temperature and salinity anomalies in combination with surface remote sensing observations (sea-surface temperature anomaly, sea-surface height anomaly, sea-surface salinity anomaly, and the northward and eastward components of seasurface wind anomaly), longitude and latitude information (LON and LAT), and subsurface Argo gridded data. Because of the temporal dependency and periodicity of ocean dynamic parameters, the Bi-LSTM is good at time-series feature learning by considering the significant temporal feature of the ocean variability and can well improve the robustness and generalization ability of the prediction model. For December 2015 as an example, our average prediction results in an overall determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.691/0.392 and a normalized root mean square error of 0.039 degrees C/0.051 PSU for subsurface temperature anomaly (STA)/subsurface salinity anomaly (SSA) prediction. This study sets up different cases based on different sea-surface feature combinations to predict the subsurface thermohaline structure and analyze the role of longitude and latitude information on Bi-LSTM prediction. The results show that in the prediction of STA, the contribution of LON + LAT to the model gradually increases with depth, whereas in the prediction of SSA, LON + LAT maintains a relatively significant contribution to the model at different depths. Meanwhile, in the STA and SSA prediction, the LAT plays a more significant role than LON. We also applied the model to bi-directional prediction for different months of 2010 and 2015 to prove the applicability and robustness of the model. This study suggests that Bi-LSTM is more advantageous in time-series modeling for predicting subsurface and deep ocean temperature and salinity structures, fully takes into account the timing dependence of global ocean data, and outperforms the classic random forest approach in predicting subsurface thermohaline structure from remote sensing data.', '[Su, Hua; Zhang, Tianyi; Lin, Mengjing; Lu, Wenfang] Fuzhou Univ, Natl & Local Joint Engn Res Ctr Satellite Geospat, Key Lab Spatial Data Min & Informat Sharing, Minist Educ, Fuzhou 350108, Peoples R China.

This study provides a spatially and temporally continuous estimate of LULC change for the Mekong River Basin for 2001-2019 using time series analysis of MODIS data coupled with a spatiotemporal carbon bookkeeping model to track carbon losses and recovery. The LULC change product has an overall accuracy of 74.4 +/- 1.9% (82.1 +/- 1.7% after consolidating tree-dominated classes), including an increase of 5.6% after combining with existing MODIS products (referred to as the M-CCDC process). Two of the largest components of LULC change in the region are the establishment of plantations and agricultural expansion, which were estimated to be 33,617 +/- 7342 km(2) and 14,915 +/- 4682 km(2) between 2003 and 2014. We found that 82% of the deforested area was converted to tree plantations. Among all the newly added plantations, 86% replaced natural forests and 12% replaced agricultural land. In addition, existing maps of annual tree canopy cover (TCC) were used to assess forest disturbances that do not result in LULC conversions. The M-CCDC results combined with the forest disturbances derived from TCC maps were coupled to a spatiotemporal carbon bookkeeping model to estimate carbon emissions and uptake. Carbon emissions were 72.9 +/- 6.2 Tg C yr(-1) during 2001-2017; emissions increase to 102.8 +/- 8.6 Tg C yr(-1) if including carbon not yet released to the atmosphere in the form of decomposing slash and wood products.

Its recently developed Monte Carlo mode using an unbiased bidirectional path tracing method, called DART-Lux, increases hundredfold DART efficiency to simulate images. Since DART-Lux does not simulate yet atmospheric RT, a hybrid method has been designed to accurately and fast simulate remote sensing images at top of atmosphere (TOA). It couples the atmospheric RT modelling of DART-FT with the very efficient Earth surface RT modelling of DART-Lux. For that, a new sky light modelling, an innovative BRF camera modelling and an adapted radiative coupling framework have been designed. The efficiency and accuracy of this hybrid method have been validated using DART-FT as a reference. Here, we present this validation for a realistic forest stand. Simulation time is reduced by a factor of 750 with a relative difference of solar plane reflectance factor smaller than 1%.

Finer sandstones have greater compositional variation compared to coarser sandstones, with higher modal proportions of mudstone intraclasts, K-feldspar, and muscovite laths, and lower modal quartz. Partial Least Squares modelling indicates a link between visible to shortwave infrared spectral data collected on samples and their average grain size. Specific electronic absorptions are important for defining this relationship, particularly in the blue-green visible spectra, wavelengths related to water or hydroxyl bonds, along with certain wavelengths in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectra. The results from field samples were compared to airborne hyperspectral datasets which showed broad scale regional variations in composition could be discerned from processed white mica abundance maps and images that use spectral bands 2350 nm and 2200 nm. The remotely sensed compositional variations are relatable to changes in sandstone grain size. Diagenetic alteration and surface weathering may influence the absorption spectra, although the effect of the latter can be reduced by using processed white mica abundance maps. Overall, the results show that airborne hyperspectral datasets, particularly the SWIR part of the spectra, can be useful to remotely map spatial compositional variations associated with sandstone grain size. This shows the method can be used to remotely map siliciclastic successions in other sedimentary basins by aiding recognition of grain size trends and significant stratal surfaces associated with changes in composition.

Clarifying the response mechanism of vegetation to rainfall can advance the understanding of expected changes in ecosystems under projected rainfall scenarios. Besides the rainfall amount over a period of time, the frequency, duration and intensity are of importance in driving ecosystem processes. The pulsating nature of rainfall forcing and of vegetation response applies particularly to arid and semi - arid regions and led to conceptualize the \"pulse-reserve\" paradigm, which we used to explain the approach we propose in this study. We introduce the Transfer Function Analysis (TFA) method in the frequency domain to capture the response of vegetation to rainfall at multiple temporal scales. The TFA method determines coherence, gain, and phase to characterize the existence, strength, and time-lag, respectively, of the vegetation response to rainfall at different temporal scales. Specifically, the coherence measures the existence of the response and only with a significant response are the gain and phase values significant and valuable for further analysis. The gain measures the strength of the relationship between fluctuations in vegetation growth and fluctuations in rainfall, while the phase value (i.e. the time-lag) measures how fluctuations in vegetation growth lag (or lead) fluctuations in rainfall. The TFA method was applied to the 34-years (1982-2015) NDVI3g and CHIRPS precipitation dataset in the Sahel-Sudano-Guinean region (20 degrees W similar to 60 degrees E, 0-25 degrees E). The Sahelian zone was characterized by a significant vegetation response to rainfall across all interand intraannual time-scales, while the Sudano-Guinean zone was dominated by significant response at annual or 6-month scales. The negative phase lag indicated that rainfall variation normally led NDVI change for most areas and across timescales. However, a positive phase observed in part of the tropical rainforest area indicated that NDVI changes led rainfall variations, which may be caused by the strong vegetation-rainfall feedback through recycling of precipitation by evapotranspiration. In summary, these results suggested that the TFA method is a powerful tool to quantify the vegetation-rainfall response regime across a range of timescales, as conceptualized by the \"pulse reserve\" paradigm. Unraveling the response of fluctuations in vegetation growth to separate components of the forcing by precipitation might improve our understanding of environmental change in the past decades in the Sahel - Sudan - Guinean region.', '[Zhou, Jie; Wu, Hao] Cent China Normal Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

Remote sensing advancements have led to an increase in the availability of a range of digital elevation models with global to quasi-global land coverage. However, the generation of these models in water bodies requires specialized approaches, such as the delimitation of the shorelines (isobaths) of lakes over time. Therefore, the processing costs are high in complex areas with many lakes. Currently, there is no systematic topographic mapping of lakes and channels in large and complex floodplains using remote sensing data. We present here the first high-resolution topographic mapping (30 m) of the non-forested portion of the middle-lower Amazon floodplain using a new method based on in-situ Amazon river water levels and a flood-frequency map derived from the Landsat Global Surface Water Dataset. Validation using locally derived bathymetry showed a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.89 m for floodplain elevation and a good representation of spatial patterns with Pearson\'s correlation coefficient of 0.77. Our approach for improving topographic representation in open water areas is an alternative to SRTM3 DEM or MERIT DEM, which represents these areas as a flat surface. We also generated the Amazon River bathymetry using nautical charts from the Brazilian Navy (average RMSE of 7.5 m and bias of 5 m), and floodplain depths maps corresponding to the highand low-water periods of the river flood wave. The results show that the storage volume in the open-water floodplain varies 104.3 km3 on average each year (from 11.9 km3 in low-water to 116.2 km3 in high-water). The method can be applied to any temporarily flooded area to provide the often missing underwater digital topographic data required for hydrological, ecological, and geomorphological studies.

Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data have demonstrated effectiveness for estimating canopy, and to a lesser degree, surface fuel components at fine-scale (i.e., 30 m) across landscapes. Using pre -and post-fire ALS data and corresponding field data, this study estimated consumption of canopy fuel (Delta CF), understory fuel (Delta UF), total fuel (Delta TF), and canopy bulk density (Delta CBD) for the 2012 Pole Creek fire in Oregon, USA (10,760 ha), and portions of the 2011 Las Conchas fire in New Mexico, USA (4,934 ha). Additionally, the feasibility of predicting fuel consumption was tested using separate preand post-fire models (PrePost), models combining all preand post-fire data (Pooled), and models using all data from both fires (Global). Estimates of Delta TF were then compared to fire radiative energy (FRE, units: MJ) derived from Fire Radiative Power (FRP, units: MW) observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard NASA Terra and Aqua satellites to mechanistically derive a biomass combustion coefficient (BCC, units: kg MJ(-1)). The PrePost and Pooled approaches yielded similar results at Las Conchas, but at Pole Creek insufficient pre-fire field data resulted in erroneous fuel consumption estimates outside the fire perimeter using the PrePost models. These results demonstrated that pre-fire field data were less important for these models than having field data which represent the full range of fuel conditions likely to exist across the landscape. Estimated total biomass consumed for the PrePost, Pooled, and Global models were 226 Gg, 224 Gg, and 224 Gg at Las Conchas, and 581 Gg, 713 Gg, and 552 Gg at Pole Creek. Comparisons between estimated Delta TF and FRE yielded an average BCC for both fires of 0.367 (s.d. +/- 0.049) kg MJ(-1) based on pixels with at least five MODIS observations. Both higher MODIS observations per pixel and accounting for canopy occlusion of FRE improved the relationship between Delta TF and MODIS-FRE. This study suggested a practical modelling approach for future efforts using only post-fire field observations and quantified a landscape-scale relationship between MODIS-derived FRE and fine-scale fuel consumption consistent with prior experiments.', '[McCarley, T.

These results have important implications for climate analysis and may help evaluate ice shelf stability. However, the accuracy of passive microwave methods used to detect melt is difficult to quantify, especially on the Antarctic Peninsula. Here four different melt de-tection methods are employed, including a new formulation of a statistical analysis of brightness temperature time series using a K-means clustering algorithm. Strikingly, two of the most widely used passive microwave melt detection methods are found to vary by 48% mean days of melt per year across six different locations on the Larsen C, Wilkins, and George VI Ice Shelves. In the absence of ground truth observations, time series of Sentinel 1 SAR observations from 2016 on provide a comparison dataset. In topographically flat regions where surface melt is spatially uniform, the passive microwave melt detection method based on a K-means analysis and the cross-polarization gradient ratio method demonstrate the highest agreement and correlation with active radar melt detection methods. One issue which has plagued passive microwave analysis is its coarse spatial resolution. High resolution SAR images are able to demonstrate and quantify the spatial variability of melt within individual passive microwave pixels. Melt is shown to be suitably uniform in space for passive microwave applications at the study sites on Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves, but not so in other regions of the Antarctic Peninsula.

Although some studies have been carried out to measure the settlement with techniques such as Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), the past studies have each only covered some limited time periods. Therefore, a complete history of settlement since the operation of the Airport has never been available to aid the understanding of the spatiotemporal behavior of the land settlement. We attempt for the first time to make full use of most of the available SAR data from multiple SAR sensors (ERS-2, ENVISAT ASAR, COSMO-SkyMed (CSK), and Sentinel-1A) to generate a settlement time series of the HKIA over 1998-2018 with an improved multi-temporal InSAR technique. In order to fill the time gaps between the different SAR datasets, a settlement model is developed based on the InSAR measurements. The results reveal both the spatial and temporal variations of the land settlement. They also show for the first time that the accumulative settlement reaches up to 40 cm over the past two decades. The settlement is largely associated with the material types used in the landfill works and the underlying alluvial sediments as some earlier research has indicated, and the stages of the reclamation works.

However, the mechanisms and complex interactions in urban areas underlying land surface temperature are still being understood. Understanding these mechanisms is necessary to design strategies that mitigate land temperatures in our cities. Using the recently available night-time moderate-resolution thermal satellite imagery and employing advanced nonlinear statistical models, we seek to answer the question \"What is the influence and relative importance of urban characteristics on land surface temperature, during both the day and night?\" To answer this question, we analyze urban land surface temperature in four cities across the United States. We devise techniques for training and validating nonlinear statistical models on geostatistical data and use these models to assess the interdependent effects of urban characteristics on urban surface temperature. Our results suggest that vegetation and impervious surfaces are the most important urban characteristics associated with land surface temperature. While this may be expected, this is the first study to quantify this relationship for Landsat-resolution nighttime temperature estimates. Our results also demonstrate the potential for using nonlinear statistical analysis to investigate land surface temperature and its relationships with urban characteristics. Improved understanding of these relationships influencing both night and day land surface temperature will assist planners undertaking climate change adaptation and heat wave mitigation.', '[Logan, T.

Assessments of water clarity in lakes over large temporal and spatial scales, however, are rare, limiting our understanding of its variability and the driven forces. In this study, we developed and validated a robust Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) algorithm for lakes across China based on two water color parameters, namely Forel-Ule Index (FUI) and hue angle alpha, retrieved from MODIS data. The MODIS Z(SD) model shows good results when compared with in-situ measurements from 17 lakes, with a 27.4% mean relative difference (MRD) in the validation dataset. Compared with other empirical Z(SD) models, our FUI and alpha-based model demonstrates improved performance and adaptability over a wide range of water clarity and trophic states. This algorithm was subsequently applied to MODIS measurements to provide a comprehensive assessment of water clarity in large lakes (N = 153) across China for the first time. The mean summer Z(SD) of the studied lakes between 2000 and 2017 demonstrated marked spatial and temporal variations. Spatially, the Z(SD) of large lakes presented a distinct spatial pattern of \"high west and low east\" over China. This spatial pattern was found to be associated with the significant differences in lake depth and altitude between west and east China while China\'s population, GDP, temperature, and precipitation distribution have also contributed to a certain extent. Temporally, the Z(SD) of most lakes increased during this period, with an overall mean rate of 3.3 cm/yr for all lakes. Here, 38.6% (N = 59) of the lakes experienced a significant increase in their Z(SD) value during the past 18 years while only 8.5% (N = 13) showed a significant decreasing trend. Significant increases in lake Z(SD) were observed in west China, which were found to correlate with the increase of air temperature and lake surface area. This is possibly a response of the lakes in west China to climate change. In the lake systems of east China, which are predominately used as a drinking water source, the increase in lake Z(SD) was found to be strongly correlated with changes in local GDP (gross domestic production), NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and lake surface area, suggesting a combined effect of the implemented management practices and climatic variability. The results of this study provide important information for water quality conservation and management in China, and also highlight the value of satellite remote sensing in monitoring water quality over lakes at a large scale and long-term.', '[Wang, Shenglei; Wan, Wei; Zhang, Xianfeng] Peking Univ, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.

Due to these difficulties, prior assessments of cropland abandonment have largely been limited in resolution, extent, or both. However, cropland abandonment has wide-reaching consequences for the environment, food production, and rural livelihoods, which is why new approaches to monitor long-term cropland abandonment in different biomes accurately are needed. Our goals were to 1) develop a new approach to map the extent and the timing of abandoned cropland using the entire Landsat time series, and 2) test this approach in 14 study regions across the globe that capture a wide range of environmental conditions as well as the three major causes of abandonment, i.e., social, economic, and environmental factors. Our approach was based on annual maps of active cropland and non-cropland areas using Landsat summary metrics for each year from 1987 to 2017. We streamlined per-pixel classifications by generating multi-year training data that can be used for annual classification. Based on the annual classifications, we analyzed land-use trajectories of each pixel in order to distinguish abandoned cropland, stable cropland, non-cropland, and fallow fields. In most study regions, our new approach separated abandoned cropland accurately from stable cropland and other classes. The classification accuracy for abandonment was highest in regions with industrialized agriculture (area-adjusted F1 score for Mato Grosso in Brazil: 0.8; Volgograd in Russia: 0.6), and drylands (e.g., Shaanxi in China, Nebraska in the U.S.: 0.5) where fields were large or spectrally distinct from non-cropland. Abandonment of subsistence agriculture with small field sizes (e.g., Nepal: 0.1) or highly variable climate (e.g., Sardinia in Italy: 0.2) was not accurately mapped. Cropland abandonment occurred in all study regions but was especially prominent in developing countries and formerly socialist states. In summary, we present here an approach for monitoring cropland abandonment with Landsat imagery, which can be applied across diverse biomes and may thereby improve the understanding of the drivers and consequences of this important land-use change process.', '[Yin, He; Buchner, Johanna; Helmers, David; Kimambo, Niwaeli E.; Lewinska, Katarzyna E.; Razenkova, Elena; Rizayeva, Afag; Rogova, Natalia; Radeloff, Volker C.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, SILVIS Lab, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

Here, we used SAR pixel offset tracking to investigate the Baige landslide before the collapse on 10 October 2018. 3D surface displacements retrieved by combining satellite SAR and optical observations revealed heterogeneous spatial patterns within the landslide complex.

Livestock grazing is the most widespread land use in temperate grasslands, and understanding the impact of grazing on grassland ecosystems is therefore important. However, monitoring grazing pressure and how it changes is hampered by a lack of adequate tools. The Eurasian steppe belt, extending from Eastern Europe to China has experienced marked changes in grazing pressure. Most notably, livestock numbers in the steppes of Kazakhstan and Russia declined by up to 80% after the breakdown of the Soviet Union in 1991, yet how this impacted spatial patterns of grazing pressure is unclear. To address this research gap, we used all available Landsat data from 1985 to 2017 together with extensive ground reference data on grazing pressure to evaluate a broad range of spectral-temporal metrics regarding their ability to capture grazing pressure. While Tasseled Cap-based disturbance indices performed best, combining all spectral -temporal metrics in a binary random forest classification yielded a grazing class membership probability that strongly outperformed all individual metrics. This new index of grazing pressure correlated well with a range of field-based grazing indicators (e.g., number of dung piles, herbaceous biomass) and yielded highly plausible spatial patterns of grazing pressure. We used this index to reconstruct annual changes in grazing pressure across our 360,000 km(2) study region, and used LandTrendr time series segmentation to identify trends in grazing pressure. Aggregated grazing pressure followed closely known trends in total livestock numbers over the time period we studied. The spatial footprint of heavy grazing was very large before 1991, but decreased by 73 (+/- 2) % until 2017. This now leaves large areas virtually ungrazed, even in close vicinity to settlements and agricultural areas, and despite a recent recovery of livestock numbers. Our analyses uncovered previously unknown hot-spots of heavy grazing during Soviet times (e.g., around watering points). Our findings suggest potential for a further revival of the livestock sector as well as for the restoration of steppe ecosystems. More broadly, our study highlights how the Landsat archive, in combination with field data on grazing, can be used to map grazing pressure reliably across large areas and over long time spans.', '[Dara, Andrey; Baumann, Matthias; Hostert, Patrick; Mueller, Daniel; Kuemmerle, Tobias] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.

Currently, the optimal scale selection processes are extremely cumbersome and time-consuming requiring repetitive experiments involving trial-and-error procedures, which significantly reduce the practical utility of the corresponding classification methods. This issue is crucial when trying to classify large-scale land use (LU) and land cover (LC) jointly (Zhang et al., 2019). In this paper, a simple and parsimonious Scale Sequence Joint Deep Learning (SS-JDL) method is proposed for joint LU and LC classification, in which a sequence of scales is embedded in the iterative process of fitting the joint distribution implicit in the joint deep learning (JDL) method, thus, replacing the previous paradigm of scale selection. The sequence of scales, derived autonomously and used to define the CNN input patch sizes, provides consecutive information transmission from small-scale features to large-scale representations, and from simple LC states to complex LU characterisations. The effectiveness of the novel SS-JDL method was tested on aerial digital photography of three complex and heterogeneous landscapes, two in Southern England (Bournemouth and Southampton) and one in North West England (Manchester). Benchmark comparisons were provided in the form of a range of LU and LC methods, including the state-of-the-art joint deep learning (JDL) method. The experimental results demonstrated that the SS-JDL consistently outperformed all of the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both LU and LC classification accuracies, as well as computational efficiency. The proposed SS-JDL method, therefore, represents a fast and effective implementation of the state-of-the-art JDL method. By creating a single, unifying joint distribution framework for classifying higher order feature representations, including LU, the SS-JDL method has the potential to transform the classification paradigm in remote sensing, and in machine learning more generally.', '[Zhang, Ce] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.

Because of the difficult geography, the investigation of ancient sites in this region is not easy and, therefore, satellite-based investigation can play an important role in the detection and documentation of archaeological sites. In this study, we combined high-resolution remote sensing (RS) imagery with in situ investigations to assess the suspected archaeological sites detected using satellite data and historical documentation. The suspected sites were confirmed according to the geometric features of the sites as they appeared in the remotely sensed imagery these sites had not been detected during earlier field investigations. In particular, we aimed to use 1-m spatial resolution WorldView-2 (WV2) imagery of the Wadi El-MelahValley (WMV) in Gafsa (also named Capsa). The satellite data were processed using statistical analysis and unsupervised classification.WV2 satellite imagery of WMV, Southwestern Tunisia, was processed within ArcGIS 10.2 to identify spatial features linked to the sites. The study outlines three different feature-extraction methods (GIS-based, unsupervised classification-based and statistical analysis-based). The satellite-based analysis and archaeological records were evaluated by RS and GIS prospecting in the area of the field survey to confirm the new discoveries. The results of remotely sensed data combined with field survey enabled us to reconstruct the military defense system consisting of is a linear defensive structure (limes) and forts related to the Imperial Roman period.

The product is validated by comparison with Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image pairs acquired 16 days apart that were visually interpreted. These independent reference data were selected using a stratified random sampling approach that allows for probability sampling of Landsat data in both time and in space. A total of 558 Landsat 8 OLI image pairs (1116 images), acquired between March 1st, 2014 and March 19th , 2015, were selected and used to validate the MCD64A1 product. The areal accuracy of the MCD64A1 product was characterized at the 30 m resolution of the Landsat independent reference data using standard accuracy metrics derived from global and from biome specific confusion matrices. Because a probability based Stage 3 sampling protocol was followed, unbiased estimators of the accuracy metrics and associated standard errors could be used. Globally, the MCD64A1 product had an estimated 40.2% commission error and 72.6% omission error; the prevalence of omission errors is reflected by a negative estimated bias of the mapped global area burned relative to the Landsat independent reference data ( - 54.1%). Globally, the standard errors of the accuracy metrics were less than 6%. The lowest errors were observed in the boreal forest biome (27.0% omission and 23.9% estimated commission errors) where burned areas tend to be large and distinct, and remain on the landscape for long periods, and the highest errors were in the Tropical Forest, Temperate Forest, and Mediterranean biomes (estimated > 90% omission error and > 50% commission error). The product accuracy was also characterized at coarser scale using metrics derived from the regression between the proportion of coarse resolution grid cells detected as burned by MCD64A1 and the proportion mapped in the Landsat 8 interpreted maps. The errors of omission and commission observed at 30 m resolution compensate to a considerable extent at coarser resolution, as indicated by the coefficient of determination (r(2) > 0.70), slope ( > 0.79) and intercept ( - 0.0030) of the regression between the MCD64A1 product and the Landsat independent reference data in 3 km, 4 km, 5 km, and 6 km coarse resolution cells. The Boreal Forest, Desert and Xeric Shrublands, Temperate Savannah and Tropical Savannah biomes had higher r(2) and slopes closer to unity than the Temperate Forest, Mediterranean, and Tropical Forest biomes. The analysis of the deviations between the proportion of area burned mapped by the MCD64A1 product and by the independent reference data, performed using 3 km x 3 km and 6 km x 6 km coarse resolution cells, indicates that the large negative bias in global area burned is primarily due to the systematic underestimation of smaller burned areas in the MCD64A1 product.', '[Boschetti, Luigi; Zubkova, Maria] Univ Idaho, Coll Nat Resources, Moscow, ID 83843 USA.

Moreover, an ad hoc procedure combining EBC data, Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory back-trajectories (HYSPLIT), and satellite fire data enabled detection of days affected by the transport of carbonaceous particles. Both Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data were used as input for the algorithm, and the corresponding results were compared and discussed. VIIRS showed a better performance in detecting smaller/cooler hotspots especially in cases of flaring, as observed during flaring events at the COVA plant itself.   Application of the procedure suggests that both regional and non-regional biomass burning episodes, which occur mainly during summer, could contribute to the BC load at the site.   The approach applied to the case study of the present work can be useful for estimating the relative contributions of local and remote sources of BC.', '[Castagna, Jessica; Calvello, Mariarosaria; Pavese, Giulia] CNR, Ist Metodol Anal Ambientale, I-85050 Tito, PZ, Italy.

It was conducted in a predominantly agricultural region of Serbia, with the focus on Ambrosia, an invasive weed that is the source of highly allergenic pollen. The land use characteristics were extracted from the Corine Land Cover and more precise crop classification maps for years 2013-2017 created using machine learning from the available satellite (RapidEye, Landsat, Sentinel) and ground truth data. Airborne pollen was collected at five locations for the same period. To integrate in situ and products derived from satellite data we defined catchment areas surrounding pollen measurements stations. Different shapes of assumed catchment areas equivalent to 5 km, 10 km and 30 km radius were tested: circular, wind rose and footprint from SILAM (System for Integrated modeLling of Atmospheric coMposition). The simple fixed circle, used as the rule of thumb in the literature, is a reasonable approximation of the representativeness of the aerobiological data. A gridded Ambrosia distribution and abundance map over Vojvodina was produced by using top-down approach that combines distribution of suitable habitats and airborne pollen concentrations. The results confirmed that variation in the agriculture-associated land use area explains notable amount of variability in the amount of Ambrosia airborne pollen. Detailed crop classification inferred from satellite data revealed the strongest relationship between pollen and variation in areas under soya bean and sugar beet. Maps of Ambrosia infection levels, based on distribution of sugar beet and soya bean fields, instead of total arable land, reveal its additional spatial variability in Vojvodina region.', '[Lugonja, Predrag; Brdar, Sanja; Simovic, Isidora; Mimic, Gordan; Sikoparija, Branko] Univ Novi Sad, BioSense Inst, Res Inst Informat Technol Biosyst, Dr Zorana Dindica 1, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.

Still, after more than 45 years of observing the Earth\'s land surface, usage of EO data by operational monitoring entities concerned with global agriculture is uneven. One reason for this is a gap in continuous communication and collaboration between those who undertake research and development of methods for cropland assessment and monitoring, and those who have the mandate to report on agricultural indicators at a national, regional, and global scales. The recent international policy focus on the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development via its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is giving increased attention to measurements and indicators for monitoring and measuring progress for meeting these goals. Satellite EO provide a source of measurements beyond traditional census data collection and statistical reporting. In this vein, this overview paper describes the current and potential uses of EO data and tools that can support the SDGs, particularly highlighting the activities of the Group on Earth Observations Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM) Initiative. GEOGLAM is composed of agricultural ministries, intergovernmental organizations, research entities, universities, space agencies, and members of industry concerned with agricultural monitoring. This GEOGLAM community has a broad portfolio of activities which provide information on the state and changes in agricultural production and land use that can be considered as contributions to both supporting the attainment of several of the 17 SDGs and many of their 169 Targets, as well as monitoring their achievement via the Global Indicator Framework. GEOGLAM contributes in particular to Goal 2: Zero Hunger, but also has less immediately apparent contributions in the realms of water (Goal 6), responsible consumption and production (Goal 12), climate action (Goal 13), life on land (Goal 15), and global partnerships for sustainable development (Goal 17). We further characterize the applicability and use of EO data products and tools as they correspond with the United Nations Interagency Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goals (IAEG-SDGs) Global Indicator Framework. This inventory will be complemented by a discussion of the intersection of other policy mandates with the SDGs in the agriculture and food security contexts, and will conclude with a discussion of approaches to improving awareness of EO value and bridging the gap between policy and EO communities, to the societal benefit of all with no one left behind.', '[Whitcraft, Alyssa K.; Becker-Reshef, Inbal; Justice, Christopher O.] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, 4321 Hartwick Rd,Suite 410, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

This paper shows that the least-squares inversion of the model is not strictly convex and the widely used unconstrained damped least-squares (DLS) can lead to biased retrievals, due to preferential descending paths. In particular, the numerical experiments show that for sparse (dense) vegetation with a low (high) opacity, the DLS tends to overestimate (underestimate) the soil moisture and vegetation water content when the soil is dry (wet). A new Constrained Multi-Channel Algorithm (CMCA) is proposed that confines the retrievals with a priori information about the soil type and vegetation density and accounts for slow temporal changes of the vegetation water content through a smoothing-norm regularization. It is demonstrated that depending on the resolution of the constraints, the algorithm can lead to high-resolution soil moisture retrievals beyond the radiometric spatial resolution.

However, they also allow retrieving of vegetation optical depth (VOD), the degree to which vegetation attenuates microwave radiation. Because attenuation is primarily a function of the total amount of liquid water in a vegetation canopy that is contained within vegetation tissue, VOD could be used to monitor seasonal changes in this quantity, which we call crop water, in major agricultural regions such as the US Corn Belt. There are two main advantages of L-band VOD: it observes the entire canopy volume because soil moisture sensitivity is maintained throughout the growing season; and since it is unaffected by cloud cover there are close to daily measurements. To show its value, we compare SMAP and SMOS VOD to satellite-scale estimates of crop productivity created using the Agricultural Integrated BIosphere Simulator (Agro-IBIS) and observed weather at the South Fork SMAP Core Validation Site in the Corn Belt state of Iowa. We find that SMAP and SMOS VOD are directly proportional to crop water. New empirical models that relate crop water to crop dry mass were required to make this finding. We created these models with in situ data spanning multiple years and stages of crop development. The value of the proportionality constant (or \"b-parameter\") relating VOD to crop water at the satellite scale is about half as large as previous estimates. Because L-band VOD is directly proportional to crop water at the satellite scale, and because we understand the relationship between crop water and crop dry mass, SMAP and SMOS have the potential to evaluate the large-scale performance of crop models in the Corn Belt on a near daily basis.', '[Togliatti, Kaitlin; Hartman, Theodore; Walker, Victoria A.; VanLoocke, Andy; Hornbuckle, Brian K.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Agron, Ames, IA 50011 USA.

Sensor-specific effects on the SAR-retrieved wind speeds are first quantified through comparisons against collocated ocean buoy observations. Based on global circulation model simulations of wind speed and direction, we retrieve the Normalized Radar Cross Section (NRCS) for different radar incidence angles. Residuals between the retrieved and the observed NRCS are used to inter-calibrate the observed NRCS before reprocessing to SAR wind fields. The inter-calibration leads to an improved agreement between SAR and buoy wind speeds with biases below 0.2 m s(-1) for all investigated SAR sensors. Estimates of the wind resource improve with respect to the buoy observations for ten of the twelve sites investigated. The average deviation between wind power densities is reduced from 20% to 8% as the SAR inter calibration leads to more conservative estimates of the wind resource.', '[Badger, Merete; Ahsbahs, Tobias; Maule, Petr; Karagali, Joanna] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Technical University of DenmarkRP Badger, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.', 'mebc@dtu.dkRI Karagali, Ioanna/Q-5950-2018; Badger, Merete/AAF-5600-2019; Badger,   Merete/AAN-5263-2020', 'Karagali, Ioanna/0000-0002-8695-7190; Badger, Merete/0000-0002-2072-8619', 'EU [730030]', 'This work received funding from the EU H2020 program under grant   agreement no. 730030 (CEASELESS project).', 40, 12, 12, 0, 25, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Furthermore, the sensor type used to observe wind streaks can influence the subsequent data analysis. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of sensor type on wind streak identification and interpretation. Six case studies featuring wind streaks on Earth were performed, using imaging by both radar and optical sensors. The results indicate that wind streak identification is constrained to a specific combination of sensor settings appropriate for the local surface properties. Only half the optically visible wind streaks considered in this study were also radar visible, but all the wind streaks observable in the radar images also appeared in the optical images. Furthermore, \"bright\" and \"dark\" (reflectance and backscatter) are relative terms and should be used with caution.

In Brazil, fire has been traditionally used to convert natural vegetation areas to agricultural lands (slash and burn) and to manage pastures for livestock. We developed the Burned Area Spectral Mixture Analysis (BASMA) algorithm in Google Earth Engine, which is designed to process Landsat data to produce a multi-temporal fire scar database representing annual burned area for an extent of 362,000 km(2) in the transition zone between the Amazon forest and the Cerrado biome. This region is considered a conservation hotspot, given its high deforestation rates over the last four decades. We digitally processed a 32-year time-series (1985 to 2017) of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper+, and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager data to map fire scars based on sub-pixel char fraction, aiming to generate a consistent burned area product at a finer scale and covering a longer period than those currently available for the region. Manually interpreted reference burned area polygons for each annual mosaic was used to guide the definition of the best fire scar endmember and its fraction threshold. To assess our BASMA-delineated fire scar, they were compared to independent datasets of manually delineated burned area produced by visual analysis of finer spatial resolution imagery, returning an average Dice Coefficient value of 0.86. Accuracy was also measured against the 30-meter Burned Area product available at the \'Queimadas\' data portal. A total of 11,106,258 ha was mapped as having been affected by fire during the annual dry season over the 32 years, which represents 30.7% of the study region. Results showed a decreasing trend in the annual amount of burned area over the time-series. It reflects a similar pattern shown in the deforestation rate for the Legal Amazon, measured by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research - INPE. Moreover, the Cerrado biome subset of the study region consistently showed higher burned area when compared to the Amazon forest subset. Our findings provide robust evidence that our approach is a consistent method to identify and delineate fire scars for large areas over a long time-series in a very efficient fashion, given the digital processing power of Google Earth Engine, which reduces the time necessary to analyze such big amount of data.', '[Daldegan, Gabriel Antunes; Roberts, Dar A.; Ribeiro, Fernanda de Figueiredo] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.', 'University of California System; University of California Santa BarbaraRP Daldegan, GA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.', 'gabrie100@ucsb.edu; dar@geog.ucsb.edu; fribeiro@geog.ucsb.eduRI Daldegan, Gabriel Antunes/AAO-9708-2020; Ribeiro,   Fernanda/AAP-3687-2021; Daldegan, Gabriel/AAV-7028-2021', 'de Figueiredo Ribeiro, Fernanda/0000-0001-9769-2901; Antunes Daldegan,   Gabriel/0000-0001-5345-4880; Roberts, Dar/0000-0002-3555-4842', 'Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)   Foundation, Brazilian Ministry of Education, through the Science Without   Borders program [13711/13-0, 13684/13-2]', 'We would like to thank Ian Housman for providing help concerning the   Landsat mosaicking process; Rodrigo Falleiro for reviewing the burned   areas mapped over the Paresi Plateau; Jo5o Henrique Fernandes Amaral for   comments on early version of the manuscript; the MapBIOMAS project for   providing relevant data; The Nature Conservancy Brazil for granting us   access to geospatial data; and the Brazilian National Institute for   Space Research for providing access to the RapidEye imagery.

The Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs) are a set of three indices that summarize annual productivity measures from satellite data for biodiversity applications, and include: a) cumulative annual productivity; b) minimum annual productivity; and c) variation in annual productivity. At global scales and in temperate regions the DHIs predict species diversity patterns well, but the DHIs have not been tested in the tropics, where higher levels of productivity lead to the saturation of many remotely sensed vegetation indices. Our goal was to explain bird species richness patterns based on the DHIs in tropical areas. We related the DHIs to species richness of resident landbirds for five guilds (forest, scrub, grassland, generalist, and all resident birds) based on a) species distribution model (SDM) maps for 217 species, and b) range map for 564 species across Thailand. We also quantified the relative importance of the DHIs in multiple regression models that included two measures of topography, and two climate metrics using multiple regression, best-subsets, and hierarchical partitioning analyses. We found that the three DHIs alone explained forest bird richness best (R-adj(2) 0.61 for both SDM- and rangemap based richness; 0.15-0.54 for the other guilds). When combining the DHIs with topography and climate, the richness of both forest birds and all resident bird species was equally well explained (R-adj(2) 0.85 and 0.67 versus 0.81 and 0.68). Among the three DHIs, cumulative annual productivity had the greatest explanatory power for all guilds based on SDM richness maps (R-adj(2) 0.54-0.61). The strong relationship between the DHIs and bird species richness in Thailand suggests that the DHIs capture energy availability well and are useful in biodiversity assessments and potentially bird conservation in tropical areas.', '[Suttidate, Naparat; Hobi, Martina L.; Pidgeon, Anna M.; Helmers, David P.; Dubinin, Maxim; Bateman, Brooke L.; Radeloff, Volker C.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, SILVIS Lab, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

Although long-record optical satellites, such as Landsat missions, provide sub-monthly observations at fairly fine spatial resolution, cloud contamination often poses a major challenge for producing temporally continuous time series. We here proposed a novel method to improve the temporal frequency of usable Landsat observations for mapping lakes and reservoirs, by effectively recovering inundation areas from contaminated images. This method automated three primary steps on the cloud-based platform Google Earth Engine. It first leveraged multiple spectral indices to optimize water mapping from archival Landsat images acquired since 1992. Errors induced by minor contaminations were next corrected by the topology of isobaths extracted from nearly cloud-free images. The isobaths were then used to recover water areas under major contaminations through an efficient vector-based interpolation. We validated this method on 428 lakes/reservoirs worldwide that range from similar to 2 km(2) to similar to 82,000 km(2) with time-variable levels measured by satellite altimeters. The recovered water areas show a relative root-mean-squared error of 2.2%, and the errors for over 95% of the lakes/reservoirs below 6.0%. The produced area time series, combining those from cloud-free images and recovered from contaminated images, exhibit strong correlations with altimetry levels (Spearman\'s rho mostly similar to 0.8 or larger) and extended the hypsometric (area-level) ranges revealed by cloud-free images alone. The combined time series also improved the monthly coverage by an average of 43%, resulting in a bi-monthly water area record during the satellite altimetry era thus far (1992-2018). The robustness of this method was further verified under five challenging mapping scenarios, including fluvial lakes in humid basins, reservoirs with complex shape geometries, saline lakes with high mineral concentrations, lakes/reservoirs in mountainous regions, and pan-Arctic lakes with frequent snow/ice covers. Given such performance and a generic nature of this method, we foresee its potential applications to assisting water area recovery for other optical and SAR sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2 and SWOT), and to estimating lake/reservoir storage variations in conjunction with altimetry sensors.', '[Yao, Fangfang; Wang, Jida] Kansas State Univ, Dept Geog, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.

The SDCI can be used for large-scale drought monitoring at a high spatial resolution in dry and humid regions. However, it is not applicable to certain areas for numerous reasons, including the discontinued service and limited coverage of the TRMM, uncertainties associated with the coarse resolution of precipitation input, the fixed lag time between precipitation deficit and vegetation responses, experimental weights and an arbitrary classification scheme. Therefore, this study aims to propose an optimal SDCI (OSDCI) using an alternative Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) as precipitation input, adding a varied lag time between precipitation and vegetation response, determining the optimal weights of variables and revising the severity classification. In Central Asia, OSDCI is calibrated using the 3-month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) during the 2001-2008 growing seasons as drought reference. The SPEI from 2009 to 2016, soil moisture anomalies (SMAs) derived from both the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) and the Climate Prediction Center (CPC), and the annual crop production of wheat and barley are used for cross-validation. For comparison, three original SDCIs are also included. The results show that the OSDCI displays better performance than the three experimental SDCIs with higher correlation coefficients relative to SPEI and SMA from the CPC for different cover types, and performance is comparable to that of SMA from the GLDAS and annual crop production. Additionally, the OSDCI based on the revised classification scheme (OSDCI_rev) shows significant superiority over the OSDCI based on the original classification system (OSDCI org) with lower drought frequency and area error. Furthermore, the OSDCI_rev can capture both the temporal evolution and the spatial patterns of droughts exemplified by the SPEI and SMAs.

With the establishment of extensive dense networks across the globe, mismatches between satellite footprints and ground single-point observations can be feasibly relieved. In this study, five remotely sensed soil moisture products, namely, the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), two Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) products, the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI), were systematically investigated by utilizing in-situ soil moisture observations from global dense and sparse networks. Distinguished from previous studies, several perturbing factors comprising the surface temperature, vegetation optical depth (VOD), surface roughness and spatial heterogeneity were taken into account in this investigation. Furthermore, products\' skills under various climate regions were also evaluated.   Through the results, the SMAP product captures temporal trends of ground soil moisture, exhibiting an averaged R of 0.729, whereas for overall accuracy, ESA CCI outperformed other products with a slightly smaller ubRMSE of 0.041 m(3) m(-3) and a bias of -0.005 m(3) m(-3). This complementarity between SMAP and ESA CCI was further demonstrated under different climate conditions and can afford the reference of their integration for a more reliable global soil moisture product. Though some underestimations still exist, the newly developed SMOS- INRA-CESBIO (SMOS-IC) was illustrated to gain considerable upgrades with regard to R and ubRMSE compared to SMOS-L3 product, especially in dense VOD conditions achieving the highest R compared to other products.   Generally, the underestimations of the European Centre for Medium-Range-Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) surface temperature used for SMOS under moderate or high VOD, heterogeneity, and most surface roughness conditions were consistent with the underestimations of the soil moisture product and provide the directions of product promotions. As for LPRM surface temperature, the worse skills can partially explain the unsatisfactory performances for LPRM soil moisture products. In spite of relatively acceptable skills of SMAP and SMOS-IC soil moisture products concerning R under moderate or dense VOD, small surface roughness, low heterogeneity conditions and temperate and cold climate types, advances in soil moisture products under high or even slightly low VOD, high roughness or topography complexity and heterogeneity, as well as in tropical or desert regions, remain challenging. It is expected that these findings can contribute to algorithm refinements, product enhancements (e.g., fusion and disaggregation) and hydrometeorological usages.', '[Ma, Hongliang; Chen, Nengcheng; Zhang, Xiang; Wang, Wei] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.

As it was originally titled, the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) spectral library version 2.0 has been expanded to support ECOSTRESS studies by including major additions of laboratory measured vegetation and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) spectra. The library now contains 541 leaf visible shortwave infrared (VIS/SWIR) spectra, 472 leaf thermal infrared (TIR) spectra, and 51 NPV VIS/SWIR and TIR spectra. Previously, the library primarily contained VSWIR and TIR laboratory spectra of minerals, rocks, and man-made materials. This new library, containing over 3000 spectra, was renamed the ECOSTRESS spectral library version 1.0 and is publicly available (http://speclib.jpl.nasa.gov). It should be noted that as with the prior versions of the library, the VSWIR and TIR measurements were made with separate instruments with different calibration sources.

This assumption is worth of a reexamination following significant advances in precise tracking of individual eddies, thanks to the recent availability of merged altimeter data with a grid resolution of 1/4 degrees x 1/4 degrees and a time interval of one day. Based on an orientationally aligned average of the effective boundaries of nearly 2.6 million individual eddies available to date, a characteristic shape of a \"standard\" eddy has been derived, which is found to be a very good approximation to a mathematical ellipsoid with a semimajor axis of a = 87.0 km, and a semiminor axis of b = 54.0 km. The oval nature of oceanic eddies appears to be universal in a climatological sense, but the best-fit ellipse varies with space and time. Statistically, the eddy ellipse has two preferred angles for its major axis: a primary angle of 104 degrees/284 degrees (nearly north-south) and a secondary angle of 1717351 (nearly east-west). The intrinsic geometric asymmetry in eddy shape and orientation is believed to be one of the fundamental reasons behind the previously observed geophysical anisotropy in eddy properties.

Satellite remote sensing provides a valuable source of data for monitoring the phenology of terrestrial ecosystems and has been widely used to map geographic and interannual variation in land surface phenology (LSP) over large areas. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) land surface phenology product provides global data sets characterizing the annual LSP of terrestrial ecosystems, and is designed to support long-term continuity of LSP measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We used data from VIIRS and MODIS to evaluate the agreement and characterize the similarities and differences between LSP data from each instrument. Specifically, we compare data from the Collection 6 MODIS Land Cover Dynamics (LCD) product with data from the newly developed VIIRS LSP product over the most common land cover types in North America. To do this, we assessed the overall agreement between time series of vegetation indices from VIIRS and MODIS, evaluated the correspondence between retrieved phenometrics from each instrument, and analyzed sources of differences between phenometrics from the each product. As part of this analysis, we also compared phenometrics from MODIS and VIIRS with phenometrics derived from Landsat Analysis Ready Data and PhenoCam time series. Results show that two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) values from VIIRS and MODIS are similar (R-2 > 0.81; root mean square deviation < 0.062), but that VIIRS EVI2 time series show more high frequency variation than time series from MODIS. Further, even though the VIIRS and MODIS products are generated using different instruments and algorithms, phenometrics from each product are similar and show only minor differences within and across land cover types. Systematic differences between phenometrics from the two products were generally less than one week (absolute bias 4.8 +/- 3.0 days), and RMSDs were less than two weeks for most phenometrics across different land cover classes (10.7 +/- 4.3 days). Comparison of VIIRS and MODIS LSP data with corresponding metrics estimated from Landsat and PhenoCam data consistently showed high agreement among the data sets. Overall, results from this analysis indicate that the VIIRS LSP product provides excellent continuity with the MODIS record. However, studies attempting to create high-fidelity long-term LSP time series by merging these products should exploit the overlap period of MODIS and VIIRS to estimate land cover-specific corrections for modest systematic bias in the MODIS LCD product relative to the VIIRS LSP product.', '[Moon, Minkyu; Melaas, Eli K.; Friedl, Mark A.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA.

High-resolution (12.5 km) scatterometry data provide a possibility to investigate several small-scale features (\"hot points\") of the wind field in the basin related to the topographic effects. They include: the gap winds near the Bosphorus, the Kerch Strait, and Tuapse; tip jets at the south and west of the Crimean peninsula, several capes of the Anatolian coast; the Kolkheti valley winds; wind shadow zones at the eastern Turkey coast and the western Crimean coast. Driving factors and directional variability of wind in these \"hot points\" is discussed.   QuikScat and ASCAT data are used to describe seasonal and interannual variability of wind characteristics in 2000-2016. Comparison with in-situ data shows that QuikScat noticeably overestimates wind magnitude during low winds conditions ( < 2 m/s). ASCAT winds are generally lower than QuikScat, but the ASCAT wind curl is higher. The amount of low winds values ( < 2 m/s) in the ASCAT data is 6% of the total data, and it is 1% in the QuikScat data. Overestimation of low winds decreases wind gradients near the wind shadows, which is the most possible reason of the underestimation of the wind curl in the QuikScat dataset.   Wind curl has a different sign and a completely different interannual variability in the western and eastern parts of the sea. Near the eastern coast of the basin, high-resolution satellite measurements reveal three powerful small-scales maximums of cyclonic vorticity. These maximums are related to the wind jets flowing around topographic obstacles in the vicinity of the Kerch Strait, in the mountain gap near Tuapse, and from the Kolkheti valley. They are observed throughout the whole year, but are largest in winter. The contribution of these maximums to the overall cyclonic vorticity is essential (30% in the QuikScat data and 50% in the ASCAT data). In the western part of the basin, the wind curl is negative (anticyclonic) on average, with the highest anticyclonic curl observed in summer. Winds are decreasing in 2000-2016 in agreement with the data on the 20 century. At the same time the basin-average wind curl rises due to its increase in the eastern Black Sea. We speculate that these trends are associated with the displacement of the Siberian Anticyclone to the west. The related rise of pressure over the eastern Europe correlates significantly with the wind curl variability on interannual time scales.', '[Kubryakov, Arseny; Stanichny, Sergey; Shokurov, Michael; Garmashov, Anton] RAS, Marine Hydrophys Inst, Fed State Budget Sci Inst, Str Kapitanskaya 2, Sevastopol 2990011, Russia.', 'Russian Academy of Sciences; Marine Hydrophysical Institute of RASRP Kubryakov, A (通讯作者)，RAS, Marine Hydrophys Inst, Fed State Budget Sci Inst, Str Kapitanskaya 2, Sevastopol 2990011, Russia.', 'arskubr@ya.ruRI Garmashov, Anton/P-4155-2017; Stanichny, Sergey/F-8915-2014', 'Garmashov, Anton/0000-0003-4412-2483; Stanichny,   Sergey/0000-0002-1033-5678', 'FASO [0827-2019-0002]; RFBR, Russia [19-05-00752a, 19-05-00479a,   17-05-41102RGO_a]', 'The validation and intercomparison of scatterometry data was made under   FASO contract no. 0827-2019-0002.

Due to increasing anthropogenic influences and the impact of climate change, wetlands are increasingly threatened and degraded. An effective monitoring of wetlands is therefore necessary to preserve and restore these endangered ecosystems. Earth Observation (EO) data offer a great potential to support cost-effective and large-scale monitoring of wetlands. Current state-of-the-art methods for wetland mapping, however, require large training data and manual effort and can therefore only be locally applied. The focus of this study is to evaluate a methodology for large-scale and highly automated wetland mapping based on current EO data streams. For this purpose, an algorithm for water and wetness detection based on multi-temporal optical imagery and topographic data is presented. Suitable spectral indices sensitive to water and wetness were identified using feature selection methods based on mutual information between optical indices and occurrence of water and wetness. In combination with the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), these were used to derive monthly water and wetness masks using a dynamic thresholding approach. Aggregating all observations corrected for seasonal bias yielded flooding and wetness frequencies and the Water Wetness Presence (or Probability) Index (WWPI) as an indicator for wetland occurrence or a pre-inventory. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, the algorithm is demonstrated at three study sites with different wetland types in Kenya/Uganda, Algeria, and Austria using Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) imagery. For all sites, the overall accuracy was above 92%. User\'s and producer\'s accuracies were higher for water (> 96%) than for wetness (> 75%). Due to the high degree of automation and low processing time, the proposed method is applicable on a large scale and has already been applied during the production of the Copernicus High Resolution Water-Wetness Layer and within the European Space Agency (ESA) project GlobWetland Africa.', '[Ludwig, Christina; Walli, Andreas; Schleicher, Christian; Weichselbaum, Juergen; Riffler, Michael] GeoVille Informat Syst & Data Proc GmbH, Sparkassenpl 2, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.RP Riffler, M (通讯作者)，GeoVille Informat Syst & Data Proc GmbH, Sparkassenpl 2, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', NULL, 'ludwig@geoville.com; walli@geoville.com; schleicher@geoville.com;   weichselbaum@geoville.com; riffler@geoville.com', 'Ludwig, Christina/0000-0003-4669-3298', 'ESA', 'We would like to thank ESA for providing the funding for the GlobWetland   Africa project and our colleagues at GeoVille Information Systems and   Data Processing GmbH for the great support, specifically Dr. Andrew   Moran, project manager for the Copernicus implementation of the   Water-Wetness layer, and former staff member Steve Kass for early   research activities.

Although this resolution mismatch may cause bias and increase in prediction error, it has not been thoroughly studied. The aim of this study was to clarify the meaning of resolution dependence in ABA, and to further identify its causal factors and quantify their effects. In general, a number of factors contribute to resolution dependence in ABA forest inventories, including the varying point density of the ALS data, the type of response variable, how the predictor variables are computed, and the properties of the prediction model. For quantification, we used field plots with mapped tree locations, which enabled the generation of different sized sample plots inside a larger plot. Plot level above ground biomass (AGB) was the response variable employed in all the models. The error rate seemed to increase when the prediction plots were larger than the fitting plots, and vice versa. The maximum BIAS was 1.50% and the maximum change of RMSE compared to its value in native resolution was 0.97% when there was a 4-fold difference in resolution.

Current assessment protocols recommended in the published literature focus on sample-based estimation of area and accuracy of features in remote sensing-based maps, which is less relevant for assessing the performance of near real-time monitoring systems. Rather than area bias and accuracy of mapped features, the objective of near real-time monitoring is fast detection of forest disturbance events. Here we present a new assessment framework as well as two new algorithms for near real-time monitoring of tropical forest disturbance. The first algorithm (NRT-CCDC) fits time series models based on MODIS data to predict future observations. Detections of forest disturbance are labeled as \"low-probability\", \"high-probability\", and \"confirmed\" based on the number of consecutive observations that deviate substantially from the prediction. The second algorithm (Fusion2) predicts MODIS observations at a high temporal frequency by building a model based on a time series of Landsat observations. Fusion2 utilizes daily MODIS observations from both Terra and Aqua to achieve rapid detection of disturbance events. A framework for assessing the performance of near real-time monitoring is presented that focuses on the timing and minimum detectable size of forest disturbance events while still being based on probability sampling and design-based inference. Central to the framework is a new metric we refer to as the \"alert-lag relationship\", which characterizes the frequency of omitted disturbance events as a function of the time lag between the dates of disturbance and detection. When applied to three different near-real monitoring systems representing three levels of operational readiness (Fusion2, NRT-CCDC and Terra-i), we found that Fusion2 achieved an alert accuracy (event-based agreement) of 50% after 82 days and NRT-CCDC achieved 50% after 126 days. Terra-i never achieved an alert accuracy of 50% but achieved 30% after 109 days. In terms of event size, all three systems showed better performance in detecting large events compared to small events. The smallest event detected by the three systems was 6.5 ha. Conventional accuracy assessment (pixel-based agreement) showed that the user\'s accuracy, which characterizes commission errors, of the disturbance class for Fusion2, NRT-CCDC, and Terra-i were 87%, 79%, and 30% respectively. The two more complex systems, Fusion2 and NRT-CCDC were consistently more accurate than the operational Terra-i system. In general, the higher the cost of implementing the system corresponded to a higher accuracy of the detection system. A primary objective moving forward is to make the NRT-CCDC and Fusion2 more operational over larger areas.', '[Tang, Xiaojing; Bullock, Eric L.; Olofsson, Pontus; Woodcock, Curtis E.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, 685 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.

We conducted monthly sampling (from May 2015 to May 2016) at Datong, the most downstream non-tidal hydrological station along the Changjiang River. To monitor long-term POC variations, we developed a two-step POC algorithm for Landsat satellite data and calculated monthly POC flux during 2000-2016. Monthly POC flux ranged from a minimum of 1.4 x 10(4) t C in February 2016 to a maximum of 52.04 x 10(4) t C in May 2002, with a mean of 13.04 x 10(4) t C/month. At Datong, monthly POC flux was positively exponentially related to water flow (N = 118, R = 0.69, p < 0.01). In the wet season (May to October) with high water flow, a large amount of terrigenous POC was flushed into the Changjiang River. After the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), both POC concentration (R = 0.46, p < 0.01) and POC flux (R = 0.33, p < 0.01) significantly exponentially decreased during 2000-2016. After 2011 with regular operation of the TGD, POC transport at Datong showed relative stability and its seasonal difference became smaller. POC concentration from the TGD to Datong in the Changjiang mainstream (similar to 1000 km) was also derived from Landsat data, which was spatially varied with water flow, slope gradient, and watercourse width.

They highlight that accuracy is lower when using single-date (0.67) or single-band images (0.70).

Gross ecosystem photosynthesis termed gross primary productivity (GPP) is a critical driver of terrestrial carbon uptake and remains challenging to be observed directly. Currently, vegetation indices that largely capture changes in greenness are the most commonly used datasets in satellite-based GPP modeling. However, there remains significant uncertainty in the spatiotemporal relationship between greenness indices and GPP, especially for relatively heterogeneous dryland ecosystems. In this paper, we compared vegetation greenness indices from PhenoCam and satellite (Landsat and MODIS) observations against GPP estimates from the eddy covariance technique, across three representative ecosystem types of the southwestern United States. We systematically evaluated the changes in the relationship between vegetation greenness indices and GPP: i) across spatial scales of canopy-level, 30-meter, and 500-meter resolution; and ii) across temporal scale of daily, 8-day, 16-day, and monthly resolution. We found that greenness-GPP relationships were independent of spatial scales as long as land cover type and composition remained relatively constant. We also found that the greenness-GPP relationships became stronger as the time interval increased, with the strongest relationships observed at the monthly resolution. We posit that the greenness-GPP relationship breaks down at short timescales because greenness changes more slowly than plant physiological function, which responds rapidly to changes in key biophysical drivers. These findings provide insights into the potential for and limitations of modeling GPP using remotely sensed greenness indices across dryland ecosystem types.', '[Yan, D.; Moore, D. J. P.; Smith, W.

In terms of detection of mesoscale eddies and larger gyres, the comparison was performed between eddy statistics extracted directly from fields of sea surface temperature (SST), on the one hand, and reconstructed from different scalar and vector altimetry-derived fields, on the other hand. Among the products being analysed, there are fields of (i) sea level anomaly (SLA), (ii) geostrophic currents, and (iii) finite size Lyapunov exponents (FSLE). Comparison of the eddy statistics provided by such different data sources revealed that altimetry-based techniques tended to overestimate the number of big cyclones and thus failed to reproduce cyclonic/anticyclonic eddy asymmetry which was shown by fields of SST. Defining the spatial scale of eddies via altimetry-based techniques seemed particularly problematic. FSLE product analysed in the study showed significant disagreements with vortical structures observed in fields of SST both in terms of the spatial scale and the sign of rotation. In order to scrutinize basin-scale features of surface circulation in the region of interest, fields of (i) geostrophic currents, (ii) total currents reconstructed by the GlobCurrent project, and (iii) surface currents provided by the reanalysis technique were analysed.

The study site was located within the Central Platte River ecosystem, south of Wood River in Central Nebraska, USA, and consisted of two sets of plots (young and old). Exotic species had recently invaded the old plots, confounding the original study design, while the young plots did not have significant invasion by weeds, reflecting the original study design. We used spectral variation (i.e. spectral diversity, expressed as the coefficient of variation) as a proxy for alpha-diversity (expressed as species richness and Shannon index). Airborne data collected at two flight altitudes and two flight directions tested the validity of \"spectral diversity-alpha-diversity\" relationship at different sampling scales and flight directions. Our results showed a strong relationship between spectral diversity and alpha-diversity in young, non-invaded plots exhibiting strong differences in alpha-diversity. However, in the old, invaded plots, the spectral diversity-alpha-diversity relationship was non-significant. Factors likely contributing to this failure in the old plots included the spatial mismatch between airborne and field-based sampling, the convergence in diversity levels over time, and the unique reflectance signatures of the invasive species related to their different structural and phenological properties. Unlike previous airborne studies in manipulated experimental prairie plots, but similar to results in more natural settings, the strong spectral diversity-alpha-diversity relationship in the young plots remained even at the spatial resolution of 1 m, demonstrating the potential of airborne remote sensing to assess diversity patterns in prairie grasslands. These findings demonstrate the importance of experimental remote sensing in evaluating spectral diversity, and provide insight for the development of operational airborne methods to assess biodiversity.', '[Gholizadeh, Hamed; Gamon, John A.; Zygielbaum, Arthur I.; Hmimina, Gabriel Y.; Yu, Rong; Moore, Ryan M.] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Ctr Adv Land Management Informat Technol, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.

Methods for detecting and monitoring tropical selective logging using satellite data are at an early stage, with current methods only able to detect more intensive timber harvest (> 20 m(3) ha(-1)). The spatial resolution of widely available datasets, like Landsat, have previously been considered too coarse to measure the subtle changes in forests associated with less intensive selective logging, yet most present-day logging is at low intensity. We utilized a detailed selective logging dataset from over 11,000 ha of forest in Rondonia, southern Brazilian Amazon, to develop a Random Forest machine-learning algorithm for detecting low-intensity selective logging (< 15 m(3) ha(-1)) We show that Landsat imagery acquired before the cessation of logging activities (i.e. the final cloud-free image of the dry season during logging) was better at detecting selective logging than imagery acquired at the start of the following dry season (i.e. the first cloud-free image of the next dry season). Within our study area the detection rate of logged pixels was approximately 90% (with roughly 20% commission and 8% omission error rates) and approximately 40% of the area inside low-intensity selective logging tracts were labelled as logged. Application of the algorithm to 6152 ha of selectively logged forest at a second site in Park northeast Brazilian Amazon, resulted in the detection of 2316 ha (38%) of selective logging (with 20% commission and 7% omission error rates). This suggests that our method can detect low-intensity selective logging across large areas of the Amazon. It is thus an important step forward in developing systems for detecting selective logging pan-tropically with freely available data sets, and has key implications for monitoring logging and implementing carbon-based payments for ecosystem service schemes.', '[Hethcoat, M.

Such maps can be generated using satellite-based information. In this study, we developed mapping techniques that rely on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) on-board earth-orbiting platforms. SAR provides valid ground surface measurements through cloud cover with high resolution and sampling frequency that has recently increased through multiple missions. Despite numerous efforts, automatic processing of SAR data to derive accurate inundation maps still poses challenges. To address them, we have developed an NRT system named RAdarProduced Inundation Diary (RAPID). RAPID integrates four processing steps: classification based on statistics, morphological processing, multi-threshold-based compensation, and machine-leaming correction. Besides SAR data, the system integrates multisource remote-sensing data products, including land cover classification, water occurrence, hydrographical, water type, and river width products. In comparison to expert handmade flood maps, the fully-automated RAPID system exhibited \"overall,\" \"producer,\" and \"user\" accuracies of 93%, 77%, and 75%, respectively. RAPID accommodates commonly encountered over- and under-detections caused by noise-like speckle, water-like radar response areas, strong scatterers, and isolated inundation areas errors that are in common practice to ignore, mask out, or be filtered out by coarsening the effective resolution. RAPID can serve as the kernel algorithm to derive flood inundation products from satellites both existing and to be launched equipped with high-resolution SAR sensors, including Envisat, Radarsat, NISAR, Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS)-1/2, Sentinel-1, and TerraSAR-X.', '[Shen, Xinyi; Anagnostou, Emmanouil N.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Storrs, CT 06263 USA.

Ideally, deforestation monitoring systems would identify a TDF clearing with near real time precision and high spatial detail, and alert park managers and environmental practitioners of illegal forest clearings occurring anywhere in a region of interest. Over the past several years there have been significant advances in the design and application of continuous land cover change mapping algorithms with these capabilities, but no studies have implemented such methods over human dominated TDF environments where small scale deforestation (< 5 ha) is widespread and hard to detect with moderate resolution sensors. The general objective for this research was to evaluate the overall accuracy of the BFASTSpatial R Package for detecting and monitoring small-scale deforestation in four sites located in tropical dry forest landscapes of Mexico and Costa Rica using greenness and moisture spectral indices derived from Landsat time series. Results show a high degree of spatial agreement (90%-94%) between the distribution of TDF clearings occurred during the 2013-2016 period (as indicated by VHR imagery interpretation) and BFASTSpatial outputs. NDMI and NBR2 had the best performance than other indices and this is evidenced by the combined overall, user\'s and producer\'s accuracies. In particular, NBR2 were the most accurate predictor of deforestation with an overall accuracy of 94.5%. Our results also imply that monitoring sites at an annual basis is feasible using BFASTSpatial and LTS, but that lower confidence should be given to sub-annual products given significant systematic temporal differences between the BFASTSpatial monthly product and reference data. The possibility of including more clear observations at the spatial resolution of Landsat (30-m) or higher will greatly increase the spatial and temporal accuracies of the method. Given its performance, BFASTSpatial can help monitor hotspots of small-scale TDF loss across Central and North America at little or no cost. Users of the method should have a strong knowledge of the local land use and land cover dynamics and the ecophysiology of vegetation types present in the landscape.

Authoritative global reference data are generally collected by experts with regional knowledge through photo-interpretation. During the last decade, crowdsourcing has emerged as an attractive alternative for rapid and relatively cheap data collection, beckoning the increasingly relevant question: can these two data sources be combined to validate thematic maps? In this article, we compared expert and crowd data and assessed their relative agreement for cropland identification, a land cover class often reported as difficult to map. Results indicate that observations from experts and volunteers could be partially conflated provided that several consistency checks are performed. We propose that conflation, i.e., replacement and augmentation of expert observations by crowdsourced observations, should be carried out both at the sampling and data analytics levels. The latter allows to evaluate the reliability of crowdsourced observations and to decide whether they should be conflated or discarded. We demonstrate that the standard deviation of crowdsourced contributions is a simple yet robust indicator of reliability which can effectively inform conflation. Following this criterion, we found that 70% of the expert observations could be crowdsourced with little to no effect on accuracy estimates, allowing a strategic reallocation of the spared expert effort to increase the reliability of the remaining 30% at no additional cost. Finally, we provide a collection of evidence-based recommendations for future hybrid reference data collection campaigns.', '[Waldner, Francois; d\'Andrimont, Raphael; de Maet, Thomas; Defourny, Pierre] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.

Today, islands within the Delta have subsided to the point where most lie below mean sea level. Long-term sustainability of the Delta requires reversal of subsidence, but spatially comprehensive maps of subsidence have not been available to inform and monitor remediation. Reported here is the first spatially dense map of recent subsidence rates across the Delta, based on synthetic aperture radar interferometry and constrained by GNSS observations. The analysis uses a temporally dense and spatially overlapping set of data acquired by the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) sensor in 2009-2015. On average, the Delta is subsiding by 9.2 +/- 4.4 mm/yr with high variability even at the sub-island scale, including peak subsidence of 160 +/- 4.4 mm/yr occurring just inland of the levee of the westernmost island and average subsidence of 11 mm/yr along the planned path of water conveyance tunnels through the Delta. The results are compared to local sea level rise (SLR), measured at a tidal gauge in San Francisco Bay, to show that subsidence is currently the dominant contributor to local relative sea level rise (RSLR) by nearly a factor of five. Based on recently measured and modeled acceleration of SLR, subsidence in the Delta is likely to dominate RSLR until the middle of the 21th century.', '[Bekaert, David P.

The HLS products are based on a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from both sensors (OLI and MSI): atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial co-registration and common gridding, bidirectional reflectance distribution function normalization and spectral bandpass adjustment. Three products are derived from the HLS processing chain: (i) S10: full resolution MSI SR at 10 m, 20 m and 60 m spatial resolutions; (ii) S30: a 30 in MSI Nadir BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR); (iii) L30: a 30 m OLI NBAR. All three products are processed for every Level-1 input products from Landsat 8/OLI (L1T) and Sentinel-2/MSI (L1C). As of version 1.3, the HLS data set covers 10.35 million km(2) and spans from first Landsat 8 data (2013); Sentinel-2 data spans from October 2015.   The L30 and S30 show a good consistency with coarse spatial resolution products, in particular MODIS Collection 6 MCDO9CMG products (overall deviations do not exceed 11%) that are used as a reference for quality assurance. The spatial co-registration of the HLS is improved compared to original Landsat 8 MT and Sentinel 2A L1C products, for which misregistration issues between multi-temporal data are known. In particular, the resulting computed circular errors at 90% for the HLS product are 6.2 m and 18.8 m, for S10 and L30 products, respectively. The main known issue of the current data set remains the Sentinel-2 cloud mask with many cloud detection omissions. The cross-comparison with MODIS was used to flag products with most evident non-detected clouds. A time series outlier filtering approach is suggested to detect remaining clouds. Finally, several time series are presented to highlight the high potential of the HLS data set for crop monitoring.', '[Claverie, Martin; Roger, Jean-Claude; Skakun, Sergii V.; Justice, Christopher] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

RADARSAT-2 data analysis shows that vegetation attenuation on the surface scattering component is stronger for the narrow-leaf (wheat) than broad-leaf crops (canola, corn and soybean). Thus, the vegetation attenuation factor is integrated into the proposed C-band polarimetric decomposition to better account for soil contribution over the whole crop phenological season. After removing the volume scattering component from the full coherency matrix, the surface scattering component was simulated by the Oh soil scattering model, instead of conventional Bragg or X-Bragg model, which is not physically valid at C-band due to limited roughness constraint condition. The proposed retrieval algorithm was applied to the RADARSAT-2 time series acquired during the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment in 2012 (SMAPVEX12). Results indicate that during the crop growth, the volume scattering power of wheat shows weak temporal variation, while it increases for corn, soybean and canola. The sensitivity of the ground scattering component to soil moisture is enhanced due to the removal of the volume scattering from the full signature. The retrieved soil moisture was validated using the soil moisture ground measurements during the SMAPVEX12. The validations indicate correlation coefficients from 0.63 to 0.76, and RMSEs from 0.058 to 0.074 m(3)/m(3) for the entire phenological period of SMAPVEX12 campaign.

Although data products provided at 500 m spatial resolution by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor provide important and readily available information on snow cover, capturing snow dynamics at finer spatial resolutions remains problematic due to the lack of high temporal and spatial resolution data, which limits the number of available observations each year. In this paper we present a new approach to create a daily time-series of 30-m snow observations (called SNOWARP), derived from daily MODIS Normalised Difference Snow Index (NDSI) snow cover data to capture the temporal dynamics of snow cover and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to re-order historical Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM + ), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) observations to account for inter-annual variability. The SNOWARP product was produced for 2000-2018 for an area of Western Alberta (approximately 30,000 km(2)) and was calibrated against a network of time-lapse cameras and snow pillows. Results indicate the RMSE of the SNOWARP fractional product ranges from 31.3%-68.3%, while F score of the SNOWARP binary product ranges from 87.7% - 98.6% when compared to ground truth data. Capturing fractional snow cover at a fine spatial and temporal scale is important due to the spatial heterogeneity of snow cover, particularly in mountainous regions with implications for biodiversity assessment and monitoring. SNOWARP demonstrates a novel method to increasing the temporal resolution of Landsat-derived snow cover data, providing valuable insights on regional snow cover dynamics for use in a range of applications.', '[Berman, Ethan E.; Bolton, Douglas K.; Coops, Nicholas C.; Mityok, Zoltan K.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Resources Management, 2424 Mail Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.

This is the case for the steppes of northern Kazakhstan, where the breakdown of the Soviet Union led to widespread cropland abandonment, creating restoration opportunities. Understanding when abandonment happened and whether it persists is important for making use of these opportunities. We developed a trajectory-based change detection approach to identify cropland abandonment between 1988 and 2013 and recultivation between 1991 and 2013. Our approach is based on annual time series of cropland probabilities derived from Landsat imagery and resulted in reliable maps (89% overall accuracy), with abandonment being detected more accurately (user\'s accuracy of 93%) than recultivation (73%). Most of the remaining uncertainty in our maps was due to low image availability during the mid-1990s, leading to abandonment in the 1990s sometimes only being detected in the 2000s. Our results suggest that of the similar to 4.7 million ha of cropland in our study area in 1985, roughly 40% had been abandoned by 2013. Knowing the timing of abandonment allowed for deeper insights into what drives these dynamics: recultivation after 2007 happened preferentially on those lands that had been abandoned most recently, suggesting that the most productive croplands were abandoned last and recultivated first. Likewise, knowing the timing of abandonment allowed for more precise estimates of the environmental impacts of abandonment (e.g., soil organic carbon sequestration estimated at 16.3 Mt. C compared to 24.0 Mt. C when assuming all abandonment happened right after the breakdown of the Soviet Union, with the uncertainty around emission estimates decreasing by 63%). Overall, our study emphasizes the value of the Landsat archive for understanding agricultural land-use dynamics, and the opportunities of trajectory-based approaches for mapping these dynamics.', '[Dara, Andrey; Baumann, Matthias; Kuemmerle, Tobias; Pflugmacher, Dirk; Rabe, Andreas; Griffiths, Patrick; Hostert, Patrick] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.

Their global scale coverage and near real-time products perfectly fit the need of an early warning landslide system. Notwithstanding these characteristics, the number of studies employing satellite rainfall estimates for predicting landslide events is quite limited.   In this study, we propose a procedure that allows us to evaluate the capability of different rainfall products to forecast the spatial -temporal occurrence of rainfall -induced landslides using rainfall thresholds. Specifically, the assessment is carried out in terms of skill scores, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The procedure is applied to ground observations and four different satellite rainfall estimates: 1) the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission Multi -satellite Precipitation Analysis, TMPA, real time product (3642-RT), 2) the SM2RASC product obtained from the application of SM2RAIN algorithm to the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) derived satellite soil moisture (SM) data, 3) the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Network (PERSIANN), and 4) the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing Technique (CMORPH). As case study, we consider the Italian territory for which a catalogue listing 1414 rainfall induced landslides in the period 2008-2014 is available.   Results show that satellite products underestimate rainfall with respect to ground observations. However, by adjusting the rainfall thresholds, satellite products are able to identify landslide occurrence, even though with less accuracy than ground-based rainfall observations. Among the four satellite rainfall products, CMORPH and SM2RASC are performing the best, even though differences are small. This result is to be attributed to the high spatial/temporal resolution of CMORPH, and the good accuracy of SM2RSC. Overall, we believe that satellite rainfall estimates might be an important additional data source for developing continental or global landslide warning systems.', '[Brunetti, M.

Passive microwave (PM) remote sensing data have long been used to retrieve snow depth and snow water equivalent with large uncertainties. The objective of this study is to develop snow-depth retrieval algorithm based on support vector regression (SVR) technique using PM remote sensing data and other auxiliary data. Ground-based daily snow depth data from 1223 stations across Eurasian continent were used to construct and validate the snow-depth retrieval algorithm. This SVR snow-depth retrieval algorithm partitioned three snow cover stages, and four land cover types then generated twelve snow-depth models for each phases. A non-linear regression method based on support vector regression (SVR) was used to retrieve snow depth with PM brightness temperatures, location (latitude and longitude), and terrain parameters (elevation) as input data and land cover as auxiliary data. In addition, we compared the performance of the SVR snow-depth retrieval algorithm with four alternative algorithms: the Chang algorithm, the Spectral Polarization Difference (SPD) algorithm, the Artificial/Neural Networks (ANN) and, an algorithm based on linear regression. Comparing results obtained from these five snow-depth retrieval algorithms against the ground-based daily snow depth data, the SVR snow-depth retrieval algorithm performs much superior with reduced uncertainties. We report the results aimed at evaluating the impact of the variation of snow cover stages and land cover types. The preliminary results suggest that the SVR snow-depth algorithm could detect deep snow with high accuracy and decrease the impact of saturation effects. These results suggest that the SVR snow-depth retrieval algorithm integrating PM remote sensing data and other auxiliary data (land cover types, location, terrain, snow cover stage with indirectly considering grain size variation) can be a more efficient and effective algorithm for retrieving snow depth and snow water equivalent over various scales.', '[Xiao, Xiongxin; Zhang, Tingjun; Shao, Wanwan; Li, Xiaodong] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Western Chinas Environm Syst, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.

At low radar frequencies, e.g. L-band (1.2 GHz) but also at higher frequency, e.g. C-band (5.6 GHz), the ionosphere has been documented to be an important source of noise in these data. In this paper, we employ a split-spectrum technique and investigate its performance for correcting ionospheric effects in InSAR-based ice velocity measurements in Greenland and Antarctica. Three case studies using ALOS PALSAR data are used to assess the performance of the split spectrum technique for ionosphere correction over a range of environmental parameters. We employ several approaches to evaluate the results, including visual inspection, profile analysis, comparison of experimental and theoretic errors, comparison with reference data from other sources, generation of double difference interferograms, and analysis of time series of multi-temporal data. Our experiments show that ionospheric distortions are observed regularly, and in our analyzed Greenland dataset and Antarctic dataset the ionospheric noise reaches 14 m/yr and 10 m/yr, respectively, which exceeds the signal associated with ice motion. Our analysis using several different approaches demonstrates that the split-spectrum technique provides an effective correction. The split spectrum technique is also found to be superior to currently used approaches such as baseline fitting and multi-temporal averaging.

The goal of the present paper is to illuminate the artefact issue of current global DEM data sets that might be an obstacle for any geoscience study using terrain information. We introduce the Maximum Slope Approach (MSA) as a technique that uses terrain slopes as indicator to detect and localize spurious artefacts. The MSA relies on the strong sensitivity of terrain slopes for sudden steps in the DEM that is a direct feature of larger artefacts. In a numerical case study, the MSA is applied for globally complete screening of two SRTM-based 3 arc-second DEMs, the SRTM v4.1 and the MERIT-DEM. Based on 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees sub-divisions and a 5 m/m slope threshold, 1341 artefacts were detected in SRTM v4.1 vs. 108 in MERIT. Most artefacts spatially correlate with SRTM voids (and thus with the void-filling) and not with the SRTM-measured elevations. The strong contrast in artefact frequency (factor similar to 12) is attributed to the SRTM v4.1 hole filling. Our study shows that over parts of the Himalaya Mountains the SRTM v4.1 data set is contaminated by step artefacts where the use of this DEM cannot be recommended. Some caution should be exercised, e.g., over parts of the Andes and Rocky Mountains. The same holds true for derived global products that depend on SRTM v4.1, such as gravity maps. Primarily over the major mountain ranges, the MERIT model contains artefacts, too, but in smaller numbers. As a conclusion, globally complete artefact screening is recommended prior to the public release of any DEM data set. However, such a quality check should also be considered by users before using DEM data. MSA-based artefact screening is not only limited to DEMs, but can be applied as quality assurance measure to other gridded data sets such as digital bathymetric models or gridded physical quantities such as gravity or magnetics.', '[Hirt, Christian] Tech Univ Munich, IAPG, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.

Well-established remote sensing methods capture change over forested ecosystems, however the return of forest vegetation in disturbed locations is infrequently documented and not well understood. Landsat time-series data allows for both the capture of the initial disturbance and the ability to monitor the subsequent vegetation regeneration with spectral vegetation indices. In this research, we used three spectral recovery metrics derived from an annual Landsatbased per-pixel Normalized Burn Ratio time series to determine trends in the short-term rates of spectral recovery for areas disturbed by wildfire (1986-2006), as assessed using a series of 5-year post-disturbance windows to observe forest recovery trends. Our results indicated that rates of spectral forest recovery vary over time and space in the Taiga and Boreal Shield ecozones. We found evidence that post-fire spectral forest recovery rates have accelerated over time in both the East and West Taiga Shield ecozones, with a consistent, positive, and significant trend measured using a Mann-Kendall test for monotonicity and Theil-Sen slope estimation. Over the analysis period (1986-2011), relative rates of spectral forest recovery increased by 18% in the Taiga Shield East and 9% in the Taiga Shield West. In contrast, spectral forest recovery rates in the Boreal Shield varied temporally, and were not consistently positive or negative. These results demonstrate that post-fire spectral recovery rates are not fixed over time and that spectral trends are dependent upon spatial location in the Canadian boreal. This retrospective baseline information on trends in spectral recovery rates highlights the value of, and continued need for detailed monitoring of vegetation regeneration in boreal forest ecosystems, particularly in the context of a changing climate.', '[Frazier, Ryan J.; Coops, Nicholas C.; Hermosilla, Txomin] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Resources Management, Integrated Remote Sensing Studio, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.

Explicit spatial knowledge on where, when and how pastures are managed and intensification takes place is needed to better estimate potentials of more sustainable management. Monitoring the frequency of management practices like burning of pasture land and tillage treatment with adequate spatial resolution therefore offers novel indicators for describing land use intensity. With dense time series of Landsat data, it appears possible to quantify land use intensity also in heterogeneous landscapes where fine-scale processes cannot be monitored with previously available datasets.   Our overarching goal is to describe the occurrence or absence of extensive or intensive management regimes over time. For this study, we focused on detecting fire and tillage events in the region of Novo Progresso, Para, Brazil, where deforested land is mostly used for cattle ranching by both largeholders and smallholders. We used a dense time series of Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 surface reflectance data to mitigate the problem of varying cloud cover. For each acquisition date, we extracted a temporal sequence of three subsequent clear observations at pixel level. The temporal variation in each clear observation sequence was characterized by a stack of spectral and temporal features. These feature stacks were classified with a random forest to identify the management events. We aggregated the classification results based on the random forest class probabilities and derived normalized annual class scores for land management events. The yielded class score maps show burned and tilled areas on a yearly basis and provide a measure of model confidence.   We detected burned pastures with area adjusted user accuracies of 80-98%, burned secondary regrowth with 63-80% and tilled pastures with 74-78%. Our approach was able to discriminate management events even when they succeeded very fast. This way, the mapping approach with clear observation sequences allows us to contextualize management events directly from dense time series of high resolution satellite data. This opens new pathways to disentangle how management practices between smallholders and agribusinesses vary in the Brazilian Amazon. With sensor constellations from Sentinel-2 and Landsat data becoming a unified source for much denser time series soon, our method bears great potential to better understand and map pasture dynamics in the Amazon.', '[Jakimow, Benjamin; Griffiths, Patrick; van der Linden, Sebastian; Hostert, Patrick] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.

Out of 13 variables, 5 variables were selected to build the BP ANN model, and we used cross validation for the accuracy assessment. The results show that: (1) the modeled mean AGB (2001-2016) provides a reasonable spatial distribution that is similar to the field measurements but reveals more details and has better spatial coverage than the limited field measurements are able to provide; (2) the overall trend of AGB in the TRHR is increasing more than decreasing (44.4% vs 29.2%, respectively) and has a stable area of 26.4%; and (3) the BP ANN model achieves better results than do the traditional multi-factor regression models (R-2 : 0.75-0.85 vs 0.40-0.64, RMSE: 355-462 vs 537-689 kg DW/ha).

The relative impact of climate variability and water management decisions are better studied and quantified using historical data that are derived using a set of consistent datasets and methodology. Historical (1984-2014) Landsat-based ET maps were generated for major irrigation districts in California, i.e., Palo Verde and eight other sub-basins in parts of the middle and lower Central Valley. A total of 3396 Landsat images were processed using the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model that integrates weather and remotely sensed images to estimate monthly and annual ET within the study sites over the 31 years. Model output evaluation and validation using gridded-flux data and water balance ET approaches indicated relatively good correspondence (R-2 up to 0.88, root mean square error as low as 14 mm/month) between SSEBop ET and validation datasets. In a pairwise comparison, annual variability of agro-hydrologic parameters of actual evapotranspiration (ETa), land surface temperature (T-s), and runoff (Q) were found to be more variable than their corresponding climatic counterparts of atmospheric water demand (ETo), air temperature (T-a), and precipitation (P), revealing process differences between regional climatic drivers and localized agro-hydrologic responses. However, only To showed a consistent increase (up to 1.2 K) over study sites during the 31 years, whereas other climate variables such as ET, and P showed a generally neutral trend. This study demonstrates a useful application of \"Big Data\" science where large volumes of historical Landsat and weather datasets were used to quantify and understand the relative importance of water management and climate variability in crop water use dynamics in regards to the linkages among water management decisions, hydrologic processes and economic transactions. Irrigation district-wide ET estimates were used to compute historical crop water use volumes and monetary equivalents of water savings for the Palo Verde Irrigation District (PVID). During the peak crop fallowing year in PVID, the water saved reached a maximum of similar to 107,200 acre-feet in 2011 with an estimated monetary payout value of $20.5 million. A significant decreasing trend in actual ET despite an increasing atmospheric demand in PVID highlights the role of management decisions in affecting local hydrologic processes. This study has importance for planning water resource allocation, managing water rights, sustaining agricultural production, and quantifying impacts of climate and land use/land cover changes on water resources. With increased computational efficiency, similar studies can be conducted in other parts of the world to help policy and decision makers understand and quantify various aspects of water resources management.

Estimation of water storage over the floodplains is essential to understand the water balances in the fluvial systems and the role of floodplains in nutrient and sediment transport. However, spatio-temporal variations of water storages over floodplains are not well known due to their remoteness, vastness, and high temporal variability. In this study, we propose a new method to estimate absolute water storages over the floodplains by establishing relations between water depths (d) and water volumes (V) using 2-D water depth maps from the integration of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and altimetry measurements. We applied this method over the Congo River floodplains and modeled the d V relation using a power function (note that d V indicates relation between d and V, not d minus V), which revealed the cross-section geometry of the floodplains as a convex curve. Then, we combined this d V relation and Envisat altimetry measurements to construct time series of floodplain\'s absolute water storages from 2002 to 2011. Its mean annual amplitude over the floodplains ( 7,777 km(2)) is 3.86 0.59 km(3) with peaks in December, which lags behind total water storage (TWS) changes from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and precipitation changes from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) by about one month. The results also exhibit inter-annual variability, with maximum water volume to be 5.9 0.72 km(3) in the wet year of 2002 and minimum volume to be 2.01 0.63 km(3) in the dry year of 2005. The inter-annual variation of water storages can be explained by the changes of precipitation from TRMM.', '[Yuan, Ting; Lee, Hyongki; Aierken, Abureli; Kim, Donghwan] Univ Houston, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Houston, TX 77204 USA.

This approach is implemented in the Global Multisensor Automated Snow and Ice Mapping System (GMASI) operated by NOAA NESDIS since 2006. Combined observations in the visible and infrared from the AVHRR sensor onboard METOP satellites and in the microwave spectral bands from SSMIS onboard DMSP satellites allows for providing spatially continuous characterization of the snow and ice distribution on a daily basis. The paper presents a basic description of techniques and algorithms implemented in the system and examines the system performance in the course of the last ten years. It is demonstrated that the GMASI product adequately reproduces spatial patterns of the snow and ice distribution and their seasonal variations. Validation of GMASI daily snow retrievals over the Northern Hemisphere has demonstrated their close correspondence to surface observations of the snow cover with the yearly mean rate of over 94%. Automated maps are found to agree even better to the daily snow and ice cover map produced interactively at NOAA. In this latter case the agreement rates on the snow cover and ice cover distribution amounted correspondingly to 96% and 98%. A larger part of mismatches was due to underestimated snow and ice extent in the automated maps as compared to in situ data and interactive analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Despite the wide use of the MAI method in the geosciences, X-band SAR has rarely been applied in MAI-based studies due to the relatively shorter decorrelation periods involved. Thus, we need to evaluate the MAI measurements from X-band SAR for the use in the geosciences. In this paper, an assessment of the MAI performance for TerraSAR-X system was carried out at the test site, Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, focusing on the Kamoamoa fissure eruption episode that occurred on March 6-10, 2011. The root-mean-square (RMS) errors of single MAI interferograms were 3.26 +/- 1.32 cm and 2.95 +/- 0.77 cm for descending and ascending datasets, respectively. Multi-stacked MAI interferograms showed reduced error levels of 1.77 and 2.04 cm for descending and ascending datasets, respectively. In addition, empirical uncertainty models of the MAI measurements were generated with respect to the interferometric coherence of single-and multi-stacked MAI measurements, and these regression models enabled us to confirm the difference between the theoretical and practical accuracies of the MAI measurements. Moreover, the MAI-based 3D model based on high accuracy 3D maps showed some possibilities of new findings and interpretations of the geologic sources. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The validation is carried out over three test sites located in geographically different areas: Sevilla (SW Spain), Valencia (E Spain), and Ipsala (W Turkey), in which different rice types are present.

The SMOS sensor, based on an innovative interferometric technology enabling multi-angular signatures of surfaces to be measured, was launched in November 2009. The SMAP sensor, based on a large mesh reflector 6 m in diameter providing a conically scanning antenna beam with a surface incidence angle of 40, was launched in January of 2015. Over the last decade, an intense scientific activity has focused on the development of the SM retrieval algorithms for the two missions. This activity has relied on many field (mainly tower-based) and airborne experimental campaigns, and since 2010-2011, on the SMOS and Aquarius space-borne L-band observations. It has relied too on the use of numerical, physical and semi-empirical models to simulate the microwave brightness temperature of natural scenes for a variety of scenarios in terms of system configurations (polarization, incidence angle) and soil, vegetation and climate conditions. Key components of the inversion models have been evaluated and new parameterizations of the effects of the surface temperature, soil roughness, soil permittivity, and vegetation extinction and scattering have been developed. Among others, global maps of select radiative transfer parameters have been estimated very recently. Based on this intense activity, improvements of the SMOS and SMAP SM inversion algorithms have been proposed. Some of them have already been implemented, whereas others are currently being investigated. In this paper, we present a review of the significant progress which has been made over the last decade in this field of research with a focus on L-band, and a discussion on possible applications to the SMOS and SMAP soil moisture retrieval approaches.

From an inferential standpoint, there is interest in prediction and interpolation of the often sparsely sampled and spatially misaligned LiDAR signals and forest variables. We propose a fully process-based Bayesian hierarchical model for above ground biomass (AGB) and LiDAR signals. The process based framework offers richness in inferential capabilities, e.g., inference on the entire underlying processes instead of estimates only at pre-specified points. Key challenges we obviate include misalignment between the AGB observations and LiDAR signals and the high-dimensionality in the model emerging from LiDAR signals in conjunction with the large number of spatial locations. We offer simulation experiments to evaluate our proposed models and also apply them to a challenging dataset comprising LiDAR and spatially coinciding forest inventory variables collected on the Penobscot Experimental Forest (PEF), Maine. Our key substantive contributions include AGB data products with associated measures of uncertainty for the PEF and, more broadly, a methodology that should find use in a variety of current and upcoming forest variable mapping efforts using sparsely sampled remotely sensed high-dimensional data.

Based on GPP phenology estimation in GPP, the growing season determined by SIF time-series is shorter in length than the growing season length determined solely using NDVI. This is mainly due to the extended period of high NDVI values, as compared to SIF, by about 46 days (+/- 11 days), indicating a large-scale seasonal decoupling of physiological activity and changes in greenness in the fall. In addition to phenological timing, mean seasonal NDVI and SIF have different responses to temperature changes throughout the growing season. We observed that both NDVI and SIF linearly increased with temperature increases throughout the spring. However, in the fall, although NDVI linearly responded to temperature increases, SIF and GPP did not linearly increase with temperature increases, implying a seasonal hysteresis of SIF and GPP in response to temperature changes across boreal ecosystems throughout their growing season. Seasonal hysteresis of vegetation at large-scales is consistent with the known phenomena that light limits boreal forest ecosystem productivity in the fall. Our results suggest that continuing measurements from satellite remote sensing of both SIF and NDVI can help to understand the differences between, and information carried by, seasonal variations vegetation structure and greenness and physiology at large-scales across the critical boreal regions.

Thus, implementation of a robust and cost-efficient carbon accounting system is one of the prerequisites for receiving financial benefits under the REDD + mechanism. For estimation targeting large areas (i.e., country, region, and sub-regional), remote sensing techniques like airborne laser scanning (ALS) enable precise and timely estimation of biomass stocks and biomass changes. The main objective of the study was to compare alternative sampling strategies using ALS for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) changes in miombo woodlands that would be suitable components of the National Forestry Resources Monitoring and Assessment (NAFORMA) program of Tanzania and of the Biennial Update Reports under UNFCCC. NAFORMA is the national forest inventory of Tanzania. The study area of 15,867 km(2) was located in the administrative district of Liwale, south-eastern Tanzania and dominated by miombo woodlands. A longitudinal survey was carried out during two temporally consistent field and ALS data acquisition campaigns in 2012 and 2014. The field data were collected on permanent plots of the NAFORMA program. ALS measurements were acquired along 32 parallel strips spaced 5 km apart and covering approximately 25% of the study area. Estimation methods (1) solely based on the ground inventory data provided by NAFORMA and (2) by incorporating field observations and auxiliary variables derived from ALS data were pursued for assessing AGB change as the difference between estimated AGB in 2012 and 2014, together with the uncertainties related to sampling variability. The AGB estimates varied from 58.48 to 59.55 Mg ha(-1) in 2012 and between 58.20 and 59.29 Mg ha(-1) in 2014. The sampling variability (in terms of standard errors) was between 137 and 4.79 Mg ha(-1) in 2012, and 1.77 and 5.03 Mg ha(-1) in 2014. The mean AGB change varied from 0.11 to 0.35 Mg ha(-1) with standard errors of 0.31 to 0.85 Mg ha(-1). Compared to direct estimation based on field data only, the efficiency gain under ALS-assisted (design-based, model-assisted) estimation was 5-22%, and approximately 66% when using ALS data in a model-dependent estimation. The results provide statistically significant evidence of change in AGB over the 2-yr period spanned by the study only under model-dependent estimation at 50% confidence level, illustrating the great challenges of change estimation over such short time periods as requested for UNFCCC reporting.

The proposed methodology is based on the inversion of the PROSAIL radiative transfer model through the state-of-the-art nonlinear Gaussian process regression (GPR) method. Landsat and SPOT5 data were used for multitemporal LAI retrievals at high-resolution. LAI estimates were validated using time series of in situ LAI measurements collected during the rice season in Spain and Italy. Ground LAI data were collected with smartphones using PocketLAI, a specific phone application for LAI estimation. Temporal evolution of the LAI estimates using Landsat and SPOT5 data followed consistently the temporal evolution of the in situ LAI measurements acquired on several Mediterranean rice varieties. The estimates had a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.39 and 0.51 m(2)/m(2) in Spain and 0.38 and 0.47 m(2)/m(2) in Italy for Landsat and SPOT5 respectively, with a strong correlation (R-2 > 0.92) for both cases. Spatial-temporal assessment of the estimated LAI from Landsat and SPOT5 data confirmed the robustness and consistency of the retrieval chain. This paper demonstrates the importance of an adequate characterization of the underlying rice background in order to address changes in background condition related to water management. Results highlight the potential of the proposed chain for deriving multitemporal near real-time decametric LAI maps fundamental for operational rice crop monitoring, and demonstrate the readiness of the proposed method for the processing of data such as the recently launched Sentinel-2.

Therefore, a critical need exists to improve our understanding of how the growing seasons of forests are changing, and by extension, how the composition and function of forests will respond to future climate change. Coarse spatial resolution satellite remote sensing has been widely used to monitor and map the phenology of terrestrial ecosystems at regional to global scales, and despite widespread agreement that the growing season of Northern Hemisphere forests is changing, the spatial resolution of these data sources imposes significant limitations on the character and quality of inferences that can be drawn from them. In particular, the spatial resolution afforded by instruments such as MODIS does not resolve ecologically important landscape-scale patterns in phenology. With this issue in mind, here we evaluate the ability of a newly developed Landsat phenology algorithm (LPA) to reconstruct a 32-year time series for the start and end of the growing season in North American temperate and boreal forests. We focus on 13 \"sidelap\" regions located between overlapping Landsat scenes that span a large geographic range of temperate and boreal forests, and evaluate the quality and character of LPA-derived-start and end of growing season (SOS and EOS) dates using several independent data sources. On average, SOS and EOS dates were detected for about two-thirds of the 32 years included in our analysis, with the remaining one-third missing due to cloud cover. Moreover, there was generally better agreement between ground observations and LPA-derived estimates of SOS dates than for EOS across the 13 sites included in our study. Our results demonstrate that, despite the presence of time series gaps, LPA provides a robust basis for retrospective analysis of long-term changes in spring and autumn deciduous forest phenology over the last three decades. Finally, our results support the potential for monitoring land surface phenology at 30 m spatial resolution in near real-time by combining time series from multiple sensors such as the Landsat Operational Land Imager and the Sentinel 2 MultiSpectral Instrument.

However, these systems are commonly classified in a deterministic, discrete manner that does not reflect inherent spatial and temporal variation. Developing a methodology to identify gradients in water inundation is critical given the dynamic nature of wetlands. We present a methodology that applies probabilistic estimates, derived from a nonparametric model, to predict wetlands along a gradient in ephemerality, or degree of water inundation. We applied this model across four sampling areas in the Plains and Prairie Pothole Region (PPPR) in the U.S. Northern Great Plains. We developed a model relationship between high-resolution (RapidEye) and moderate resolution (Landsat) satellite sensor data. This allowed us leverage the benefits of high spatial resolution data and a long temporal series of freely available mid-resolution data to characterize water persistence in wetlands. To obtain measures of wetland inundation across a gradient of ephemerality, we estimated wetland probabilities across a temporal series reflecting large variation in moisture conditions. We found that a nonparametric statistical approach was highly effective in predicting wetlands of varying size and ephemerality. Our predictions were strongly supported with low error (RapidEye 3.1-15%, Landsat 0.3-1.5%). Probabilistic predictions of wetland ephemerality contribute valuable information needed for management and policy decisions, especially given potential alterations to wetland ephemerality and ecosystem services under climate change. Using predicted gradients in wetland ephemerality over time will enable researchers and land managers to more effectively capture nuance in ecosystem condition, function, and change.

Existing survey approaches cannot provide sufficiently fine-resolution data at landscape-level extents to quantify this structure appropriately. Using a small, unpiloted aerial system (UAS) to acquire aerial photographs and processing theses using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry, three-dimensional models were produced describing the vegetation structure of semi-arid ecosystems at seven sites across a grass-to shrub transition zone. This approach yielded ultra-fine (<1 cm(2)) spatial resolution canopy height models over landscape-levels (10 ha), which resolved individual grass tussocks just a few cm(3) in volume. Canopy height cumulative distributions for each site illustrated ecologically-significant differences in ecosystem structure. Strong coefficients of determination (r(2) from 0.64 to 0.95) supported prediction of above-ground biomass from canopy volume. Canopy volumes, above-ground biomass and carbon stocks were shown to be sensitive to spatial changes in the structure of vegetation communities. The grain of data produced and sensitivity of this approach is invaluable to capture even subtle differences in the structure (and therefore function) of these heterogeneous ecosystems subject to rapid environmental change. The results demonstrate how products from inexpensive UAS coupled with SfM photogrammetry can produce ultra-fine grain biophysical data products, which have the potential to revolutionise scientific understanding of ecology in ecosystems with either spatially or temporally discontinuous canopy cover.

Light use efficiency (LUE) models in combination with satellite data have been used to estimate production for most major ecosystems, but peatlands have been largely ignored. The objectives of this study were: 1) to examine how the LUE parameter epsilon, epsilon (the amount of carbon fixed or converted to biomass per unit absorbed photosynthetically active radiation), varies between and within four different peatlands; 2) to examine how the variations in epsilon relate to variations in environmental conditions; and 3) to evaluate a LUE-based model for estimation of epsilon in peatlands. We achieve these objectives using a combination of eddy covariance flux measurements, climate data and satellite data and estimate epsilon using the LUE-based vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM). The results show that: 1) mean site-specific flux-derived epsilon values (+/- standard deviation) were split into three statistically different groups: lowest values at the two colder fens, Kaamanen and Sandhill (0.22 +/- 0.18 and 0.23 +/- 0.20 g C MJ(-1), respectively), highest values at the treed fen La Biche (0.47 +/- 0.27 g C MJ(-1)) and intermediate values at the bog, Mer Bleue (0.34 +/- 0.18 g C MJ(-1)); 2) Variations in monthly epsilon within sites related mainly to air temperature, while variations in annual epsilon within sites related mainly to wetness variables; 3) relative mean absolute errors of estimates of s for the four sites ranged between 19% and 35%, with r(2) values ranging between 72% and 93%. LUE models are appealing as they are relatively simple formulations of variables that are easily obtained from satellite data. Challenges associated with the use of satellite data derived input variables are further discussed in the paper. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A cell-by-cell assessment of the DEM for hydrological network extraction is also provided through the Gyasi-Agyei et al. (1995) suitability metric. Results show that DEM uncertainty generally ranged between 0.025 and 0.060 m, slope uncertainty ranged between 0.6 and 1.5 degrees, and aspect uncertainty ranged between 2.7 and 24.1 degrees for the given case study site. DEM uncertainty and slope uncertainty were correlated with the incidence angle between the laser pulse and the terrain, described with a piecewise linear function. Uncertainty in aspect showed a correlation with terrain slope and could be described with a decreasing power function. The variation in watershed area was less than 1% of total watershed area indicating it was not sensitive to LiDAR measurement errors for the selected case study site. Stream network length variability was 1.5% of total length, but increased as the analyzed area decreased. Areas of 1 ha showed relative standard deviations of stream network length of similar to 26%. These results can be used to optimise LiDAR survey data collection configuration and in the design of tools to ensure the objectives and uncertainty requirements of projects requiring terrain derivative products are successfully achieved.

Thin clouds inside visible Bands 1-4 of Landsat-8 data acquired on 8 January 2014 disappeared after the algorithm. Values of mean and one standard deviation decreased, band-by-band. The reduction was supported by the leftward shift of the histogram curve in each band. To validate the algorithm, we used the cloud-free image acquired on 23 December 2013 of Landsat-8 as the reference image. Among the January image before the algorithm, the January image after the algorithm, and the reference image, values of mean and one standard deviation of the January image after the algorithm were much closer to those of the reference image. Histogram curves of the January image after the algorithm and the reference image were almost overlapped entirely. Spatial correlation coefficients of the January image before the algorithm and reference were 0.496, 0.547, 0.656, and 0.730 for Bands 1-4, respectively. Coefficients of the January image after the algorithm and reference image became 0.782, 0.822, 0.840, and 0.885 for Bands 1-4. In cloud-free areas, the algorithm did not alter spectral characteristics of cloud-free pixels. Thus, the algorithm was not only able to remove thin clouds, but also to preserve spectral characteristics of cloud-free pixels. The algorithm was then applied to other land use and land cover (LULC) types, and images acquired in other locations and seasons by Landsat-8 and WorldView-2 sensors. Results in cloud removal were satisfactory. Finally, this algorithm outperformed three widely-used cloud removal algorithms in comparison. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

For that reason, agricultural drought research and monitoring are of increasing interest. Although soil moisture is the main variable to define and identify agricultural drought, the actual soil water content is rarely taken into account because this type of drought is commonly studied using methodologies based on either climatological data or hydrological modeling. Currently, it is possible to use remote sensing to obtain global and frequent soil moisture data that could be directly used for agricultural drought monitoring everywhere. For example, the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) satellite was launched in 2009 and provides global soil moisture maps every 1-2 days. In this work, the Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI) was calculated using the SMOS 12 soil moisture series in the REMEDHUS (Soil Moisture Measurement Stations Network) area (Spain) during the period 2010-2014. The satellite index was thus calculated using several approaches to obtain the soil water parameters and was compared with the SWDI obtained from in situ data. One approach was based directly on SMOS soil moisture time series (using the 5th percentile as an estimator for wilting point and the 95th percentile and the minimum of the maximum value during the growing season as estimators for field capacity). In this case, the results of the comparison were good, but the temporal distribution and the range of the index data were unrealistic. Other approaches were based on in situ data parameters and pedotransfer functions estimation. In this case, the results were better, and the satellite index was able to adequately identify the drought dynamics. Therefore, the final choice to apply the index in one particular site will depend on the availability of data. Finally, a comparison analysis was made with the SMOS SWDI and two indices (Crop Moisture Index, CMI, and Atmospheric Water Deficit, AWD) commonly used for agricultural drought monitoring and assessment. In both cases, the agreement was very good, and it was proven that SMOS SWDI reproduces well the soil water balance dynamics and is able to appropriately track agricultural drought.

Remote sensing of land surface phenology (LSP), i.e., the start and the end of the growing season (SOS and EOS, respectively) in evergreen needleleaf forests is particularly challenging due to their limited seasonal variability in canopy greenness. Using 107 site-years of CO2 flux data at 14 evergreen needleleaf forest sites in North America, we developed a new model to estimate SOS and EOS based entirely on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. We found that the commonly used vegetation indices (VI), including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), were not able to detect SOS and EOS in these forests. The MODIS land surface temperature (LST) showed better performance in the estimation of SOS than did a single VI. Interestingly, the variability of LST (i.e., the coefficient of variation, CV LST) was more useful than LST itself in detecting changes in forest LSP. Therefore, a new model using the product of VI and CV LST was developed and it significantly improved the representation of LSP with mean errors of 11.7 and 5.6 days for SOS and EOS, respectively. Further validation at five sites in the Long Term Ecological Research network (LTER) using camera data also indicated the applicability of the new approach. These results suggest that temperature variability plays a previously overlooked role in phenological modeling, and a combination of canopy greenness and temperature could be a useful way to enhance the estimation of evergreen needleleaf forest phenology of future ecosystem models.

Satellite images, in particular data from the Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (TM/ETM +) sensors, are often integrated with field plots from forest inventory programs, leveraging the complete spatial coverage of imagery with detailed ecological information from a sample of plots to spatially model forest conditions and resources. However, in remote and unmanaged areas such as Canada\'s northern forests, financial and logistic constraints can severely limit the availability of inventory plot data. Additionally, Landsat spectral information has known limitations for characterizing vertical vegetation structure and biomass; while clouds, snow, and short growing seasons can limit development of large area image mosaics that are spectrally and phenologically consistent across space and time. In this study we predict and map forest structure and aboveground biomass over 37 million ha of forestland in Saskatchewan, Canada. We utilize lidar plots observations of forest structure collected from airborne discrete-return lidar transects acquired in 2010 as a surrogate for traditional field and photo plots. Mapped explanatory data included Tasseled Cap indices and multi-temporal change metrics derived from Landsat TM/ETM+ pixel-based image composites. Maps of forest structure and total aboveground biomass were created using a Random Forest (RF) implementation of Nearest Neighbor (NN) imputation. The imputation model had moderate to high plot-level accuracy across all forest attributes (R-2 values of 0.42-0.69), as well as reasonable attribute predictions and error estimates (for example, canopy cover above 2 m on validation plots averaged 35.77%, with an RMSE of 13.45%, while unsystematic and systematic agreement coefficients (AC(uns) and AC(sys)) had values of 0.63 and 0.97 respectively). Additionally, forest attributes displayed consistent trends in relation to the time since and magnitude of wildfires, indicating model predictions captured the dominant ecological patterns and processes in these forests. Acknowledging methodological and conceptual challenges based upon the use of lidar plots from transects, this study demonstrates that using lidar plots and pixel compositing in imputation mapping can provide forest inventory and monitoring information for regions lacking ongoing or up-to-date field data collection programs.
