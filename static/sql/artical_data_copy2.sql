The solution is expressed as a probability distribution that measures the likelihood of encountering specific values of the marine reflectance given the observed TOA reflectance. This conditional distribution, the posterior distribution, allows the construction of reliable multi-dimensional confidence domains of the retrieved marine reflectance. The expectation and covariance of the posterior distribution are computed, which gives for each pixel an estimate of the marine reflectance and a measure of its uncertainty. Situations for which forward model and observation are incompatible are also identified. Prior distributions of the forward model parameters that are suitable for use at the global scale, as well as a noise model, are determined. Partition-based models are defined and implemented for SeaWiFS, to approximate numerically the expectation and covariance. The ill-posed nature of the inverse problem is illustrated, indicating that a large set of ocean and atmospheric states, or pre-images, may correspond to very close values of the satellite signal. Theoretical performance is good globally, i.e., on average over all the geometric and geophysical situations considered, with negligible biases and standard deviation decreasing from 0.004 at 412 nm to 0.001 at 670 nm. Errors are smaller for geometries that avoid Sun glint and minimize air mass and aerosol influence, and for small aerosol optical thickness and maritime aerosols. The estimated uncertainty is consistent with the inversion error. The theoretical concepts and inverse models are applied to actual SeaWiFS imagery, and comparisons are made with estimates from the SeaDAS standard atmospheric correction algorithm and in situ measurements. The Bayesian and SeaDAS marine reflectance fields exhibit resemblance in patterns of variability, but the Bayesian imagery is less noisy and characterized by different spatial de-correlation scales. Experimental errors obtained from match-up data are similar to the theoretical errors determined from simulated data. Regionalization of the inverse models is a natural development to improve retrieval accuracy, for example by including explicit knowledge of the space and time variability of atmospheric variables.

The main aim of this research is to develop FSC estimation in complex alpine-forested environments using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methodology as a fusion framework between multi-sensor remotely sensed data at medium temporal/spatial resolution (e.g.16-day revisit time; 30 m; Landsat), and high spatial resolutions (e.g.1 m; IKONOS). This research is the first known attempt to develop a multi-scale estimator of FSC from surface equivalent reference data derived from IKONOS multispectral data. It is also the first endeavor to estimate FSC values by combining terrain and snow/non-snow reflectance data. The plasticity of the developed ANN Landsat-FSC model accommodates alpine-forest heterogeneity, and renders unbiased, comprehensive, and precise FSC estimates. The accuracy of the ANN Landsat based FSC is characterized by: (1) very low error values (mean error similar to 0.0002; RMSE similar to 0.10; MAE similar to 0.08 FSC), (2) high correlation with the ground equivalent reference datasets derived from I m resolution IKONOS images (r(2) similar to 0.9), and (3) robust FSC estimation that is independent of terrain/vegetation alpine heterogeneity. The latter is supported by a spatially uniform distribution of errors, and lack of correlation between terrain (slope, aspect, terrain shadow distribution), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and the error (r(2) = 0).

Our study was motivated by the observation that multiple LUE definitions are reported in the literature. The temporal behavior of three operational definitions of LUE, based on (i) incident radiation, (ii) total absorbed radiation and (iii) radiation absorbed by photosynthetically active/green vegetation was examined for two contrasting crops (soybean and maize) having different physiologies, leaf structures and canopy architectures. Over the course of a growing season, the behavior of these three contrasting LUE definitions was strikingly dissimilar, and the degree of dissimilarity varied with contrasting crops (corn and soybean). This demonstrates that LUE model behavior would vary strongly with the LUE definition used, with resulting implications both for the estimated seasonal productivity, and for the interpretation of the underlying mechanism. Based on these findings, we recommend a standard definition of the LUE model based on radiation absorbed by green vegetation. We also discuss the practical and theoretical implications of using this simple conceptual model on a dynamic biological system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we investigated the potential of spaceborne LiDAR to quantify the effects of forest disturbances caused by typhoons on Hokkaido Island, Japan, after typhoon Songda in 2004. We developed a model to estimate canopy height from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) of the Ice Cloud and land Elevation Satellite. GLAS waveforms are broadened by slopes (\"pulse broadening\"), so we used the lead10 and train10 values (edge extents referring to 10% and 90% of the cumulative energy returned) to correct for this effect, because they were the parameters most strongly correlated with pulse broadening. We developed the estimation model by dividing GLAS data between gentle and steep slopes, using an empirically determined threshold, and obtained a root-mean-square error of 3.5 m for canopy height. We then applied the model to GLAS data in the area damaged by typhoon Songda to estimate changes in canopy height caused by the typhoon. We used a wind damage map produced in a previous study to identify the damage severity. The model showed that canopy height decreased by an average of 2.7 +/- 1.8 m (95% confidence interval) in heavily damaged areas. The canopy height decreased most in coniferous forests, and especially in Japanese larch forests, that they have very shallow roots. We also assessed the geographic factors that most strongly influenced wind damage risk by means of multivariate analysis. We found serious damage in areas with a gentle slope that sustained strong winds. Understory plants and topography type also affected the risk. Our results show that spaceborne LiDAR can be used to quantify the severity of wind damage caused by forest disturbances, thereby providing guidance for forest management. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

However, historical assessment of the global distribution of forest cover and change has been lacking due to obstacles in image acquisition, computational demands, and lack of retrospective reference data for image classification. As limitations of access to imagery and computational power are overcome, the possibility is increased of an automated retrospective classification of forest cover. We used locally fit classification trees to relate hind-cast observations of \"stable pixels\" of forest and non-forest cover from circa-2000 to Landsat spectral measurements taken from the circa-1990 epoch of the Global Land Survey collection of Landsat images. Based on analysis of nearly 30,000 Landsat images, forest-cover change between 1990 and 2000 epochs was detected based on joint probabilities of cover in the two epochs. Assessed across a sample of areas with coincident reference data in the conterminous United States, the resulting maps achieved 93% accuracy for forest cover and 84% for forest-cover change comparable or even higher than many previous national efforts. Global accuracy assessment likewise showed accuracy of 88% for forest-cover change. The maps depict the global distribution of gross gains and losses in forest cover, as well as their net change. The initial analysis showed strong effects of extant land use in temperate regions and land-use change in the tropics over the period, while wildfire dominated in the boreal zone. Regions of high net forest loss (e.g., Amazonia) were associated with land-use changes into agriculture, and regions of high gross gains and losses (e.g., southeastern US, Sweden) were associated with intensive forestry. These results, including the global forest cover and forest cover change datasets, will be a basis for the estimation of the efficacy of policies and analyzing correlation between forest cover change and socio-economic factors.

It demonstrates the pivotal role that satellite remote sensing can play in supplementing in situ monitoring efforts, particularly in the developing world. The study concludes that eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms are widespread in South African water bodies and remain issues of critical concern for water quality.

DAFIS is a unique system that automatically measures the spectro-directional reflectance properties of a semi-arid savanna in the spectral range of 350-1800 nm, daily from sunrise to sunset. The instrumental setup allows studying surface anisotropy for different phenological phases. First data retrieved from the Dahra field spectrometer system show distinctive patterns of spectrally dependent anisotropic behavior: during the rainy season normalized reflectance was highest around solar noon for small off-nadir observation angles but for observations of large off-nadir angles highest values were found in the morning or evening hours (both forward and backward scatter direction). Anisotropy factors corresponding to MODIS, SPOT and SEVIRI red, near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) sensor response functions indicated little influence of the anisotropic behavior for savanna but vegetation indices including red/NIR (NDVI) and NIR/SWIR (SIWSI) were found to be sensitive to the view angle (NDVI and SIWSI varied by 5 and 41 %, respectively). Surprisingly, the influence from differences in shading (analyzed by measurements from forward and backward scatter direction) did not have a noticeable impact on the indices (0.2% and 0.5% difference for NDVI and SIWSI in the backward and forward scatter direction, respectively). The presented data show the large potential of continuous time series collected with the DAFIS system for monitoring of plant spectro-directional behavior in semi-arid African savanna for quantitative evaluation of satellite or airborne remote sensing data or development of new Earth Observation (EO) based indices and algorithms to monitor vegetation status or stress.

In this work we use forest inventory data to parameterize a carbon cycle model to represent post-disturbance carbon trajectories of carbon pools and fluxes for specific forest types growing in high and low site productivity class settings. We then apply these trajectories to landscapes and regions based on forest age distributions derived from either the FIA data or from Landsat time series stacks (1985-2006) for 54 representative scenes throughout most of the conterminous United States. We estimate the net carbon uptake in forests caused by post-disturbance growth and decomposition (\"regrowth sink\") for forested regions across the country. At the landscape scale, the prevailing condition of positive net ecosystem productivity (NEP) is in stark contrast to local patches with large sources, particularly in the west where fires and clear cuts create contiguous disturbed patches. At the continental scale, regional differences in disturbance rates reflect management patterns of high disturbance rates in the Southeastern and South Central states, and lower disturbance rates in the Northeast and Northern Lakes States. Despite low contemporary disturbance rates in the Northeast and Northern Lakes States (0.61 and 0.74% y(-1)), the regrowth sink there remains of moderate to large strength (88 and 57 g C m(-2) y(-1)) owing to the continued legacy from historical clearing. Large regrowth sinks are also found in the Southeast, South Central, and Pacific Southwest regions (85, 86, and 95 g C m(2) y(-1)) where disturbance rates also tend to be higher (1.59, 1.38, and 0.93% y(-1)). Overall, the Landsat-derived disturbance rates are elevated relative to FIA-derived rates (1.19 versus 0.93% y(-1)) particularly for western regions. The differences only modestly adjust regional- and continental-scale carbon budgets, reducing NEP from forest regrowth by about 8%. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This study applied the Gaussian volume model on the daily MODIS/LST products from 2000 to 2012 to derive the UHI centroid in Beijing on a multi-temporal scale. The trajectories indicated that (1) on a diurnal scale during July-September, the daytime and nighttime centroids of the UHI were primarily located in the Xicheng district near the city center, and the mean intensity was from 2.12 to 2.97 degrees C. The daytime centroid was in the south of the nighttime centroid and demonstrated a higher intensity and a larger core area, where Aqua obtains a higher intensity than Terra. The movement of the UHI centroid was also more significant in the north-south direction than in the east-west direction; (2) on a monthly scale, the daytime centroid moved from the northeast to the southwest by (1.85, 2.91) km from July to September, and the intensity varied from 2.16 degrees C (September) to 3.09 degrees C (August), while the nighttime centroid generally moved anticlockwise from January to December, and the intensity varied from 1.98 degrees C (July) to 3.07 degrees C (January); and (3) on an annual scale, the daytime UHI centroid in August and the nighttime UHI centroid moved toward the northeast by (2.15, 131) km and (0.43, 0.89) km, respectively. There was a dramatic change in the UHI prior to 2008, which was most likely caused by the numerous preparation projects for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. Correlation analysis demonstrated that the hot and medium-hot landscapes exhibited positive contributions to the variation of the horizontal location of UHI centroid, and NDVI and albedo showed positive contributions to the variations of daytime (less than 10%) and nighttime (close to 50%) UHI centroids, respectively. Also, we discussed the relationship between Z-dimension of UHI centroid and other UHI indicators, and the impact of missing data. This study presents scientific insights for urban planning and management in Beijing and motivates the investigation of comprehensive changes in UHI of other metropolises worldwide.

Recent autochthonous cases registered in Greece have increased the awareness regarding the threat of malaria re-emergence in Southern Europe. Currently, the presence of competent vectors, suitable environmental conditions and the evidences of a changing climate may increase the widespread re-emergence of malaria in Southern Europe. This work focused on determining the current relationships between environmental factors and the density of the former malaria vector Anopheles atroparvus in Portugal, a previously endemic country. Adult females were sampled and vector density was estimated in 22 sites in Southern Portugal between 2001 and 2010 and related with land cover and satellite-derived air temperature and vegetation indices. The relationship between vector density and local larval habitat, temperature and, in a broader sense, to environmental suitability, was assessed using a statistical modelling approach.   Results showed that present environmental conditions are suitable for vector development at high densities and the spatial and temporal patterns closely resemble the ones registered in the past endemic period. The use of satellite-derived data, together with statistical models, allowed the extrapolation of suitable environmental conditions for vector development from site-level to the Portuguese mainland territory. This work also improved the baseline knowledge needed to understand the potential impacts of future environmental changes on vector density and, indirectly, on the risk of malaria re-emergence.

Photosynthetic systems evolved early in Earth history, providing evidence for the significance of pigments in plant functions. Photosynthetic pigments fill multiple roles from increasing the range of energy captured for photosynthesis to protective functions. Given the importance of pigments to plant functioning, greater effort is needed to determine and quantify the relationship between gross primary production (GPP) and canopy chlorophyll (Chl) content, the main photosynthetic pigment, as well as its proxy, green leaf area index (CIAO, both used as quantitative measures of plant greenness. The objective of this study is to establish relationships for GPP vs. canopy CM content and GPP vs. GLAI in maize. The main focus of the paper is to reveal fine details of the relationships and understand their features in different stages of maize development. Data on GPP, leaf Chl content and GLAI were collected across ten years (2001-2010) at three AmeriFlux sites in Nebraska over irrigated and rainfed maize. Relationships of GPP vs. total canopy Chl content and GPP vs. GLAI were established for vegetative, tasseling and reproductive stages. In each stage, relationships were close with determination coefficients above 0.9; however, the shapes and slopes of the relationships in vegetative stages were different from reproductive stages. This difference was more pronounced for the GPP vs. CIA! relationship. In part, this difference is due to different leaf Chl contents in vegetative and reproductive stages. Smaller but detectable differences in shape and slope were also found for the GPP vs. canopy Chl relationship. Despite the differences in relationships for vegetative and reproductive stages, for the entire growing season, green LAI (GIAI) explained 90% of GPP variation with a coefficient of variation (CV) = 17%, while total canopy Chl content explained more than 92% of GPP variation with CV = 15%. Quantitative characterization of relationships between GPP and such biophysical characteristics as GLAI and canopy Chl content underlines the role of chlorophyll in photosynthesis and has significant implications on remote sensing of primary production.

However, while remote sensing of forest disturbance in general is very well developed, discerning between different types of forest disturbances remains challenging. In this work, we developed an algorithm to separate windfall disturbance from clear-cut harvesting using Landsat data. The method first extracts training data primarily based on Tasseled Cap transformed bands and histogram thresholds with minimal user input. We then used a support-vector machine classifier to separate disturbed areas into \'windfall\' and \'clear-cut harvests\'. We tested our algorithm in the temperate forest zone of European Russia and the southern boreal forest zone of the United States. The forest-cover change classifications were highly accurate (similar to 90%) and windfall classification accuracies were greater than 75% in both study areas. Accuracies were generally higher for larger disturbance patches. At the Russia study site about 60% of all disturbances were caused by windfall, versus 40% at the U.S. study site. Given the similar levels of accuracy in both locations and the ease of application, the algorithm has the potential to fill a research gap in mapping wind disturbance using Landsat data in both temperate and boreal forests that are subject to frequent wind events.

The availability of numerous products creates a need to Understand the level of consistency between products, and reasons for inconsistencies. We evaluate the consistency of six FAPAR products (MODIS, MERIS, SeaWIFS, MODIS-TIP, SPOT-VEG, and AVHRR) across the Australian continent, using multi-year records. We find that seemingly large differences in FAPAR products over much of Australia can be explained by a simple offset present in certain products. Additional inconsistencies arise from different sensitivities in FAPAR to changes in vegetation cover. These inconsistencies can in turn be partially attributed to changes in biome type that are relevant to certain products and related model-specific assumptions.   The satellite FAPAR products are compared to similar to 800 observation-based estimates of fractional vegetation cover at field sites across Australia. After accounting for offsets in FAPAR, relatively high agreement occurs at sites classified as grasslands, shrublands and managed land (agriculture). Significant disagreement occurs at sites correctly classified as forests. Consequently, some products show significant differences in FAPAR between regions of similar vegetation cover but different biome classification. We find that all products show a much lower sensitivity to fractional vegetation cover (range in coefficient of linear regression: 0.28-0.61) than is predicted theoretically (0.96-1.18) using a canopy radiative transfer model. Reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Accurate forest carbon sequestration assessment requires estimation of both forest biomass and forest biomass dynamics over time. Forest dynamics are characterized by disturbances and recovery, key processes affecting site productivity and the forest carbon cycle. Thus, spatially and temporally explicit knowledge of these processes and their drivers are critical for understanding regional carbon cycles. Here, we present a new method that uses satellite data to estimate changes in forest aboveground biomass associated with forest disturbances and recovery at annual time steps. First yearly maps of aboveground biomass between 1985 and 2010 based on Landsat time series and field data were created. Then, we applied a trajectory-based segmentation and fitting algorithm to the yearly biomass maps to reconstruct the forest disturbance and recovery history over the last 25 years.   We tested the method over a coniferous forest region in the Western Carpathian Mountains, which experienced long-term environmental changes. Overall, 55% (similar to 30,700 ha) of the total coniferous forest experienced a loss of biomass over the observation period, while similar to 30% showed severe or complete removal of forest biomass. At the same time, 11.2% of the area was reforested or regenerated on previously damaged forest stands. The total coniferous biomass dropped by 15% between 1985 and 2010, indicating negative balance between the losses and the gains. Disturbance hotspots indicate high insect infestation levels in many areas and reveal strong interactions between biomass loss and climate conditions. Our study demonstrates how spatial and temporal estimates of biomass help to understand regional forest dynamics and derive degradation trends in regard to regional climate change.

Very high resolution (VHR) narrow-band multispectral (10 cm) and thermal (20 cm) imagery was acquired diurnally, in four airborne campaigns conducted over an experimental vineyard site undergoing three different irrigation treatments. Field measurements of leaf stomatal conductance (G(s)) and leaf water potential (Psi(leaf)) were acquired concurrently with the airborne campaigns and compared against the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), a widely accepted, thermal-based indicator of water stress, and against narrow-band multispectral indices calculated from pure-vegetation pixels. The study proposes a new formulation, a normalized PRI (PRInorm), in which the standard PRI index is normalized by an index that is sensitive to canopy structure (Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index, RDVI) and by a red edge index that is sensitive to chlorophyll content (R-700/R-670). The hypothesis investigated is that the new index, calculated as PRInorm = PRI/[RDVI center dot R-700/R-670], not only detects xanthophyll pigment changes as a function of water stress, but also normalizes for the chlorophyll content level and canopy leaf area reduction induced by stress. Results demonstrated that when comparing PRInorm against stomatal conductance (r(2) = 0.79; p <0.001) and leaf water potential (r(2) = 0.77; p < 0.001) measured at midday, the new index performed better than the standard PRI (r(2) = 0.52 and 0.49, respectively). Further, when using the four flights conducted during the diurnal experiment, the relationships with stomatal conductance also showed the superior performance of PRInorm (r(2) = 0.68) as opposed to PRI (r(2) = 0.4). The proposed normalized PRI was highly related (r(2) = 0.75; p <0.001) to the thermal indicator of water stress, CWSI, which was used here as a benchmark. In comparison, the standard PRI index was found to be significantly related to CWSI (p < 0.001), although the relationship was weaker (r(2) = 0.58) than that obtained for PRInorm. In summary, this study demonstrates that PRInorm isolated better than PRI the physiological changes against a changing background of altered pigments and structure, tracking more precisely the diurnal dynamics of the stomatal aperture. Simulations conducted, using leaf and canopy radiative transfer models to elucidate these results, showed that PRInorm is more linearly related to canopy pigment content than the standard PRI, and was more capable of differentiating between stress levels, providing better insight into the results of this diurnal study.

For this purpose, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to all of these types of GRACE-based solutions to extract the corresponding main orthogonal spatial and temporal modes of variability to be compared for 2003-2010. For the first three spatial modes, regional solutions provide a better geographical localization of hydrological structures, especially indicating major surface and groundwater systems of South America. Over hydrological patterns, records of river level versus time are particularly consistent with the GRACE temporal modes, especially for our regional solutions (i.e., correlations generally greater than 0.7). Interannual variations of GRACE-based Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) clearly exhibit the signatures of extreme climatic events as the recent droughts and floods that affected South America. Very significant agreement is also found at interannual time-scale between TWS and discharges in drainage basins dominated by the surface reservoir (more than 0.9 of correlation in the Amazon basin).

Discrimination of different degrees of burn severity is critical to improve management of fire-affected areas. In this work, an unmixing-based methodology was evaluated in three Mediterranean study areas to estimate burn severity from medium spatial resolution optical satellite data. Post-fire Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images were unmixed into four fraction images: non-photosynthetic vegetation and ash (NPV-Ash), green vegetation (GV), soil and shade using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA). MESMA decomposes each pixel using different combinations of potential endmembers, overcoming the Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis limitation of using the same number of endmembers to model all image pixels. Next, a decision tree was used to classify the shade normalized fraction images into four classes: unburned and low, moderate, and high levels of burn severity. Finally, the burn severity estimates were validated using error matrix, producer and user accuracies per class, and K statistic. For reference data, we used 50 plots per class defined from a 50 cm post-fire orthophotography (proportion of dead tree < 50%, low severity; proportion of dead tree between 50 and 90%, moderate severity; and proportion of dead tree > 90%, high severity). MESMA-based burn severity estimates showed a high accuracy (0.80, 0.80, and 0.78) for the three test sites. We conclude that the proposed MESMA based methodology is valid to accurately map burn severity in Mediterranean countries from moderate resolution satellite data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This algorithm is based on an empirical rotation model and was tested on Landsat image pairs over the Cherokee National Forest, Tennessee; Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest, Utah; San Juan National Forest, Colorado; and Sinkyone Wilderness State Park, California. The illumination correction process successfully eliminated correlation between Landsat reflectance and illumination condition. Comparison to forest-change maps derived from uncorrected images showed significant disagreement, ranging from 23% to 45%. Validated against high-resolution (1 m or less) time-serial images, the illumination correction decreased overestimation of forest gains and losses and improved specificity in detection of major forest changes. The overall accuracy increases 34% at the Cherokee Forest site and about 10% at the other three sites. The disagreement rate between change maps from the original and corrected Landsat images increased with increasing terrain inclination angle, with the relationship between illumination condition and the disagreement rate following a V-shaped curve that varied among sites. The lowest disagreement rate occurred when illumination condition was slightly smaller than that of a horizontal field.

This paper proposes a new method for estimating water volume changes in lakes and reservoirs from these four databases in combination with satellite imagery data, without any in-situ measurements and bathymetry maps. Three lakes/reservoirs with different characteristics were studied, i.e. Lake Mead (U.S.A.), Lake Tana (Ethiopia) and Lake IJssel (The Netherlands). Compared to in-situ water levels, satellite altimetry products provided accurate water level variations for Lake Mead and Lake Tana but not for Lake IJssel. The long-term lowest water level in each satellite altimetry database was used as the reference level for water volume estimation. All water levels were converted to the Water Level Above the Lowest Level (WLALL), and the series of Landsat TM/ETM + imagery data were selected to extract corresponding surface areas for establishing area-WLALL relationships. Subsequently, the relationships of the Water Volume Above the Lowest water Level (WVALL) and WLALL were obtained through the analytical integration of area-WLALL relationships. The WVALL-WLALL relationships are site-specific and database-specific and can be used to convert water levels from the four databases directly into water volumes above the identified minimum levels for the same lake. Validation showed that estimated water volumes agreed well with in-situ measurements (R-2 from 0.95 to 0.99) and the root mean square error (RMSE) was within 4.6 to 13.1% of the mean volumes of in-situ measurements.

This question must be addressed before ecosystem managers or policy makers can use the result with confidence for addressing related environmental or natural resource management issues. One means of answering this question is through systematic error propagation analysis. In this study, we analyzed error propagation for detecting inter-annual changes in foliage biomass over Wapusk National Park, Canada. Specifically, we first estimated uncertainties in all input data, including sampling errors in foliage and random errors in AVHRR and Landsat data. Secondly, we evaluated the error propagation from inputs to the remote sensing-derived foliage biomass estimates (including the Landsat-based foliage biomass, AVHRR-derived foliage biomass, and the inter-annual changes in foliage biomass), and determined the threshold of detectable change in foliage biomass. Finally, we investigated approaches that can reduce the threshold. Our results indicated that over Wapusk National Park during 1985-2006, the threshold for a clear-sky AVHRR pixel between two single years was similar to 40% with a confidence level of 84%, and can be reduced to 10% for a land cover class with more than 10 clear-sky AVHRR pixels between two 5-year \"State of Park\" reporting periods.

Particular attention is paid to which gives the most accurate peak accumulation, seasonal SWE changes and first and last dates of snow cover.   SSM/I and AMSR-E are pure earth observation (EO) derived products whilst Globsnow is a combination of EO and ground data. The results suggest that the pure EO products can saturate in deeper snow (SWE> 80-150 mm), can show spurious features during melt and can overestimate SWE due to strong thermal gradients and erroneous forest cover correction factors. Along with the comparison to ground data (only a single point) this suggests that Globsnow is the more accurate product for determining peak accumulation and seasonal SWE cycle.   The snow start and end dates of the three SWE products were compared to an optically derived SCA (MOD10C1, taken as truth) and found to give large errors of snow start date ( root mean square error of 20 + days, though SSM/I was correct on average). The snow end dates had lower errors (a bias of 1-6 days) although the spread was still on the order of three weeks.   During the investigation, occasional abrupt changes in Globsnow were observed (in the v1.0 and v1.2 daily and v1.2 weekly products). These only occurred in around 1% of cases examined and seem to be spurious. Care should be taken to corrector avoid these jumps if using Globsnow to validate land surface models or in an assimilation scheme. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The research area was a pine forest affected by decline processes. Spectral reflectance and pigment content including chlorophylls a and b (Ca + b), carotenoid (Cx + c) and xanthophyll cycle pigments (VAZ) were measured in needles for two consecutive years. The study was conducted using radiative transfer modeling methods and high-resolution airborne imagery acquired at 10 nm FWHM bandwidth. Airborne data consisted of high spatial resolution imagery acquired with a narrow-band multispectral camera on board an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The imagery had 50 cm resolution and six spectral bands in the 500-800 nm range, enabling the identification of pure crowns to obtain the reflectance of individual trees. The indices evaluated were traditional formulations and new simple ratios developed by combining bands sensitive to Cx + c absorption in the 500-600 nm region. The PROSPECT-5 model was coupled with the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model to explore the performance of Cx + c-sensitive vegetation indices at leaf and canopy levels. The sensitivity of these indices to structural effects was assessed to study the potential scaling-up of Cx + c-related vegetation indices on heterogeneous canopies. Coefficients of determination between Cx + c content and narrow-band vegetation indices revealed that traditional indices were highly related with Cx + c content at leaf level (r(2) > 0.90; P<0.001 for the CRI index (1/R-515)-(1/R-550)) but highly affected by structural parameters at crown level (r(2) > 0.44; P<0.001). A new simple-ratio vegetation index proposed in this study (R-515/R-570) was found to be significantly related with Cx + c content both at leaf (r(2) > 0.72: P<0.001) and canopy levels (r(2) > 0.71; P<0.001). Remote sensing cameras on board UAV platforms can provide very high multispectral and hyperspectral imagery for mapping biochemical constituents in heterogeneous forest canopies.

MAIAC uses a time series and spatial analysis for cloud detection, aerosol retrievals and atmospheric correction. It implements a moving window of up to 16 days of MODIS data gridded to 1 km resolution in a selected projection. The RTLS parameters are computed directly by fitting the cloud-free MODIS top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data stored in the processing queue. The RTLS retrieval is applied when the land surface is stable or changes slowly. In case of rapid or large magnitude change (as for instance caused by disturbance), MAIAC follows the MODIS operational BRDF/albedo algorithm and uses a scaling approach where the BRDF shape is assumed stable but its magnitude is adjusted based on the latest single measurement. To assess the stability of the surface, MAIAC features a change detection algorithm which analyzes relative change of reflectance in the Red and NIR bands during the accumulation period. To adjust for the reflectance variability with the sun-observer geometry and allow comparison among different days (view geometries), the BRFs are normalized to the fixed view geometry using the RTLS model. An empirical analysis of MODIS data suggests that the RTLS inversion remains robust when the relative change of geometry-normalized reflectance stays below 15%. This first of two papers introduces the algorithm, a second, companion paper illustrates its potential by analyzing MODIS data over a tropical rainforest and assessing errors and uncertainties of MAIAC compared to conventional MODIS products.

The model is then used to calculate evapotranspiration (ET) using the estimated parameters, atmospheric forcing data (from NLDAS-2) and remotely sensed surface soil moisture (from AMSR-E) and temperature (from AMSR-E and MODIS). By exploiting the statistical relationship between the forcing (e.g., precipitation and radiation) and surface states (soil moisture and temperature), the stationarity-based parameter estimation avoids the restrictive requirements of direct calibration (i.e., the need for ground-truth ET), enabling broad applicability. Modeled annual mean ET rates are compared with benchmark values based on runoff data from Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC), and the root mean square error (RMSE) between them is less than 10 Wm(-2). Spatial patterns of model estimated ET and of key model parameters indicate that radiation and moisture availability are the controlling factors on ET in the study area. The spatial distributions of the estimated parameters appear reasonable: they are smooth and not overly patchy or random; and they are consistent with the land cover and soil moisture distribution through the area. An important feature of the stationarity-based method demonstrated here is that forcing and surface states need not be continuous. In this application, approximately 30% of the daily surface temperature and moisture data were missing. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The RSP is an airborne prototype for the Aerosol Polarimetery Sensor (APS), which was on-board of the NASA Glory satellite. This instrument measures both polarized and total reflectance in 9 spectral channels with central wavelengths ranging from 410 to 2260 nm. The cloud droplet size retrievals use the polarized reflectance in the scattering angle range between 135 degrees and 165 degrees, where they exhibit the sharply defined structure known as the rain- or cloud-bow. The shape of the rainbow is determined mainly by the single scattering properties of cloud particles. This significantly simplifies both forward modeling and inversions, while also substantially reducing uncertainties caused by the aerosol loading and possible presence of undetected clouds nearby. In this study we present the accuracy evaluation of our algorithm based on the results of sensitivity tests performed using realistic simulated cloud radiation fields. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

While flow has frequently been considered as a master variable that controls aquatic biodiversity and species behavior in river floodplains, little is known about thermal heterogeneity and its effect on aquatic biota in complex landscapes. However, quantifying thermal patch dynamics at the river floodplain scale remains a challenging task. In this study, we applied airborne thermal infrared (TIR) imagery to characterize spatial thermal heterogeneity under high (March 2010) and mean (July 2010) flow conditions in a 347.5 ha lowland river floodplain (Oder River, Germany). Concurrently, we electro-fished all major floodplain water bodies (main channel, side channel, and permanently connected ponds) to identify the composition of associated fish assemblages. In addition, we deployed temperature loggers from March to July across the entire range of floodplain water bodies to assess seasonal temperature patterns at 20 min intervals. Under both flow conditions, the TIR imagery revealed a complex mosaic of thermal patches across the floodplain. Cumulative degree-days and average and maximum temperatures were the main variables that thermally differentiated individual water bodies. The water body types delineated based on spatial and seasonal thermal signatures also contained distinct fish assemblages. Distinct temperature gradients at the floodplain scale and both within and across distinct water body types were resolved with airborne thermal data, providing a fully spatial and concurrently available temperature mosaic. A delay in response of fish distribution to a strong thermal gradient recorded in spring, that has never been predicted or observed elsewhere, could be assessed by the use of TIR imagery. This study demonstrates the potential of airborne remotely sensed TIR imagery as a non-invasive method for detecting and quantifying spatial heterogeneity and ecologically relevant temperature gradients in complex landscapes, thereby facilitating the \"up-scaling\" of ecosystem processes to the landscape scale and expanding current understanding of fish behavior.

We incorporate prior information into the multitemporal analysis, as optimized contours are propagated through a sequence of images. We demonstrate the applicability of the method to monitor individual trees and tree groups in two residential areas in the Netherlands using multispectral aerial images acquired over a period of five years. The method allowed the identification of abrupt and gradual tree crown changes in both areas and performed superior to an alternative region growing segmentation approach.

Although experienced observers are a spill response\'s mainstay, few trained observers and confounding factors including weather, oil emulsification, and scene illumination geometry present challenges. DWH spill and impact monitoring was aided by extensive airborne and spaceborne passive and active remote sensing.   Oil slick thickness and oil-to-water emulsion ratios are key spill response parameters for containment/cleanup and were derived quantitatively for thick (>0.1 mm) slicks from AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) data using a spectral library approach based on the shape and depth of near infrared spectral absorption features. MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite, visible-spectrum broadband data of surface-slick modulation of sunglint reflection allowed extrapolation to the total slick. A multispectral expert system used a neural network approach to provide Rapid Response thickness class maps.   Airborne and satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides synoptic data under all-sky conditions; however. SAR generally cannot discriminate thick (> 100 mu m) oil slicks from thin sheens (to 0.1 mu m). The UAVSAR\'s (Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR) significantly greater signal-to-noise ratio and finer spatial resolution allowed successful pattern discrimination related to a combination of oil slick thickness, fractional Surface coverage, and emulsification.   In situ burning and smoke plumes were studied with AVIRIS and corroborated spaceborne CALIPSO (Cloud Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) observations of combustion aerosols. CALIPSO and bathymetry lidar data documented shallow subsurface oil, although ancillary data were required for confirmation.   Airborne hyperspectral, thermal infrared data have nighttime and overcast collection advantages and were collected as well as MODIS thermal data. However, interpretation challenges and a lack of Rapid Response Products prevented significant use. Rapid Response Products were key to response utilization data needs are time critical; thus, a high technological readiness level is critical to operational use of remote sensing products. DWH\'s experience demonstrated that development and operationalization of new spill response remote sensing tools must precede the next major oil spill. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Polarization is studied, and the surface slope probability density function is Gaussian and then non-Gaussian to study the skewness and the kurtosis effects. It is shown that sea surface infrared emissivity is sensitive to the zenith observation angle and the wind direction, and the skewness and the kurtosis effects are significant for grazing directions (with zenith angle > 80 degrees). For Gaussian surfaces, surface emissivity for grazing zenith angles reaches maxima in the up-wind and downwind directions. whereas minima are found in the cross-wind direction. After taking into account the skewness and the kurtosis effects, the surface emissivity has the largest value in the down-wind direction. The analytical results are then compared with measurements, which shows that considering one surface reflection significantly improves the agreement for large zenith angles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

There is a perceived apprehension to use the transform because the derivation methods are diverse, and concern that coefficients are only useful for the images from which they were derived. We address these concerns and outline a workflow for future derivations. First, we ensure greater consistency of future K-T transform derivations by creating an empirical approach to identify scenes most favorable for derivations. This approach can be applied to large data archives and provide a \"first-cut\" criterion for selecting vegetation land cover dominated scenes. The algorithm provides a quantified basis to exclude imagery from a K-T transform derivation because of ill-suited land cover. This empirically derived relationship can be used to sort large imagery archives for vegetation land cover dominated scenes. This \"first-cut\" method still requires the need for an analyst, but the work load is greatly reduced.   Each K-T transform matrix is sensor and data-model specific. For every sensor and data type (e.g., radiance, reflectance, DN), a new transform matrix must be derived. As an example of using the work flow we derive the DN-based Landsat 7 ETM + K-T transform coefficients and show the resulting tasseled-cap space. The proposed process uses the first two dominant eigenvalues which are the roots of the characteristic equations solving the variance-covariance matrix of the spectral data. We have discovered that these quantities are discriminative of the land cover type contained in the scene. Not only can these specific types eigenvalues be used to select appropriate scenes for the K-T transform derivation but can also be included in the image header as a useful parameter in imagery database inquiries. Like cloud cover and image quality flags, the In-lambda1 [In(lambda(1))] and ln-lambda2 [In(lambda(2))] values provide general information about the variability and land cover of the scene.

Satellite remote sensing enables cost-effective and accurate monitoring at frequent time steps over large areas. Yet, generic methods to detect disturbances within newly captured satellite images are lacking. We propose a multi-purpose time-series-based disturbance detection approach that identifies and models stable historical variation to enable change detection within newly acquired data. Satellite image time series of vegetation greenness provide a global record of terrestrial vegetation productivity over the past decades. Here, we assess and demonstrate the method by applying it to (1) simulated time series of vegetation greenness data from satellite data, (2) real-world satellite greenness image time series between February 2000 and July 2011 covering Somalia to detect drought-related vegetation disturbances. First, simulation results illustrate that disturbances are successfully detected in near real-time while being robust to seasonality and noise. Second, major drought-related disturbance corresponding with most drought-stressed regions in Somalia are detected from mid-2010 onwards. The method can analyse in-situ or satellite data time series of biophysical indicators from local to global scale since it is fast, does not depend on thresholds and does not require time series gap filling. While the data and methods used are appropriate for proof-of-concept development of global scale disturbance monitoring, specific applications (e.g., drought or deforestation monitoring) mandate integration within an operational monitoring framework (e.g., http://www.fews.net/).

These images have been invaluable for characterizing and detecting changes in the land cover and land use of the world. Although initially conceived as primarily picture generating sensors, even the early sensors were radiometrically calibrated and spectrally characterized prior to launch and incorporated some capabilities to monitor their radiometric calibration once on orbit. Recently, as the focus of studies has shifted to monitoring Earth surface parameters over significant periods of time, serious attention has been focused toward bringing the data from all these sensors onto a common radiometric scale over this 40-year period. This effort started with the most recent systems and then was extended back in time. Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM)+, the best-characterized sensor of the series prior to launch and once on orbit, and the most stable system to date, was chosen to serve as the reference. The Landsat-7 project was the first of the series to build an image assessment system into its ground system, allowing systematic characterization of its sensors and data. Second, the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) (still operating at the time of the Landsat-7 launch and continues to operate) calibration history was reconstructed based on its internal calibrator, vicarious calibrations, pseudo-invariant sites and a tie to Landsat-7 ETM + at the time of the commissioning of Landsat-7. This process was performed in two iterations: the earlier one relied primarily on the TM internal calibrator. When this was found to have some deficiencies, a revised calibration was based more on pseudo-invariant sites, though the internal calibrator was still used to establish the short-term variations in response due to contaminant build up on the cold focal plane. As time progressed, a capability to monitor the Landsat-5 TM was added to the image assessment system. The Landsat-4 TM, which operated from 1982 to 1992, was the third system to which the radiometric scale was extended. The limited and broken use of the Landsat-4 TM made this analysis more difficult. Eight-day separated image pairs from Landsat-5 combined with analysis of pseudo invariant sites established this history. The fourth and most challenging effort was making the Landsat 1-5 Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS) sensors\' data internally radiometrically consistent. This effort was particularly complicated by the age of the MSS data, varying formats and processing levels in the archive, limited datasets, and limited documentation available. Ultimately, pseudo-invariant sites were identified in North America and used for this effort. Note that most of the Landsat MSS archived data had already been calibrated using the MSS internal calibrators, so this processing was embedded in the result The final effort was developing an absolute scale for Landsat MSS similar to what was already established for the \"TM\" sensors. This was accomplished by using simultaneous data from Landsat-5 MSS and Landsat-5 TM, accounting for spectral differences between the sensors using EO-1 Hyperion data. The recalibrated history of the Landsat data and implications to users are discussed. The key result from this work is a consistently calibrated Landsat data archive that spans nearly 40 years with total uncertainties on the order of 10% or less for most sensors and bands.

A comparison between remotely sensed chlorophyll a (chl a) and sea-surface temperature (SST) with in-situ measurements, reveals the largest bias in areas with rapid and large concentration changes such as at the ice edge, the polar front and in the Ross Sea Polynya. The correlation between fCO(2)sw and SST, chl a, biological productivity estimates and mixed layer depth (MLD) are evaluated, and single and multiple regression methods are used to develop fCO(2)sw algorithms. Single regressions between the study parameters and fCO(2)sw show that most of the fCO(2)sw variability is explained by chl a. The Multi-Parameter Linear regressions were used to create fCO(2)sw algorithms derived from field measurements, and using solely remote-sensing products. Based on the best fits from the two data sets fCO(2)sw estimates have a root means square deviation of +/- 14 mu atm and coefficient of determination of 0.82. The addition of satellite derived estimates of biological productivity in the algorithm does not significantly improve the fit. We use the algorithm with remotely sensed chl a and SST data to produce an fCO2sw map for the entire high-latitude Southern Ocean south of 55 degrees S. We analyze and discuss the seasonal and spatial robustness of the algorithm based on the remotely sensed data and compare with climatologic fCO(2)sw data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, pixel-based classifications utilized fewer variables (15 vs. 300), achieved similar classification accuracies, and required less time to produce than object-based classifications. Object-based classifications produced a visually appealing generalized appearance of land cover classes.

Here, we explore the effect of inter-seasonal spectral variation on the potential for automated classification methods to accurately discern species of trees and lianas from high-resolution spectral data collected at the leaf level at two tropical forest sites. Through the application of a set of data reduction techniques and classification methods to leaf-level spectral data collected at both rainforest and seasonally dry sites in Panama, we found that in all cases the structure and organization of spectrally-derived taxonomies varied substantially between seasons. Using principle component analysis and a non-parametric classifier, we found at both sites that species-level classification was possible with a high level of accuracy within a given season. Classification across season was not, however, with accuracy dropping on average by a factor of 10. This study represents one of the first systematic investigations of leaf-level spectro-temporal variability, an appreciation for which is crucial to the advancement of species classification methods, with broad applications within the environmental sciences.

In this paper, we test the hypothesis if it is possible to scale needle spectral albedo up to shoot spectral albedo using only one structural parameter: the spherically averaged shoot silhouette to total area ratio (STAR). To test the hypothesis, we measured both structural and spectral properties of ten Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) shoots and their needles. Our results indicate that it is possible to upscale from needle to shoot spectral albedo using STAR. The upscaling model performed best in the VIS and SWIR regions, and for shoots with high STAR values. As STAR is linearly related to photon recollision probability, it is also possible to apply the upscaling model as integral part of radiative transfer models. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AATSR LSTs were directly compared with concurrent ground measurements over homogeneous, full-vegetated rice fields in the conventional temperature-based (T-based) method. We also applied the new radiance-based (R-based) method over bare soil and water surfaces, where ground LST measurements were not available. In the R-based method, ground LSTs are simulated from AATSR brightness temperatures in the 11 mu m band and radiative transfer simulations using surface emissivity data and atmospheric water vapor and temperature profiles. The accuracy of the R-based ground LSTs depends on how well the profiles used in simulations represent the actual atmosphere at the time of AATSR observations. This can be checked with the difference delta(T-11-T-12) between the actual AATSR and the profile-based simulated difference in the 11 and 12 mu m brightness temperatures (T-11 and T-12, respectively). We found that for -0.6 K<delta(T-11-T-12)< 0.6 K, the R-based LSTs were accurate within +/- 1.0 K and can be used for LST validation. For the data analyzed here, the AATSR operational algorithm overestimated the ground LST by 2 to 5 K, showing that the auxiliary data utilized within the retrieval scheme (biome classification and fractional vegetation cover maps at 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees resolution) should be improved and provided at the same spatial resolution as the AATSR data (1 km(2)). When the AATSR algorithm was optimized with biome and fractional vegetation cover selected according to the nature of each surface, LST errors showed negligible average biases and rmse = +/- 0.5 K for full vegetation and water, and +/- 1.1 K for bare soil. Furthermore, we checked an alternative algorithm explicitly dependent on emissivity, which provided accurate LSTs for all the surfaces studied, with small biases, rmse from +/- 0.4 to +/- 0.6 K and most LST errors within +/- 1.0 K The algorithm requires monthly emissivity maps at 1 km(2), which can be derived from classification and fractional vegetation cover estimated from optical AATSR data. The results of this paper show the high LST accuracy achievable with AATSR data in ideal conditions. While it is necessary to establish and maintain highly homogeneous T-based validation sites, the R-based method provides an alternative for the semi-operational, long-term evaluation of LST products at global scale, since it is applicable over surfaces with varied LST and atmospheric regimes where ground LST measurements are not feasible.

Imaging spectroscopy has contributed to canopy chemical remote sensing, but efforts to develop general, globally-applicable approaches have been limited by sparse and inconsistent field and laboratory data, and lacking analytical methods. We analyzed leaf hemispherical reflectance and transmittance spectra, along with a 21-chemical portfolio, taken from 6136 fully sunlit humid tropical forest canopies, and developed an up-scaling method using a combination of canopy radiative transfer, chemometric and high-frequency noise modeling. By integrating these steps, we found that the accuracy and precision of multi-chemical remote sensing of tropical forest canopies varies by leaf constituent and wavelength range. Under conditions of varying canopy structure and spectral noise, photosynthetic pigments, water, nitrogen, cellulose, lignin, phenols and leaf mass per area (LMA) are accurately estimated using visible-to-shortwave infrared spectroscopy (VSWIR; 400-2500 nm). Phosphorus and base cations are retrieved with lower yet significant accuracy. We also find that leaf chemical properties are estimated far more consistently, and with much higher precision and accuracy, using the VSWIR range rather than the more common and limited visible to near-infrared range (400-1050 nm; VNIR). While VNIR spectroscopy proved accurate for predicting foliar LMA, photosynthetic pigments and water, VSWIR spectra provided accurate estimates for three times the number of canopy traits. These global results proved to be independent of site conditions, taxonomic composition and phylogenetic history, and thus they should be broadly applicable to multi-chemical mapping of humid tropical forest canopies. The approach developed and tested here paves the way for studies of canopy chemical properties in humid tropical forests using the next generation of airborne and space-based high-fidelity imaging spectrometers.

Such methods should produce information that is consistent across various geographical scales. Airborne scanning Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is among the most promising remote sensing technologies for estimation of forest resource information such as timber volume and biomass, while acquisition of three dimensional data with Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) from space is seen as a relevant option for inventory in the tropics because of its ability to \"see through the clouds\" and its potential for frequent updates at low costs. Based on a stratified probability sample of 201 field survey plots collected in a 960 km(2) boreal forest area in Norway, we demonstrate how total above-ground biomass (AGB) can be estimated at three distinct geographical levels in such a way that the estimates at a smaller level always sum up to the estimate at a larger level. The three levels are (1) a district (the entire study area), (2) a village, local community or estate level, and (3) a stand or patch level. The LiDAR and InSAR data were treated as auxiliary information in the estimation. At the two largest geographical levels model-assisted estimators were employed. A model-based estimation was conducted at the smallest level. Estimates of AGB and corresponding error estimates based on (1) the field sample survey were compared with estimates obtained by using (2) LiDAR and (3) InSAR data as auxiliary information. For the entire study area, the estimates of AGB were 116.0, 101.2, and 111.3 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Corresponding standard error estimates were 3.7, 1.6, and 3.2 Mg ha(-1). At the smallest geographical level (stand) an independent validation on 35 large field plots was carried out. RMSE values of 17.1-17.3 Mg ha(-1) and 42.6-53.2 Mg ha(-1) were found for LiDAR and InSAR, respectively. A time lag of six years between acquisition of InSAR data and field inventory has introduced some errors. Significant differences between estimates and reference values were found, illustrating the risk of using pure model-based methods in the estimation when there is a lack of fit in the models. We conclude that the examined remote sensing techniques can provide biomass estimates with smaller estimated errors than a field-based sample survey. The improvement can be highly significant, especially for LiDAR. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The CAROLS (Cooperative Airborne Radiometer for Ocean and Land Studies) bi-angular (34 degrees-0 degrees) and dual-polarized (V and H) L-band radiometer was designed, built and installed on board the French ATR-42 research aircraft. During springs of 2009 and 2010, soil moisture observations from the SMOSMANIA (Soil Moisture Observing System-Meteorological Automatic Network Integrated Application) network of Meteo-France were complemented by airborne observations of the CAROLS L-band radiometer, following an Atlantic-Mediterranean transect in southwestern France. Additionally to the 12 stations of the SMOSMANIA soil moisture network, in situ measurements were collected in three specific sites within an area representative of a SMOS pixel. Microwave radiometer observations, acquired over southwestern France by the CAROLS instrument were analyzed in order to assess their sensitivity to surface soil moisture (w(g)). A combination of microwave brightness temperature (T(b)) at either two polarizations or two contrasting incidence angles was used to retrieve w(g) through regressed empirical logarithmic equations with good results, depending on the chosen configuration. The regressions derived from the CAROLS measurements were applied to the SMOS T(b) and their retrieval performance was evaluated. The retrievals of w(g) showed significant correlation (p-value < 0.05) with surface measurements for most of the SMOSMANIA stations (8 of 12 stations) and with additional field measurements at two specific sites, also.

The approach differs from other traditional methods (sonar, Lidar, optical inversion, and Radar) but takes advantage of the fast-changing nature of the lake\'s inundation area. On every image, the water/land boundary is effectively a topographic isobath after correction for the water level gradient. Thus, the -10/year carefully selected MODIS images provided incremental topographic isobaths, from which bottom topography was derived every year. Such-derived topographic maps were validated using limited historical data and other consistency checks. Most of the lake bottom showed an elevation of 12 m to 17 m (referenced against the elevation reference of the Woosung Horizontal Zero). Significant inter-annual variability of the bottom topography from 2000 to 2009 was found for some of the lake\'s bottom, with more areas associated with bottom elevation increases than decreases. The changes and inter-annual variability in the bottom topography were attributed to the combined effect of human activities (e.g., sand dredging and levee construction) and weather events. One example was the increased bottom elevation from 2002 to 2003, which was apparently due to the excessive precipitation in 2002 and the impoundment of the Three-Gorges Dam in 2003. The 10-year record of the bottom topography of this highly dynamic lake provides baseline information to monitor the impact of future engineering and management activities, to estimate the lake\'s water and sediment budgets, and to aid ship navigation.

We validate the theory using both tower and space-borne sensors. The concept, originated in Hall et al. (2008), and Hilker et al. (2008a) and is based on two principles: (1) The first derivative of the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) with respect to shadow fraction viewed by the sensor partial derivative PRI/partial derivative alpha(s), is proportional to light-use efficiency c. (2) This behavior can be shown both theoretically and empirically to be independent of vegetation structure and optical properties. These two principles provide the basis for a robust photosynthesis algorithm that can be applied consistently both spatially and temporally. We develop the general theoretical concept using a canopy reflectance model that incorporates a dependence of leaf reflectance on illumination strength, permitting the leaf reflectance at 531 nm to depend on the intensity of photosynthetic down-regulation. Using this model we are able to show that using PRI alone to infer e is confounded by the shadow fraction viewed by a sensor, the PRI value in a non-down-regulated physiological state, and the sunlit canopy reflectance. We are able to demonstrate that these difficulties are mitigated by using partial derivative PRI/partial derivative alpha(s)-not PRI-as the primary measure of canopy level c. We demonstrate our concept using tower and satellite data acquired over three years, in two distinct biomes and vegetation types to show that PRI/partial derivative alpha(s) and c are related by a single function. Building on these ideas we propose the development of a new satellite concept that can utilize a spatially and temporally robust algorithm to map photosynthesis at landscape scales and its temporal variation.

It measures the response of the darkspot reflectance to increased shadow associated with clumped vegetation and is related to leaf area index. Clumping index theoretically declines with increasing woody cover until the tree canopy begins to become uniform. In this study, clumping index is calculated for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer BRDF data for the Australian tropical savanna, the tropical savannas of South America, and the tropical savannas of east, west and southern Africa and compared with site-based measurements of tree canopy cover, and with area-based classifications of land cover. There were differences in sensitivity of clumping index between red and near-infrared reflectance channels, and between savanna systems with markedly different woody vegetation physiognomy. Clumping index was broadly related to foliage cover from historical site data in Australia and in West Africa and Kenya, but not in Southern Africa nor with detailed site-based demographic data in the cerrado of Brazil. However, clumping index decreased with proportion of woody cover in land cover datasets for east Africa, Australia and the Colombian Llanos. There was overlap in the range of clumping index values for forest, cerrado and campo land covers in Brazil. Clumping index was generally negatively correlated with percentage tree cover from the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields product, but regional differences in the relationship were evident. There were large differences in the frequency distributions of clumping index from savanna, woody savanna and grassland land cover classes between global ecoregions. The clumping index shows differing sensitivity to savanna woody cover for red and NIR reflectance, and requires regional calibration for application as a universal indicator. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) is a well established and effective technique to address this mixture problem. SMA models a mixed spectrum as a linear or nonlinear combination of its constituent spectral components or spectral endmembers weighted by their subpixel fractional cover. By model inversion SMA provides subpixel endmember fractions. The lack of ability to account for temporal and spatial variability between and among endmembers has been acknowledged as a major shortcoming of conventional SMA approaches using a linear mixture model with fixed endmembers. Over the past decades numerous efforts have been made to circumvent this issue. This review paper summarizes the available methods and results of endmember variability reduction in SMA. Five basic principles to mitigate endmember variability are identified: (i) the use of multiple endmembers for each component in an iterative mixture analysis cycle, (ii) the selection of a subset of stable spectral features, (iii) the spectral weighting of bands, (iv) spectral signal transformations and (v) the use of radiative transfer models in a mixture analysis. We draw attention to the high complementarities between the different techniques and suggest that an integrated approach is necessary to effectively address endmember variability issues in SMA.

A two-phase classification method is proposed to discriminate the fuel classes of the Prometheus classification system, which is adapted to the ecological characteristics of the European Mediterranean basin. The first step mapped the main fuel groups, namely grass, shrub and tree, as well as non-fuel classes. This phase was carried out using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification combining LiDAR and multispectral data. The overall accuracy of this classification was 92.8% with a kappa coefficient of 0.9. The second phase of the proposed method focused on discriminating additional fuel categories based on vertical information provided by the LiDAR measurements. Decision rules were applied to the output of the SVM classification based on the mean height of LiDAR returns and the vertical distribution of fuels, described by the relative LiDAR point density in different height intervals. The final fuel type classification yielded an overall accuracy of 88.24% with a kappa coefficient of 0.86. Some confusion was observed between fuel types 7 (dense tree cover presenting vertical continuity with understory vegetation) and 5 (trees with less than 30% of shrub cover) in some areas covered by Holm oak, which showed low LiDAR pulses penetration so that the understory vegetation was not correctly sampled.

Due to remoteness of most permafrost areas, monitoring of the land surface temperature (LST) through remote sensing is desirable. However, suitable satellite platforms such as MODIS provide spatial resolutions that cannot resolve the considerable small-scale heterogeneity of the surface conditions characteristic for many permafrost areas. This study investigates the spatial variability of summer surface temperatures of high-arctic tundra on Svalbard, Norway. A thermal imaging system mounted on a mast facilitates continuous monitoring of approximately 100 x 100 m of tundra with a wide variability of different surface covers and soil moisture conditions over the entire summer season from the snow melt until fall. The net radiation is found to be a control parameter for the differences in surface temperature between wet and dry areas. Under clear-sky conditions in July, the differences in surface temperature between wet and dry areas reach up to 10 K. The spatial differences reduce strongly in weekly averages of the surface temperature, which are relevant for the soil temperature evolution of deeper layers. Nevertheless, a considerable variability remains, with maximum differences between wet and dry areas of 3 to 4 K. Furthermore, the pattern of snow patches and snow-free areas during snow melt in July causes even greater differences of more than 10 K in the weekly averages. Towards the end of the summer season, the differences in surface temperature gradually diminish. Due to the pronounced spatial variability in July, the accumulated degree-day totals of the snow-free period can differ by more than 60% throughout the study area. The terrestrial observations from the thermal imaging system are compared to measurements of the land surface temperature from the MODIS sensor. During periods with frequent clear-sky conditions and thus a high density of satellite data, weekly averages calculated from the thermal imaging system and from MODIS LST agree within less than 2 K. Larger deviations occur when prolonged cloudy periods prevent satellite measurements. Furthermore, the employed MODIS L2 LST data set contains a number of strongly biased measurements, which suggest an admixing of cloud top temperatures.   We conclude that a reliable gap filling procedure to moderate the impact of prolonged cloudy periods would be of high value for a future LST-based permafrost monitoring scheme. The occurrence of sustained subpixel variability of the summer surface temperature is a complicating factor, whose impact needs to be assessed further in conjunction with other spatially variable parameters such as the snow cover and soil properties.

The boreal zone contains almost 30% of global forest by area but measurements of forest resources are often outdated. Although past and current spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter data are not optimal for forest-related studies, a multi-temporal combination of individual GSV estimates can improve the retrieval as compared to the single-image case. This feature has been included in a novel GSV retrieval approach, hereafter referred to as the BIOMASAR algorithm. One innovative aspect of the algorithm is its independence from in situ measurements for model training. Model parameter estimates are obtained from central tendency statistics of the backscatter measurements for unvegetated and dense forest areas, which can be selected by means of a continuous tree canopy cover product, such as the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields product. In this paper, the performance of the algorithm has been evaluated using hyper-temporal series of C-band Envisat Advanced SAR (ASAR) images acquired in ScanSAR mode at 100 m and I km pixel size. To assess the robustness of the retrieval approach, study areas in Central Siberia (Russia), Sweden and Quebec (Canada) have been considered. The algorithm validation activities demonstrated that the automatic approach implemented in the BIOMASAR algorithm performed similarly to traditional approaches based on in situ data. The retrieved GSV showed no saturation up to 300 m(3)/ha, which represented almost the entire range of GSV at the study areas. The relative root mean square error (RMSE) was between 34.2% and 48.1% at 1 km pixel size. Larger errors were obtained at 100 m because of local errors in the reference datasets. Averaging GSV estimates over neighboring pixels improved the retrieval statistics substantially. For an aggregation factor of 10 x 10 pixels, the relative RMSE was below 25%, regardless of the original resolution of the SAR data. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

However, appropriate techniques are required to upscale these spatially discrete findings globally. Satellite remote sensing provides unique opportunities in this respect, but remote sensing of the photosynthetic light-use efficiency (epsilon), one of the key components of Gross Primary Production, is challenging. Some progress has been made in recent years using the photochemical reflectance index, a narrow waveband index centered at 531 and 570 nm. The high sensitivity of this index to various extraneous effects such as canopy structure, and the view observer geometry has so far prevented its use at landscape and global scales. One critical aspect of upscaling PRI is the development of generic algorithms to account for structural differences in vegetation. Building on previous work, this study compares the differences in the PRI: epsilon relationship between a coastal Douglas-fir forest located on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and a mature Aspen stand located in central Saskatchewan, Canada. Using continuous, tower-based observations acquired from an automated multi-angular spectro-radiometer (AMSPEC II) installed at each site, we demonstrate that PRI can be used to measure epsilon throughout the vegetation season at the DF-49 stand (r(2)= 0.91, p<0.00) as well as the deciduous site (r(2) = 0.88, p <0.00). It is further shown that this PRI signal can be also observed from space at both sites using daily observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) and a multi-angular implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) (r(2) = 0.54 DF-49; r(2) = 0.63 SOA; p<0.00). By implementing a simple hillshade model derived from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to approximate canopy shadow fractions (alpha(s)), it is further demonstrated that the differences observed in the relationship between PRI and epsilon at DF-49 and SOA can be attributed largely to differences in alpha(s). The findings of this study suggest that algorithms used to separate physiological from extraneous effects in PRI reflectance may be more broadly applicable and portable across these two climatically and structurally different biome types, when the differences in canopy structure are known.

However, spatial patterns in agricultural landscapes vary significantly across the Earth resulting in different imagery requirements depending on what part of the globe is observed. Furthermore, there is an increasing diversity of Earth observation instruments providing imagery with various configurations of spatial, temporal, spectral and angular resolutions. In terms of spatial resolution, the choice of imagery should be conditioned by knowing the appropriate spatial frequency at which the landscape must be sampled with the imaging instrument in order to provide the required information from the targeted fields. This paper presents a conceptual framework to define quantitatively such requirements for both crop area estimation and crop growth monitoring based on user-defined constraints. The methodological development is based on simulating how agricultural landscapes, and more specifically the fields covered by a crop of interest, are seen by instruments with increasingly coarser resolving power. The results are provided not only in terms of acceptable pixel size but also of pixel purity which is the degree of homogeneity with respect to the target crop. This trade-off between size and purity can be adjusted according to the end-user\'s requirements. The method is implemented over various agricultural landscapes with contrasting spatial patterns, demonstrating its operational applicability. This diagnostic approach can be used: (i) to guide users in choosing the most appropriate imagery for their application, (ii) to evaluate the adequacy of existing remote sensing systems for monitoring agriculture in different regions of the world and (iii) to provide guidelines for space agencies to design future instruments dedicated to agriculture monitoring.

Terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) can be used to measure structural and potentially chemical properties of objects by quantifying the x,y,z coordinates and intensity of laser light, respectively, returned from an object\'s surface. The objective of this study was to determine the potential usefulness of TLS with a green (532 nm) laser to simultaneously measure the spatial distribution of chlorophyll a and b content (Chl(ab)), leaf area (LA), and leaf angle (LAN). The TLS measurements were obtained from saplings of two tree species (Quercus macrocarpa and Acer saccharum) and from an angle-adjustable cardboard surface. The green laser return intensity value was strongly correlated with wet-chemically determined Chlab (r(2) = 0.77). Strong agreement was shown between measured and TLS-derived LA (r(2) = 0.95, intercept = 1.43, slope = 0.97). The TLS derived LANs of both species followed a plagiophile LAN distribution, and the measured angles of the cardboard surface allowed us to quantify that these LAN values were strongly correlated with TLS derived angles (r(2) = 1.0, intercept and slope = 0.98). Our results show that terrestrial laser scanners are feasible for simultaneous measurement of LA, LAN, and Chl(ab), in simple canopies of small broadleaved plants. Further research is needed in more complex and larger canopies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Eitel, Jan U.

Marine geophysical products from MODIS-Aqua depend on the efficacy of the atmospheric correction process, which can be problematic in coastal environments. The operational atmospheric correction algorithm for MODIS-Aqua requires an assumption of negligible near-infrared water-leaving radiance, nL(w)(NIR). This assumption progressively degrades with increasing turbidity and, as such, methods exist to account for non-negligible nL(w)(NIR) within the atmospheric correction process or to use alternate radiometric bands where the assumption is satisfied, such as those positioned within shortwave infrared (SWIR) region of the spectrum. We evaluated a decade-long time-series of nL(w)(lambda) from MODIS-Aqua in Chesapeake Bay derived using NIR and SWIR bands for atmospheric correction. Low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) for the SWIR bands of MODIS-Aqua added noise errors to the derived radiances, which produced broad, flat frequency distributions of nL(w)(lambda) relative to those produced using the NIR bands. The SWIR approach produced an increased number of negative nL(w)(lambda) and decreased sample size relative to the NIR approach. Revised vicarious calibration and regional tuning of the scheme to switch between the NIR and SWIR approaches may improve retrievals in Chesapeake Bay, however, poor SNR values for the MODIS-Aqua SWIR bands remain the primary deficiency of the SWIR-based atmospheric correction approach.

The proposed algorithm combines the marked point process, Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. In this paper, the candidates of oil spills or dark spots in a SAR intensity image are characterized by a Poisson marked point process. The marked point process is formed by a group of random points (as a point process modelling the locations of oil spills) and a set of parameters including geometric parameters of windows centred at the random points and gamma distribution parameters (as the marks attaching to each point). As a result, the candidates of oil spills are represented by a group of windows, in which the intensities of pixels follow independent and identical gamma distribution with lower mean than that for the identical gamma distribution of the pixels out of windows. Following the Bayesian paradigm, the posterior distribution, which characterizes the locations and statistical distributions of oil spills, can be obtained up to a normalizing constant. In order to simulate from the posterior distribution and to estimate the parameters of the posterior distribution, the Revisable Jump MCMC (RJMCMC) algorithm is used. The optimal locations and sizes of dark spots are obtained by a maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm. The proposed approach is tested using Radarsat-1 SAR images with oil spills indicated by human analysts. The results show that the proposed approach works well and is very promising.

For most of the Arctic, however, there is no existing baseline inventory of shrub canopy cover, as existing maps of Arctic vegetation provide little information about the density of shrub cover at a moderate spatial resolution across the region. Remotely-sensed fractional shrub canopy maps can provide this necessary baseline inventory of shrub cover. In this study, we compare the accuracy of fractional shrub canopy (>0.5 m tall) maps derived from multi-spectral, multi-angular, and multi-temporal datasets from Landsat imagery at 30 m spatial resolution, Moderate Resolution Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MODIS) imagery at 250 m and 500 m spatial resolution, and MultiAngle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) imagery at 275 m spatial resolution for a 1067 km(2) study area in Arctic Alaska. The study area is centered at 69 degrees N, ranges in elevation from 130 to 770 m, is composed primarily of rolling topography with gentle slopes less than 10, and is free of glaciers and perennial snow cover. Shrubs >0.5 m in height cover 2.9% of the study area and are primarily confined to patches associated with specific landscape features. Reference fractional shrub canopy is determined from in situ shrub canopy measurements and a high spatial resolution IKONOS image swath. Regression tree models are constructed to estimate fractional canopy cover at 250 m using different combinations of input data from Landsat, MODIS, and MISR. Results indicate that multi-spectral data provide substantially more accurate estimates of fractional shrub canopy cover than multi-angular or multi-temporal data. Higher spatial resolution datasets also provide more accurate estimates of fractional shrub canopy cover (aggregated to moderate spatial resolutions) than lower spatial resolution datasets, an expected result for a study area where most shrub cover is concentrated in narrow patches associated with rivers, drainages, and slopes. Including the middle infrared bands available from Landsat and MODIS in the regression tree models (in addition to the four standard visible and near-infrared spectral bands) typically results in a slight boost in accuracy. Including the multi-angular red band data available from MISR in the regression tree models, however, typically boosts accuracy more substantially, resulting in moderate resolution fractional shrub canopy estimates approaching the accuracy of estimates derived from the much higher spatial resolution Landsat sensor. Given the poor availability of snow and cloud-free Landsat scenes in many areas of the Arctic and the promising results demonstrated here by the MISR sensor, MISR may be the best choice for large area fractional shrub canopy mapping in the Alaskan Arctic for the period 2000-2009.

Development intensity zones based on %ISA are defined for each urban area emanating outward from the urban core to the non-urban rural areas nearby and used to stratify sampling for land surface temperatures and NDVI. Sampling is further constrained by biome and elevation to insure objective intercomparisons between zones and between cities in different biomes permitting the definition of hierarchically ordered zones that are consistent across urban areas in different ecological setting and across scales.   We find that ecological context significantly influences the amplitude of summer daytime UHI (urban-rural temperature difference) the largest (8 degrees C average) observed for cities built in biomes dominated by temperate broadleaf and mixed forest. For all cities combined, ISA is the primary driver for increase in temperature explaining 70% of the total variance in LST. On a yearly average, urban areas are substantially warmer than the non-urban fringe by 2.9 degrees C, except for urban areas in biomes with and and semiarid climates. The average amplitude of the UHI is remarkably asymmetric with a 4.3 degrees C temperature difference in summer and only 1.3 degrees C in winter. In desert environments, the LSTs response to ISA presents an uncharacteristic \"U-shaped\" horizontal gradient decreasing from the urban core to the outskirts of the city and then increasing again in the suburban to the rural zones. UHI\'s calculated for these cities point to a possible heat sink effect. These observational results show that the urban heat island amplitude both increases with city size and is seasonally asymmetric for a large number of cities across most biomes. The implications are that for urban areas developed within forested ecosystems the summertime UHI can be quite high relative to the wintertime UHI suggesting that the residential energy consumption required for summer cooling is likely to increase with urban growth within those biomes.

Blister rust, a fungal pathogen, and mountain pine beetle, an insect pest, are two dominant sources of stress and mortality to high-altitude whitebark pine within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). In whitebark pine populations infested with blister rust or mountain pine beetle, the shift from green to red needles at the outer-most branches is an early sign of stress and infestation. In this analysis, we investigated a method that combines field surveys with a remote sensing classification and spatial analysis to differentiate the effects of these two agents of stress and mortality within whitebark pine. Hyperspectral remotely sensed images from the airborne HyMap sensor were classifled to determine the locations of stress and mortality in whitebark pine crowns through sub-pixel mixture-tuned matched-filter analysis in three areas of the GYE in September 2000 and July 2006. Differences in the spatial pattern of blister rust and mountain pine beetle infestation allowed us to separate areas dominated by mountain pine beetle versus blister rust by examining changes in the spatial scale of significant stress and mortality clusters computed by the Ripley\'s K algorithm. At two field sites the distance between clusters of whitebark pine stress and mortality decreased from 2000 to 2006, indicating domination by the patchy spatial pattern of blister rust infestation. At another site, the distance between significant stress and mortality clusters increased from 2000 to 2006, indicating that the contiguous pattern of mountain pine beetle infestation was the primary source of disturbance. Analysis of these spatial stress and mortality patterns derived from remote sensing yields insight to the relative importance of blister rust and mountain pine beetle dynamics in the landscape.

Satellite laser altimetry along repeated ground tracks confirms that regions of high mean backscatter are associated with stationary, tabular icebergs. The altimeter data also provide iceberg freeboard, from which we infer maximum ice draft assuming the lightly-grounded limit and a two-layer density model consistent with a source at Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf. The maximum iceberg draft agrees very well with the ocean depth at a point where the bathymetry is well constrained by ship soundings. However, for an extensive region near 71 degrees S, south of Larsen C Ice Shelf, the maximum grounding depth for several icebergs reveals the ocean to be locally more than 200 m shallower than in bathymetry products. This previously uncharted bank is expected to have a profound effect on the northward flow of the western Weddell Gyre and the cross-slope transport of offshore warm deep water towards the eastern Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves. Passive microwave data also show that sea-ice concentration is reduced in the vicinity of this group of grounded icebergs, indicating an iceberg influence on ocean/atmosphere heat and freshwater exchanges.

At eight sites the brightness temperature (T-b) of the undisturbed snow pack was measured with a multi-frequency dual polarization (6.9, 19, 37, and 89 GHz) ground based radiometer system. The ice lens was then carefully removed and the T(b)s were measured again. The individual V-pol channels and the 37 V - 19 V difference were largely unaffected by the presence of the ice lens, exhibiting a systematic shift of about 3 K. In comparison, the ice lens had a considerable effect on the H-pol T-b at all frequencies, with a mean difference (ice lens present-ice lens removed) of - 9 K (+/- 5.3 K) at 6.9 GHz, - 40 K (+/- 11.3 K) at 19 GHz, - 33 K (+/- 7.6 K) at 37 GHz, and - 19 K (+/- 8.0 K) at 89 GHz. The effect of the ice lens on H-pol measurements was also observed with spaceborne data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) satellite data.   Simulations of T-b were produced for each site using a new two layer formulation of the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) snow emission model. The ice lens was used as the top layer and the underlying snowpack considered as a homogenous second layer. The agreement between observations and simulations was variable, with agreement strongest at 19 GHz. A comparison with simulations produced using the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS) suggests HUT model uncertainty is related not to the ice lens, but to difficulties in simulating emission from deep snow. Overall, the observations and simulations suggest H-poll measurements are capable of detecting new ice layers across the tundra snowpack, while V-pol measurements are more appropriate for snow water equivalent (SWE) retrievals due to their relative insensitivity to ice layers.

This effect should be corrected for through the process of accurate image navigation and orthorectification in order to meet the geolocation accuracy for systematic observations specified by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) requirements for satellite climate data records. We investigated the impact of orthorectification on the accuracy of maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composite data for a mountain region in north-westem Canada at various spatial resolutions (1 km, 4 km, 5 km, and 8 km). Data from AVHRR on board NOAA-11 (1989 and 1990) and NOAA-16 (2001, 2002, and 2003) processed using a system called CAPS (Canadian AVHRR Processing System) for the month of August were considered. Results demonstrate the significant impact of orthorectification on the quality of composite NDVI data in mountainous terrain. Differences between orthorectified and non-orthorectified NDVI composites (ANDVI) adopted both large positive and negative values, with the 1% and 99% percentiles of ANDVI at 1 km resolution spanning values between -0.16<Delta NDVI<0.09. Differences were generally reduced to smaller numbers for coarser resolution data, but systematic positive biases for non-orthorectified composites were obtained at all spatial resolutions, ranging from 0.02 (1 km) to 0.004 (8 km). Analyzing the power spectra of maximum NDVI composites at 1 km resolution, large differences between orthorectified and non-orthorectified AVHRR data were identified at spatial scales between 4 km and 10 km. Validation of NOAA-16 AVHRR NDVI with MODIS NDVI composites revealed higher correlation coefficients (by up to 0.1) for orthorectified composites relative to the non-orthorectified case. Uncertainties due to the AVHRR Global Area Coverage (GAC) sampling scheme introduce an average positive bias of 0.02 +/- 0.03 at maximum NDVI composite level that translates into an average relative bias of 10.6% +/- 19.1 for sparsely vegetated mountain regions. This can at least partially explain the systematic average positive biases we observed relative to our results in AVHRR GAC-based composites from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) and Polar Pathfinder (PPF) datasets (0.19 and 0.05, respectively). With regard to the generation of AVHRR long-term climate data records, results suggest that orthorectification should be an integral part of AVHRR preprocessing, since neglecting the terrain displacement effect may lead to important biases and additional noise in time series at various spatial scales.

Gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP) are routinely derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard satellites Terra and Aqua, and estimates generally agree with independent measurements at validation sites across the globe. However, the accuracy of GPP and NPP estimates in some regions may be limited by the quality of model input variables and heterogeneity at fine spatial scales. We developed new methods for deriving model inputs (i.e., land cover, leaf area, and photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by plant canopies) from airborne laser altimetry (LiDAR) and Quickbird multispectral data at resolutions ranging from about 30 m to 1 km. In addition, LiDAR-derived biomass was used as a means for computing carbon-use efficiency. Spatial variables were used with temporal data from ground-based monitoring stations to compute a six-year GPP and NPP time series for a 3600 ha study site in the Great Lakes region of North America. Model results compared favorably with independent observations from a 400 m flux tower and a process-based ecosystem model (BIOME-BGC), but only after removing vapor pressure deficit as a constraint on photosynthesis from the MODIS global algorithm. Fine-resolution inputs captured more of the spatial variability, but estimates were similar to coarse-resolution data when integrated across the entire landscape. Failure to account for wetlands had little impact on landscape-scale estimates, because vegetation structure, composition, and conversion efficiencies were similar to upland plant communities. Plant productivity estimates were noticeably improved using LiDAR-derived variables, while uncertainties associated with land cover generalizations and wetlands in this largely forested landscape were considered less important.

Lidar remote sensing has been used successfully to estimate live biomass, but studies focusing on dead biomass are rare. We used lidar data, in conjunction with field measurements from 58 plots to distinguish between and map standing live and dead tree biomass in the mixed coniferous forest of the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, USA. Lidar intensity and canopy volume were key variables for estimating live biomass, whereas for dead biomass, lidar intensity alone was critical for accurate estimation. Regression estimates of both live and dead biomass ranged between 0 and 600 Mg ha(-1), with means of 195.08 Mg ha(-1) and 65.73 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Cross validation with field data resulted in correlation coefficients for predicted vs. observed of 0.85 for live biomass (RMSE = 50 Mg ha(-1) and %RMSE (RMSE as a percent of the mean) = 26). For dead biomass, correlation was 0.79, RMSE was 42 Mg ha(-1), and %RMSE was 63. Biomass maps revealed interesting patterns of live and dead standing tree biomass. Live biomass was highest in the ponderosa pine zone, and decreased from south to north through the mixed conifer and spruce-fir forest zones. Dead biomass exhibited a background range of values in these mature forests from zero to 100 Mg ha(-1), with lower values in locations having higher live biomass. In areas with high dead biomass values, live biomass was near zero. These areas were associated with recent wildfires, as indicated by fire maps derived from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity Project (MTBS). Combining our dead biomass maps with the MTBS maps, we demonstrated the complementary power of these two datasets, revealing that MTBS burn intensity class can be described quantitatively in terms of dead biomass. Assuming a background range of dead biomass up to 100 Mg ha(-1), it is possible to estimate and map the contribution to the standing dead tree biomass pool associated with recent wildfire.

Given large and increasing geographic extent of selective logging throughout Amazonia, this phenological disturbance has a potential to impact carbon and water fluxes, nutrient dynamics, and other functional processes in these forests.

The overall goal of this study was to assess the influence of ALS sensor and flight configurations on the ability to detect small trees in the alpine tree line and on the estimation of their heights. The study was conducted in a sub-alpine/alpine environment in southeast Norway. 342 small trees (0.11-5.20 m tall) of Norway spruce, Scots pine, and downy birch were precisely georeferenced and measured in field. ALS data acquired with two different instruments and at different flying altitudes (700-1130 m a.g.l.) with different pulse repetition frequencies (100, 125, and 166 kHz) were collected with a point density of all echoes of 7.7-11.0 m(-2). For each acquisition, three different terrain models were used to process the ALS point clouds in order to assess the effects of different preprocessing parameters on the ability to detect small trees. Regardless of acquisition and terrain model, positive height values were found for 91% of the taller trees (>1 m). For smaller trees (<1 m), 29-61% of the trees displayed positive height values. For the lowest repetition frequencies (100 and 125 kHz) in particular, the portion of trees with positive laser height values increased significantly with increasing terrain smoothing. For the highest repetition frequency there were no differences between smoothing levels, likely because of large ALS measurement errors at low laser pulse energy levels causing a large portion of the laser echoes to be discarded during terrain modeling. Error analysis revealed large commission errors when detecting small trees. The commissions consisted of objects like terrain structures, rocks, and hummocks having positive height values. The magnitude of commissions ranged from 709 to 8948% of the true tree numbers and tended to increase with increasing levels of terrain smoothing and with acquisitions according to increasing point densities. The accuracy of tree height derived from the ALS data indicated a systematic underestimation of true tree height by 0.35 to 1.47 m. depending on acquisition, terrain model, and tree species. The underestimation also increased with increasing tree height. The standard deviation for the differences between laser-derived and field-measured tree heights was 0.16-0.57 m. Because there are significant effects of sensor and flight configurations on tree height estimation, field calibration of tree heights at each point of time is required when using airborne lasers for tree growth monitoring.

The impetus for the development of imaging spectrometry came in the 1970\'s from field spectral measurements in support of Landsat-1 data analysis. Progress required developments in electronics, computing and software throughout the 1980\'s and into the 1990\'s before a larger segment of the Earth observation community would embrace the technique. The hardware development took place at NASA/JPL beginning with the Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (AIS) in 1983. The airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) followed in 1987 and has proved to this day to be the prime provider of high-quality hyperspectral data for the scientific community. Other critical elements for the exploitation of this data source have been software, primarily ENVI, and field spectrometers such as those produced by Analytical Spectral Devices Inc. In addition, atmospheric correction algorithms have made it possible to reduce sensor radiance to spectral reflectance, the quantity required in all remote sensing applications. The applications cover the gambit of disciplines in Earth observations of the land and water. The further exploitation of hyperspectral imaging on a global basis awaits the launch of a high performance imaging spectrometer and more researchers with sufficient resources to take advantage of the vast information content inherent in the data.

Hence, land use and land cover changes in surrounding areas may substantially influence the natural resources within parks. The US National Park Service has recognized these threats and incorporated land use and land cover monitoring into its Inventory and Monitoring Program. The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework based on a conceptual approach for planning and implementing monitoring within this Program. We present a conceptual model, based on ecological theory, which illustrates how land use and land cover change impact park resources, and helps to identify monitoring indicators that will measure relevant attributes of land use and land cover change. We also discuss potential sources of data for quantifying indicators of land use and land cover change over time, including remote sensing data and ancillary spatial datasets. Finally, we describe steps for analyzing monitoring data so that the intensity and direction of changes in land use and land cover over time are quantified, as well as trends in the status of important park resources impacted by these changes. Integration of land use and land cover monitoring data and park resource data will allow for analysis of change from past to present, and can be used to project trends into the future to provide knowledge about potential land use and land cover change scenarios and ecological impacts. We illustrate our monitoring approach with an example from the Inventory and Monitoring Program\'s Greater Yellowstone Network. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

It is shown that remote sensing allows detection of spatial-temporal patterns of snow cover across large areas in inaccessible terrain, providing useful information on a critical component of the hydrological cycle. Results show large variation in snow cover between years while an increasing trend from west to east is observed. Of all river basins the Indus basin is, for its water resources, most dependent on snow and ice melt and large parts are snow covered for prolonged periods of the year. A significant negative winter snow cover trend was identified for the upper Indus basin. For this basin a hydrological model is used and forced with remotely sensed derived precipitation and snow cover. The model is calibrated using daily discharges from 2000 to 2005 and stream flow in the upper Indus basin can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy. From the analysis it is concluded that there are indications that regional warming is affecting the hydrology of the upper Indus basin due to accelerated glacial melting during the simulation period. This warming may be associated with global changes in air temperature resulting from anthropogenic forcings. This conclusion is primarily based on the observation that the average annual precipitation over a five year period is less than the observed stream flow and supported by positive temperature trends in all seasons.

The method uses an image fusion algorithm to produce snow maps at an improved 250 m spatial resolution in addition to the 500 m resolution snow maps. An iterative approach is used to correct imagery for both atmospheric and topographic effects using daily observations of atmospheric parameters. The computation of ground spectral reflectance enabled the use of image-independent end-members in a constrained linear unmixing technique to achieve a robust estimation of subpixel snow fractions. The accuracy of the snow maps and performance of the algorithm were assessed carefully using eight pairs of synchronic MODIS/ASTER images. \'Pixel-based\' metrics showed that subpixel snow fractions were retrieved with a Mean Absolute Error of 6.8% at 250 m spatial resolution and 5.1% after aggregation at 500 m spatial resolution. In addition, a \'feature-based\' metric showed that 90% of the snowlines were depicted generally within 300 m and 200 m of their correct position for the 500-m and 250-m spatial resolution snow maps, respectively. A dataset of 679 maps of subpixel snow fraction was produced for the period from February 2000 to May 2007. These repeated observations of the seasonal snow cover will benefit the ongoing effort to model snowmelt runoff in the region and to improve the estimation and management of water resources.

Such analyses do not perform well on landscapes with low topographic relief (e.g., floodplains, river deltas, coastal wetlands, and estuaries) where surface water flow is influenced by subtle topographic depressions and may be bidirectional, divergent, and spatially dynamic in response to hydrologic forcing such as tides or variation in river discharge. We developed a framework for hydrologic analysis of low-relief landscapes using a high-resolution (1 m) DEM derived from light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data collected over a -8.8 km(2) section of the Umatilla River Floodplain, Oregon, USA. Our approach assessed the pattern and characteristics of \"hydrologic facets\" (landscape patches that have high internal surface water connectivity and therefore function as a single hydrologic unit), where facet boundaries were defined by subtle topographic divides across the floodplain. We initially identified nearly 6000 small (fine-scale) hydrologic facets using standard GIS processing algorithms. We located the divide between each pair of adjacent facets, and determined \"hydrologic impedance\" (i.e., the maximum change in river stage necessary to inundate the divide) for each divide (n = -17,000). Using hydrologic impedance values, we analyzed patterns of surface water connectivity among the fine-scale facets and aggregated groups of adjacent facets that had high connectivity. This process yielded a reduced number of larger facets useful for hydrologic analysis at coarser spatial scales. We compared results derived using several alternate rule sets for aggregating facets. With appropriate aggregation rules, the results are useful for generating optimal link-and-node flow networks to support hydrologic modeling of surface water flux across low-relief landscapes.

This study evaluated the feasibility to detect L. conchilega reefs by very-high resolution side-scan sonar imagery. A subtidal very-high resolution (410 kHz) side-scan survey, combined with grab sampling, revealed high densities of L. conchilega (up to 1979 ind. m(-2)) to coincide with a higher reflectivity, patchy and grainy acoustic facies. From the side-scan sonar imagery, individual reefs were estimated to reach a maximum size of 15 m(2). To ground truth the acoustic facies, the distribution of intertidal L. conchilega reefs was mapped at low tide and side-scan sonar imagery was recorded during the following high tide. Intertidal L. conchilega reefs had a patch size of 0.8 m(2) up to 11.6 m(2), elevated 7.5 to 11.5 cm above the surrounding seafloor and covered approximately 10% of the selected area. The very-high (445 kHz) resolution side-scan sonar imagery revealed a similar acoustic facies as in the subtidal. Lower-resolution (132 kHz) side-scan sonar imagery was less efficient to detect physically less developed L. conchilega reefs. We conclude that (1) there are no major technical restrictions to map L. conchilega reefs using side-scan sonar, (2) the developmental stage of L. conchilega reefs impacts the detectability of the reefs, and (3) very-high resolution side-scan sonar imagery is considered a necessity when mapping small-scale structures, such as L. conchilega reefs.

Semi-arid landscapes present a particular challenge to satellite remote sensing validation using traditional techniques because of the high spatial variability and potentially rapid rates of temporal change in moisture conditions. In this study, temporal stability analysis and spatial sampling techniques are used to investigate the representativeness of ground observations at satellite scale soil moisture in a semi-arid watershed for a long study period (March 1, 2002 to September 13, 2005). The watershed utilized, the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed, has a dense network of 19 soil moisture sensors, distributed over a 150 km(2) study region. In conjunction with this monitoring network, intensive gravimetric soil moisture sampling conducted as part of the Soil Moisture Experiment in 2004 (SMEX04), contributed to the calibration of the network for large-scale estimation during the North American Monsoon System (NAMS). The sensor network is shown to be an excellent estimator of the watershed average with an accuracy of approximately 0.01 m(3)/m(3) soil moisture. However, temporal stability analysis indicated that while much of the network is stable, the soil moisture spatial pattern, as represented by mean relative difference, is not replicated by the network mean relative difference pattern. Rather, the network is composed of statistical samples. Geophysical aspects of the watershed, including topography and soil type are also examined for their influence on the soil moisture variability and stability. Soil type, as characterized by bulk density, clay and sand content, was responsible for nearly 50% of the temporal stability. Topographic effects were less important in defining representativeness and stability.

However, the accuracy with which this can be achieved is highly dependent on the sensor configuration and the structural characteristics of the forest examined. As a result, there is a need to understand laser light interactions with forest canopies so that LiDAR sensor configurations can be optimised to assess particular forest types. Such optimisation will not only ensure the targeted forest attributes can be accurately and consistently quantified, but may also minimise the cost of data acquisition and indicate when a survey configuration will not deliver information needs.   In this paper, we detail the development and application of a model to simulate laser interactions within forested environments. The developed model, known as the LiDAR Interception and Tree Environment (LITE) model, utilises a range of structural configurations to simulate trees with variable heights, crown dimensions and foliage clumping. We developed and validated the LITE model using field data obtained from three forested sites covering a range of structural classes. Model simulations were then compared to coincident airborne LiDAR data collected over the same sites. Results indicate that the LITE model can be used to produce comparable estimates of maximum height of trees within plots (differences <2.42 m), mean heights of first return data (differences <2.27 m), and canopy height percentiles (r(2) =0.94, p<0.001) when compared to airborne LiDAR data. In addition, the distribution of airborne LiDAR hits through the canopy profile was closely matched by model predictions across the range of sites. Importantly,, this demonstrates that the structural differences between forest stands can be characterised by LITE. Models that are capable of interpreting the response of small-footprint LiDAR waveforms can facilitate algorithm development, the generation of corrections for actual LiDAR data, and the optimisation of sensor configurations for differing forest types, benefiting a range of experimental and commercial LiDAR applications. As a result, we also performed a scenario analysis to demonstrate how differences in forest structure, terrain, and sensor configuration can influence the interception of LiDAR beams.

Much of this popularity may be attributed to the non-parametric, multivariate features of the technique, its intuitiveness, and its ease of use. When used with satellite imagery and forest inventory plot data, the technique has been shown to produce useful estimates of many forest attributes including forest/non-forest, volume, and basal area. However, variance estimators for quantifying the uncertainty of means or sums of k-NN pixel-level predictions for areas of interest (AOI) consisting of multiple pixels have not been reported. The primary objectives of the study were to derive variance estimators for AOI estimates obtained from k-NN predictions and to compare precision estimates resulting from different approaches to k-NN prediction and different interpretations of those predictions. The approaches were illustrated by estimating proportion forest area, tree volume per unit area, tree basal area per unit area, and tree density per unit area for 10-km AOIs. Estimates obtained using k-NN approaches and traditional inventory approaches were compared and found to be similar. Further, variance estimates based on different interpretations of k-NN predictions were similar. The results facilitate small area estimation and simultaneous and consistent mapping and estimation of multiple forest attributes.

In particular, since plant species richness is a fundamental indicator of biodiversity at the community and regional scales, attempts were made to predict species richness (spatial heterogeneity) by means of spectral heterogeneity. The possibility of using spectral variance of satellite images for predicting species richness is known as Spectral Variation Hypothesis. However, when using remotely sensed data, researchers are limited to specific scales of investigation. This paper aims to investigate the effects of scale (both as spatial and spectral resolution) when searching for a relation between spectral and spatial (related to plant species richness) heterogeneity, by using satellite data with different spatial and spectral resolution. Species composition was sampled within square plots of 100 m(2) nested in macroplots of 10,000 m(2). Spectral heterogeneity of each macroplot was calculated using satellite images with different spatial and spectral resolution: a Quickbird multispectral image (4 bands, spatial resolution of 3 m), an Aster multispectral image (first 9 bands used, spatial resolution of 15 m for bands 1 to 3 and 30 m for bands 4 to 9), an ortho-Landsat ETM+ multispectral image (bands 1 to 5 and band 7 used; spatial resolution, 30 m), a resampled 60 m Landsat ETM+ image. Quickbird image heterogeneity showed a statistically highly significant correlation with species richness (r=0.69) while coarse resolution images showed contrasting results (r=0.43, r=0.67, and r=0.69 considering the Aster, Landsat ETM+, and the resampled 60 m Landsat ETM+ images respectively). It should be stressed that spectral variability is scene and sensor dependent. Considering coarser spatial resolution images, in such a case even using SWIR Aster bands (i.e. the additional spectral information with respect to Quickbird image) such an image showed a very low power in catching spectral and thus spatial variability with respect to Landsat ETM+ imagery. Obviously coarser resolution data tend to have mixed pixel problems and hence less sensitive to spatial complexity. Thus, one might argue that using a finer pixel dimension should inevitably result in a higher level of detail. On the other hand, the spectral response from different land-cover features (and thus different species) in images with higher spectral resolution should exhibit higher complexity. Spectral Variation Hypothesis could be a basis for improving sampling designs and strategies for species inventory fieldwork. However, researchers must be aware on scale effects when measuring spectral (and thus spatial) heterogeneity and relating it to field data, hence considering the concept of scale not only related to a spatial framework but even to a spectral one.

This is an ill-posed problem due to nonuniqueness of the solution and the instability induced by error/noise and small singular values of the linearized system or the linear BRDF model. A robust inversion algorithm is critical for the BRDF/albedo retrieval from the limited number of satellite observations. We propose a promising algorithm for resolving this kind of ill-posed problem encountered in BRDF model inversion using remote sensing data.   New techniques for robust estimation of BRDF model parameters are needed to cope with the scarcity of the number of observations. We are reminded by Cornelius Lanczos\' dictum: \"Lack of information cannot be remedied by mathematical trickery.\" Thus identifying a priori information or appropriate constraints, and the embedding of the information or constraints into the regularization algorithm, are pivotal elements of a retrieval algorithm. We develop a regularization method, which is called the numerically truncated singular value decomposition (NTSVD). The method is based on the spectrum of the linear driven kernel, and the a priori information/constraint is based on the minimization of the l(2) norm of the parameters vector. The regularization algorithm is tested using field data as well as satellite data. Numerical experiments with a subset of measurements for each site demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm.

Many existing tree crown delineation algorithms require a set of seed pixels to start the process of image segmentation. In this study, different methods of obtaining seed pixels (semi-) automatically from orthophotos and digital surface models derived from stereo digital camera imagery are tested and compared. The UltracamD digital camera provides images with a stereo overlap of about 90% and this paper presents a new method of DSM generation based on multiple stereo pairs. The evaluation of the DSMs shows that by using a multiple image approach, also referred to as block-based approach, the quality is significantly increased: the mean difference between the estimated values and 356 measured upper layer tree heights is only 0.77 m with a standard deviation of 2.39 m.   In terms of seed generation, the morph algorithm (2d) used in this paper detected 64% of the trees visible in the aerial photos with an error margin of around 25% both for commission and omission in a dense natural forest. The orthophoto-based local maximum approach generally yielded lower accuracies and more multiple hits than the morph algorithm. 3d seed generation from the block based model returned about 70% correct hits for the upper tree canopy layer. All evaluations are performed based on field measurements and visual aerial photo interpretation. Furthermore, the dependence of successful tree detection on the dominance of a tree within the stand is analyzed. As expected, suppressed trees are more likely to be omitted. The segmentation proved to be useful, as the automatically generated segments had a similar number of correct hits as achieved by visual interpretation, with the only drawback being a higher error of commission.

The applicability of kNN could be enhanced if adjacent images of different acquisition dates could be used in the same estimation procedure. Relative radiometric calibration is a prerequisite for this. This study focuses on two empirical calibration methods. They are tested on adjacent LANDSAT TM scenes in Austria. The first, quite conventional one is based on radiometric control points in the overlap area of two images and on the determination of transformation parameters by linear regression. The other, recently developed method exploits the kNN-cross-validation procedure. Performance and applicability of both methods as well as the impact of phenology are discussed.

Remotely sensed hyperspectral imagery has the potential to provide important information about fine-scale ground cover components that are indicative of burn severity after large wildland fires. Airborne hyperspectral imagery and ground data were collected after the 2002 Hayman Fire in Colorado to assess the application of high resolution imagery for burn severity mapping and to compare it to standard burn severity mapping methods. Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF), a partial spectral unmixing algorithm, was used to identify the spectral abundance of ash, soil, and scorched and green vegetation in the burned area. The overall performance of the MTMF for predicting the ground cover components was satisfactory (r(2) = 0.21 to 0.48) based on a comparison to fractional ash, soil, and vegetation cover measured on ground validation plots. The relationship between Landsat-derived differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) values and the ground data was also evaluated (r(2) -0.20 to 0.58) and found to be comparable to the MTMF. However, the quantitative information provided by the fine-scale hyperspectral imagery makes it possible to more accurately assess the effects of the fire on the soil surface by identifying discrete ground cover characteristics. These surface effects, especially soil and ash cover and the lack of any remaining vegetative cover, directly relate to potential postfire watershed response processes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Surface characteristics of the ice sheet margins are strongly modified by the annual process of snow accumulation and melt. In this work, we explore spatial and temporal relationships between near-infrared albedo and surface roughness from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) aboard NASA\'s Terra satellite. Our study area is a region in western Greenland in the vicinity of Jakobshavn Glacier and its upland drainage basin. We compute near-infrared albedo from MISR data using imagery over the April to September period for 2000 through 2005. Near-infrared albedo is inversely related to both snow age and melt intensity. We map surface roughness using the Normalized Difference Angular Index (NDAI) applied to MISR atmospherically corrected surface hemispherical-directional reflectance. In previous work, the NDAI has been correlated with surface roughness on the scale of about 70 m. We have further substantiated that relationship here. The NDAI and albedo images for each of the six years are used in an ISODATA unsupervised classification. Classification results for the individual years show year-to-year differences, which appear to depend on the number and temporal distribution of images with minimal cloud cover as well as interannual differences in ice sheet surface properties. The year 2003, which had the greatest number of images with minimal cloud cover, shows good correspondence with previously mapped glacier zones. However, we do not have an ISODATA class that corresponds to the dry-snow zone and we see greater differentiation between zones at lower elevations. Within each ISODATA class, distinct relationships between near-infrared albedo and surface roughness emerge and in all cases but one there is an inverse temporal relationship between albedo and roughness. The one class that shows a direct relationship between albedo and surface roughness is hypothesized to be the superimposed-ice zone. While still somewhat preliminary, these results suggest that concurrent measurements of near-infrared albedo and surface roughness have significant potential for ice sheet surface characterization as well as for ongoing monitoring.

While nadir-viewing passive multispectral sensors have limited utility for characterizing the full dimensionality of forest canopies, multi-angle remote sensors such as the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) may improve detection of canopy architecture, canopy cover, and leaf area index (LAI) of forest canopy versus understory vegetation. Our objective was to determine whether data from the MISR sensor could improve estimates of LAI across a post-fire ponderosa pine forest located in the Black Hills of South Dakota. We measured LAI during the 2002 and 2003 growing seasons and created continuous LAI maps using Landsat TM and ETM+ data (mean R-2=0.81). We fit linear regression models of total and canopy LAI, using a series of MISR at-nadir and off-nadir or anisotropic vegetation indices as predictor variables, for each of five sampling periods. We found the best LAI model fits using either a new hotspot-adjusted normalized difference vegetation index, NDVIHS, NDVI calculated from the -60 degrees view angle, or NDVI at-nadir and either the Hotspot-DarkSpot Index (RDS) or the normalized difference anisotrophic index (NDAX) (R-2 = 0.56-0.91). However, differences in fits of these best models and those including NDVI at-nadir ranged from only 1 to 8%. Reflectance anisotropy patterns related strongly to understory vegetation phenology. We found that the relationships among NDVI or the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and canopy or total LAI showed little variation across view angles when the understory vegetation was senesced and significant anisotropy when understory green LAI was greatest. These findings demonstrate the value of multi-temporal measurements during periods of understory phenological change, even if the overstory LAI is relatively stable. We also evaluated the performance of the MISR LAI product and found moderate fits between the MISR LAI and our field- and Landsat-derived canopy LAI (R-2 =0.21-0.44). (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

For illustration purposes, we focus on the estimation of chlorophyll-a concentrations from remote sensing reflectance just above the ocean surface. A variety of bio-optical algorithms have been developed to relate measurements of ocean radiance to in situ concentrations of phytoplankton pigments, and ultimately most of these algorithms demonstrate the potential of quantifying chlorophyll-a concentrations accurately from multispectral satellite ocean color data. Both satellite-derived data and in situ measurements are subject to high levels of uncertainty. In this context, robust and stable non-linear regression methods that provide inverse models are desirable.   Lately, the use of the support vector regression (SVR) has produced good results in inversion problems, improving state-of-the-art neural networks. However, the SVR has some deficiencies, which could be theoretically alleviated by the RVM. In this paper, performance of the RVM is evaluated in terms of accuracy and bias of the estimations, sparseness of the solutions, robustness to low number of training samples, and computational burden. In addition, some theoretical issues are discussed, such as the sensitivity to training parameters setting, kernel selection, and confidence intervals on the predictions.   Results suggest that RVMs offer an excellent trade-off between accuracy and sparsity of the solution, and become less sensitive to the selection of the free parameters.

Yet current efforts to characterize phenological processes are limited by remote sensing challenges and lack of uncertainty estimates. Here, for a global distribution of phenologically and climatically similar phenoregions, we used the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer to develop a conceptually and computationally simple technique for real-time and forecast applications. Our overall approach was to analyze the phenological behavior of groups of pixels without recourse to smoothing or fitting. We used a 3-step initial process: (1) define a phenoregion specific normalized difference vegetation index threshold; (2) for all days from 19822003, calculate the percent of pixels above the threshold (PAT); (3) calculate daily 1982-2003 empirical distributions of PAT. For real-time monitoring, the current PAT may then be compared to the historical range of variability and visualized in relation to user-defined levels. Using similar concepts, we projected daily PAT up to one month in the future and compared predicted and actual dates at which a hypothetical PAT was reached. We found that the maximum lead-time of phenological forecasts could be analytically defined for user-specified uncertainty levels. The approach is adaptable to different remote sensing technologies and provides a foundation for ascribing a sequence of ground conditions (e.g. snowmelt, vegetative growth, pollen production, insect phenology) to remotely sensed land surface phenology observations.

Aircraft observations were collected using a new version of the Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer (PSR) that provided four C band and four X band frequencies. Observations were also available from the Aqua satellite Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) at these same frequencies. SMEX02 was conducted over a three-week period during the summer near Ames, Iowa. Corn and soybeans dominate the region. During the study period the corn was approaching its peak water content state and the soybeans were at the mid point of the growth cycle. Aircraft observations are compared to ground observations. Subsequently models are developed to describe the effects of corn and soybeans on soil moisture retrieval. Multiple altitude aircraft brightness temperatures were compared to AMSR-E observations to understand brightness temperature scaling and provide validation. The X-band observations from the two sensors were in reasonable agreement. The AMSR-E C-band observations were contaminated with anthropogenic RFI, which made comparison to the PSR invalid. Aircraft data along with ancillary data were used in a retrieval algorithm to map soil moisture. The PSR estimated soil moisture retrievals on a field-by-field comparison had a standard error of estimate (SEE) of 5.5%. The error reduced when high altitude soil moisture estimates were aggregated to 25 km resolution (same as AMSR-E EASE grid product resolution) (SEE similar to 2.85%). These soil moisture products provide a validation of the AMSR retrievals. PSR/CX soil moisture images show spatial and temporal patterns consistent with meteorological and soil conditions. The dynamic range of the PSR/CX observations indicates that reasonable soil moisture estimates can be obtained from AMSR, even in areas of high vegetation biomass content (similar to 4-8 kg/m2).

One class of particular interest is agriculture as area estimates of cultivated lands are important for purposes such as estimating yields or irrigation needs. The synoptic coverage of satellite imagery and the relative ease of automated analysis have led to widespread mapping of agriculture using remote sensing. The accuracy of area estimates derived from these maps is known to be related to the accuracy of the maps. However, even in the situation where the map is very accurate, errors in area estimates may occur. These errors result from the behavior of the distribution of subpixel proportions of cultivated areas, and how that behavior changes as a result of sensor spatial resolution and class definitions. The sensitivity of estimates of cultivated areas to sensor spatial resolution and to the choice of threshold used to define cultivated land is explored in six agriculturally distinct locations around the world. Using a beta model for the distribution of subpixel proportions that is parameterized using variograms, it is possible to model the distribution of subpixel proportions for any spatial resolution. When the spatial resolution is small with respect to the spatial structure of the landscape (as measured by the variogram range) use of any class definition threshold produces an estimate very close to the true area coverage. On the other hand, as the resolution becomes coarse in relation to the variogram range, the subpixel proportions are no longer concentrated at the extremes of the distribution and the difference between the estimated and the true area has greater sensitivity to the selected threshold used to define classes. Thus, for the cases examined here, both the resolution and the class definition threshold have a strong influence on area estimates. The spatial resolutions where errors can be large depend on landscape spatial structure, which can be quantified using variograms. The net effect is that for the same spatial resolution, some places will exhibit much larger errors in area estimates than others. For the site in the Anhui province of China, where agricultural fields are very small (0.07 ha on the average), area estimates are highly sensitive to class definition thresholds even at the relatively fine resolution of 45 in. Conversely, in California (USA) spatial resolutions as coarse as 500 m can be used to reliably estimate cultivated areas. Results also suggest that the proportion of the total area that is cultivated significantly influences the accuracy of area estimates. When the area proportion is low, the class definition threshold must also be low to achieve an accurate area estimate. Conversely, in areas dominated by agriculture, a very stringent class definition of cultivated lands is required for accurate area estimates. While explored in the context of estimation of cultivated areas, the findings presented here are generic to the problem of area estimation using remote sensing. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Within the context of the preparation of SMOS activities over land, a field campaign, SMOSREX (Surface Monitoring Of the Soil Reservoir EXperiment), has been in operation since January 2001 in Mauzac, near Toulouse in France. Continuous ground measurements of meteorological variables, soil moisture and temperature profiles have been taken over bare soil and a grass plot left fallow. Since January 2003, SMOSREX has been providing accurate field measurements of dual polarized L-band brightness temperature up-welling from both bare soil and fallow plots, together with multi-spectral (from visible to infrared frequencies) remote sensing surface data. The scientific objectives are presented in this paper and the corresponding experimental design is described. The experimental concept is totally new since (i) SMOSREX combines land-surface-atmosphere observations, passive microwave measurements and VIS to NIR remote sensing, (ii) SMOSREX is based on highly accurate L-band measurements carried out by a radiometer specifically designed for the experiment, and (iii) SMOSREX provides a unique continuous data set of L-band measurements over several years. The characteristics of the L-band emission are presented at diurnal, seasonal and annual temporal scales, and the emissions are compared over bare soil and natural grass. The surface emissions over bare soil and fallow area are shown to be counter-phased at the diurnal scale due to small variations in vegetation water content and bare soil surface moisture. Innovative long term results using L-band measurements for both bare soil and natural grass are presented in this paper, and the relationship between the surface emission at L-band and surface bare soil moisture is shown to be suitable for a long term period (19 months). Soil freezing is shown to be drastically different for bare soil and vegetation covered plots, with a large threshold effect on microwave surface emission. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Areas of mixed forest and variable terrain present unique challenges for the detection and mapping of mountain pine beetle red-attack damage, as red-attack has a more heterogeneous distribution under these conditions. In this study, mountain pine beetle red-attack damage was detected and mapped using a logistic regression approach with a forward stepwise selection process and a set of calibration data representing samples of red-attack and non-attack from the study area. Variables that were considered for inclusion in the model were the enhanced wetness difference index (EWDI) derived from a time series of Landsat remotely sensed imagery, elevation, slope, and solar radiation (direct, diffuse, and global). The output from the logistic regression was a continuous probability surface, which indicated the likelihood of red-attack damage. Independent validation data were used to assess the accuracy of the resulting models. The final model predicted red-attack damage with an accuracy of 86%. These results indicate that for this particular site, with mixed forest stands and variable terrain, remotely sensed and ancillary spatial data can be combined, through logistic regression, to create a mountain pine beetle red-attack likelihood surface that accurately identifies damaged forest stands. The use of a probabilistic approach reduces dependence upon the definition of change by the application of thresholds (upper and lower bounds of change) at the image processing stage. Rather, a change layer is generated that may be interpreted liberally or conservatively, depending on the information needs of the end user. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data were used to estimate fire properties and background properties for the 2003 Simi Fire in Southern California, USA. A spectral library of emitted radiance endmembers corresponding to a temperature range of 500-1500 K was created using the MODTRAN radiative transfer model. A second spectral library of reflected solar radiance endmembers, corresponding to four vegetation types and two non-vegetated surfaces, was created using image spectra selected by minimum endmember average root mean square error (RMSE). The best fit combination of an emitted radiance endmember and a reflected solar radiance endmember was found for each spectrum in the AVIRIS scene. Spectra were subset to reduce the effects of variable column water vapor and smoke contamination over the fire. The best fit models were used to produce maps of fire temperature, fire fractional area, background land cover, land cover fraction, and RMSE. The highest fire temperatures were found along the fire front, and lower fire temperatures were found behind the fire front. Saturation of shortwave infrared channels limited modeling of the highest fire temperatures. Spectral similarity of land cover endmembers and smoke impacted the accuracy of modeled land cover. Sensitivity analysis of modeled fire temperatures revealed that the range of temperatures modeled within 5% of minimum RMSE was smallest between 750 and 950 K.

Our method attempts to develop an algorithm which primarily uses remote sensing information and eliminates the need for ground information as model input, by using various land and atmospheric data products available from Terra-MODIS. It explicitly recognizes the need for spatially varied parameters and provides a distributed net radiation map over large heterogeneous domain with fine spatial resolution. Since instantaneous net radiation estimates have limited scope compared to daily average values or diurnal cycle, a sinusoidal model is proposed to estimate diurnal cycle of net radiation. The sinusoidal model is capable of retrieving the diurnal variations of net radiation with a single instantaneous net radiation estimate from the satellite. Preliminary results, using data over Southern Great Plains, show good agreement with ground-based observations. It appears that the methodology presented here can estimate instantaneous and daily net radiation with comparable accuracy to those of current methods that use ground-based observations and mainly provide point estimates.

This approach offers an alternative to SAR interferometry, because no present or planned RADAR satellite mission provides data with a temporal separation short enough to derive the displacements of glaciers. The methodology presented in this study does not require ground control points (GCPs). The key step is a precise relative orientation of the two images obtained by adjusting the stereo model of one \"slave\" image assuming that the other \"master\" image is well georeferenced. It is performed with numerous precisely-located homologous points extracted automatically. The strong ablation occurring during summer time on the glaciers requires a correction to obtain unbiased displacements. The accuracy of our measurement is assessed based on a comparison with nearly simultaneous differential GPS surveys performed on two glaciers of the Mont Blanc area (Alps). If the images have similar incidence angles and correlate well, the accuracy is on the order of 0.5 m, or 1/5 of the pixel size. Similar results are also obtained without GCPs. An acceleration event, observed in early August for the Mer de Glace glacier, is interpreted in term of an increase in basal sliding. Our methodology, applied to SPOT5 images, can potentially be used to derive the displacements of the Earth\'s surface caused by landslides, earthquakes, and volcanoes. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Vegetation height was recovered from airborne SAR interferometry, and was used along with an established relationship between forest height and age for mapping the successional stages of vegetation. A map of forest ages could be generated and validated (age RMSE was 3.5 years). Biomass stocks and annual rates of increment in biomass could be attributed to the forest ages by a comprehensive growth model for forests in the study area. A conceptual model of land use change was developed for the study area that accounts for four different types of land use: primary forest, secondary forest, degraded forest and nonforest. The transition probabilities between those land use types were recovered from internal modeling of available data, from literature sources, and from large-scale remote sensing results. The land use change matrix, area-age densities of secondary forests, and a growth model, yield a spatialized estimate of the carbon budget. The committed emissions from annual land use change were computed. For the year 2000-2001 the carbon balance was negative, on an area of ca. 5700 ha, land use dynamics resulted in a release of approximately 16,000 t of carbon, mainly arising from the cutting of primary forest for agricultural purposes. The secondary forest carbon budget was almost balanced, and forest degradation was revealed less important. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, a case study is shown for the application of wavelet analysis to morphotectonic lineament investigation. Results of wavelet analysis are compared to traditional methods. Although this study involves DEM-derived morphological lineaments, the presented wavelet analysis can be also used for lineaments derived from remotely sensed images.

Data from the AVHRR sensor are routinely processed to provide bi-monthly NDVI (normalised difference vegetation index) composite images of the agricultural zone of WA. We used a time series of NDVI imagery for 1995 to 1998 together with coincident climate layers in a light use efficiency (LUE) model to generate PGR maps for WA. We only operated the model for areas of the agricultural zone where pasture constituted more than 60% of the land cover. The regional estimates were compared with whole-farm averages made at three farms using pasture exclosures positioned across the main land management units (LMUs) on each property. Significant relationships were obtained between predicted and observed PGR for the three farms Kojonup, Porongurup and Williams of R-2 0.67, 0.75 and 0.70, respectively. A validation study in 1999 at five farms used a potential productivity index for LMUs to scale the regional estimates down to paddock level. The relationship between predicted and observed PGR, for data averaged by LMU, had an R-2 of 0.69. Given that little information on regional PGR currently exists, estimates generated by such LUE models from in-line AVHRR processing made available on the internet or by subscription can greatly improve the basis for feed management across wool growing enterprises in the south west of WA. This approach could readily be applied to other highly seasonal grazing systems around the world. Crown Copyright (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Inc.

This ecotone, the world\'s largest, stretches for over 13,400 km and marks the transition between the northern limits of forests and the Southern margin of the tundra. Because of the inaccessibility and large extent of this zone, remote sensing data can play an important role for mapping the characteristics and monitoring the dynamics. Basic understanding of the capabilities of existing space borne instruments for these purposes is required. In this study we examined the use of several remote sensing techniques for characterizing the existing tundra-taiga ecotone. These include Landsat-7, MISR, MODIS and RADARSAT data. Historical cover maps, recent forest stand measurements and high-resolution IKONOS images were used for local ground truth.   It was found that a tundra-taiga transitional area can be characterized using multi-spectral Landsat ETM+ summer images, multi-angle MISR red band reflectance images, RADARSAT images with larger incidence angle, or multi-temporal and multi-spectral MODIS data. Because of different resolutions and spectral regions covered, the transition zone maps derived from different data types were not identical, but the general patterns were consistent.

The data obtained from the passive and active L and S band sensor (PALS) along with physical variables measured by in situ sampling have been used in this study to demonstrate the sensitivity of the instrument to soil moisture and perform soil moisture retrieval using statistical regression and physical modeling techniques. The land cover conditions in the region studied were predominantly soybean and corn crops with average vegetation water contents ranging from 0 to similar to5 kg/m(2). The PALS microwave sensitivity to soil moisture under these vegetation conditions was investigated for both passive and active measurements. The performance of the PALS instrument and retrieval algorithms has been analyzed, indicating soil moisture retrieval errors of approximately 0.04 g/g gravimetric soil moisture. Statistical regression techniques have been shown to perform satisfactorily with soil moisture retrieval error of around 0.05 g/g gravimetric soil moisture. The retrieval errors were higher for the com than for the soybean fields due to the higher vegetation water content of the corn crops. However, the algorithms performed satisfactorily over the full range of vegetation conditions. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Based on the assumptions that NDVI time-series follow annual cycles of growth and decline of vegetation, and that clouds or poor atmospheric conditions usually depress NDVI values, we have developed in the present study a simple but robust method based on the Savitzky-Golay filter to smooth out noise in NDVI time-series, specifically that caused primarily by cloud contamination and atmospheric variability. Our method was developed to make data approach the upper NDVI envelope and to reflect the changes in NDVI patterns via an iteration process. From the results obtained by applying the newly developed method to a 10-day MVC SPOT VGT-S product, we provide optimized parameters for the new method and compare this technique with the BISE algorithm and Fourier-based fitting method. Our results indicate that the new method is more effective in obtaining high-quality NDVI time-series. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we utilize IKONOS, Landsat 7 ETM+, and airborne scanning light detection and ranging (lidar) to quantify coniferous forest and understory grass coverages in a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) dominated ecosystem in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Linear spectral mixture analyses of IKONOS and ETM+ data were used to isolate spectral endmembers (bare soil, understory grass, and tree/shade) and calculate their subpixel fractional coverages. We then compared these endmember cover estimates to similar cover estimates derived from lidar data and field measures. The IKONOS-derived tree/shade fraction was significantly correlated with the field-measured canopy effective leaf area index (LAI(c)) (r(2) = 0.55, p < 0.001) and with the lidar-derived estimate of tree occurrence.(r(2) = 0.79, p < 0.001). The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) calculated from IKONOS imagery showed a negative correlation with the field measured tree canopy effective LAI and lidar tree cover response (r(2) = 0.30, r = 0.55 and r(2) = 0.41, r = -0.64, respectively; p < 0.001) and further analyses indicate a strong linear relationship between EVI and the IKONOS-derived grass fraction (r(2) = 0.99, p < 0.001). We also found that using EVI resulted in better agreement with the subpixel vegetation fractions in this ecosystem than using normalized difference of vegetation index (NDVI). Coarsening the IKONOS data to 30 in resolution imagery revealed a stronger relationship with lidar tree measures (r(2) = 0.77, p < 0.001) than at 4 in resolution (r(2) = 0.58, p < 0.001). Unmixed tree/shade fractions derived from 30 in resolution ETM+ imagery also showed a significant correlation with the lidar data (r(2) = 0.66, p < 0.001). These results demonstrate the power of using high resolution lidar data to validate spectral unmixing results of satellite imagery, and indicate that IKONOS data and Landsat 7 ETM+ data both can serve to make the important distinction between tree/shade coverage and exposed understory grass coverage during peak summertime greenness in a ponderosa pine forest ecosystem.

Also, variables characterizing the detected trees such as tree height, crown area, and crown base height can be measured. The Scandinavian boreal forest mainly consists of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and deciduous trees. It is possible to separate coniferous from deciduous trees using near-infrared images, but pine and spruce give similar spectral signals. Airborne laser scanning, measuring structure and shape of tree crowns could be used for discriminating between spruce and pine. The aim of this study was to test classification of Scots pine versus Norway spruce on an individual tree level using features extracted from airborne laser scanning data. Field measurements were used for training and validation of the classification. The position of all trees on 12 rectangular plots (50 X 20 in 2) were measured in field and tree species was recorded. The dominating species (>80%) was Norway spruce for six of the plots and Scots pine for six plots. The field-measured trees were automatically linked to the laser-measured trees. The laser-detected trees on each plot were classified into species classes using all laser-detected trees on the other plots as training data. The portion correctly classified trees on all plots was 95%. Crown base height estimations of individual trees were also evaluated (r=0.84). The classification results in this study demonstrate the ability to discriminate between pine and spruce using laser data. This method could be applied in an operational context. In the first step, a segmentation of individual tree crowns is performed using laser data. In the second step, tree species classification is performed based on the segments. Methods could be developed in the future that combine laser data with digital near-infrared photographs for classification with the three classes: Norway spruce, Scots pine, and deciduous trees.

In this paper, we examine the utility of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument currently operating on the NASA Terra satellite, which provides near infrared (VNIR) stereo imaging from which topography can be derived. We wrote software to generate digital elevation models (DEMs) from the ASTER level 1A product, which employs an automated stereo matching technique to calculate the parallax offsets between the images acquired by the nadir- and aft-looking sensors. Comparison of ASTER DEMs with DEMs derived from other sources (digitized 1:50 K topographic maps and aerial interferometric radar) at Ruapehu volcano reveal an RMS error of about 10 in for the ASTER DEM, in the absence of significant atmospheric water vapor. A qualitative assessment of surface features showed that the ASTER DEM is superior to the interpolated 1:50 K map product but falls short of the detail provided by aerial interferometric radar, especially in terms of stream channel preservation. A second ASTER DEM was generated for Taranaki volcano, where previously only 1:50 K topographic map data were available. Although the 2000 Space Shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) will largely remedy the previous global paucity of adequate topographic data at volcanoes, such as Taranaki, we anticipate the problem that at active volcanoes, the topography may change significantly following activity, rendering the SRTM data inaccurate. With the high temporal coverage of the dataset, ASTER not only provides a means to update significant (>10 in) topographic measurements at active volcanoes via a time-series of DEMs, but also provides a simultaneous means to map surface cover and localized land-use via the near infrared sensors. Thus we demonstrate the potential for up-to-date volcanic economic risk assessment using geographic information systems (GIS) analysis. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we analyze and discuss several such signatures acquired from the airborne POLDER and HyMap instruments during the DAISEX\'99 campaign over agricultural crops. The observed signatures are very similar to those acquired from space at a resolution of several tens of kilometers [J. Geophys. Res. 107 (2002)], which provides further evidence that the hot spot is a scale-free feature. The hot spots can be fitted by a two-parameter function (amplitude and width) of the phase angle derived from canopy radiative transfer modeling. The model predicts that the amplitude is directly related to the leaf reflectance, while the width is a function of the canopy structure. The retrieved leaf reflectance values over a wide spectral range are in very good agreement with noncoincident laboratory measurement. The retrieved half widths are on the order of 1degrees with no significant variability between the analyzed targets. There is an apparent spectral variability in the half width, a feature in contradiction with the modeling, although the variations are not larger than the uncertainties. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

As such areas, particularly mudflats of limited access for point sampling, remote sensing techniques have the potential to map diatom biomass. This study used two monospecific cultures of the benthic, diatoms Navicula ramosissima and Entomoneis paludosa, isolated from mudflats in Bourgneuf Bay (France), to obtain a biomass range. Exponential and senescent stages of microalgal growth were also tested. The objective was to relate the spectral reflectance obtained by spectroradiometry to the composition and amount of principal and accessory pigments measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Analysis of pigments vs. chlorophyll a ratios revealed differences between these two diatom species, mainly due to fucoxanthin and diadinoxanthin. These interspecific variations among the class of Bacillariophyceae were also detected by spectroradiometry. No differences were observed between the two growth stages, and cell senescence had no effects on spectral properties. The chlorophyll pigments used to establish a relationship between diatom biomass and spectral reflectance gave the most interesting results for an absorption band at 632 nm corresponding to chlorophyll a and chlorophyll e. This band, contrary to that at 673 nm related to chlorophyll a only and traditionally used for biomass estimations in green plants, provided the largest range of variations and was not saturated at a high biomass concentration.

Complexity of reef environments, established by field observation, ranged from 3 to 15 classes of benthic habitats containing various combinations of sediments, carbonate pavement, seagrass, algae, and corals in different geomorphologic zones (forereef, lagoon, patch reef, reef flats). Processing included corrections for sea surface roughness and bathymetry, unsupervised or supervised classification, and accuracy assessment based on ground-truth data. IKONOS classification results were compared with classified Landsat 7 imagery for simple to moderate complexity of reef habitats (5-11 classes). For both sensors, overall accuracies of the classifications show a general linear trend of decreasing accuracy with increasing habitat complexity. The IKONOS sensor performed better, with a 15-20% improvement in accuracy compared to Landsat. For IKONOS, overall accuracy was 77% for 4-5 classes, 71% for 7-8 classes, 65% in 9-11 classes, and 53% for more than 13 classes. The Landsat classification accuracy was systematically lower, with an average of 56% for 5-10 classes. Within this general trend, inter-site comparisons and specificities demonstrate the benefits of different approaches.

A number of grouped wavebands with high correlation (R-2>95%) were revealed. For the crop variables based on quantity per unit surface area, i.e. GBM, LAI, Chl(density), and N-density, these wavebands had in the majority (87%) of the cases a center wavelength in the red edge spectral region from 680 to 750 nm and the band combinations were often paired so that both bands were closely spaced in the steep linear shift between R-red and R-nir, The red edge region was almost absent for bands related to Chl(conc) and N-conc, where the visible spectral range, mainly in the blue region, proved to be better. The selected narrow-band indices improved the description of the influence of all six-crop variables compared to the traditional broad- and short-band indices normally applied on data from satellite, aerial photos, and field spectroradiometers. For variables expressed on the basis of soil or canopy surface area, the relationship was further improved when exponential curve fitting was used instead of linear regression. The best of the selected narrow-band indices was compared to the results of a partial least square regression (PLS). This comparison showed that the narrow-band indices related to LAI and Chl(conc), and to some extent also Chl(density) and N-density, were optimal and could not be significantly improved by PLS using the information from all wavelengths in the hyperspectral region. However, PLS improved the prediction of GBM and N-conc by lowering the RMSE with 22% and 24%, respectively, compared to the best narrow-band indices. It is concluded that PLS regression analysis may provide a useful exploratory and predictive tool when applied on hyperspectral reflectance data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

This paper examines whether cloudiness has already changed locally in the Brazilian arc of deforestation, one of the most deforested regions of the Amazon basin, where over 15% of the primary forest has been converted to pasture and agriculture. Three pairs of deforested/forested areas have been selected at a scale compatible with that of climate model grids to compare changes in land cover with changes in cloudiness observed in satellite data over a 10-year period from 1984 to 1993. Analysis of cloud cover trends suggests that a regional climate change may already be underway in the most deforested part of the arc of deforestation. Although changes in cloud cover over deforested areas are not significant for interannual variations, they are for the seasonal and diurnal distributions. During the dry season, observations show more low-level clouds in early afternoon and less convection at night and in early morning over deforested areas. During the wet season, convective cloudiness is enhanced in the early night over deforested areas. Generally speaking, the results suggest that deforestation may lead to increased seasonality; however, some of the differences observed between deforested and forested areas may be related to their different geographical locations.

In recent years, applications of the genetic algorithms (GA) to a variety of optimization problems in remote sensing have been successfully demonstrated. In this study, we estimated LAI by integrating a canopy RT model and the GA optimization technique. This method was used to retrieve LAI from field measured reflectance as well as from atmospherically corrected Landsat ETM+ data. Four different ETM+ band combinations were tested to evaluate their effectiveness. The impacts of using the number of the genes were also examined. The results were very promising compared with field measured LAI data, and the best results were obtained with three genes in which the R 2 is 0.776 and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) 1.064.

Progress in canopy-level photosynthesis modeling suggests that simpler big-leaf photosynthesis models are giving ways to more complex sunlit/shaded leaf separation models. This advancement in ecological modeling has increased the demand for advanced description of canopy architecture. Such demand may be mostly met through the use of multi-angle remote sensing techniques. In addition to leaf area index (LAI), another canopy parameter, the foliage clumping index, can be derived from multi-angle remote sensing. These two parameters are the basis for separating sunlit and shaded leaves. As leaf photosynthesis is nonlinearly related to incident radiation, such separation avoids the problems of big-leaf models that only make use of the total radiation absorption by the canopy without considering the distribution of radiation among leaves. A practical conclusion is that the traditional way of mapping the net primary productivity (NPP) through its correlation with the remotely sensed fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) absorbed by plant canopies is only a very crude approximation and could be replaced with mapping LAI and clumping index and modeling NPP with advanced photosynthesis models. This is a step forward in remote sensing applications because single-angle remote sensing can only acquire information on the effective LAI related to the canopy gap fraction in the viewing direction and the amount of shaded leaf area is unknown.

When applied together, they offer useful information about the relationships among species and the ecological processes occurring within a community. Remote sensing provides surrogate data for characterizing the spatial distribution of ecological classes based on the assumption of characteristic reflectance of species and species associations. Currently, there exists a need to establish and clarify the link between theories and practices of classification by ecologists and remote sensing scientists. In this study, high spatial resolution Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) reflectance data were examined and compared to plant community data for a peatland complex in northern Manitoba, Canada. The goal of this research was to explore the relationship between classification of species cover and community data and reflectance values. Ordination and cluster analysis techniques were used in conjunction with spectral separability measures to organize clusters of community-based data that were suitable for classification of CASI reflectance data, while still maintaining their ecological significance. Results demonstrated that two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) clusters did not correspond well to spectral reflectance and gave the lowest classification results of the methods investigated. The highest classification accuracies were achieved with ecological classes defined by combining the information obtained from a suite of analysis techniques (i.e., TWINSPAN, correspondence analysis (CA), and signature separability analysis), albeit not statistically superior to the classification obtained from the signature separability analysis alone.

The continuum of forest land proportion predictions was separated into strata to facilitate stratified estimation. The k-Nearest Neighbors technique is carefully explained, five precautions are noted, and a plea is made for an objective approach to calibrating the technique. The variances of the stratified forest area estimates were smaller by factors as great as 5 than variances of the arithmetic mean calculated under the assumption of simple random sampling.

This study investigates the spatial manifestation of forest succession in optical imagery through three types of models: a two-component spatial model, a canopy reflectance model (Geometric-Optical and Radiative Transfer, GORT) and a forest ecosystem dynamics model (ZELIG). The latter two models provide inputs to the former one to predict the spatial properties of images as a function of the combined effects of tree size and density, the spectral signatures of scene components and pixel size. An important source of information that is diagnostic of canopy structure has been identified: the spatial properties of multiresolution imagery. The sill of variograms of images of forest stands decrease with regularization, and in particular the rate of decrease is related to the size of trees. For stands with larger trees the sills of variograms decrease more slowly with increasing regularization than for stands with smaller trees. However, the spatial patterns for a scene with multiresolution imagery are also dependent on tree cover. This implies that the use of spatial patterns to estimate tree size will require independent estimates of tree cover as a preliminary step. Concept verification with an Ikonos 1-m panchromatic image for stands at the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the Cascade Range of Oregon indicates the simulated spatial patterns exist in multiresolution imagery. This study demonstrates the potential to map tree size automatically from multiresolution imagery. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Because of the variety of the samples with respect to vegetation type, leaf age, and phenological developmental stage, the data of L and Nc were uncorrelated. The scattering effect of leaves effectuated a robust linear relationship between L and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance (r=.93), whereas the N-c (vegetative period) was significantly correlated with the spectral reflectance in the green (r=-.88) and far-red wavebands (r=-.94). The correlations between vegetation indices and L were also important, in particular, for the enhanced vegetation index (EVI; r=.88), whereas the red edge position correlated less significantly with N-c (r=.78). Assuming L and Nc to be responsible for most of the spatial variability in the CO2 assimilation rates, remote sensing-based maps of these variables were produced for use in a coupled sun/shade photosynthesis/transpiration model. The predicted rates of net photosynthesis and transpiration compared reasonably with eddy covariance measurements Of CO2 and water vapour fluxes recorded at four different crop fields. The results allowed evaluation of the spatial variations in the photosynthetic light, nitrogen, and water use efficiencies. While photosynthesis was linearly related to the transpiration, the light use efficiency (LUE) was found to be dependent on nitrogen concentrations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

In particular, empirical scaling analysis was conducted to investigate the linkages between the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture, and landscape characteristics including terrain, soils, and vegetation. The results show that the soil moisture fields exhibit multiscaling and multifractal behavior varying with the scales of observation and hydrometeorological forcing. A break in statistical symmetry (multiscaling behavior) was identified, which separates the spatial and temporal evolution of the statistical structure of soil moisture fields for wavelengths below and above 10 km, the alpha- and beta-scale ranges, respectively. Specifically, the multiscaling behavior is consistent with the scaling behavior of soil hydraulic properties as described by soil texture parameters such as sand and clay content. The multifractal behavior is associated with the temporal evolution of drying and wetting regimes, reflecting the nonlinear character of soil moisture dynamics. Finally, Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis was conducted to explain the relationship between the spatial structure of estimated soil moisture and that of ancillary data including topography, soil texture, and vegetation cover. Topography appears to dominate the spatial structure of soil moisture only during and immediately after rainfall. In interstorm periods, the spatial evolution of soil moisture is closely associated with the spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties when the soil is above field capacity, while vegetation dominates the evolution of soil moisture fields through evapotranspiration as the landscape dries down.

A SAR polynya algorithm is used to delineate open water, new ice, and young ice, and to define the size and shape of polynyas. In order to extract radiometric and contextual information in the ERS SAR PRI images. three different image classification routines are developed and applied. No in situ data have been available for verification of the polynya shapes and sizes, but one of the ice classification routines have been verified earlier using ground truth data. The SAR polynya algorithm is demonstrated to be able to discriminate between the polynya and the surrounding ice area for 85 analyzed cases. The results from the SAR algorithm are compared to ERS Browse images. passive microwave data (a recent Polynya Signature Simulation Method (PSSM), and the Bootstrap and the NASA Team ice concentration algorithms), and a numerical polynya model (NPM) forced by National Center for Environmental Predictions (NCEP) wind fields and air temperatures. The ERS SAR Browse images show a relatively good correlation with the ERS SAR PRI images (.88) while the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) Bootstrap and the NASA Team ice concentration algorithms both have low correlation coefficients (below .3). The PSSM calculates the polynya shape and size, and delineates open water and thin ice. For polynyas of all sizes it has a correlation of .69 compared to the SAR PRI images. For polynyas with widths greater than 10 km the correlation increases to .83. The NPM computes offshore coastal polynya widths, heat exchange. and ice production. Compared to SAR data, it overestimates the maximum size of the polynya by about 15% and has a correlation of .71 compared to the analyzed SAR PRI images. The polynyas in our main investigation area, located at Franz Josef Land, are found to be primarily wind driven. The surrounding large-scale ice drift and tidal currents have little effect on the polynya behavior. One overall conclusion from this investigation is that SAR images processed through the SAR polynya algorithm in combination with the NPM is a powerful tool for investigating and characterizing polynyas at various scales in the Arctic.

Reasonable accuracy of the air temperature should be obtained without including the annual variation of the emissivity. We studied the sensitivity of the inferred air temperature to penetration depth, a determinant parameter for the effective temperature, and used a snow dielectric constant model derived from strong fluctuation theory. Below 10 GHz. the snow cover temperature and layering determine this depth, whereas above 20 GHz, the determinant factor is the snow crystal sized all parameter have an effect at intermediate frequencies. The penetration depth ranges for the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) channels are the following: 20-40 m at 6.6 GHz. 6-16 in at 10.7 GHz, about 1-5 m at 18 GHz, and 0.1-1.4 m at 37 GHz. Analysis of the effective temperature revealed that the snow effective temperature can explain short-term fluctuations at 37 GHz and annual trends for all SMMR channels, For short-term fluctuations (< 10 days), calculations and measurements showed that the brightness temperature at 3 7 GHz starts to respond immediately to the air temperature changes, even though the time to reach the maximum is delayed by a day or less: furthermore, the amplitude of the resulting fluctuation was sufficiently large to be detectable in most cases. Indeed, short-term fluctuations of the air temperature can clearly be detected from significant variations of the air temperature over 3 days. but small amplitude fluctuations shorter than 1 day will hardly be detectable through the brightness temperature. This limits use of the brightness temperature at 37 GHz. and this is a point to consider for inversion models, Nevertheless, air temperature fluctuations over 2-3 days can be detected: thus, this technique could be used to observe the winter warming periods in Antarctica that often occur, even during cloudy periods.

However, the 3-year composite data shows more rain events over the Arabian Sea at early morning hours between 0000 and 0200 GMT. This is verified by concurrently available TOPEX Microwave Radiometer (TMR) observations of rain events. The intensity of rain rate also does not show any marked diurnal variability. The probability of rain events is significantly high over the Bay of Bengal region compared to the Arabian Sea region. This is also verified with TMR-based analysis.

This algorithm differs from standard line enhancement, threshold edge detection, or classical contour techniques. Instead it utilizes a hyperbolic tangent function in a surface-fitting technique to follow an oceanic front. It has the advantage of describing the characteristics of an oceanic thermal front (including mean SST, SST difference, width and gradient across the front) and extracting information on the position and characteristics of the front into parameter form. Thus, the algorithm has the added benefit of recording the changes in the characteristics of the thermal front as it tracks along the front. The algorithm was applied to AVHRR SST imagery on part of the Subtropical Front known as the Southland Front (SF) off the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand, where subantarctic surface waters and subtropical surface waters converge. The algorithm was tested on examples of the SF and also compared with a standard gradient operator.

The test site is located in northern Finland, and it consists of the drainage area of River Kemi, which is the largest river in Finland. A total of 18 ERS-2 SAR and six cloudless AVHRR images have been acquired from the test site during the spring of 1997 These images cover totally the snow melt period starting from dry snow and ending to snow-free ground. The optical and microwave radar data sets were compared to each other and to in situ measurements made on the weather stations which are used for current operative snow mapping. The results show that SAR-derived snow cover maps agree reasonably urea with ground based observations, and they have a good correlation with AVHRR reflectance for open areas (r=0.82), and even in the presence of vegetation the correlation is relatively high (r=0.77).

Field surveys during the flights recorded biophysical data and water depth in 11 marsh sites containing communities of three principal emergent macrophytes: Cladium jamaicense, Typha domingensis, and Eleocharis cellulosa. The only major seasonal change was in flooding. Seasonal changes in polarimetric backscatter magnitude (HH, VV, and CS=(HV+ VH)/2) and phase [\\H-V phase difference\\ = PD) were extracted for a stable evergreen mangrove forest calibration site, which confirmed that the absolute calibration of the Yucatan imagery exceeded: the SIR-C system calibration. We estimate that seasonal changes of greater than or equal to 2dB in backscatter magnitude and greater than or equal to 10 degrees in phase (PD) are significant in our data. Seasonal changes in L- and C-band magnitude and phase were extracted from the 11 marshes, and significant changes above the calibration limit were noted. Increased flooding in the mac-shes was detected by: 1) an increase in backscatter magnitude in marshes with tall, dense cover; 2) a decrease in backscatter magnitude in marshes with short, sparse cover and 3) an increase in PD in all types of marshes. Magnitude increases result from an increase in double-bounce interactions between the emergent vegetation and water surface, whereas decreases result from an increase in forward scattering off the open water. Average PD values increase owing to an absolute or relative increase in double- compared with single-bounce interaction. Changes from dry or partially flooded to completely flooded as well as increases in water depth, could be detected by most of the polarimetric parameters, but changes from dry to partially flooded could not. C-band PD (CPD) was the radar parameter most sensitive to flooding. CPD changed significantly for all eleven marshes, followed by L-band PD (LPD) and LVV (nine marshes) and LHH, LCS, and CVV (seven marshes). CHH detected significant changes in five marshes but produced changes of +/-1.8-1.9 dB (just below our estimated calibration limit) in. four others. An evaluation of current spaceborne radars indicates that a combination of the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-1,2) and Radarsat radars could detect seasonal flooding in a wide variety of marsh ecosystems, excluding partial flooding and flooding in small patches of short, sparse vegetation.

A wide range of leaves was collected including variations in species and leaf status. All the leaves were dried out. The biochemical composition was measured rising classical wet chemistry techniques to determine lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, starch, and protein contents. Concurrently, leaf reflectance and transmittance were measured with a high spectral resolution spectrophotometer in the 800-2500 nm range with approximately 1 nm spectral resolution and sampling interval. In addition, infinite reflectance achieved by stacking leaves was also measured. The PROSPECT leaf optical properties model was first inverted over a selection of wavebands in the 800-2400 nm domain to provide estimates of the scattering characteristics using leaf reflectance, transmittance, and infinite reflectance data. Then, the model was inverted again over all the wavelengths to estimate the global absorption coefficient, using the previously estimated scattering properties. The global absorption coefficient was eventually explained using the measured biochemical composition by fitting the corresponding specific absorption coefficients after substraction of the measured contribution of the residual structural water absorption. Results show that the derived specific absorption coefficients are quite robustly estimated. Further, they are in good agreement with known absorption features of each biochemical compound. The average contribution of each biochemical compound to leaf absorption feature is also evaluated. Sugar, cellulose, and hemicellulose are the main compounds that contribute to absorption. Results demonstrate the possibility of modeling leaf optical properties of dry leaves with explicit description of leaf biochemistry. Estimates of the detailed biochemical composition obtained by model inversion over the 1300-2400 nm spectral domain show poor predictive performances. In particular, the protein content is very poorly retrieved. The retrieval performances of several combinations of the biochemical compounds are investigated.

The land surface parameterizations provide albedos to determine solar absorption, various resistances to fluxes of heat and moisture from canopy and soil, descriptions of various welter reservoirs, and mechanisms for water to be lost to runoff These parameterizations consist of the algorithms for these processes and the numerical parameter values required by those algorithms. A wide variety of heterogeneities affect fluxes between land surfaces and the atmosphere and occur on scales that are small compared to the spatial resolution of global climate models. These heterogeneities need to be accounted for in terms of statistical distributions and/or relatively fine spatial resolution for specification of land properties.

Estimates of crop growth often are inaccurate for practical field conditions. Therefore, model simulations must be improved by incorporating information on the actual growth and development of field crops, for example, by using remote sensing data. Such data can be used to initialize, calibrate, or update crop growth models, and it can yield parameter estimates to be used as direct input into growth models: 1) leaf area index (LAI), 2) leaf angle distribution (LAD), and 3) leaf colour (optical properties in the PAR region). LAI and LAD determine the amount of light interception. Leaf (or crop) color influences the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and the maximum (potential) rate of photosynthesis of the leaves. A framework is described for integrating optical remote sensing data from various sources in order to estimate the mentioned parameters. In this article, the above concepts for crop growth estimation are elucidated and illustrated using groundbased and airborne data obtained during the MAC Europe 1991 campaign.

This article presents a method for unmixing coarse resolution signals (of the NOAA-AVHRR type) through the use of multiple linear regression. This allows the signal for each mixed coarse resolution pixel to be broken down thanks to a knowledge of land use and a linear mixture model. It is then possible to calculate the individual radiometric contribution of each constituent of a mixed pixel. The work presented here is an assessment of the performance of this method using SPOT-HRV data, degraded to simulate the coarse resolution and as normally provided to produce the land use information.

It is shown that this usual practice generates errors, the lower and upper bounds of which are given in the form of two functions associated with the physical model.

Related work has shown that APAR may be estimated from multispectral (visible and near infrared) remotely sensed observations. The combination of these two concepts may provide the basis for development of physically-based agronomic monitoring systems. These concepts are subjected to examination for two primary, mid-latitude crops; corn (Zea mays L.) and soybeans (Glycine max Merr.). Phytomass, green leaf area index (LAI), absorbed PAR, and multispectral reflectance factors of corn and soybean were measured periodically from planting to mid-grain fill in two growing seasons. As green LAI increased, the fractional APAR asymptotically approached a maximum value between 0.95 and 0.97. Fractional APAR displayed a linear relation to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is relatively independent of species, throughout the growing seasons. However, deviations in the relation were observed between pre- and post-onset of senescence. For both corn and soybean, a linear relation between cumulative APAR and cumulative above-ground phytomass production was found. However, the rate of accumulation per unit APAR was more than twice as great for corn as for soybean. This agrees with previous reports comparing C4 grasses and C3 legumes. These results indicate that remotely sensed measurements contribute valuable information concerning energy/mass accumulation in plant canopies. However, implementation of this approach in crop monitoring will clearly require a capability to discriminate between, at least, corn and soybean.

However, spatially explicit, continuous information on surface fuel loads and fuelbed depth is scarce because the collection of field data is laborious, while suitable methods for deriving estimates from remote sensing data are still at an early stage of development. Fine-scale surface fuel mapping using both passive and active remote sensing has not yet been carried out in Central European forest types, and it remains unexplored how prediction uncertainties of different fuel components affect modelled fire behaviour. This study combines very detailed airborne lidar and multispectral satellite data to extract metrics describing forest structure and composition in two forested areas in southwestern Germany. These metrics were used to predict field-sampled surface fuel components using random forest regression. Accuracies of continuous fuel load predictions were compared to accuracies that could be achieved if only forest type-specific average fuels were assigned. Results revealed that models based on remotely sensed metrics explain part of the variance in litter and fine dead woody fuels (R2=0.27-0.41), but not in coarser dead woody fuels. Estimates for herb and shrub fuels were fairly accurate (R2=0.55-0.64) but limited for the more fire-relevant fine fraction of shrub fuels (R2=0.39). Fuelbed depth was moderately well predicted based on remote sensing data (R2=0.44). Lidar-derived metrics were particularly useful for predicting understory fuels and fuelbed depth. Litter and fine woody fuel predictions were linked to canopy characteristics captured with both lidar and multispectral data and similarly accurate estimates could be obtained using average values based on forest type. We used the fine-scale surface fuel maps derived from remote sensing to predict potential surface fire behaviour in the study area and analysed the sensitivity of modelled fire behaviour to errors in the predicted loads of different surface fuel components: fire behaviour was most sensitive to errors in litter and especially shrub fuel loads, hence estimates of these components need to be improved. Overall, this study showed that statistical relationships between remotely sensed metrics describing forest composition and structure and surface fuels have some potential for estimating fuel loads in Central European forest types and should be further developed to provide starting points for realistic fire behaviour models.', '[Labenski, Pia; Ewald, Michael; Schmidtlein, Sebastian] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Geog & Geoecol, Kaiserstr 12, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.

However, till date, no direct validation has been conducted on existing satellite-based SIF products. In this study, validation of two groups of TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) SIF products, namely TROPOSIFCaltech (containing far-red and red TROPOSIFCaltech datasets) and TROPOSIFESA (containing TROPOSIF735 and TROPOSIF743 datasets that are retrieved from two different retrieval windows), was conducted using tower-based SIF measurements over seven sites. Several issues and potential obstacles emerged while matching satellite-based and in situ SIF retrievals, including spatial scale mismatch. To overcome the spatial scale mismatch between the satellite data and ground observations, a near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv)-scaled approach was employed to mitigate the spatial difference between the locations of specific sites and the matched TROPOSIF samples using Sentinel-2 imagery. Other issues related to retrival methods and instrument differences were examined. Subsequently, the 3FLD retrieval method was chosed for the in situ data. The validation results showed that the three far-red TROPOSIF datasets exhibit slightly different performances in terms of the validation accuracy; the R2 for TROPOSIFCaltech, TROPOSIF735, and TROPOSIF743 was 0.43, 0.33 and 0.40, respectively, which is asociated with root-mean-square error(RMSE) values of 0.59, 0.42 and 0.57 mW m- 2 sr-1 nm- 1, respectively. However, red TROPOSIFCaltech exhibited no significant correlation with tower-based SIF with R2 of 0.02 and RMSE of 0.34 mW m- 2 sr-1 nm- 1. Furthermore, the validation results at different sites varied, with R2 ranging from 0.01 to 0.70. Uncertainties still exist in the validation of the four TROPOSIF datasets, which are attributed to some unresolved issues, such as the limited quality of in situ SIF retrievals and the spatial scaling difference. Thus, to fully utilize satellite-based SIF products for wide ranging applications, further improvements in SIF product quality are urgently required at both ground and satellite scales.', '[Du, Shanshan; Liu, Xinjie; Chen, Jidai; Duan, Weina; Liu, Liangyun] Int Res Ctr Big Data Sustainable Dev Goals, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.

To hold restoration efforts accountable and monitor their outcomes, traditional strategies for monitoring tree cover increase by field surveys are falling short, because they are labor-intensive and costly. Meanwhile remote sensing approaches have not been able to distinguish different forest types that result from utilizing different restoration approaches (conservation versus production focus). Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAV) with light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can observe forests` vertical and horizontal structural variation, which has the potential to distinguish forest types. In this study, we explored this potential of UAV-borne LiDAR to distinguish forest types in landscapes under restoration in southeastern Brazil by using a supervised classification method. The study area encompassed 150 forest plots with six forest types divided in two forest groups: conservation (remnant forests, natural regrowth, and active restoration plantings) and production (monoculture, mixed, and abandoned plantations) forests. UAV-borne LiDAR data was used to extract several Canopy Height Model (CHM), voxel, and point cloud statistic based metrics at a high resolution for analysis. Using a random forest classification model we could successfully classify conservation and production forests (90% accuracy). Classification of the entire set of six types was less accurate (62%) and the confusion matrix showed a divide between conservation and production types. Understory Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the variation in vegetation density in the upper half of the canopy were the most important classification metrics. In particular, LAI understory showed the most variation, and may help advance ecological understanding in restoration. The difference in classification success underlines the difficulty of distinguishing individual forest types that are very similar in management, regeneration dynamics, and structure. In a restoration context, we showed the ability of UAV-borne LiDAR to identify complex forest structures at a plot scale and identify groups and types widely distributed across different restored landscapes with medium to high accuracy. Future research may explore a fusion of UAV-borne LiDAR with optical sensors , include successional stages in the analyses to further characterize , distinguish forest types and their contributions to landscape restoration.', '[Scheeres, Janneke; de Jong, Johan] Wageningen Univ & Res, Forest Ecol & Forest Management, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, several studies started to use satellite mea-surements to evaluate changes in air quality in many different regions worldwide. However, although satellite data is continuously validated, it is known that its accuracy may vary between monitored areas, requiring regionalized quality assessments. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate whether satellites could measure changes in the air quality of the state of Sa similar to o Paulo, Brazil, during the COVID-19 outbreak; and to verify the relationship between satellite-based data [Tropospheric NO2 column density and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)] and ground -based concentrations [NO2 and particulate material (PM; coarse: PM10 and fine: PM2.5)]. For this purpose, tropospheric NO2 obtained from the TROPOMI sensor and AOD retrieved from MODIS sensor data by using the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm were compared with concentrations obtained from 50 automatic ground monitoring stations. The results showed low correlations between PM and AOD. For PM10, most stations showed correlations lower than 0.2, which were not significant. The results for PM2.5 were similar, but some stations showed good correlations for specific periods (before or during the COVID-19 outbreak). Satellite-based Tropospheric NO2 proved to be a good predictor for NO2 concentrations at ground level. Considering all stations with NO2 measurements, correlations >0.6 were observed, reaching 0.8 for specific stations and periods. In general, it was observed that regions with a more industrialized profile had the best correlations, in contrast with rural areas. In addition, it was observed about 57% reductions in tropospheric NO2 throughout the state of Sa similar to o Paulo during the COVID-19 outbreak. Variations in air pollutants were linked to the region economic vocation, since there were reductions in industrialized areas (at least 50% of the industrialized areas showed >20% decrease in NO2) and increases in areas with farming and livestock characteristics (about 70% of those areas showed increase in NO2). Our results demonstrate that Tropospheric NO2 column densities can serve as good predictors of NO2 concentrations at ground level. For MAIAC-AOD, a weak relationship was observed, requiring the evaluation of other possible predictors to describe the relationship with PM. Thus, it is concluded that regionalized assessment of satellite data accuracy is essential for assertive estimates on a regional/local level. Good quality information retrieved at specific polluted areas does not assure a worldwide use of remote sensor data.', '[Rudke, A. P.; Albuquerque, T. T.

Due to the nonlinear distortion from velocity bunching, the operational Sentinel-1 Wave Mode (WV) level-2 (L2) Ocean (OCN) wave products retrieved by quasi-linear inversion are still quite different from the real wave spectrum, requiring further calibration. Limited by the azimuth cut-off, the quasi-linear inversed wave spectrum mostly concentrates on swells with a wavelength longer than 150 m. 2D spectral partitioning separates different swell systems, denoted as partitions in the Sentinel-1 WV L2 OCN product. We compared and calibrated the Sentinel-1 WV L2 OCN products\' swell partitions (More specifically partitioned integral ocean wave parameters: partitioned wave height, partitioned wavelength, and partitioned wave direction) with WAVEWATCH III (WW3) in different polarization modes (HH and VV polarization) and different incidence angles (-23 degrees -WV1 and - 36 degrees- WV2).The accuracy of swell partitions in the OCN products varies with peak wave direction relative to the Sentinel-1 flight direction, and it is difficult to calibrate the partitions derived from quasi-linear inversion unless deleting partitions severely distorted by nonlinearity and large-scale features. A machine learning method is proposed to calibrate the wave partitions. Spectral distances of collocated Sentinel-1 and WW3 partition pairs larger than two are considered \"bad\" partitions to be filtered. Inputting high-dimensional features (twenty-one features) derived from Sentinel-1 WV L2 OCN products into the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model can effectively reduce the bias (root-mean-square error, RMSE) of significant wave height (SWH) of all the partitions from-0.10 m (-0.70 m) to-0.00 m (-0.46 m) and the bias (RMSE) of wavelengths of all the partitions from-20 m (-35 m) to-0.20 m (-26 m) compared with WW3 swell partitions.

While airborne laser scanning (ALS) data have provided detailed information on vertical vegetation structure and is widely used in ecological studies, it is lacking in availability and repeat frequency. Although the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) waveform Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor and algorithms were optimized for measuring dense forests, it was anticipated that GEDI metrics could provide useful characterization of lower stature, sparse savannas structures. This study provided the first baseline validation of Version 2 GEDI (L2A) relative height 98 (RH98) by comparing the on-orbit GEDI-RH98orb to the simulated GEDI-RH98sim derived from ALS data across diverse savanna vegetation. It furthermore determined the influence of various factors on error, e.g. algorithm setting group (SGs), beam type, day vs. night, beam sensitivity, and vegetation phenology. After applying quality flags, 22,813 GEDI footprints were analyzed across 11 sites. SGs 4-6 that are aimed at dense forests had much larger errors than SGs 1-3. The phenological conditions at the time of GEDI data acquisition had a very large influence on the error of RH98orb. During leaf-on conditions for savanna vegetation with RH98sim < 15 m, RH98orb was very accurate with R2 = 0.61, mean bias =-0.55 m, %bias = -11.1%, RMSE = 1.64 m and % RMSE = 29.8%. In leaf-off conditions where RH98sim < 15 m, RH98orb was less accurate with R2 = 0.43, mean bias =-1.47 m, %bias =-26.5%, RMSE = 2.03 m and %RMSE = 40.9%. During leaf-off conditions, the GEDI LiDAR signal at the start of the waveform may be weaker as it interacts with denuded branches and may be truncated as noise, leading to a large negative height bias. Therefore, assessments of deciduous vegetation structures should be conducted during leaf-on periods. In leaf-on conditions, GEDI\'s RH98orb was very accurate between canopy heights of 3 and 7 m, with a mean bias of-0.79 m (-10%). The bias of RH98orb was not influenced by canopy cover. Due to the GEDI LiDAR pulse width of 15.6 ns, the GEDI-RH98 data product cannot reliably estimate canopy heights of shrubs below 2.34 m and will require more complex deconvolution of the waveform. GEDI\'s RH98 accurately estimates the canopy height of trees between 3 and 15 m allowing assess-ment of canopy heights over vast savanna areas.', '[Li, Xiaoxuan; Wessels, Konrad] George Mason Univ, Dept Geog & Geoinformat Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.

Timely and accurate monitoring of cover crop traits, notably aboveground biomass and nutrient content, is beneficial to agricultural stakeholders to improve management and understand outcomes. Currently, there is a scarcity of spatially and temporally resolved information for assessing cover crop growth. Remote sensing has a high potential to fill this need, but conventional empirical regression operated with coarse-resolution multispectral data has large uncertainties. Therefore, this study utilized airborne hyperspectral imaging techniques and developed new process-guided machine learning approaches (PGML) for cover crop monitoring. Specifically, we deployed an airborne hyperspectral system covering visible to shortwave-infrared wavelengths (400-2400 nm) to acquire high spatial (0.5 m) and spectral (3-5 nm) resolution reflectance over 23 cover crop fields across Central Illinois in March and April of 2021. Airborne hyperspectral surface reflectance with high spectral and spatial resolution can be well matched with field data to quantify cover crop traits. Furthermore, the PGML models were pretrained by synthetic data from soil-vegetation radiative transfer modeling (one million records), and then fine-tuned with field data of cover crop biomass and nutrient content. Results show that airborne hyperspectral data with PGML can achieve high accuracy to predict cover crop aboveground biomass (R2 = 0.72, relative RMSE = 15.16%) and nitrogen content (R2 = 0.69, relative RMSE = 16.59%) through leave-one-field-out crossvalidation. Unlike the pure data-driven approach (e.g., partial least-squares regression), PGML incorporated radiative transfer knowledge and obtained higher predictive performance with fewer field data. Meanwhile, with field data for model fine-tuning, PGML predicted biomass more accurately than the inversion of radiative transfer models. We also found that the red edge has a high contribution in quantifying aboveground biomass and nitrogen content, followed by green and shortwave spectra. This study demonstrated the first attempt of utilizing hyperspectral remote sensing to accurately quantify cover crop traits. We highlight the strength of PGML in exploiting sensing data to quantify ecosystem variables to advance agroecosystem monitoring for sustainable agricultural management.', '[Wang, Sheng; Guan, Kaiyu; Zhang, Chenhui; Jiang, Chongya; Zhou, Qu; Li, Kaiyuan; Qin, Ziqi; Ainsworth, Elizabeth A.; Margenot, Andrew J.; Herzberger, Leo] Univ Illinois, Inst Sustainabil Energy & Environm, Agroecosyst Sustainabil Ctr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.

Because SIF is usually <5% of recorded canopy radiance, sources of measurement error must be reduced for accurate SIF retrieval. Here we quantify the impact of spectral stray light on SIF retrieval using a high-resolution imaging spectrometer. We first derived the FLD retrieval solution in the presence of stray light under the simplifying assumptions that SIF, reflectance, and stray light are constant across the region of the spectrum used in the retrieval. We show that stray light contributions from the canopy and reference spectra could cancel out if obtained from the same instrument. In practice however, the simplifying assumptions are unlikely to hold because SIF and reflectance vary across regions of the spectrum commonly exploited by the FLD retrieval, and stray light can also vary across the spectrum, as we demonstrate with an empirical example. To quantify the impact of spectral stray light on SIF retrievals in more realistic scenarios, we performed a sensitivity analysis. We used a stray light signal distribution function and measurements of spectral radiance and SIF to generate spectra with known quantities of SIF and stray light over four orders of magnitude of stray light. We then quantified the bias in retrieved SIF using four SIF retrieval approaches-standard FLD, 3FLD, a spectral fitting method (SFM), and a method based on singular value decomposition (SVD)-applied to the red and/or far-red spectral domains. We found that spectral stray light can cause either a positive or negative bias in SIF estimates. In the highest stray light scenario, with spectral stray light one order of magnitude smaller than the radiance signal, the stray light error ranged from < +/- 1% of SIF (for O2-A band retrievals with FLD, 3FLD, and SFM methods, and for far-red retrievals in the 748 nm to 756 nm domain with SVD-based and 3FLD methods applied to Fraunhofer lines) to >30% of SIF (O2-B band retrieval with SFM, and 3FLD applied to Fraunhofer lines in the red domain). For context, a bias of 27% of SIF is a comparable magnitude to seasonal variation in SIF observed in the Amazon basin, and to SIF differences among plant functional types. However, when spectral stray light was three orders of magnitude smaller than the radiance signal, mean bias was < +/- 2% for all retrieval methods. Our analysis informs when spectral stray light corrections must be performed for SIF remote sensing.', '[Albert, Loren P.; Cushman, K.

Light detection and ranging (lidar), especially the emerging near-surface lidar platforms (e.g., terrestrial laser scanning/TLS, backpack laser scanning/BLS, unmanned aerial vehicle laser scanning/ULS), can depict 3D canopy information with high efficiency and accuracy, providing an ideal data source for forest CSC quantification. However, current existing lidar-based CSC quantification indices may share common limitations of getting saturated in structurally complex forest stands and not fully capturing within-canopy structural var-iations. In this study, we introduced the concept of entropy into forest CSC quantification, and proposed a new forest CSC index, namely canopy entropy (CE). Two major bottlenecks were addressed in the CE calculation procedure, including (1) using a Mann-Kendall (MK) test-based resampling strategy to address the issue of incongruent sampling chances of canopy elements at different locations from different lidar systems, and (2) using a kernel density estimation (KDE)-based method to reduce its dependence on point density. The effec-tiveness and generality of CE were evaluated by simulating TLS and ULS point clouds from nine forest stands and collecting TLS, BLS, and ULS point clouds from 110 field plots distributed in five forest sites, covering a large variety of forest types and forest CSC conditions. The results showed that CE was an effective forest CSC quantification index that successfully captured CSC variations caused by both tree density and the number of vertical canopy layers. It had significant positive correlations with four widely used CSC indices (i.e., canopy cover, foliage height diversity, canopy top rugosity, and fractal dimension; R2: 0.32 to 0.67), but outperformed them by overcoming their common limitations. CE estimates from multiplatform lidar point clouds agreed well with each other (R2 >= 0.70, RMSE <= 0.10), indicating it has generality in cross-platform forest CSC quantification practices. We believe the proposed CE index has great potential to help us unravel the correlations among forest CSC, species diversity, and forest ecosystem functions, and therefore improve our understanding on forest ecosystem processes.', '[Liu, Xiaoqiang; Ma, Qin; Wu, Xiaoyong; Hu, Tianyu; Liu, Zhonghua; Liu, Lingli; Su, Yanjun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.

New generations of remote sensing sensors and machine learning approaches can predict these grassland characteristics with varying accuracy. However, such studies frequently fail to cover a sufficiently broad range of environmental conditions, and their prediction models are often case-specific. To address this gap, we have modelled above-ground biomass and species richness in 150 spatially independent grassland plots of three geographical regions in Germany. These regions follow a North-South climate gradient and differ in soil types, topography, elevation, climatic conditions, historical contexts, and management intensities. The predictors tested in this study are Sentinel-1 backscatter, Sentinel-2 time series of surface reflectance along with derived vegetation indices and Rao\'s Q, and a set of topoedaphic variables. We compared the performance of a feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) with a random forest (RF) regression algorithm. The DNN achieved the best estimations of biomass (r2 = 0.45) when trained with Sentinel-2 surface reflectance only. Moreover, the DNN showed a higher generalizability than RF during spatial cross-validations (i.e., calibrating and validating in different regions, r2 = 0.38 vs. 0.26). Species richness pre-dictions by both algorithms improved when the full time series of Sentinel-2 surface reflectance values were used (highest r2 = 0.42 achieved by the DNN), but both performed poorly during spatial cross-validations. Overall, the DNN-based models were more robust than RF models, showed a lower bias and lower systematic error, and required fewer inputs. Explainability analysis indicated that red-edge and near infrared information from May and October was the most relevant to predict species richness. This study presents an important step forward in generating robust spatially explicit predictions of grassland attributes and biodiversity variables across large areas, environmental gradients, and phenological stages.', '[Muro, Javier] Univ Bonn, Ctr Remote Sensing Land Surfaces ZFL, Bonn, Germany.

In response to this shortcoming, many independent satellite-based SM downscaling approaches have been introduced recently. However, owing to limitations in the spatial sampling characteristics of existing SM ground-monitoring networks, it has proven difficult to obtain reliable reference SM observations at the target downscaling resolution for these approaches (typically 1 to 10 km). As a result, the objective evaluation of SM downscaling approaches is often challenging and/or limited to very localized conditions. Here, we introduce and evaluate a point-scale downscaling (PSD) benchmarking strategy whereby spatially sparse, long-term, point-scale SM observations available from existing ground-based SM networks are utilized for the objective benchmarking of downscaled satellite-based SM products. First, we define criteria that must be met for a given SM downscaling strategy to add either temporal accuracy or spatial skill relative to its coarse-resolution SM baseline. Next, we illustrate, both analytically and numerically, that such criteria can be accurately evaluated using sparse, point-scale SM observations available from existing ground-based SM networks. Finally, we apply our new PSD benchmarking approach to evaluate existing fine-scale SM products. Results demonstrate that the PSD approach, in concert with existing ground-based network data, can be leveraged to robustly evaluate SM downscaling approaches.', '[Crow, W.

Although these estimators date back at least 50 years and appear in multiple current sampling textbooks, the associated terminology is inconsistently defined, even among the prominent authorities. Further, two of the most prominent statistical sampling textbooks, Cochran (1977) and Sa spacing diaeresis rndal et al.

The analyses focused on assessing the unbiasedness of the regression estimators of both the mean and variance, the role of the g-weights on the unbiasedness of the variance estimator, and differences for linear versus nonlinear models. Key terminological distinctions were that the generalized estimators accommodate unequal probability sampling and that the difference estimator of the mean is unbiased whereas the regression estimator of the mean is only asymptotically unbiased, meaning it only approaches unbiasedness as the sample size increases.The key analytical conclusions were threefold: (1) the regression variance estimator was confirmed as asymptotically unbiased, (2) the form of the regression variance estimator that incorporated the g-weights was more accurate, and (3) the regression variance estimator was more accurate for linear models than for nonlinear models.', '[McRoberts, Ronald E.] Raspberry Ridge Analyt, Hugo, MN 55038 USA.

Recent studies recommend making use of non-destructive terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) based techniques for individual tree AGB estimation that provide unbiased AGB predictors. However, applying these techniques across large sites and landscapes remains logis-tically challenging. Unoccupied aerial vehicle laser scanning (UAV-LS) has the potential to address this through the collection of high density point clouds across many hectares, but estimation of individual tree AGB based on these data has been challenging so far, especially in dense tropical canopies. In this study, we investigated how TLS and UAV-LS can be used for this purpose by testing different modelling strategies with data availability and modelling framework requirements. The study included data from four forested sites across three biomes: temperate, wet tropical, and tropical savanna. At each site, coincident TLS and UAV-LS campaigns were con-ducted. Diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height were estimated from TLS point clouds. Individual tree AGB was estimated for & GE;170 trees per site based on TLS tree point clouds and quantitative structure modelling (QSM), and treated as the best available, non-destructive estimate of AGB in the absence of direct, destructive measurements. Individual trees were automatically segmented from the UAV-LS point clouds using a shortest-path algorithm on the full 3D point cloud. Predictions were evaluated in terms of individual tree root mean square error (RMSE) and population bias, the latter being the absolute difference between total tree sample population TLS QSM estimated AGB and predicted AGB. The application of global allometric scaling models (ASM) at local scale and across data modalities, i.e., field-inventory and light detection and ranging LiDAR metrics, resulted in individual tree prediction errors in the range of reported studies, but relatively high popu-lation bias. The use of adjustment factors should be considered to translate between data modalities. When calibrating local models, DBH was confirmed as a strong predictor of AGB, and useful when scaling AGB esti-mates with field inventories. The combination of UAV-LS derived tree metrics with non-parametric modelling generally produced high individual tree RMSE, but very low population bias of & LE;5% across sites starting from 55 training samples. UAV-LS has the potential to scale AGB estimates across hectares with reduced fieldwork time. Overall, this study contributes to the exploitation of TLS and UAV-LS for hectare scale, non-destructive AGB estimation relevant for the calibration and validation of space-borne missions targeting AGB estimation.', '[Brede, Benjamin; Bartholomeus, Harm M.; Lau, Alvaro; van der Zee, Jens; Herold, Martin] Wageningen Univ & Res, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.

The method was realized in a near real time (NRT) application which allows for the processing of data from different satellites and modes. The algorithm estimates the total significant wave height Hs, dominant and secondary swell and windsea wave heights, first, and second moment wave periods, the mean wave period and the period of wind sea. The algorithm was applied to the Sentinel-1 (S1) C-band Interferometric Wide Swath Mode (IW), Extra Wide (EW) and Wave Mode (WV) Level-1 (L1) products and also extended to X -band TerraSAR-X (TS-X) StripMap (SM) products. The scenes are processed in raster and result in continuous sea state fields, with the exception of S1 WV, where averaged values for sea state parameters for along-orbit imagettes of 20 km x 20 km are presented. The developed empirical algorithm consists of two parts: a first CWAVE_EX (extended CWAVE) part, based on a linear regression approach, and a subsequent machine learning part using the support vector machine (SVM) technique. A series of new data preparation steps (i.e. filtering, denoising) and new features estimated from SAR images are also introduced. The algorithm was tuned and validated using two independent global wave model hindcasts, WaveWatch-3 and MFWAM as well as National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) measurements. The achieved root mean squared errors (RMSE) for CWAVE_EX for the total Hs are 0.60 m for low-resolution modes S1 IW (10 m pixel) and EW (40 m pixel) and 0.35 m for S1 WV and TS-X SM (pixel spacing ca.1-4 m) in comparison to model predictions. The RMSEs of the retrieved wave periods are in the range of 0.45-0.90 s for all of the satellites and models considered. Similarly, the dominant and secondary swell, and wind sea wave height RMSEs are in the range of 0.35-0.80 m. The SVM postprocessing improves the accuracy of the initial results of CWAVE_EX for Hs and reaches an RMSE of 0.25 m for S1 WV. Comparisons to 64 NDBC buoys, collocated at distances shorter than 50 km to S1 WV imagettes worldwide, result in an RMSE of 0.41 m. All results and the methods presented are novel in terms of the accuracy achieved, combining the classical approach with machine learning techniques, and performing an automatic NRT processing of multiparametric sea state fields from L1 data with automatic switching for different satellites and modes. The complete archive of S1 WV L1 Single Look Complex products from December 2014 until February 2021 was processed to create a sea state parameter database and validated using model hindcast and buoy mea-surements.

Land Surface Temperature data from NASA MODIS with global resolution of 0.05 & DEG; and Skin Temperature data from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5-Land reanalysis with global resolution of 0.1 fulfill these demands. In this study, we analyze the remote-sensing -based MODIS data to estimate land surface temperature change rates over the period 2001-2020 in global, continental, and pixel-wise scales with statistical significance indicated. The model-based ERA5-Land data are also analyzed in parallel, extending the period of analysis back to 1981. These two independently-sourced datasets, one from satellites above the atmosphere and one from combining surface modeling and observations, are shown to produce highly consistent results. It is revealed that the trends in the shorter period 2001-2020 are spatially conforming to the trends in the longer period 1981-2020 despite the shorter time length. For the period 2001-2020, we show that the global average land surface temperature rate of change was 0.26 -0.34 C per decade, with substantially different warming rates in different regions. The Arctic, Europe, and Russia show statistically significant warming in both datasets. The Arctic, in particular, warmed at a rate 2.5-2.8 times the global average, and data in the 40-year period 1981-2020 suggest that warming is accelerating in almost all the continents or large regions. Most noticeably, the two independent datasets both indicate that Arctic permafrost regions had the world\'s highest warming rate at the onset of the 21st century, reaching > 2 ? per decade in some areas.', '[Wang, You-Ren; Hessen, Dag O.; Stordal, Frode] Univ Oslo, Ctr Biogeochem Anthropocene, Oslo, Norway.

Appropriate grassland management is key for balancing trade-offs between provisioning and regulating ecosystem services. The timing and frequency of mowing events are major factors of grassland management. Recent studies have shown the feasibility of detecting mowing events using remote sensing time series from optical and radar satellites. In this study, we present a new method combining the regular observations of Sentinel-1 (S1) and the better accuracy of Sentinel-2 (S2) grassland mowing detection algorithms. This multi-source approach for grassland monitoring was assessed over large areas and in various contexts. The method was first validated in six European countries, based on Planet image interpretation. Its performances and sensitivity were then thoroughly assessed in an independent study area using a more precise and complete reference dataset based on an intensive field campaign. Results showed the robustness of the method across all study areas and different types of grasslands. The method reached a F1-score of 79% for detecting mowing events on hay meadows. Furthermore, the detection of mowing events along the growing season allows to classify mowing practices with an overall accuracy of 69%. This is promising for differentiating grasslands in terms of management intensity. The method could therefore be used for largescale grassland monitoring to support agri-environmental schemes in Europe.', '[De Vroey, Mathilde; Bontemps, Sophie; Heymans, Diane; Radoux, Julien; Defourny, Pierre] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, 2 Croix Sud Bte L7-05-16, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.

The PWV obtained by the multi-source data fusion method has a low spatial resolution because of the low spatial resolution of the data used. Therefore, it is difficult to retrieve PWV maps with sub-km resolution. Therefore, retrieving PWV with high spatial resolution becomes the focus of this study. A dual-scale method for retrieving PWV maps, based on heterogeneous earth data, is proposed, which can obtain sub-kilometer resolution PWV, while maintaining accuracy. First, an approach for analyzing the spatial correlation between land cover types (LCT) and ground-based PWV was proposed, and the meteorological, ecological, topographic, and LCT variables affecting changes in PWV in the near-earth atmosphere were determine, Subsequently, three different regression models, including multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF), and a generalized regression neural network (GRNN), were used to construct the functional model linking heterogeneous earth observation data and ground-based GNSSderived PWV. Finally, the PWV map with sub-kilometer resolution was generated based on the dual-scale method. Unlike the PWV obtained by data fusion and remote sensing technology, the proposed dual-scale retrieval method can generate PWV maps at 300 m spatial resolution. Statistical analyses demonstrated that the RMS of the PWV derived from the proposed method was less than 2.2 mm, and the bias was close to 0, thereby filling the gap in the sub-kilometer high-precision PWV products.', '[Ma, Xiongwei; Yao, Yibin; Zhang, Bao] Wuhan Univ, Sch Geodesy & Geomat, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

The development of an automated and scalable coastline extraction methodology from satellite imagery is currently limited by the low availability of open, globally distributed and diverse labelled data with which to develop and benchmark techniques. Therefore, in this study we present the Sentinel-2 Water Edges Dataset (SWED), a new and bespoke labelled image dataset for the development and bench-marking of techniques for the automated extraction of coastline morphology data from Sentinel-2 images. Composed of 16 labelled training Sentinel-2 scenes, and 98 test label-image pairs, SWED is globally distributed and contains examples of many different coastline types and natural and anthropogenic coastline features. To provide a baseline of model performance against SWED we train and test four convolutional neural network models, based on the U-Net model architecture. Models are optimised using Categorical Cross-entropy Loss, Sorensen-Dice Loss and two novel loss functions we present for the focusing of model training attention to the boundary between land and water. Through a hybrid quantitative and qualitative model assessment process we demonstrate that the model trained using our novel Sobel-edge loss function has greater sensitivity to fine-scale, narrow coastline features whilst possessing near top quantitative performance demonstrated by Categorical Cross-entropy. The SWED dataset is published openly for use by the remote sensing and machine learning communities, whilst the Sobel-edge loss is available for use in machine learning applications where sensitivity to boundary features is important.', '[Seale, Catherine; Redfern, Thomas; Chatfield, Paul; Dempsey, Kari] UK Hydrog Off, Taunton TA1 2DN, Somerset, England.

In addition, information pertaining to discharge is scarce and inconsistent across the globe due to economic, geographic, and political reasons. Therefore, understanding spatiotemporal dynamics of river discharge in ungauged headwaters is extremely challenging, particularly in high mountain regions such as the Tibetan Plateau (TP). This study presents a methodology of estimating daily continuous discharge using multisource remote sensing and a hydrological model that can simulate cryospheric processes including snow and glacier accumulation and melt. The hydrological model is forced and calibrated purely by satellite-observed information, particularly by river widths derived from high-spatial-resolution images without using in situ river discharge measurements. Poorly gauged or ungauged headwaters with river widths on the order of 100 m, including the Lhasa (the tributary of the upper Brahmaputra River), Salween, Mekong, and Yangtze rivers originating on the TP were chosen to test the methodology. At-a-section river widths were derived from high-resolution satellite images (i.e., IKONOS, QuickBird, RapidEye-1/2/4/5, GeoEye-1, and WorldView-2) and Landsat archives. As exemplified by the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient values (NSE) (up to 0.8 and higher than 0.5 overall), simulated daily continuous discharge was reliable in the four testbeds with different river bathymetry, narrow river widths, and complex terrain. Uncertainties associated with the accuracy, number, and variability of calibration references (i.e., remotely sensed widths) and optimization algorithms were fully discussed. This study highlights the potential of deriving daily continuous discharge without a priori information on river flow, paving the way for discharge estimation in ungauged headwaters globally and providing important implications for satellite-based discharge estimation in narrow rivers across high-mountain regions.', '[Huang, Qi; Long, Di; Han, Zhongying; Han, Pengfei] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.', 'Tsinghua UniversityRP Long, D (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.', 'dlong@tsinghua.edu.cnRI Long, Di/N-8049-2013', 'Long, Di/0000-0001-9033-5039', 'National Natural Science Foundation of China [92047301, 91547210,   51722903]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research   (STEP) program [2019QZKK0105]; Planet through the Education and Research   Program', 'This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of   China (Grants No. 92047301, 91547210, and 51722903) and the Second   Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program   (2019QZKK0105) .

The evaluation of the quality of the FAPAR OLCI values was based on the availability of data acquired over several years by Sentinel-3A (S3A) and Sentinel 3B (S3B). The evaluation exercise consisted of several stages: first, an overall comparison of the two S3 platform products was carried out during the tandem phase; second, comparison with an FAPAR climatology derived from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) provided information on the seasonality of various types of land cover. Then, direct comparisons were made with the same type of FAPAR products retrieved from two sensors, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Sentinel-2 (S2) Multispectral Instrument (MSI), and with several ground-based estimates. In addition, an analysis of the efficiency of the retrieval algorithm with 3D radiative transfer simulations was performed. The results indicated that the consistency between daily and monthly S3A and S3B on a global scale was very good during the tandem phase (RMSD = 0.01 and a correlation R-2 of 0.99 with a bias of 0.003); we found an agreement with a correlation of 0.95 and 0.93 (RMSD = 0.07 and 0.09) with JRC FAPAR S2 and JRC FAPAR MODIS, respectively.

For the first time, a p-based approach to modeling forest reflectance was tested in a wide range of differently structured forests from different biomes. To parameterize the model, we measured forest canopy structure and spectral characteristics for 50 forest plots in four study sites spanning from boreal to temperate biomes in Europe (48 degrees -62 degrees N). We compared modeled forest reflectance spectra against airborne hyperspectral data at wavelengths of 450-2200 nm. Large overestimation occurred, especially in the near-infrared region, when the model was parameterized considering only leaves or needles as plant elements and assuming a Lambertian canopy. The model root mean square error (RMSE) was on average 80%, 80%, 54% for coniferous, broadleaved, and mixed forests, respectively. We suggest a new parameterization that takes into account the nadir to hemispherical reflectance ratio of the canopy and contribution of woody elements to the forest reflectance. We evaluated the new parameterization based on inversion of the model, which resulted in average RMSE of 20%, 15%, and 11% for coniferous, broadleaved, and mixed forests. The model requires only few structural parameters and the spectra of foliage, woody elements, and forest floor as input. It can be used in interpretation of multi- and hyperspectral remote sensing data, as well as in land surface and climate modeling. In general, our results also indicate that even though the foliage spectra are not dramatically different between coniferous and broadleaved forests, they can still explain a large part of reflectance differences between these forest types in the near-infrared, where sensitivity of the reflectance of dense forests to changes in the scattering properties of the foliage is high.', '[Hovi, Aarne; Schraik, Daniel; Juola, Jussi; Rautiainen, Miina] Aalto Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Built Environm, POB 14100, Aalto 00760, Finland.

Substantial evidence shows that edge effects cause profound changes in forest biodiversity and productivity. However, the broader impacts of edge effects on ecosystem functioning remain unclear. Assessing the three-dimensional arrangement of forest elements has the potential to unveil structural traits that are scalable and closely linked to important functional characteristics of the forest. Using over 600 high-resolution terrestrial laser scanning measurements, we present a detailed assessment of forest structural metrics linked to ecosystem processes such as energy harvesting and light use efficiency. Our results show a persistent change in forest structural characteristics along the edges of forest fragments, which resulted in a significantly lower structural diversity, in comparison with the interior of the forest fragments. These structural changes could be observed up to 35 m from the forest edges and are likely to reflect even deeper impacts on other ecosystem variables such as microclimate and biodiversity. Traits related to vertical plant material allocation were more affected than traits related to canopy height. We demonstrate a divergent response from the forest understory (higher vegetation density close to the edge) and the upper canopy (lower vegetation density close to the edge), indicating that assessing forest disturbances using vertically integrated metrics, such as total plant area index, can lead to an erroneous interpretation of no change. Our results demonstrate the strong potential of terrestrial laser scanning for benchmarking broader-scale (e.g. airborne and space-borne) remote sensing assessments of forest distur-bances, as well as to provide a more robust interpretation of biophysical changes detected at coarser resolutions.', '[Maeda, Eduardo Eiji; Nunes, Matheus Henrique] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, POB 68, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.

They can also be a valuable indicator for ecosystem health and climate change. Inventory of lichen abundance at regional scales is required to assess availability within caribou ranges, and assess potential declines from natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Previous studies have mapped lichen cover and volume using remote sensing, but these efforts were often constrained by the limited availability of ground truth information needed for model calibration and validation. In this study, we leveraged unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys and WorldView (WV) satellite scenes in a nested upscaling approach in order to expand the number of training samples at the 30 m Landsat resolution. These were used to develop machine learning models to map fractional reindeer lichen cover in Eastern Canada. We found that the best correlation between UAV and WV derived lichen coverages exists at an optimal scale that is slightly larger than 30 m and varies with landscape type and observation geometry. Based on training data from UAV-calibrated lichen coverage from WV data, a neural network model with simple structure achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.09, a mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.07 and R-2 = 0.79 for mapping fractional lichen cover from Landsat without the use of ancillary data. We then applied our model and Landsat data to produce a lichen fractional cover map for the Red Wine Mountain caribou herd range in Labrador, NL and the Manicouagan caribou herd range in Que \' bec. Validation against domain-averaged lichen cover in eight UAV survey sites suggests an accuracy with RMSE = 0.04, MAE = 0.03 and R-2 = 0.62 for low lichen cover. Compared to aggregated lichen cover at 30 m from UAV surveys, map accuracy decreases to RMSE = 0.09, MAE = 0.06, and R-2 = 0.49, partially due to registration error between UAV and Landsat images. Our study demonstrates that upscaling of lichen cover from UAV data to Landsat via an intermediate image scale is an effective regional-scale mapping approach.', '[He, Liming; Chen, Wenjun; Leblanc, Sylvain G.; Lovitt, Julie; Fraser, Robert H.; Latifovic, Rasim; Sun, Lixin; Prevost, Christian; White, H.

Many studies have explored on PV module detection based on color aerial photography and manual photo interpretation. Imaging spectroscopy data are capable of providing detailed spectral information to identify the spectral features of PV, and thus potentially become a promising resource for automated and operational PV detection. However, PV detection with imaging spectroscopy data must cope with the vast spectral diversity of surface materials, which is commonly divided into spectral intra-class variability and interclass similarity. We have developed an approach to detect PV modules based on their physical absorption and reflection characteristics using airborne imaging spectroscopy data. A large database was implemented for training and validating the approach, including spectra-goniometric measurements of PV modules and other materials, a HyMap image spectral library containing 31 materials with 5627 spectra, and HySpex imaging spectroscopy data sets covering Oldenburg, Germany. By normalizing the widely used Hydrocarbon Index (HI), we solved the intra-class variability caused by different detection angles, and validated it against the spectragoniometric measurements. Knowing that PV modules are composed of materials with different transparencies, we used a group of spectral indices and investigated their interdependencies for PV detection with implementing the image spectral library. Finally, six well-trained spectral indices were applied to HySpex data acquired in Oldenburg, Germany, yielding an overall PV map. Four subsets were selected for validation and achieved overall accuracies, producer\'s accuracies and user\'s accuracies, respectively. This physics-based approach was validated against a large database collected from multiple platforms (laboratory measurements, airborne imaging spectroscopy data), thus providing a robust, transferable and applicable way to detect PV modules using imaging spectroscopy data. We aim to create greater awareness of the potential importance and applicability of airborne and spaceborne imaging spectroscopy data for PV modules identification.', '[Ji, Chaonan; Bachmann, Martin; Esch, Thomas; Heldens, Wieke; Metz-Marconcini, Annekatrin; Zeidler, Julian] German Aerosp Ctr, German Remote Sensing Data Ctr, Wessling, Germany.

Data from these comprehensive field surveys offer immense value for advancing remote sensing technology to map crop production across Indonesia, particularly through the development of machine learning approaches to relate survey data with satellite imagery. The objective of this study was to compare different machine learning scenarios for classifying and mapping the temporal progression of paddy rice production stages across West Java, Indonesia using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. Monthly paddy rice survey data at 21,696 locations across West Java from November 2018 through April 2019 were used for model training and testing. Five classes related to rice production stage or other field conditions were defined, including rice at tillering, heading, and harvest stages, rice fields with little to no vegetation present, and non-rice areas. A recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short term memory (LSTM) nodes provided optimal performance with classification accuracies of 79.6% and 75.9% for model training and testing, respectively, and reduced computational effort. Other approaches that incorporated a convolutional neural network (CNN) either reduced classification accuracy or increased computational effort. Deep machine learning methods (RNN and CNN) generally outperformed other non-deep classifiers, which achieved up to 63.3% accuracy for model testing. Classification accuracies were optimized by inputting two Sentinel-1 channels (VH and VV polarizations) and ten Sentinel-2 channels. Temporal patterns of paddy rice production stages were consistent between the monthly ground-based agricultural survey data and 10-m, satellite-based rice classification maps obtained by applying the LSTM-based RNN across West Java. The results demonstrated the value of combining modern agricultural survey data, satellite remote sensing, and a recurrent neural network to develop multitemporal maps of paddy rice production stages.', '[Thorp, K.

This study presents a new processing scheme combining radar (Copernicus Sentinel-1) and optical satellite data (Copernicus Sentinel-2) to quickly and easily map landscape changes such as landslides, coastal uplift and changes in water bodies caused by a severe event such as an earthquake. The processing scheme has been tested for the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake (Mw 7.8), New Zealand, which impacted vast and mostly inaccessible areas, causing hundreds of landslides. The workflow combines the following change-detection methods: i) Sentinel-1 amplitude change detection ii) Sentinel-2-based detection of non-vegetated areas that occurred after the event using the atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI). To get a more complex view of the surface changes caused by the Kaikoura earthquake, the available online services and tools were further tested (open source via the European Space Agency) allowing automatic detection of vertical displacements and deformations. It was concluded, that the above-mentioned approaches facilitated the assessment of earthquake-triggered changes in a comprehensive manner. The methodology is an example of how to detect earthquake landscape changes in an automatic and rapid manner. The new processing scheme for the synergic use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data has high potential to be used for operational and scientific purposes, since it relies on globally available, free data and provides high spatial and temporal resolution.

Almost 96% of the forest coverage was lost due to impacts related to feral goats and wildfires. To date, goats have been eradicated and the restoration of the native vegetation communities is underway. The purpose of this study was to develop a 3D Structural Classification Method (3D-SCM) using Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) for mapping the vertical structure of the forest and to automatically characterize its physical attributes. Several TLS scans were performed in July 2016 to assess this recovery, particularly the succession progression. The 3D-SCM used the Forest Condition Classification (FCC) based on radiometric intensity and height values, and the Individual Shape Index (ISI) based on geometry and intensity parameters. It was designed to classify vegetation by stratum using a trial-and-error model to semi-automatically identify impacted areas and succession. The 3D-SCM was able to differentiate the vegetation strata by each forest community at the stand level with a precision of 93% as well as the tree structure parts (stem, branches, and leaves) with a precision of 97%, it also fits the best characteristic shape for the Guadalupe cypress (decagon) and for the pine (droplet). The resulting 3D-SCM provide precise physical specifications, demonstrates a high correlation R-2 = 0.949 for (Diameter Breast Height) DBH, R-2 = 0.974 for the crown and R-2 = 0.97 for heights between maximum laser pulse of tree heights and crowns with respect to field measurements. Mapping 3D vertical forest measurements are important for quantifying the success of management practices and to assist future restoration actions, as it will allow quantification of forest dynamics and carbon sequestration on this island.', '[Yepez-Rincon, Fabiola D.; Ferrino-Fierro, Adrian L.] Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, San Nicolas De Los Garza, Nuevo Leon, Mexico.

The retrieval method is based on the Bayesian approach with the a priori information provided by atmospheric and oceanic models for surface wind and currents, respectively. The backscatter and Doppler frequency shift are estimated from the along-track interferometric SAR system TanDEM-X data. The retrieval results are compared against in-situ measurements along the Swedish west coast. It is found that the wind retrieval reduces the atmospheric model bias compared to in-situ measurements by about 1 m/s for wind speed, while the bias reduction in the wind direction is minor as the wind direction provided by the model was accurate in the studied cases. The ocean model bias compared to in-situ measurements is reduced by about 0.04 m/s and 12 circle for current speed and direction, respectively. It is shown that blending SAR data with model data is particularly useful in complex situations such as atmospheric and oceanic fronts. This is demonstrated through two case studies in the Skagerrak Sea along the Swedish west coast.

Tracking the temporal and spatial changes in SAV is crucial for the identification of state changes in lacustrine ecosystems, such as changes in light, nutrients, and temperature. However, the available SAV classification algorithms based on remote sensing are highly dependent on field survey data and/or human interventions, prohibiting the extraction of large-scale and/or long-term patterns. Here, we developed an automatic SAV classification algorithm using Landsat imagery, where the thresholds of two key parameters (the floating algae index (FAI) and reflectance in the shortwave-infrared (SWIR) band) are automatically determined. The algorithm was applied to eight Landsat images of four Yangtze Plain lakes and obtained a mean producer accuracy of 82.9% when gauged against field-surveyed datasets. The algorithm was further employed to obtain long-term SAV areal data from Changdang Lake on the Yangtze Plain from 1984 to 2018, and the result was highly consistent with lake transparency data. Numerical simulations indicated that our developed algorithm is insensitive to the Chl-a concentration of the water column. Yet, it has a detection limit of similar to 0.35 m below the water surface, and such a limit changes with different fractions of vegetation coverage within a pixel. The automatic classification algorithm proposed in this study has the potential to obtain the temporal and spatial distribution patterns of SAV in other shallow lakes where SAV grows in lakes sharing similar hydrological characteristics as the lakes in the Yangtze Plain.', '[Dai, Yanhui; Feng, Lian; Hou, Xuejiao] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.

The flexible deployment of these UAV-HSI systems have the potential to expand the data acquisition window to acceptable (though non-ideal) atmospheric conditions. This is an important consideration for time-sensitive applications (e.g. phenology) in areas with persistent cloud cover. Since the majority of UAV studies have focused on applications with ideal illumination conditions (e.g. minimal or non-cloud cover), little is known to what extent UAV-HSI data are affected by changes in illumination conditions due to variable cloud cover. In this study, we acquired UAV pushbroom HSI (400-2500 nm) over three consecutive days with various illumination conditions (i.e. cloud cover), which were complemented with downwelling irradiance data to characterize illumination conditions and in-situ and laboratory reference panel measurements across a range of reflectivity (i.e. 2%, 10%, 18% and 50%) used to evaluate reflectance products. Using these data we address four fundamental aspects for UAV-HSI acquired under various conditions ranging from high (624.6 - 16.63 W.m(2)) to low (2.5 - 0.9 W.m(2)) direct irradiance: atmospheric compensation, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), spectral vegetation indices and endmembers extraction. For instance, two atmospheric compensation methods were applied, a radiative transfer model suitable for high direct irradiance, and an Empirical Line Model (ELM) for diffuse irradiance conditions. SNR results for two distinctive vegetation classes (i.e. tree canopy vs herbaceous vegetation) reveal wavelength dependent attenuation by cloud cover, with higher SNR under high direct irradiance for canopy vegetation. Spectral vegetation index (SVIs) results revealed high variability and index dependent effects. For example, NDVI had significant differences (p < 0.05) across illumination conditions, while NDWI appeared insensitive at the canopy level. Finally, often neglected diffuse illumination conditions may be beneficial for revealing spectral features in vegetation that are obscured by the predominantly non-Lambertian reflectance encountered under high direct illumination. To our knowledge, our study is the first to use a full range pushbroom UAV sensor (400-2500 nm) for assessing illumination effects on the aforementioned variables. Our findings pave the way for understanding the advantages and limitations of ultra-high spatial resolution full range high fidelity UAV-HSI for ecological and other applications.', '[Arroyo-Mora, J.

While a variety of remote sensing-based burn severity indices have been developed, the Landsat-based differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) presents the most widely-used approach to burn severity assessment for fire research and management. Although dNBR-based approaches have been continuously updated, including the development of the relative dNBR (RdNBR) and the Relativized Burn Ratio (RBR), one key obstacle for the reliable applications of the burn severity indices in the high northern latitudes has not been adequately addressed. Specifically, optimal Landsat image pairs are very rarely available for the calculation of the burn severity indices in certain regions of the high northern latitudes (HNL), resulting in the burn severity index outputs calculated for a large number of wildfires being considerably affected by non-fire-related factors. The suboptimal selection of image pairs may have partially contributed to the lack of consistency in the performance of the burn severity indices in the HNL regions. In this paper, we systematically evaluated the impacts of sub-optimal image pairs on signal stability through two sets of analyses conducted at different spatial scales. First, at the regional scale, we examined the burn severity indices calculated for a selection of wildfires in Alaska. Here, we demonstrate the inconsistent performance of the same index calculated based on Landsat data that are typically considered as \"optimal\". In addition, we show that the calculated indices may be more prone to the negative impacts of these inconsistencies, thus leading to reduced reliability, when there is limited Landsat data availability. Second, at the continental scale, we show that certain areas in the HNL, especially Alaska during the pre-2000 era, are subject to the potentially strong negative impact associated with the limited data availability. Through systematically analyzing this issue, we hope to not only divert more attention to it but also to provide potential solutions, based on which further improvements that may be of particular importance for research on Arctic wildfires could be made.', '[Chen, Dong; Hall, Joanne V.; Loboda, Tatiana V.] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

However, net photosynthetic CO2 assimilation rate (A) does not linearly correlate with ETR when the fraction of electron partitioning into photosynthesis and photorespiration changes under fluctuating environmental conditions (CO2, light, temperature and soil moisture).   Here, we propose a practical approach to estimate A based on ETR with integration of stomatal conductance (g(s)) and leaf temperature, taking intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i)- and temperature-dependent electron partitioning into account.   A estimated with the present approach was in good agreement with A measured under i) various CO2 concentrations and light intensities in seedlings of Japanese beech and Japanese white birch, and ii) under 400 and 800 mu mol mol(-1) CO2 and temperatures of 15-40 degrees C, and iii) in progress of drought stress after a water withholding in seedlings of Japanese white birch. Furthermore, canopy-level CO2 uptake could be estimated based on the spectroscopic and flux observations over a Japanese beech stand, under a wide range of environmental conditions.

In particular, they provide a unique insight into the hydrodynamics of the surface ocean and phytoplankton phenology. This information can be combined with in-situ observations of higher trophic levels to understand the functioning of the marine ecosystem, with potential use for fisheries and aquaculture. In the Gulf of Maine, off the eastern seaboard of North America, Georges Bank is one of the world\'s most productive natural sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) fisheries, which sustains economically valuable fisheries in Canada and the US. In Canada, the relationship between the scallop meat weight and its shell height (known as scallop condition) is used to obtain biomass estimates for stock assessment and thereby influences the fishing quotas. On Georges Bank, for a 100 mm shell height scallop, scallop condition has varied significantly interannually between 10.2 g and 19.5 g. Establishing a relationship between environmental factors and scallop condition would improve the forecasting of scallop biomass and reduce the uncertainty when determining the total allowable catch for the subsequent fishing season. In this study, satellite remote-sensed sea-surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chia) coupled with in-situ measurements of scallop condition (SC) on Georges Bank were used to assess the relationship between SC and satellite-derived environmental conditions between 1985 and 2019 for SST and between 1998 and 2019 for Chla. The inter-annual variation of SC in May was found to be positively correlated (p-value <0.001) with the variation in SST in winter-spring months of the current and previous year of the SC survey. An empirical linear model for the estimation of SC was developed and validated using two independent datasets of satellite SST (r(2) = 0.64, MAPD = 7%). Another model using cumulative SST in the previous year only was also provided (r(2) = 0.58, MAPD = 7.7%), which could serve as an alternative choice when the SST products in the current year are not yet available for use. There was a weak relationship observed between SC and Chla; this is likely due to the influence of water-column vertical mixing on transport of phytoplankton to the benthic zone where the sea scallop resides. Our study indicates that a cost-effective satellite-derived SST product can be used to improve predictions of SC and provide useful information and decision support tools for managing scallop stocks.', '[Liu, Xiaohan; Devred, Emmanuel; Johnson, Catherine L.; Keith, Dave; Sameoto, Jessica A.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Bedford Inst Oceanog, POB 1006, Dartmouth, NS B2Y 4A2, Canada.

Assuming that the geometry and properties of an oceanic eddy are orientation-sensitive, an angularly aligned composite analysis of over 40 million eddy-focused surface topographic \"snapshots\" obtained by merging tandem altimeter data from January 1993 through January 2019 reveals that oceanic vortices appear to have a characteristic surface shape of \"egg\" rather than circle or ellipse as previously understood. Consequently, a second-order moment in eddy morphology is revealed which leads to a similar to 10 km departure from a standard ellipse in terms of major axis. Furthermore, the sharp poles of oceanic eddies exhibit two quasi-orthogonal modes of orientation: primarily meridional and secondarily zonal. The additional submesoscale asymmetry in eddy shape is confirmed by a consistent anisotropy in a normalized eddy-centric velocity field derived from over 25 thousand drifters. The high-order moments in terms of geometric asymmetry and dynamic anisotropy associated with mesoscale eddies (which are found to be statistically significant at 99% level) may have profound geophysical and biological impacts on energy transport, substance entrainment, as well as ecosystem dynamics in the ocean. In particular, it is demonstrated that some of the previously identified patterns in eddy properties obtained by non-rotated normalization may be notably biased due to the ignorance of existing eddy orientation.', '[Chen, Ge; Yang, Jie; Han, Guiyan] Ocean Univ China, Inst Adv Ocean Study, Dept Marine Technol, Qingdao, Peoples R China.

Time-series approaches have been widely applied to classify plant species; however, developing time-series with high spatial and temporal resolution over coastal zones remains challenging due to the influence caused by frequent cloud cover and periodic tidal fluctuations. In this study, aiming at the above challenges, we presented a saltmarsh vegetation classification method using phenological parameters derived from Sentinel-2 pixel-differential time-series (PDTS): first, a PDTS that each pixel has a different distribution of observations was constructed using a time series cloud mask; second, a tidal filter determined by the threshold and frequency of the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) was used to exclude tide-related observations from the PDTS; third, phenological parameters that highlight the differences among salt marsh vegetation were extracted from a two term Fourier fitting curve as classification features; and finally, the random forest algorithm was used for plant species classification with the assistance of sample data. Six common plant species (Spartina alterniflora, Phragmites australis, Suaeda salsa, Tamarix chinensis, Imperata cylindrica, and Scirpus mariqueter) from three representative coastal sites in China were analyzed. The major results were as follows: (1) The MNDWI demonstrated superior ability in identifying flooding pixels, with an overall accuracy of similar to 0.91. After tidal filtering, the R-2 of the fitting curve for more than 70% of the vegetated salt marsh pixels was improved with an average increase of 0.113. (2) The six plant species exhibit unique phenological characteristics. In particular, P. australis has an advanced green-up season, 19-42 days earlier than that of the other plant species mentioned above, whereas S. alterniflora senesces one to two months later than the native plant species. (3) The average overall accuracy of the plant species classification based on the PDTS was 81.5%. Compared with a single-image based classification, the PDTS-based classification demonstrated a 5.1% improvement in overall accuracy, which is expected to serve the annual monitoring dynamics of the salt marsh.', '[Sun, Chao; Li, Jialin] Ningbo Univ, Dept Geog & Spatial Informat Tech, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

At large spatial scales, remote sensing-based (RS) models are often used to quantify ET. Despite the large number of RS ET models available, few include soil moisture as a key environmental input, which can degrade model accuracy and utility. Here, we use model assimilation enhanced soil moisture estimates from the NASA SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) mission as a water supply control in the MOD16 ET algorithm framework. SMAP-derived daily surface (0-5 cm depth) and root zone (0-1 m depth) soil moisture are used with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) vegetation observations, and 4 km gridded regional surface meteorology (Gridmet) as primary inputs for estimating daily ET and underlying model soil and stomatal conductance terms. We calibrated the model environmental response parameters using tower eddy covariance ET observations representing major North American biomes. The model ET results were validated using a holdout set of tower observations spanning a large regional climate gradient. The updated ET estimates outperform the baseline MOD16 product across all tower validation sites (RMSE = 0.758 vs 1.108 mm day(-1); R-2 = 0.68 vs 0.45, respectively). Smaller relative improvements were obtained using a recalibrated model with 4 km Gridmet meteorology, but no soil moisture control (RMSE = 0.813 mm day(-1); R-2 = 0.66), indicating that these changes are essential for the improved model performance. The soil moisture-constrained model improvements and relative benefits from the SMAP observations are greater in arid climates, consistent with stronger soil moisture control on ET in water-limited regions. The use of SMAP soil moisture as an additional model constraint improves MOD16 regional performance and provides a new framework for investigating both soil and atmosphere controls on ET.', '[Brust, Colin; Kimball, John S.] Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Numer Terradynam Simulat Grp, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.

In this paper, we use the 1978 Ms 7.4 Tabas-e-Golshan earthquake in eastern Iran as a case study to test how scan resolution affects digitisation and hence the measurements of deformation. We scanned 6 aerial photographs that were acquired in 1956 with 150, 300, 600 and 1200 dots per inch (dpi), and generated four sets of pre-earthquake digital elevation model (DEM) covering the Tabas fold. By differencing the pre-earthquake DEMs and the post earthquake DEM derived from SPOT-6 data acquired in 2013, we made four measurements of slip on the Tabas fold. We compared our measurements to the published model which was derived from matching the pre earthquake Hexagon Keyhole-9 US image and the post-earthquake SPOT-2 and SPOT-6 images, and found that the 600 dpi scans yield the most consistent result among the four different resolutions, with a misfit of 0.7 m. A different resolution might well be better for a different set of aerial photographs, depending on the quality and photographic scale of the images. We scanned 20 aerial photographs that cover the Kurit fold to the south of the Tabas fold with 600 dpi and used them to investigate the slip on that segment. Similarly, DEMs were extracted first to produce the DEM of difference (DoD). Five swath profiles taken from the DoD show clear discontinuities across two fault strands, i.e. the main Kurit fault (the western strand) and a back thrust (the eastern strand). Based on the profile measurements, we implemented Monte Carlo modelling of elastic dislocation and obtained a slip of 1.4 m and 2.2 m on the western and eastern strands respectively. By combining all the information about the earthquake and postseismic slip, we inferred a coseismic slip of 3.5 m on the detachment fault by which most of the seismic moment was released. This slip enhanced the applied load on part of the Kurit fault, which is partly responsible for the long-lasting postseismic deformation in the region.', '[Lu, Lejun; Zhou, Yu] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Geodynam & Geohazards, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.

We also explored the utility of L-band sigma 0HH to detect FYI and MYI melt onset dates. For both ice types, L-band exhibited a similar sigma 0HH evolution to Cand Ku-bands. A rise in L-band sigma 0HH was observed from winter to melt onset, however, with a lower magnitude attributed to the larger penetration of L-band microwaves through the snow-covered sea ice medium. Over FYI, L-band sigma(0)(HH) exhibited the most robust response and greater diversity in melt onset signature, compared to Cand Ku-bands. Over MYI, L-band sigma(0)(HH) declined during the winter to melt onset transition contrasting the Cand Ku-band evolution of sigma(0)(HH) during melt onset. Although, a distinct L-band sigma(0)(HH) response was not found during pond onset, a very strong sigma(0)(HH) response was found during sea ice break-up, which could operationally be utilized to identify sea ice break-up timing. During freeze-up, L-band sigma(0)(HH) showed greater diversity compared to Cand Ku-bands. Our study also found that, L-band detected melt onset dates were up to 6 days later than Cand Ku-band detected dates, for both ice types. The melt response was the strongest at L-band for FYI, where C-band detected a robust melt onset date for MYI. Therefore, for operational sea ice monitoring, L-band suits better for FYI, whereas C-band is still a better choice for MYI. In the warming Arctic, where FYI has become the dominant ice type, L-band demonstrates promise to be the optimal choice for sea ice operational monitoring with high spatiotemporal data acquisition from existing, upcoming and proposed L-band SAR missions.', '[Mahmud, Mallik S.; Geldsetzer, Torsten; Yackel, John] Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.

Here we mapped thaw subsidence and frost heave signals over the Toolik Lake area on the North Slope of Alaska using 12 ALOS PALSAR Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) scenes (2006-2010). For the first time, we jointly analyzed InSAR observations with a large number of soil measurements collected within similar to 100 km of the Toolik Field Station. We found that the InSAR-observed deformation patterns are mainly related to soil water content and the seasonal active layer freeze-thaw (FT) cycle. We did not observe any substantial long-term subsidence trend outside the 2007 Anaktuvuk River Fire scar. This suggests that the magnitude of the maximum annual thaw subsidence did not change much outside the fire zone during the study period. The joint analysis of InSAR and field observations allows us to show that the amplitude of the seasonal thaw subsidence is proportional to the total amount of ice that has melted into liquid water at any given time. We note that topography influences the spatial distribution of soil water content, and the availability of soil water influences the type of vegetation that can grow. As a result, we found that the average seasonal thaw subsidence increases along a geomorphic-ecohydrologic transect with heath vegetation on the drier ridge-tops, tussock tundra on hillslopes, and sedge tundra at the wet lowland riparian zones. In addition, we detected a net uplift between late July and early September, mostly in the wetter riparian zone that experienced a larger seasonal thaw subsidence. Toolik Field Station in-situ records suggest that the air temperature fluctuated around or below freezing in early September during the ALOS PALSAR data acquisition times (at similar to 12 am local time). In this scenario, ice can be formed at the top of the soil, which leads to frost heave in saturated soils. Our results highlight how InSAR can improve our understanding of active layer freeze-thaw and water storage dynamics in permafrost environments.', '[Chen, Jingyi; Wu, Yue] Univ Texas Austin, Cockrell Sch Engn, Dept Aerosp Engn & Engn Mech, Austin, TX 78712 USA.

Lake reclamation (i.e., conversion of natural lake/wetland areas to agricultural/urban land or aquaculture, thereby reducing the area of natural waters) in particular has greatly contributed to meeting the increasing demands for food and urban development. However, until now, a comprehensive quantification and understanding of historical anthropogenic lacustrine exploitation in this region has been lacking, prohibiting assessment of the impacts of these activities. We used Landsat observations from 1973 to 2018 to track reclamation-induced changes in 112 large lakes (97.8% of the total lake area) in the Yangtze Plain. We show that 41.6% (6056.9 km(2)) of the total lake area has been reclaimed since the 1970s. The expansion of agricultural and built-up lands dominated the reclamation activities in the 1970s, while the increase of aquaculture zones has prevailed since the mid-1980s. Reclamation activities were closely connected to government policies and major socio-economic events and had strong impacts on lake hydrology, flood risk mitigation capacity, and water quality as revealed by satellite and in situ observations. This new quantitative understanding of anthropogenic reclamation and its associated impacts on Yangtze Plain freshwater lakes can underpin the development of strategies to reduce the impacts of lake reclamation on environmental quality. The study has also demonstrated the unique strength of using long-term series satellite images in tracking historical environmental changes in a substantial region of the world, and the methods used here are potentially extendable to other inland and coastal areas to understand similar human-environment interaction problems.', '[Hou, Xuejiao; Feng, Lian; Liu, Junguo; Wang, Junjian; Xu, Yang; Dai, Yanhui; Zheng, Yi; Zheng, Chunmiao] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, State Environm Protect Key Lab Integrated Surface, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.

The aerosol phase function, which characterizes the angular signature of scattering, has been continuously monitored from ground-based and space-borne observations. However, the range of scattering angles these instruments can sample is very limited. Here, we report multi-year measurements from a mountain-top remote sensing instrument: the California Laboratory for Atmospheric Remote Sensing Fourier Transform Spectrometer (CLARS-FTS), which overlooks the Los Angeles megacity. The observational geometries of CLARS-FTS provide a wide range of scattering angles, from about 20 degrees (forward) to about 140 degrees (backward), which is larger than the range provided by any existing aerosol remote sensing instrument. We then quantify the aerosol angular scattering effect using the O-2 ratio, which is the ratio of retrieved O-2 Slant Column Density (SCD) to geometric O-2 SCD. The O-2 ratio quantifies the light path modification due to aerosol scattering, with a value of 1 representing an aerosol-free scenario. The lower the O-2 ratio value than 1, the stronger the aerosol loading. CLARS-FTS measurements are highly sensitive to the angular scattering effect of aerosols in the Los Angeles (LA) urban atmosphere, due to the long light path going through the boundary layer and the wide range of observational angles. The differences in aerosol scattering between different surface reflection points targeted by CLARS-FTS can be explained by differences in their angular scattering geometries. The correlation between measurements at different targets can be used to quantify the strength of the angular dependence of the aerosol phase function. Applying the correlation technique to CLARS-FTS measurements, we find that, from 2011 to 2018, there is no significant trend in the aerosol phase function in the LA megacity. Overall, this study provides a practical observing strategy for quantifying the angular dependence of aerosol scattering in urban atmospheres that could potentially contribute towards improved greenhouse gas remote sensing in megacities.', '[Zeng, Zhao-Cheng] Univ Calif Los Angeles, JIFRESSE, Los Angeles, CA USA.

Remote sensing data, especially the nighttime light images, have been widely used to delineate urbanized areas across the world. Meanwhile, some emerging urban data, such as volunteered geographical information (e.g., OpenStreetMap) and social sensing data (e.g., mobile phone and social media), have also shown great potential in revealing urban boundaries and dynamics. However, consistent and robust methods to quantify urban areas from these multi-source data have remained elusive. Here, we propose a percolation-based method to extract urban areas from these multi-source urban data. We derive the optimal urban/non-urban threshold by considering the critical nature of urban systems with the support of the percolation theory. Furthermore, we apply the method with three open-source datasets - population, road, and nighttime light - to 28 countries. We show that the proposed method captures the similar urban characteristics in terms of urban areas from multi-source data, and Zipf\'s law holds well in most countries. The accuracy of the derived urban areas by different datasets has been validated with the Landsat-based reference data in 10 cities, and the accuracy can be further improved through data fusion (kappa = 0.69-0.85, mean kappa = 0.78).

In order to exploit the full range of unprecedented observational capabilities of VIIRS, we have developed a nighttime shortwave radiative transfer model capability in the UNified and Linearized Radiative Transfer Model (UNL-VRTM). This capability is based on the use of additional source functions to treat illumination from the Moon, from fires, and from artificial lights. We have applied this model to address fundamental questions associated with the VIIRS sensing of aerosol and fire at night. Detailed description of model developments and validation (either directly with surface measurements of lunar spectra or indirectly through cross validation) are presented. Our analysis reveals that: (a) when convolution with the broad-range (500-900 nm) relative spectral response (RSR) function of the VIIRS Day-Night Band (DNB) is omitted, AOD retrieval from the DNB have uncertainties up to a factor of two in conditions with low or moderate AOD (<0.5 in mid-visible); (b) using a wavelength independent spectrum for the surface illumination source can lead to an AOD bias of -10% over surfaces illuminated by light-emitting diodes and fluorescent lamps, and -30% illuminated by high-pressure sodium lamps; and (c) a DNB-equivalent narrow band for AOD retrieval over the surfaces illuminated by the three types of bulbs studied in this paper is found to be centered at 585 nm at which the look-up table can be generated for AOD retrieval from DNB. Furthermore, while uncertainty in AOD retrievals from the DNB decreases as AOD increases, fire characterization can be affected by AOD; for a smoke-scenario AOD of 2.0, the DNB and SWIR (1.6 mu m) radiances can be reduced by 50% depending on the fire area fraction and temperature within VIIRS pixel. DNB is overall more sensitive to smaller and cooler fires than SWIR and can be used to retrieve AOD over bright surfaces. Finally, three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer effects and the non-collimated nature of most artificial light sources are neglected in this 1D radiative transfer (plane-parallel) model, resulting in possibly large uncertainties (e.g., the inability to reproduce side-illumination of clouds by city lights) that should be studied in future.', '[Wang, Jun; Zhou, Meng; Xu, Xiaoguang; Roudini, Sepehr] Univ Iowa, Iowa Technol Inst, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, 4133 Seamans Ctr, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.

Unlike the existing scatterometer missions, GNSS-R uses L-Band navigation signals that can penetrate through clouds and rain. Rain may have a negligible impact on the transmitted signal in terms of path attenuation at this wavelength. However, there are other effects due to rain, such as changes in surface roughness and rain induced local winds, which can significantly alter the measurements. Currently, there is no observation-based characterization of all possible impacts of rain on radar forward scatter, which is the nature of operation of GNSS-R missions. In this study, we propose a 3-fold rain model which accounts for attenuation, surface effects of rain and rain induced local winds. We utilize the large dataset of measurements made by the CYGNSS mission to separate these different effects of rain. The attenuation model suggests that a total of at least 96% transmissivity exists at L-Band up to a rain rate of 30 mm/h. A perturbation model is used to characterize the other rain effects. It suggests that rain is accompanied by an overall reduction in the scattering cross-section of the ocean surface and, most importantly, this effect is observed only up to surface wind speeds of 15 m/s, beyond which the gravity capillary waves dominate the scattering in the quasi-specular direction. Observations also suggest that, at very low wind speeds, the lower bound on wavenumber of the portion of the surface roughness spectrum that influences the measurements deviates from the geometric optics approximation normally used.

Due to the coarse node spacing of the tropospheric models, like ERA-Interim and other external data like Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), the interpolation techniques are not able to well replicate the localized and turbulent tropospheric effects. In this study, we propose a new technique based on machine learning (ML) Gaussian processes (GP) regression approach using the combination of small-baseline interferograms and GNSS derived zenith total delay (ZTD) values to mitigate phase delay caused by troposphere in interferometric observations.

To meet these needs, the U.S. Geological Survey has implemented a capability to monitor land surface change called the Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP) initiative. This paper describes the methodological foundations and lessons learned during development and testing of the LCMAP approach. Testing and evaluation of a suite of 10 annual land cover and land surface change data sets over six diverse study areas across the United States revealed good agreement with other published maps (overall agreement ranged from 73% to 87%) as well as several challenges that needed to be addressed to meet the goals of robust, repeatable, and geographically consistent monitoring results from the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm. First, the high spatial and temporal variability of observational frequency led to differences in the number of changes identified, so CCDC was modified such that change detection is dependent on observational frequency. Second, the CCDC classification methodology was modified to improve its ability to characterize gradual land surface changes. Third, modifications were made to the classification element of CCDC to improve the representativeness of training data, which necessitated replacing the random forest algorithm with a boosted decision tree. Following these modifications, assessment of prototype Version 1 LCMAP results showed improvements in overall agreement (ranging from 85% to 90%).', '[Brown, Jesslyn F.; Tollerud, Heather J.; Barber, Christopher P.; Zhou, Qiang; Dwyer, John L.; Vogelmann, James E.; Loveland, Thomas R.; Pengra, Bruce W.; Smith, Kelcy; Xian, George; Auch, Roger F.; Sohl, Terry L.; Sayler, Kristi L.; Gallant, Alisa L.; Zelenak, Daniel; Reker, Ryan R.; Rover, Jennifer] US Geol Survey, Earth Resources Observat & Sci EROS, 47914 252nd St, Sioux Falls, SD 57198 USA.

At the coastline, however, small-scale fog oases harbor a specialized vegetation and fauna, living from moisture by fog, which is used by humans to feed water demands of industrial projects. To date, knowledge about fog and low stratus (FLS) clouds as well as their physical properties is limited in that only local observations or spatial products from satellites with coarse resolutions are available generally failing to capture local patterns resulting from the complex topography. Consequently, we provide the first climatology of FLS with 30 m spatial resolution based on over 400 Landsat scenes acquired since 1986. The new product provides valuable estimates of FLS optical and micro-physical properties. FLS over the Pacific Ocean featured cloud optical depth values around 13.5 declining over land to 4.2. Effective radii were around 5.3 mu m. Liquid water path was between 71.0 gm(-2) over the Ocean and 14.9 gm(-2) over land surfaces. The climatologies of the new Landsat product were successfully validated against those of the MODIS cloud property product over homogeneous surfaces. Over areas with heterogeneous topographies, the new product outperforms existing ones with coarse spatial resolutions if compared against in situ measurements. This shows the general need for cloud products with high spatial resolutions in areas where the development of small scale clouds is favored e.g., by a complex topography leading to systematical biases in existing retrievals.', '[Lehnert, Lukas W.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany.

A random point generation algorithm was used to generate the voting points for functional zone category identification, and then a trained CNN model was employed to assign functional attributes to those voting points. Then a statistical method was involved to count the frequency of the classified voting points of different functional attributes in each basic functional zone units. By voting process, the functional attribute with the highest frequency was assigned to the basic functional zone unit, which corrected the misclassification results of CNN to some extent. This paper also explored the scale effect of the SO on the final functional zone classification result from two aspects, spatial scale of SO and the sampling window size of CNN model. Because of the natural differences between functional zone division and land cover classification, region based overall accuracy assessment method was used to evaluate functional zone division result. Compared with other methods, SO-CNN method can generate higher accuracy and subtle result, based on which larger spatial scale results can be available by scaling-up, so SO-CNN method plays a great significant role on small scale functional space structure research.', '[Zhou, Wen; Ming, Dongping; Lv, Xianwei; Zhou, Keqi; Bao, Hanqing; Hong, Zhaoli] China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Informat Engn, 29 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.

Accordingly, huge attention is directed towards the development of innovative and reliable approaches for the damage analysis of the Cultural Heritage assets. Within this framework, this paper deals with an integrated approach for the combination of deformation time series, derived from the Tomographic processing of X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired by the Italian COSMO-SkyMed satellite constellation, with ground-based measurements obtained by in-situ survey, laser scanner acquisition and structural analysis. The approach exploits satellite deformation measurements to validate the first interpretation of the structural behaviour of a construction threatened by ground instability based on visual inspection and the analysis of the crack pattern, when geotechnical studies and interpretation, as well as in-situ monitoring systems, are not available.   The methodology has been tested on the St. Gerlando Cathedral, located on the westernmost and highest area of the Agrigento hill. The Cathedral is affected by complex ground instability phenomena, that have led to several and continuous cracks over centuries. The spatially dense Tomographic SAR measurements allows accessing differential displacement trends in the different sections of the Cathedral and thereby analyzing the overall kinematic behavior of such a complex and heterogeneous structure. This provides essential information for the definition of the structural models, which are fundamental to better understand the behavior and damage evolution of structures subject to ground instabilities and consequently address the most suitable restoration actions.', '[Reale, Diego; Noviello, Carlo; Verde, Simona] Natl Res Council IREA CNR, Inst Electromagnet Sensing Environm, Via Diocleziano 328, I-80124 Naples, Italy.

Quantitative measurements have been performed by using two different Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) datasets. A ground-based survey using two different ground-coupled systems equipped with 100 MHz and 35 MHz antennas was performed in 2004. In 2015 the dataset was collected by using a helicopter-borne step frequency GPR equipped with a 100 MHz antenna. Through a critical discussion of the two different methodologies, we show how both approaches are useful to estimate the ice volume within a glacier, as well as its morphological characteristics and changes with time, even if datasets are acquired in different periods of the year.   The observed 2004-2014 ice volume reduction of the Marmolada glacier is equal to about 30%, while the area covered by ice decreased by about 22%. The glacier is now splitted in several separated units. It is very likely that the fragmentation of the Marmolada glacier observed in the period 2004-2014 was accelerated due to irregular karst topography. By applying the observed 2004-2014 ice-melting trend for the future although the Marmolada glacier might behave slightly differently compared to glaciers on non-karstic terrains owing to dominant vertical subglacial drainage, it will likely disappear by the year 2050. Only few isolated very small and thin ice patches will eventually survive due to avalanche feeding and shading at the foot of the north-facing cliffs.', '[Santin, I.; Forte, E.] Univ Trieste, Dept Math & Geosci, Trieste, Italy.

Typical DA procedures such as the Kalman filter require that the observations of a variable of interest used in a forecast of this variable to be collected just prior to the updating procedure and that they continue to be collected over time, a requirement that is not always practical for forest inventory problems. Distinct from the Kalman filter, the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) circumvents this time constraint, because it can calibrate the predicted values of a variable of interest using observations from other variables correlated with this variable of interest. Remote sensing played a major role in this study by providing the latter observations. The objective of this study was threefold: (1) to propose and illustrate a DA calibration procedure that incorporates simultaneous predictions and BLUP to improve prediction accuracy; (2) to expand this procedure in the framework of model-based inference; and (3) to compare the inferential properties before and after DA calibration for multiple scenarios. Four major conclusions are relevant. First, the prediction accuracies for all variables of interest were consistently increased by 10%-74% after implementing the DA procedure. Second, the DA procedure supported simultaneous inference, and the precision of the simultaneously estimated population means for the variables of interest were increased by 55%-76% after implementing this procedure. Third, the parametric bootstrap procedures used to estimate the inferential precisions for this complex estimation problem were effective and converged rapidly. In addition, this DA calibration procedure is universally applicable for DA calibrations using other data sources such as airborne or terrestrial laser scanning and spectral data, given that cross-model correlations exist. Overall, the proposed procedure demonstrated considerable potential for better serving forest inventory with respect to both simultaneous inference and inferential precision.', '[Hou, Zhengyang] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.

This large temporal variability cannot be captured using the standard Ocean Colour Radiometry (OCR) polar orbiting satellites, the latter providing almost one image per day. On the contrary, the use of OCR geostationary sensors, like the Geostationary Ocean Colour Imager (GOCI), centred above the Korean Peninsula, enable to capture the short-term variability of the optical properties. To compensate the lack of a geostationary sensor similar to GOCI over other coastal environments, like the North Adriatic Sea (NAS), the multiple observations provided during the same day by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) mounted on the SUOMI NPP satellite, can be exploited. Indeed, due to its large swath of 3060 km, the VIIRS orbits can overlap over the NAS during the same day within 1 h and 42 min, an important feature that can be useful in capturing the short term variability of the optical properties.   A large number of VIIRS overlaps in the NAS are characterized by high sensor zenith angle (SZA) of the observation, resulting in a large portion of images masked by the high satellite zenith flag. In order to make available those observations and, in general, to reduce the dependence of the VIIRS observations from the SZA, an adjustment based on a multi linear regression scheme, which exploits radiometric in situ observations, was here applied.   This study aims to prove the suitability of the adjusted overlapping VIIRS in capturing the short time scale dynamics of particulate backscattering, and this was demonstrated by the analysis of a case study for the 21st and 22nd of March 2013. In order to evaluate the advantages in using multiple observations during the same day, also the similar to 24 h dynamics was analysed, comparing the overlapping VIIRS results with the ones obtained from the daily product.', '[Bracaglia, Marco; Volpe, Gianluca; Colella, Simone; Santoleri, Rosalia; Brando, Vittorio Ernesto] CNR, ISMAR, Ist Sci Marine, Via Fosso Cavaliere 100, I-00133 Rome, Italy.

In this study, we propose a hybrid generalized additive model (HGAM) method to extract PPT using the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM)-based gross primary production (GPP) product, and we examine the dynamics, drivers, and consequences of PPT changes in temperate and alpine grasslands in China over 2000-2016. We found that the PPTs in temperate and alpine grasslands have exhibited advancing (with -0.68 days yr(-1), p < 0.05) and delaying (with 0.29 days yr(-1), p = 0.158) trends, respectively. In addition, preseason precipitation and soil moisture were positively correlated with the PPT in temperate and alpine grasslands, respectively, while the preseason temperature consistently controlled the PPT changes in both grasslands. Furthermore, we found that an earlier PPT was associated with higher annual production in the temperate grasslands but not in the alpine grasslands in China. The divergent PPT patterns indicated the varied adaptation characteristics to climatic constraints in the temperate and alpine grasslands and also caused different consequences on carbon uptake.

In this paper, we describe a novel hybrid approach for global burned area mapping that combines active fire data and time series of surface reflectance using graphs, which provide a flexible and efficient way of extracting spatiotemporal consistent patches.   Our approach has three main steps. Firstly, we analyze burn-sensitive vegetation index time series to determine for each location a set of events, which are the dates for which the spectral-temporal signal indicates the possibility of a burn. Secondly, we explore the spatiotemporal distribution of all events and active fires to determine a subset of events with strong evidence of corresponding to burned areas. Those events are used as positive occurrences for training a one-class maximum entropy classifier and obtain, for each candidate event, a likelihood of it actually corresponding to a burn. Finally, we build a graph that combines all previous information, from which we extract spatiotemporal patches of densely connected events. Patches with strong evidence of burning determine the burned area map at any given time period.   This research is part of the European Space Agency\'s Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) and aims ultimately at generating Sentinel-3 daily global burned area products at 500 m spatial resolution. Towards that end, we test our approach with spatially and spectrally similar MODIS gridded surface reflectance (MOD/MYDO9GA), as well as non-gridded active fire (MCD14ML) 2008 data and CCI global land cover maps. Using 105 independent Landsat fire reference perimeters to validate global results, we show that our algorithm applied to MOD/MYDO9GA data (PT-M09) has very similar accuracy (44%) measured by the Dice coefficient compared with MCD64A1 v006 (45%). Moreover, PT-M09 exhibits a higher commission error but a lower omission error than MCD64A1. Due to their coarse resolution, this kind of product cannot capture very small burn areas. The bias relative to the reference burned area indicates that the algorithm presented in the current study underestimates burned area by 14% of the area actually burned according to reference data, which is lower than the underestimation in MCD64A1 (28%).   We also analyzed the temporal accuracy of the patch based algorithm and concluded that the average time difference to active fires detection is 3.43 days, which is similar to MCD64A1 (3.75 days). Finally, we performed a sensitivity analysis which shows that total mapped burned areas varies only 3% when the main algorithm threshold that separates \"burned\" and \"unburned\" patches varies from quantile 45% to 55%.', '[Campagnolo, M.

While this allows more accurate prediction of plant traits at different spatial scales, it raises concerns about a lack of independence between observations. Hyperspectral wavelengths are serially correlated provoking multicollinearity among the predictors. As collection of ground reference points for validation remains time-consuming and difficult in many environments, empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths. Moreover, any set of observations collected from a continuous surface is also likely to be spatially autocorrelated. Machine learning regression facilitates the task of selecting the most informative wavelengths, and then transforming them into latent variables to avoid the problem of multicollinearity. However, these regression methods do not solve the problem of spatial autocorrelation in the model residuals. In this study we show that, when significant spatial autocorrelation is observed, models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate exhibit a higher prediction accuracy than machine learning regressions do. However, for these models to work, the number of (hyperspectral) bands included in the models has to be drastically reduced and the model can not be directly extrapolated to a new (unobserved) location in another area. We conclude that quantifying spatial autocorrelation a-priori in the data can help in deciding whether the spatial and the spectral dimensions should be modelled together or not.', '[Rocha, Alby D.; Groen, Thomas A.; Skidmore, Andrew K.] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, Enschede, Netherlands.

Towards better construction planning for the follow-up civil works, stability monitoring is usually required at these artificial sites. The Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) technique can provide bi-weekly updates of high resolution (up to 1 m) and high precision (millimeter level) ground motion maps at low costs, which overcomes the limitations of ground-based instruments. However, rapid settlement during the early stage of soil consolidation can result in significant temporal decorrelation to phase signals and impact InSAR detection, especially over newly reclaimed areas. Here, we give a first demonstration on how the introduction of in-situ extensometer measurements can help improve InSAR capabilities for signal recovery of the early consolidation process. We integrate persistent scatterers (PS) and distributed scatterers (DS) in our processing chain to establish a two-tier monitoring network. Magnetic extensometers are used to estimate local consolidation models, which are then utilized to replace the linear part in the conventional functional phase model. For nonlinear deformation, both hyperbolic and exponential models were considered. The proposed method was applied to 61 TerraSAR-X images covering the Penny\'s Bay Reclamation Stage 2 (PBR2) in Hong Kong. The consolidation history of the new reclamation site has been successfully extracted, with cumulative subsidence exceeding 1.6 m between May 2008 and Dec. 2011. Approximately 84% of the settlement of the non-dredged region was found to be from compaction of underlying soft marine deposits, not the filling materials. In addition to highlighting the spatiotemporal characteristics of the deformation, InSAR also helps reveal the compaction evolution of the underlying deposit. The results benefit our understanding of the early consolidation process in PBR2 and inform extra reinforcement plans if necessary.', '[Shi, Guoqiang; Lin, Hui; Ma, Peifeng; Liu, Yuzhou] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Space & Earth Informat Sci, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

The history of mangrove remote sensing (RS) can be traced back to 1956. Over the last six decades, hot spot topics in the field of mangrove RS have evolved from mangrove distribution mapping, biophysical parameters inversion, to ecosystem process characterization. Although several review articles have been published to summarize the progress in this field, none of them highlighted the key milestones of historical developments pertinent to major research topics or key drivers that stimulate such milestones.   In this review, we aim to identify key milestones in mangrove RS by associating the emergence of major research topics with the occurrence of new sensors in four historical phases, i.e. before 1989, 1990-1999, 2000-2009, and 2010-2018. For each identified research topic, an in-depth theoretical understanding was achieved by analyses of both the first published article and the most-cited article. Based on the analyses, the current state of knowledge as well as existing limitations were summarized. In addition, in order to gain insights on driving forces for emergence of new research topics, we compared the chronological evolution of mangrove RS with that of terrestrial forest RS.   Interestingly, we found that key research topics in mangrove RS replicated those of forest RS yet with varying time lags. This can be attributed to the following two facts: 1) mangrove forests often appear as more elongated patches than terrestrial forests; 2) field work is more challenging in mangrove habitat. Along with the RS sensors\' advancement, various topics that had been studied in terrestrial forests were later transformed to mangrove studies. Based on the projected growth of foreseeing earth observation capacity, insights on future research directions in mangrove RS were also presented.', '[Wang, Le; Yin, Dameng] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Geog, 105 Wilkeson Quad, Buffalo, NY 14261 USA.

Aiming at integratively measuring and expressing these three characteristics, this study proposes a spatiotemporal cube model and a spatiotemporal multi-resolution segmentation (ST-MRS) method for analyzing SITS. First, the novel spatiotemporal model, ST-cube, is introduced to reduce the spectral heterogeneity in spatial and temporal domains. Both spatial and temporal heterogeneities are considered and defined while constructing the spatiotemporal segmentation model. Second, the ST-MRS method is proposed by extending the existing mono-temporal MRS method into spatiotemporal domain to segment SITS into relatively homogeneous ST-cubes. Third, a novel unsupervised method is developed to evaluate the segmentation results of the ST-MRS method. In experiments, we apply this method to Shunyi District in Beijing, China, generate ST-cubes at different spatiotemporal scales, and compare our method with existing ones for SITS classification.

To assess DOM dynamics, monthly measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and colored DOM (CDOM; an optical proxy for DOC) absorption were obtained over a three-year period (2008-2011) along a transect encompassing the upper, middle and lower regions of the Barataria Basin estuary. While CDOM absorption coefficient at 355 nm (a(g)355) generally decreased and spectral slope at 275-295 nm (S275-295) increased along the transect from the upper to lower basin, deviations were observed associated with hydrologic and meteorological influences. An application of wavelet analysis to the time-series of a(g)355 and various freshwater sources revealed a spatiotemporal resonance of ag355 with freshwater input from the Mississippi River (MR), the controlled freshwater discharge from the Davis Pond freshwater diversion, and rainfall in the lower, middle and upper basins, respectively. Field measurements and Landsat/MODIS data spanning across different seasons between 2008 and 2011 were used to develop optimized a(g)355 empirical algorithms for the high river flow, cold front, and normal conditions. Power law models relating a band ratio (green/red) of a satellite sensor to a(g)355 showed good performance for the MODIS-Aqua (R-2 similar to 0.81-0.83, N = 581) and Landsat-5 TM (R-2 similar to 0.72-0.79, N = 304) imagery. a(g)355-DOC relationships (R-2 similar to 0.77-0.84, N = 306) applied to historical Landsat-5 TM (1985-2011) and MODIS-Aqua imagery (2002-2012) showed strong environmental influences on multi-decadal CDOM and DOC spatiotemporal trends. Satellite-derived DOC agreed reasonably well with in-situ measured DOC (averaged R-2 = 0.71; RMSE = 2.13). While the time-series DOC showed seasonality and decreasing gradients from the upper to lower basin, an overall increase in DOC was observed in the upper and middle basins from 1985 to 2012. However, in the lower basin, DOC increased from 1985 to 2006 but decreased from 2007 to 2012, likely due to the impact of two major hurricanes in 2005. Furthermore, relationships between satellite-derived DOC and land cover variations (1985-2011) along the wetland-estuary interfaces derived from Landsat-5 TM supervised classification showed an increase in DOC with corresponding increase in developed area in the upper basin, while in the lower basin, DOC increased by 41% (R-2 = 0.54) between 1985 and 2006 corresponding to a 17% decrease in salt marsh area, suggesting strong land use/land loss impact on the long-term DOC trends in Barataria Basin.', '[Liu, Bingqing; D\'Sa, Eurico J.; Joshi, Ishan] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.', 'Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State UniversityRP D\'Sa, EJ (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.', 'ejdsa@lsu.eduRI Joshi, Ishan/I-3465-2019; D\'Sa, Eurico/ABA-6699-2020', 'Joshi, Ishan/0000-0001-7710-0059; D\'Sa, Eurico/0000-0002-5262-6094; Liu,   Bingqing/0000-0003-4651-6996', 'Bureau of Ocean Energy and Management (BOEM) [M08AX12685]; Department of   Oceanography and Coastal Sciences, Louisiana State University', 'The authors wish to acknowledge the USGS for providing Landsat 5 TM   data, and the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) for providing   MODIS data.

Satellite based remote sensing has evolved as an important technology to spatially map the occurrence of invasive species in space and time. With the new era of the Sentinel missions, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and multispectral data are now freely available and repeatedly acquired on a high spatial and temporal resolution for the entire globe. However, the high potential of such sensors for automatic mapping procedures cannot be fully harnessed without sufficient and appropriate reference data for model calibration. Reference data are commonly acquired in field surveys, which however, are often relatively expensive and affected by sampling and observer bias. Moreover, a direct transferability to the remote sensing perspective and scale is difficult. Accordingly, we firstly assess the potential of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for semi-automatic reference data acquisition on species cover of three woody invasive species Pinus radiata, Ulex europaeus and Acacia dealbata occurring in Chile. Secondly, we test the upscaling of the estimated species cover to the spatial scale of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. The proposed workflow includes the visual sampling of respective canopies in UAV orthomosaics and the subsequent spatial extrapolations using MaxEnt with spectral (RGB, Hyperspectral), textural (2D) and canopy structural (3D) predictors derived from UAV-based photogrammetry. These UAV-based maps are then used to train random forest models with multitemporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to map the invasive species cover on large spatial scales. Our results show that the semi-automatic UAV-based mapping of the three invasive species results in accurate predictions. Depending on the predictor combination, the correlation was 0.70, 0.77 and 0.90 for Pinus radiatia, Ulex europaeus, Acacia dealbata, respectively. Among the three species, we observed clear differences in the model performance between the tested photogrammetric predictors and their combinations (spectral, 2D texture or 3D structure). For scaling up the UAV-based estimates to the satellite-scale, the Sentinel-2 data (multispectral) were more important than Sentinel-1 data (SAR). An independent validation revealed that the R-2 of the upscaling accounted for 0.78 or higher for all species and RMSE lower than 12%. Our results hence demonstrate that UAV-based reference data acquisitions are a promising alternative to traditional field surveys if the target species are directly identifiable in the UAV data.', '[Kattenborn, Teja; Lopatin, Javier; Fassnacht, Fabian Ewald] KIT, Inst Geog & Geoecol IfGG, Kaiserstr 12, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.

To meet this objective it will carry, for the first time in space, a fully polarimetric P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Three main products will be provided: global maps of both AGB and forest height, with a spatial resolution of 200 m, and maps of severe forest disturbance at 50 m resolution (where \"global\" is to be understood as subject to Space Object tracking radar restrictions). After launch in 2022, there will be a 3-month commissioning phase, followed by a 14-month phase during which there will be global coverage by SAR tomography. In the succeeding interferometric phase, global polarimetric interferometry Pol-InSAR coverage will be achieved every 7 months up to the end of the 5-year mission. Both Pol-InSAR and TomoSAR will be used to eliminate scattering from the ground (both direct and double bounce backscatter) in forests. In dense tropical forests AGB can then be estimated from the remaining volume scattering using non-linear inversion of a backscattering model. Airborne campaigns in the tropics also indicate that AGB is highly correlated with the backscatter from around 30 m above the ground, as measured by tomography. In contrast, double bounce scattering appears to carry important information about the AGB of boreal forests, so ground cancellation may not be appropriate and the best approach for such forests remains to be finalized. Several methods to exploit these new data in carbon cycle calculations have already been demonstrated. In addition, major mutual gains will be made by combining BIOMASS data with data from other missions that will measure forest biomass, structure, height and change, including the NASA Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidar deployed on the International Space Station after its launch in December 2018, and the NASA-ISRO NISAR L- and S-band SAR, due for launch in 2022. More generally, space-based measurements of biomass are a core component of a carbon cycle observation and modelling strategy developed by the Group on Earth Observations. Secondary objectives of the mission include imaging of sub-surface geological structures in arid environments, generation of a true Digital Terrain Model without biases caused by forest cover, and measurement of glacier and icesheet velocities. In addition, the operations needed for ionospheric correction of the data will allow very sensitive estimates of ionospheric Total Electron Content and its changes along the dawn-dusk orbit of the mission.', '[Quegan, Shaun; Lomas, Mark] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.

Now, having collected earth observation data for well over four decades since the 1972 launch of Landsat1, the Landsat program is increasingly complex and vibrant. Critical programmatic elements are ensuring the continuity of high quality measurements for scientific and operational investigations, including ground systems, acquisition planning, data archiving and management, and provision of analysis ready data products. Free and open access to archival and new imagery has resulted in a myriad of innovative applications and novel scientific insights. The planning of future compatible satellites in the Landsat series, which maintain continuity while incorporating technological advancements, has resulted in an increased operational use of Landsat data. Governments and international agencies, among others, can now build an expectation of Landsat data into a given operational data stream. International programs and conventions (e.g., deforestation monitoring, climate change mitigation) are empowered by access to systematically collected and calibrated data with expected future continuity further contributing to the existing multi-decadal record. The increased breadth and depth of Landsat science and applications have accelerated following the launch of Landsat-8, with significant improvements in data quality.   Herein, we describe the programmatic developments and institutional context for the Landsat program and the unique ability of Landsat to meet the needs of national and international programs. We then present the key trends in Landsat science that underpin many of the recent scientific and application developments and followup with more detailed thematically organized summaries. The historical context offered by archival imagery combined with new imagery allows for the development of time series algorithms that can produce information on trends and dynamics. Landsat-8 has figured prominently in these recent developments, as has the improved understanding and calibration of historical data. Following the communication of the state of Landsat science, an outlook for future launches and envisioned programmatic developments are presented. Increased linkages between satellite programs are also made possible through an expectation of future mission continuity, such as developing a virtual constellation with Sentinel-2. Successful science and applications developments create a positive feedback loop-justifying and encouraging current and future programmatic support for Landsat.', '[Wulder, Michael A.; Hermosillo, Txomin; Li, Zhan; White, Joanne C.] Nat Resources Canada, Pacific Forestry Ctr, Canadian Forest Serv, 506 West Burnside Rd, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada.

A new method was proposed to calculate slope-adaptive waveform metrics for forest AGB mapping over mountainous areas. First, a theoretical model was proposed to calculate lidar waveforms of bare ground with known terrain slopes. The forest waveform and its corresponding calculated bare ground waveform were then aligned by the signal ending points. Their energy quartiles were extracted separately by taking the signal ending points as references. The height differences between the corresponding energy quartiles were defined as slope-adaptive waveform metrics, which were then used as independent variables for the estimation of the forest AGB. The proposed method was examined with both simulated lidar waveforms of forest stands and real waveforms acquired by the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS). Two typical footprint sizes (i.e., 25 m and 70 m in diameter) and 21 terrain slopes (i.e., from 0 degrees to 40 degrees at an interval of 2 degrees) were used in the simulation of the lidar waveforms. The terrain slopes of the GLAS waveforms were between 5.54 degrees and 34.08 degrees. The results showed that the terrain stretching on the forest waveform could be compensated for by the bare ground waveform. Compared with the Gaussian decomposition and waveform parameter methods, the proposed method gave the best estimation of the forest AGB with R-2 = 0.92 and RMSE = 15.95 Mg/ha using simulated waveforms with a footprint size of 70 m and R-2 = 0.84 and RMSE = 34.99 Mg/ha using the GLAS waveforms.

Following the conversion of largely hardwood forests to cultivated fields and pastures for similar to 200 years, excess runoff from fields led to extreme sheet, rill, and gully erosion across the landscape. Roads, terraces, and a variety of other human disturbances have increased the landscapes surface roughness. By the 1950s, cultivation-based agriculture was largely abandoned across most of the Southern Piedmont due to soil erosion, declining agricultural productivity, and shifting agricultural markets. Secondary forests, dominated by loblolly and shortleaf pines, have since regrown on much of the landscape, including the 1500 km(2) Sumter National Forest, which was purchased from farmers and private land owners in the 1930s. Although this landscape was intensively farmed for approximately 150 years, there are a few hardwood forest stands and even entire small watersheds that have never been plowed and degraded by farming. Such relatively old hardwood stands and watersheds comprise relic landforms whose soils, regoliths, and vegetation are of interest to hydrologists, environmental historians, biogeochemists, geomorphologists, geologists, pedologists, and others interested in understanding the legacy of land-use history in this severely altered environment.   In this work we champion the need for high-resolution terrain mapping and demonstrate how Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) digital elevation model (DEM) data and microtopographic terrain roughness analyses (MTRA) can be used to infer land use history and management. This is accomplished by analyzing fine scale variation in terrain slope across the 1190 km(2) CCZO using data derived from three independent and overlapping LiDAR datasets at varying spatial resolutions. Terrain slope variability MTRA is further compared to three other methods of capturing and quantifying fine-scale surface roughness. We lastly demonstrate how these analyses can be employed in concert with historic aerial photography from the 1930\'s, contemporary Landsat remote sensing data, and ecological field data to identify reference relic landforms: hardwood stands, hillslopes, and small watersheds that have experienced minimal anthropogenic erosion for study and conservation.', '[Brecheisen, Zachary S.; Cook, Charles W.; Heine, Paul R.; Richter, Daniel deB.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Soils Lab, Durham, NC 27708 USA.', 'Duke UniversityRP Brecheisen, ZS (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Soils Lab, Durham, NC 27708 USA.', 'zbrecheisen@gmail.comRI Richter, D.D./AAN-4583-2021', 'Brecheisen, Zachary/0000-0002-3712-1725', 'Duke University; Forest History Society Weyerhaeuser Fellowship program;   National Science Foundation (NSF); Biological Sciences Directorate;   Geosciences Directorate\'s Division of Earth Sciences Critical Zone   Observatory program [EAR-1331846]', 'The authors would like to thank the editor and reviewers for their   thoughtful and thorough review of the manuscript, the suggested edits   and revisions improved it greatly.

An initial burned area map is created in the first step, from which tile dependent statistics are extracted for the second step. The whole Sub-Saharan Africa (around 25 M km(2)) was processed with this algorithm at a spatial resolution of 20 m, from January to December 2016. This period covers two half fire seasons on the Northern Hemisphere and an entire fire season in the South. The area was selected as existing BA products account it to include around 70% of global BA. Validation of this product was based on a two-stage stratified random sampling of Landsat multitemporal images. Higher accuracy values than existing global BA products were observed, with Dice coefficient of 77% and omission and commission errors of 26.5% and 19.3% respectively. The standard NASA BA product (MCD64A1 c6) showed a similar commission error (20.4%), but much higher omission errors (59.6%), with a lower Dice coefficient (53.6%). The BA algorithm was processed over > 11,000 Sentinel-2 images to create a database that would also include small fires (< 100 ha). This is the first time a continental BA product is generated from medium resolution sensors (spatial resolution = 20 m), showing their operational potential for improving our current understanding of global fire impacts. Total BA estimated from our product was 4.9 M km(2), around 80% larger area than what the NASA BA product (MCD64A1 c6) detected in the same period (2.7 M km(2)). The main differences between the two products were found in regions where small fires (< 100 ha) account for a significant proportion of total BA, as global products based on coarse pixel sizes (500 m for MCD64A1) unlikely detect them. On the negative side, Sentinel-2 based products have lower temporal resolution and consequently are more affected by cloud/cloud shadows and have less temporal reporting accuracy than global BA products. The product derived from S2 imagery would greatly contribute to better understanding the impacts of small fires in global fire regimes, particularly in tropical regions, where such fires are frequent.

Relying on optical remote sensing data, the SCOPE model estimates photosynthesis and evapotranspiration, but these ecosystem-level fluxes may be significantly overestimated if water availability is the primary limiting factor for vegetation. Remedying this shortcoming, additional information from extra sources is needed. In this study, we propose considering water stress in SCOPE by incorporating soil moisture data in the model, besides using satellite optical reflectance observations. A functional link between soil moisture, soil surface resistance, leaf water potential and carboxylation capacity is introduced as an extra element in SCOPE, resulting in a soil moisture integrated version of the model, SCOPE-SM. The modified model simulates additional state variables: (i) vapor pressure (e(i)), both in the soil pore space and leaf stomata in equilibrium with liquid water potential; (ii) the maximum carboxylation capacity (V-cmax) by a soil moisture dependent stress factor; and (iii) the soil surface resistance (r(ss)) through approximation by a soil moisture dependent hydraulic conductivity. The new approach was evaluated at a Fluxnet site (US-Var) with dominant C3 grasses and covering a wet-to-dry episode from January to August 2004. By using the original SCOPE (version 1.61), we simulated half-hourly time steps of plant functioning via locally measured weather data and time series of Landsat (TM and ETM) imagery. Then, SCOPE-SM was similarly applied to simulate plant functioning for three cases using Landsat imagery: (i) with modeled e(i); (ii) with modeled ei and V-cmax; and (iii) with modeled e(i) V-cmax and r(ss). The outputs of all four simulations were compared to flux tower plant functioning measurements. The results indicate a significant improvement proceeding from the first to the fourth case in which we used both Landsat optical imagery and soil moisture data through SCOPE-SM. Our results show that the combined use of optical reflectance and soil moisture observations has great potential to capture variations of photosynthesis and evapotranspiration during drought episodes. Further, we found that the information contained in soil moisture observations can describe more variations of measured evapotranspiration compared to the information contained in thermal observations.', '[Bayat, Bagher; van der Tol, Christiaan; Yang, Peiqi; Verhoef, Wouter] Univ Twente, Fac Geo Informat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.', 'University of TwenteRP Bayat, B (通讯作者)，Univ Twente, Fac Geo Informat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.', 'b.bayat@utwente.nl; c.vandertol@utwente.nl; p.yang@utwente.nl;   w.verhoef@utwente.nlRI Yang, Peiqi/AAY-5147-2020; Bayat, Bagher/AAP-2573-2020; van der Tol,   Christiaan/A-2403-2010', 'Yang, Peiqi/0000-0003-4377-8560; Verhoef, Wouter/0000-0003-4696-2144;   van der Tol, Christiaan/0000-0002-2484-8191; Bayat,   Bagher/0000-0002-7761-9544', 'ITC Faculty of the University of Twente IFP program [IFP17.1.2]; IMSRT   scholarship [4.81681]', 'We are very grateful to Prof. Dennis Baldocchi and Dr. Siyan Ma from the   University of California, Berkeley, USA, who provided the time series   ground measurements of the needed soil moisture content and leaf area   index for the Vaira Ranch (US-Var) Fluxnet site during the course of   this research.

In this study, we analyzed 33-years of high resolution (30 m) Landsat (LT) data for reconstructing seasonal patterns of chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration in four lakes across Finland, between 60 degrees N and 64 degrees N. Chl a models based on LT spectral bands were calibrated using 17-years (2000-2016) of field measurements collected across the four lakes. These models were then applied for estimating chl a using the entire LT-5 and 7 archives. Approximately 630 images, from 1984 to 2017, were analyzed for each lake. The chl a seasonal patterns were characterized using phenology metrics, and the time-series of LT-based chl a estimates were used for identifying temporal shifts in the seasonal patterns of chl a concentration. Our results showed an increase in the length of phytoplankton growth season in three of the lakes. The highest increase was observed in Lake Koylionjarvi, where the length of growth season has increased by 28 days from the baseline period of 1984-1994 to 2007-2017. The increase in the length of season was mainly attributed to an earlier start of phytoplankton blooms. We further analyzed surface temperature (T-s) and precipitation data to verify if climatic factors could explain the shifts in the seasonal patterns of chl a. We found no direct relationship between T-s and chl a seasonal patterns. Similarly, the phonological metrics of Ts, in particular length of season, did not show significant temporal trends. On the other hand, we identify potential links between changes in precipitation patterns and the increase in the phytoplankton season length. We verified a significant increase in the rainfall contribution to the total precipitation during the autumn and winter, accompanied by a decline in snowfall volumes. This could indicate an increasing runoff volume during the beginning of spring, contributing to an earlier onset of the phytoplankton blooms, although further assessments are needed to analyze historical streamflow values and nearby land cover data. Likewise, additional studies are needed to better understand why chl a patterns in some lakes seem to be more resilient than in others.', '[Maeda, Eduardo Eiji; Kaikkonen, Laura; Kuikka, Sakari] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Ecosyst & Environm Res Programme, POB 68, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.

Since 2011-2014 the Guyana Forestry Commission (GFC) has used visual interpretation of 5 m resolution RapidEye imagery to map forest loss and nearby degradation for the entire country. According to the GFC produced national map, 58% of all forest loss events cover less than 1 ha, so forest loss is very rare and occurs at a scale that can be difficult to detect and monitor. Nearly all (similar to 97%) of the forest loss and nearby degradation is due to small-scale mining and its associated infrastructure. For any country wanting to accurately map and monitor forest loss, sample-based area estimation can be considerably less expensive than wall-to-wall mapping. To quantify the tradeoff between precision and cost, we evaluated the standard errors of area estimators for several sample-based strategies using Guyana as a case study. We partitioned Guyana into 374 blocks, with each block 24 km x 24 km to align with the image tiles provided by RapidEye\'s 3A product. The area of forest loss and area of degradation for each of the 374 blocks were determined from the GFC map to create the population data used to evaluate the precision of different sample-based strategies. We compared the standard errors of estimators of area of forest loss and area of degradation obtained from simple random, stratified random and systematic sampling as applied to these population data. To construct strata for the stratified design, we evaluated two forest loss maps produced from Landsat data, a 30 m global forest loss product and a 30 m national forest loss map produced specifically for Guyana. For both of these maps, several options for defining stratum boundaries and allocating sample size to strata were evaluated. All stratified design options reduced the standard error of the area estimators relative to simple random sampling. The Dalenius-Hodges and Jenks methods for choosing stratum boundaries yielded greater improvements in precision than the Equal Area method. For this Guyana case study, optimal and equal allocation of sample size to strata led to substantially better precision than proportional allocation. Only small improvements in precision were attained by increasing the number of strata from three to five. For simple random sampling, incorporating the global and national forest loss map information in a regression estimator reduced standard errors of estimated area of forest loss and area of degradation relative to the standard error of the Horvitz-Thompson estimator that does not incorporate the forest loss map information. However, the best performing stratified sampling design options had better precision than the regression estimator. RapidEye data cost 800 USD per \'3A\' tile so the annual imagery cost for mapping Guyana would be 274,000 USD. For an investment of 75,200 USD (the cost of 94 RapidEye tiles, the largest sample size evaluated), the best performing stratified random sample achieved a relative standard error (100% times the standard error divided by area) of 7% for estimating area of forest loss and 6% for estimating area of degradation. This study demonstrates the utility of Landsat-based forest loss maps to provide effective strata to improve precision of area estimators produced from a sample of RapidEye imagery in a country for which forest loss and degradation are very rare features of the landscape.', '[Pickering, Jeffrey; Tyukavina, Alexandra; Potapov, Peter; Jantz, Samuel M.; Hansen, Matthew C.] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

Airborne small footprint lidar is a potential major source for the detection of variation in leaf area density (LAD), LAD vertical profiles, and total leaf area (leaf area index, LAI), from sites to regional scales. However, the sensitivities of lidar-based LAD and LAI estimation are not yet well known, particularly in dense forests, over landscape heterogeneity, sensor system, and survey differences, and through time. To address these questions, we compared 16 pairs of multitemporal airborne lidar surveys with four different laser sensors across six Amazon forest sites with resurvey intervals ranging from one to nine years. We tested whether the different laser sensors, and the pulse return density of laser sampling (variable between and within each survey) introduce systematic biases. Laser sensors created consistent biases that accounted for up to 18.20% of LAD differences between surveys, but biases could be corrected with a simple regression approach. Lidar pulse return density had little appreciable bias impact when above 20 returns per m(2). After correction, repeated mean and site maximum LAI estimates became significantly correlated (R-2 similar to 0.8), while LAD profiles revealed site differences. Heterogeneity and change in LAD structure were detectable at the ecologically relevant 1/4 ha forest neighborhood grid scale, as evidenced by the high correlation of profile variation between surveys, with the strength of correlation (R-2 value) significantly decreasing with increasing survey interval (0.74 to 0.16 from one to nine years), consistent with accumulating effects of forest dynamics. Sensor-induced biases trended towards correlation with lidar footprint (beam width).

In this study, we utilize NASA AVIRIS - Next Generation imaging spectroscopy data to map 15 foliar functional traits in a grassland experiment at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, a Long-Term Ecological Research site in Central Minnesota, across three years. To estimate traits, we compared the widely used partial least squares regression (PLSR) with Gaussian processes regression (GPR) to assess differences in model performance and uncertainty estimates. PLSR is attractive for its straightforward implementation and interpretation, but requires bootstrapping-based methods to estimate and map prediction uncertainties. On the other hand, GPR is more complex to implement and interpret, but provides explicit estimates of uncertainties. Our results indicated that foliar functional traits can be retrieved in these grasslands with moderate to high accuracies using either method. Highest validation accuracies were obtained for leaf mass per area (LMA), soluble cell contents, hemicellulose and cellulose (all with R-2 > 0.8), and lower accuracies for lignin, nitrogen, and some pigments with both techniques. The estimations for the mass-based pigments were more accurate than the area-based pigments (at least 5% improvement in normalized RMSE). Overall, GPR and PLSR performed comparably with respect to both skill of predictions and the selection of most informative spectral regions. Maps of uncertainties corresponded well between the two models, with highest uncertainties related to low vegetation cover, high diversity levels, or under irrigation and nitrogen treatments (not represented in the field sampling). The maps showed that trait values in each plot were relatively stable across three years of managed species richness. Our results provide a template for mapping foliar traits and their uncertainties in grasslands, and point to the need for extensive ground data across time to properly evaluate performance of trait mapping algorithms.', '[Wang, Zhihui; Townsend, Philip A.; Singh, Aditya] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

Uncontrolled late season fires promote deforestation, produce greenhouse gases (similar to 25% of Brazil\'s land-use related CO2 emissions between 2003 and 2005) and are a major threat to the conservation of biodiversity in protected areas. Governmental institutions therefore implemented early dry season (EDS) prescribed burnings as part of integrated fire management (IFM) in protected areas of the Cerrado, with the aim to reduce the area and severity of late dry season (LDS) fires. The planning and implementation of EDS prescribed burning is supported by satellite-based geo-information on fuel conditions, derived from Landsat 8 and Sentinel -2 data. The Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering algorithm was used to analyse the data, and the relationship between the resulting matched fractions (dry vegetation, green vegetation and soil) and in situ surface fuel samples was assessed. The linear regression of in situ data versus matched filter scores (MF scores) of dry vegetation showed an r(2) of 0.81 (RMSE = 0.15) and in situ data versus MF scores of soil showed an r(2) of 0.65 (RMSE = 0.38). To predict quantitative fuel load, a multiple linear regression analysis was carried out with MF scores of NPV and soil as predictors (adjusted r(2) = 0.86; p < 0.001; standard error = 0.075). The fuel load maps were additionally evaluated by fire managers while planning EDS prescribed burning campaigns. The fuel load mapping approach has proven to be an effective tool for integrated fire management by improving the planning and implementation of prescribed burning, promoting pyrodiversity, prioritising fire suppression and evaluating fire management efforts to meet overall conservations goals.

The first one linearly extrapolates the land slope, defining the bottom as the intersection of all extrapolated lines. The second linearly interpolates the uppermost and lowermost pixels of the reservoir\'s main river, repeating the process for all other tributaries. A visible bathymetry, resulting from the combination of radar altimetry and water extent masks, can be coupled with the DEM, improving the accuracy of techniques (a) and (b). Envisat and Altika-based altimetric time series is combined to a Landsat-based water extent database over the 2002-2016 period in order to generate the visible bathymetry, and topography is derived from the 3-arcsec HydroSHEDS DEM.

Accuracy is measured using ground observations, and show that metrics improve as a function of added data requirement and processing.

However, the process of shrub encroachment is still poorly understood. Particularly, there has been limited historical datasets and inadequate field samples about the encroachment species. Shrub age can serve as an important indicator of the shrub encroachment history; and the population structure based on the shrub age distribution can reflect the population dynamics of an encroachment species. Using a high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing data, this paper estimates the age and population structure of a typical shrub, the Caragana genus (hereafter shrubs) in the temperate arid and semiarid grasslands of Inner Mongolia, China. The primary methods include: (1) building a shrub age estimation model considering different shrub crown growth rates affected by different precipitation regimes in the Inner Mongolian grassland; (2) identifying shrub individuals from multiple HSR remote sensing images and estimating the age of shrub individuals using the developed shrub age estimation model; (3) establishing a shrub age histogram, fitting the population structure, and calculating the survival rate and regeneration count using a negative exponential function. The results indicate that this shrub age estimation model performs better than a simple statistical regression using only the shrub crown area. Further, employing the negative exponential function for research on shrub encroachment provides supporting evidence of its effective role in capturing the population structure. Result also identifies that the survival rate increases with precipitation.', '[Cao, Xin; Liu, Yu; Liu, Qixin; Cui, Xihong; Chen, Xuehong; Chen, Jin] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.', 'Beijing Normal UniversityRP Liu, Y (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.', 'liuyu0213@mail.bnu.edu.cnRI Chen, Xuehong/AAS-7460-2020; Chen, Jin/A-6417-2011; Cao,   Xin/P-3814-2014; Cui, Xihong/T-6809-2019; Chen, Xuehong/A-7768-2012', 'Chen, Jin/0000-0002-6497-4141; Cao, Xin/0000-0001-5789-7582', 'National Natural Science Foundation of China [41571406]; Fund for   Creative Research Groups of National Natural Science Foundation of China   [41621061]; State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource   Ecology at Beijing Normal University [2015-ZDTD-011]', 'This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of   China (41571406), the Fund for Creative Research Groups of National   Natural Science Foundation of China (41621061), and the State Key   Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology at Beijing   Normal University (2015-ZDTD-011).

Therefore, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of these bridges is urgently needed by civil engineers to effectively reduce the risk of bridge damage or collapse on public safety. An essential method for SHM, the modem Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) technique, can detect subtle deformation of bridges at relatively low costs. Nevertheless, identifying dense point-like targets (PTs) on such partially coherent arch bridges in SAR image is more difficult than that for other man-made objects, owing to their complex structures and backscattering behaviors. Furthermore, the complex mechanical properties of arch bridges, due to the varying arch-beam interactions, make it hard to separate the surface deformation and thermal dilation accurately, and the lack of specific structural knowledge, that can help to understand the deformation evolution process, limits the global structural risk assessment. Aiming at these problems, we developed a structure-driven multi-temporal DInSAR approach for arch bridge-specific SHM. By introducing three structure-driven steps, i.e. backscattering geometrical interpretation, linear thermal dilation estimation and validation, and Deformation Feature Points (DFPs) based risk assessment, into the traditional DInSAR method, the reliability of PTs identification, thermal dilation separation, and structural risk assessment for arch bridges are significantly improved. The effectiveness of our approach was fairly presented by two case studies of the Rainbow and Lupu bridges, and the experimental results were verified by leveling benchmark validation, cross-sensor comparison, as well as structural-reliability assessment. Our results revealed that arch bridges exhibit a similar pattern of PTs distribution that is dense around piers and sparse on the spans, as well as a symmetrical progressive pattern of surface deformation with the subsidence increasing from piers and reaching a peak at the central spans. In contrast, magnitudes and mechanisms of thermal dilation are different, and highly dependent on the materials and structural characteristics of specific bridges.', '[Qin, Xiaoqiong; Zhang, Lu; Yang, Mengshi; Luo, Heng; Liao, Mingsheng] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.

Standard satellite missions could not provide such data at both high resolutions. Fusion approaches that leverage the complementary strengths in various satellite sources (e.g. MODISNIIRS/GOES-R\'s sub-daily revisiting frequency and Landsat/Sentinel-2\'s high spatial resolution) provide a viable means to simultaneously achieve both high resolutions in the fusion data. In this paper, we presented a novel, generic and fully-automated method, STAIR, for fusing multi-spectral satellite data to generate a high frequency, high-resolution and cloud-/gap-free data. Building on the time series of multiple sources of satellite data, STAIR first imputes the missing-value pixels (due to cloud cover or sensor mechanical issues) in satellite images using an adaptive-average correction process, which takes into account different land covers and neighborhood information of miss-value pixels through an automatic segmentation. To fuse satellite images, it employs a local interpolation model to capture the most informative spatial information provided by the high spatial resolution data (e.g., Landsat) and then performs an adjustment step to incorporate the temporal patterns provided by the high-frequency data (e.g., MODIS). The resulting fused products contain daily, high spatial resolution and cloud-/gap-free fused images. We tested our algorithm to fuse surface reflectance data of MODIS and Landsat in Champaign County at Illinois and generated daily time series for all the growing seasons (Apr 1 to Nov 1) from 2000 to 2015 at 30 m resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAIR not only captures correct texture patterns but also predicts accurate reflectance values in the generated images, with a significant performance improvement over the classic STARFM algorithm. This method is computationally efficient and ready to be scaled up to continental scales. It is also sufficiently generic to easily include various optical satellite data for fusion. We envision this novel algorithm can provide effective means to leverage historical optical satellite data to build long-term daily, 30 m surface reflectance record (e.g. from 2000 to present) at continental scales for various applications, as well as produce operational near-realtime daily and high-resolution data for future earth observation applications.', '[Luo, Yunan; Pen, Jian] Univ Illinois, Dept Comp Sci, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.

However, the calibration of radar models whether empirically or physically-based, is still subject to large uncertainties especially at high-spatial resolution. To help calibrate radar-based retrieval approaches to supervising SM at high resolution, this paper presents an innovative synergistic method combining Sentinel-1 (Si) microwave and Landsat-7/8 (L7/8) thermal data. First, the S1 backscatter coefficient was normalized by its maximum and minimum values obtained during 2015-2016 agriculture season. Second, the normalized S1 backscatter coefficient was calibrated from reference points provided by a thermal-derived SM proxy named soil evaporative efficiency (SEE, defined as the ratio of actual to potential soil evaporation). SEE was estimated as the radiometric soil temperature normalized by its minimum and maximum values reached in a water-saturated and dry soil, respectively. We estimated both soil temperature endmembers by using a soil energy balance model forced by available meteorological forcing. The proposed approach was evaluated against in situ SM measurements collected over three bare soil fields in a semi-arid region in Morocco and we compared it against a classical approach based on radar data only. The two polarizations VV (vertical transmit and receive) and VH (vertical transmit and horizontal receive) of the S1 data available over the area are tested to analyse the sensitivity of radar signal to SM at high incidence angles (39 degrees-43 degrees). We found that the VV polarization was better correlated to SM than the VH polarization with a determination coefficient of 0.47 and 0.28, respectively. By combining Si (VV) and L7/8 data, we reduced the root mean square difference between satellite and in situ SM to 0.03 m(3) m(-3) which is far smaller than 0.16 m(3) m(-3) when using SI (VV) only.', '[Amazirh, Abdelhakim; Er-Raki, Salah] Univ Cadi Ayyad, Fac Sci & Tech, Dept Phys Appl, LP2M2E, Marrakech, Morocco.

To better predict the rainforest\'s response to future droughts, it is necessary to understand its behavior during past events. Satellite observations provide a practical source of continuous observations of Amazonian forest. Here we used a passive microwave-based vegetation water content record (i.e., vegetation optical depth, VOD), together with multiple hydrometeorological observations as well as conventional satellite vegetation measures, to investigate the rainforest canopy dynamics during the 2005 and 2010 droughts. During the onset of droughts in the wet-to-dry season (May July) of both years, we found large-scale positive anomalies in VOD, leaf area index (LAI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) over the southern Amazonia. These observations are very likely caused by enhanced canopy growth. Concurrent below-average rainfall and above average radiation during the wet-to-dry season can be interpreted as an early arrival of normal dry season conditions, leading to enhanced new leaf development and ecosystem photosynthesis, as supported by field observations. Our results suggest that further rainfall deficit into the subsequent dry season caused water and heat stress during the peak of 2005 and 2010 droughts (August October) that exceeded the tolerance limits of the rainforest, leading to widespread negative VOD anomalies over the southern Amazonia. Significant VOD anomalies were observed mainly over the western part in 2005 and mainly over central and eastern parts in 2010. The total area with significant negative VOD anomalies was comparable between these two drought years, though the average magnitude of significant negative VOD anomalies was greater in 2005. This finding broadly agrees with the field observations indicating that the reduction in biomass carbon uptake was stronger in 2005 than 2010. The enhanced canopy growth preceding drought-induced senescence should be taken into account when interpreting the ecological impacts of Amazonian droughts.', '[Liu, Yi Y.; Parinussa, Robert M.] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

Mass loss from FJL doubled between 2011 and 2015 compared to 1953-2011/2015, increasing from a rate of -2.18 +/- 0.72 Gt yr(-1) to -4.43 +/- 0.78 Gt yr(-1). This 2011-2015 rate indicates an acceleration in ice loss from that observed in 2003-2009 by multiple studies using ICESat and GRACE. Glacier thinning rates are spatially highly variable. We observe glacier thinning rates of up to 10 m per year, and in general we see a trend of increased thinning from the NE towards the SW. Glacier retreat is widespread and has led to the creation of at least one new island. Historically, ice wastage from FJL is thought to have been relatively small, but accelerating ice loss may be the new normal for this archipelago in a warming Arctic.', '[Zheng, Whyjay; Pritchard, Matthew E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.

Remote sensing provides fast and nondestructive methods for estimating leaf Chl content based on its optical characteristics in visible and near-infrared spectrum. Multispectral lidar (MSL) systems have been developed to combine spectral and spatial detection abilities. Statistical relationships of plant biochemical constituents can be established through MSL measurements. However, empirical models cannot be readily extended to independent datasets. Simultaneously, the few spectral bands of MSL limit the use of a physical model. Hence, the development of hyperspectral lidar (HSL) systems offers a wider range of spectrum. This study investigated the possibility of adopting an HSL system with 32 channels covering 539-910 nm to estimate foliar Chl through a physical model. This study aimed to (1) Determine whether reflectance at the 32 channels is sufficient to retrieve Chl content through PROSPECT model inversion and (2) Considering the difference between passively and actively measured reflectance, investigate whether HSL measurements can be applied into PROSPECT model inversion for leaf biochemical constituents. Three kinds of datasets were used: a synthetic dataset simulated by running the PROSPECT model in forward mode, a public dataset ANGERS taking the channels of the HSL system, and an experimental dataset of paddy rice measured by the HSL system. Results showed HSL measurements can be directly used to retrieve leaf Chl content through PROSPECT-4 model inversion (R-2 = 0.55). These measurements also exhibit higher accuracy than that of support vector regression (threefold cross validation; 100 repetitions: median R-2 = 0.47). This validation work provides basis in the determination of vegetation physiological status directly from HSL measurements through model inversion with the PROSPECT model.', '[Sun, Jia; Shi, Shuo; Chen, Biwu; Gong, Wei; Mao, Feiyue] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.

Managed realignment (MR) is an increasingly popular method to artificially recreate these habitats by reinstating tidal regimes to reclaimed land. However, to improve MR design, better knowledge of the processes that control morphological evolution in natural saltmarshes is needed. In this paper, we develop tools to assist in the monitoring of creek network evolution towards dynamic morphological equilibrium, a state of landform stability under current physical forcings. Using lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) datasets, we combined a semi-automated creek extraction algorithm, based on elevation and slope thresholds, with a novel algorithm for morphometric creek analysis. A comprehensive suite of morphological creek characteristics was extracted for 13 natural British saltmarshes, including: amplitude, length, sinuosity ratio, junction angle, width, depth, cross-sectional area, creek order, bifurcation ratio, drainage density, and drainage efficiency. Results closely matched with field-validated manual digitization results, and were significantly faster and less subjective to produce. Morphological equilibrium relationships from the literature were found to be applicable to the new dataset, despite yielding high prediction errors due to the inherent variety of creek network shapes in salt marshes. New equilibrium relationships were also defined relating the creek network drainage efficiency to the mouth cross-sectional area and the marsh elevation. To improve future scheme designs, these tools will be used in further studies to monitor rates of evolution towards equilibrium in MR sites depending on their initial conditions.', '[Chirol, C.; Haigh, I.

Monitoring this crucial interface may be addressed with satellite imagery as a cost-efficient mapping solution. Topography and bathymetry, defining the structural complexity of the coast, are commonly studied separately given specific thematic and methodological contexts, yet many science questions and societal challenges require an integrated approach (e.g., coastal inundation). In such cases, triplet multispectral imagery represents an affordable solution based on a single satellite product. Here we examine how Pleiades-1 triplet imagery may be used to retrieve a seamless and accurate topobathymetry digital surface model (DSM, from -20 to 1207 m) over an entire, socio-ecologically complex island: Moorea, French Polynesia. Creation of the topography DSMs was based on stereo and tri-stereo photogrammetry, and the bathymetry DSMs relied on quasi-nadiral multispectral data subject to light/water interaction modelling. Results were compared with over 3.9 million airborne LiDAR topobathymetry measurements to quantify how the spatio-spectral mode, the third imagery, and the level of radiometric correction act on two-and three-dimensional accuracy. Horizontal accuracy of the tri-stereo panchromatic dataset (E-RMSE = 4.22 and N-RMSE = 7.59 m) was better than the multispectral (E-RMSE = 5.06 and N-RMSE = 7.51 m) dataset. Topography point cloud density increased by a factor of three in the tri-stereo panchromatic (9.11 points/m(2)) or multispectral (0.23 points/m(2)) datasets. Topography vertical accuracy enhanced with tri-stereo + level-1 radiometric correction (RMSE = 7.40 m) for panchromatic and with stereo + level-1/-2 radiometric correction (RMSE = 7.77/7.77 m) as well as tri-stereo without radiometric correction (RMSE = 7.85 m) for multispectral datasets. Bathymetry vertical accuracy improved with level-2 (atmospheric) correction (RMSE = 0.83 m).

The sudden emptying of these lakes releases large volumes of water and sediment in destructive glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), one of the most publicised natural hazards to the rapidly growing Himalayan population. Despite the growing number and size of glacial lakes, the frequency of documented GLOFs is remarkably constant. We explore this possible reporting bias and offer a new processing chain for establishing a more complete Himalayan GLOF inventory. We make use of the full seasonal archive of Landsat images between 1988 and 2016, and track automatically where GLOFs left shrinking water bodies, and tails of sediment at high elevations. We trained a Random Forest classifier to generate fuzzy land cover maps for 2491 images, achieving overall accuracies of 91%. We developed a likelihood-based change point technique to estimate the timing of GLOFs at the pixel scale. Our method objectively detected ten out of eleven documented GLOFs, and another ten lakes that gave rise to previously unreported GLOFs. We thus nearly doubled the existing GLOF record for a study area covering similar to 10% of the HKH region. Remaining challenges for automatically detecting GLOFs include image insufficiently accurate co-registration, misclassifications in the land cover maps and image noise from clouds, shadows or ice.

A better understanding and forecasting of their impact on climate therefore requires precise observations of dust emission and transport. Observations from space offer a good opportunity to follow, day by day and at high spatial resolution, dust evolution at global scale and over long time series. Infrared observations allow retrieving dust aerosol optical depth (AOD) as well as the mean dust layer altitude, daytime and nighttime, over oceans and over continents, in particular over desert. Moreover, coarse mode particles are preferentially observed in the infrared, when, in the visible, both larger and finer particles are observed making the distinction between the two modes difficult. Therefore, they appear complementary to observations in the visible. In this study, a decade of the Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Interferometer (IASI) on board European Satellite Metop-A observations, from July 2007 to December 2016, has been processed pixel by pixel, using a \"Look-Up-Table\"(LUT) physical approach. Important improvements have been brought to our former approach in order to extend it to: 1) daytime retrieval, 2) mid-latitude retrieval, 3) retrieval at the IASI pixel resolution, 4) near real time retrieval (day-1). Moreover, over continents, surface characteristics (pressure, temperature, as well as emissivity spectrum) are now better accounted for. Here, a particular attention is given to the validation of the IASI-retrieved AOD through comparisons with the Spectral Deconvolution Algorithm (SDA) 500 nm coarse mode AOD observed at 70 ground-based Aerosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) sites during the 114 months processed. Even if such a comparison requires converting AOD from infrared to visible, inherently leading to significant uncertainties, the two AOD datasets compare well, with an overall correlation of 0.8. For a large majority of sites, correlation ranges from 0.7 to 0.9. Sites with highest correlation are well distributed within the \"dust belt\" (Sahara, Arabian Peninsula, Mediterranean basin, India and also the Caribbean). Correlations obtained for East-Asia are in general smaller, which might be due to a more complex dust structure (i.e., impact of pollution) and partly due to an increase of the AERONET coarse-mode AOD uncertainty. More generally, the good overall agreement between our restitutions and AERONET AOD demonstrates the ability of infrared sounders to infer dust properties, which opens interesting perspective for a synergy with visible observations.', '[Capelle, V.; Chedin, A.; Pondrom, M.; Crevoisier, C.; Armante, R.; Crepeau, L.; Scott, N.

Spectral indices for estimating f(R) are sensitive to soil and crop residue water contents, therefore the uncertainty of f(R) estimates increases when moisture conditions vary. Our goals were to evaluate the robustness of spectral residue indices based on the shortwave infrared region (SWIR) for estimating f(R) and to mitigate the uncertainty caused by variable moisture conditions on f(R) estimates. Ten fields with center pivot irrigation systems (eight partially irrigated and two uniformly dry fields) were identified in Worldview-3 satellite imagery acquired for a study site in Maryland (USA). The fields were mid-irrigation at the time of imagery acquisition, allowing comparison of residue cover under dry and wet conditions. Fields were subdivided into approximately equal-size wedges within the dry and wet portions of each field, and the SWIR bands were extracted for each pixel. Two crop residue indices (Normalized Difference Tillage Index (NDTI); Shortwave Infrared Normalized Difference Residue Index (SINDRI) and a water index (WI) were calculated. Reflectance in each band was moisture-adjusted based on the WI difference between wet and dry wedges, and updated NDTI and SINDRI were calculated. Finally, the probability density distributions of f(R) estimated from the residue indices were calculated for each field. SINDRI was more robust than NDTI for estimating f(R). Moisture corrections of spectral bands reduced the root mean square error of NDTI f(R) estimates from 22.7% to 4.7%, and SINDRI f(R) estimates from 6.0% to 2.2%. The mean and variance of the probability density distribution of f(R) estimated from residue indices, before and after moisture correction, were greatly reduced in the partially irrigated fields, but only slightly in fields with uniform water distribution. The estimation of f(R) should be based on SINDRI if appropriate bands are available, but f(R) can be reliably estimated by combining NDTI with a water content index to mitigate the uncertainty caused by variable moisture conditions.', '[Quemada, M.] Univ Politecn Madrid, CEIGRAM, Sch Agr Engn, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.

LiDAR remote sensing has proven efficient and accurate for the fine-scale estimation of above-ground tree biomass (AGB) and carbon stocks in many ecosystems, but tropical savanna remain under studied. We utilized a two-phase LiDAR analysis procedure which integrates both individual tree detection (ITC) and area-based approaches (ABA) to better understand how the uncertainty of biomass estimation varies with scale. We used estimations from individual tree LiDAR measurements as training/reference data, and then applied these data to develop allometric equations related to LIDAR metrics. We found that LiDAR individual tree heights were strongly correlated with field-estimated AGB (R-2 = 0.754, RMSE = 90 kg), and that 63% of individual trees crowns (ITC) could be accurately delineated with a canopy maxima approach. Area-based biomass estimation (ABA), which incorporated errors from the ITC steps, identified the quadratic mean of canopy height (QMCH) as the best single independent variable for different plot sample sizes (e.g. for 4 ha plots: R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 3.4 Mg ha(-1); and 1 ha plots: R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 4.0 Mg ha(-1)).

This study investigates the spatio-temporal dynamics of juniper forest encroachment into tallgrass prairies by generating juniper forest encroachment maps from 1984 to 2010 at 30 m spatial resolution. A pixel and phenology-based mapping algorithm was used to produce the time series maps of juniper forest encroachment using a combination of Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) mosaic data from 2010 and Landsat 5 and 7 data (10,871 images from 1984 to 2010). We analyzed the resultant maps to understand the dynamics of juniper forest encroachment at state and county spatial scales and examined juniper occurrence by geographic region and soil type. The juniper forest maps were generated over five multi-year periods: the late 1980s (1984-1989), early 1990s (1990-1994), late 1990s (1995-1999), early 2000s (2000-2004), and late 2000s (2005-2010).

However, little is known about the influence on the lake\'s wetland landscapes. Here, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations and a phenology-based decision tree approach, we present the spatial and temporal changes of the major wetland cover types from 2000 to 2014. Over the 15-year period, both total coverage of vegetation (Carex spp., Triarrhena lutarioriparia L. - Phragmites, sparse grass, and Zizania latifolia communities) and the area of each community (excluding floating aquatic macrophytes community or FAM) showed significantly increasing trends, with vegetation expanded towards the lake center. In contrast, the areas of water and mudflat have decreased significantly since the TGD impoundment, and they were mainly replaced by prominently expanded vegetated areas. The transition maps during 2000-2014 show that the vegetation community transitions occurred mainly from hydrophilic cover types to those adapted to dryer conditions. Despite the significant changes in wetland cover types, the most preferable water depth for each cover type remained stable before and after the TGD. In conclusion, the vegetation compositions are primarily controlled by water depth, indicating that the recent wetland changes can be directly linked to the TGD-induced hydrological regime-shift. These results provide a critical reference for local authorities to assess the potential influence of the newly proposed dam in this lake and to optimize its. future operations with respect to modulating water levels.', '[Han, Xingxing; Chen, Xiaoling] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.

In this work, we present and evaluate an improved AC for hyperspectral sensors developed within NASA\'s SeaWiFS Data Analysis System software package (SeaDAS). The improvement is based on combining the classical AC approach of multi-spectral capabilities to correct for the atmospheric path radiance, extended to hyperspectral, with a gas correction algorithm to compensate for absorbing gases in the atmosphere, including water vapor.

Yet the value of ocean colour for climate-change studies depends to a large extent not only on the decidedly important quality of the data per se, but. also on the qualities of the algorithms used to convert the multi-spectral radiance values detected by the ocean-colour satellite into relevant ecological, bio-optical and biogeochemical variables or properties of the ocean. The algorithms selected from the pool of available algorithms have to be fit for purpose: detection of marine ecosystem responses to climate change. Marine ecosystems might respond in a variety of ways to changing climate, including perturbations to regional distributions in the quantity and in the type of phytoplankton present, their locations and in their seasonal dynamics. The ideal algorithms would be capable of distinguishing between abundance and type, and would not mistake one for the other. They would be robust to changes in climate, and would not rely on assumptions that might be valid only under current climatic conditions. Based on such considerations, we identify a series of ideal qualitative traits that algorithms for climate-change studies would possess. Necessarily, such traits would have to complement the quantitative requirements for precision, accuracy and stability in the data over long time scales. We examine the extent to which available algorithms meet the criteria, according to the work carried out in the Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative, and where improvements are still needed.

New cloud-based computing platforms and satellite sensors offer opportunities for generating land cover maps designed to meet the spatial and temporal requirements of specific applications. Such maps can be a significant improvement compared to existing products, which tend to be coarser than 300 m, are often not representative of areas with fast-paced land use change, and have a fixed set of cover classes. Here, we present two approaches for land cover classification using the Landsat archive within Google Earth Engine. Random forest classification was performed with (1) season-based composites, where median values of individual bands and vegetation indices were generated from four years for each of four seasons, and (2) metric-based composites, where different quantiles were computed for the entire four-year period. These approaches were tested for six land cover types spanning over 18,000 locations in Zambia, with ground \"truth\" determined by visual inspection of high-resolution imagery from Google Earth. The methods were trained on 30% of these points and tested on the remaining 70%, and results were also compared with existing land cover products. Overall accuracies of about 89% were achieved for the season- and metric-based approaches for individual classes, with 93% and 94% accuracy for distinguishing.cropland from non-cropland. For the latter task, the existing Globeland30 dataset based on Landsat had much lower accuracies (around 77% on average), as did existing cover maps at coarser resolutions. Overall, the results support the use of either season or metric-based classification approaches. Both produce better results than those obtained from previous classifiers, which supports a general paradigm shift away from dependence on standard static products and towards custom generation of on-demand cover maps designed to fulfill the needs of each specific application.

To assess and understand these changes that are occurring all around the planet, regular and continuous monitoring is an essential condition. However, due to the potentially large area spread over numerous locations that need to be followed, this usually leads to a low frequency of monitoring of environmental changes of only a few selected sites at best.   With the increasing number of freely and openly accessible big remotely-sensed Earth Observations (EO) Data repositories and the increasing capabilities of open and interoperable software solutions it is now possible to automate various EO data processing tasks to monitor environmental changes at large scale.   This paper presents the Live Monitoring of Earth Surface (LiMES) framework that helps to automate image processing tasks in transforming raw data into information and knowledge through workflows using interoperable processing service chains for monitoring environmental changes. Both benefits and limitations are demonstrated and discussed through the implementation of a prototype to facilitate the update on the status of some of the 278 UNEP Environmental Hotspots. We believe that such a framework can help to reduce the gap between massive volumes of EO data and the users such as International Organizations (10) in order to help them better fulfil their environmental monitoring mandates by bringing raw data to a level which can be used by non-remote sensing experts for basic impacts assessments.

The foundations and core components of the AGDC are: (1) data preparation, including geometric and radiometric corrections to Earth observation data to produce standardised surface reflectance measurements that support time-series analysis, and collection management systems which track the provenance of each Data Cube product and formalise re-processing decisions; (2) the software environment used to manage and interact with the data; and (3) the supporting high performance computing environment provided by the Australian National Computational Infrastructure (NCI).

In the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM), this challenge is addressed through modeling, validation, and extensive tests in contrasting environments. Specifically, using extensive SSS datasets collected by many groups spanning > 10 years and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and SeaWiFS (Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor) estimated remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) at 412, 443, 488 (490), 555, and 667 (670) nm and sea surface temperature (SST), a multilayer perceptron neural network-based (MPNN) SSS model has been developed and validated with a spatial resolution of 1 km. The MPNN was selected over many other empirical approaches such as principle component analysis (PCA), multi-nonlinear regression (MNR), decision tree, random forest, and supporting vector machines (SVMs) after extensive evaluations. The MPNN was trained by a back-propagation learning technique with LevenbergMarquardt optimization and Bayesian regularization. The model showed an overall performance of root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.2, with coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.86, mean bias (MB) = 0.0, and mean ratio (MR) = 1.0 for SSS ranging between 1 and 37 (N = 3640). Validation using an independent dataset showed a RMSE of 1.1, MB of 0.0, and MR of 1.0 for SSS ranging between 27 and 37 (N = 412). The model with its original parameterization has been tested in the Mississippi-Atchafalaya coastal region, Florida\'s Big Bend region, and in the offshore Mississippi River plume, with satisfactory performance obtained in each case. Comparison with concurrent Aquarius-derived SSS maps (110-km resolution) showed similar agreement in offshore waters as indicated above, but the new 1-km resolution SSS maps revealed more finer-scale features as well as salinity gradients in coastal waters. The sensitivity of the model to realistic model input errors in satellite derived SST and Rrs was also thoroughly examined, with uncertainties in the model-derived SSS being always < 1 for SSS > 30. The extensive validation, evaluation, and sensitivity test all indicated the robustness of the MPNN model in estimating SSS in most, if not all, coastal waters and offshore plumes in the northern GOM. Thus, the model provided a basis for generating near real-time 1-km resolution SSS maps from satellite measurements. However, the model showed limitations when applied to regions with known algal blooms or up welling as they both led to low Rrs in the blue bands that may be falsely recognized as caused by low SSS.', '[Chen, Shuangling; Hu, Chuanmin] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, 140 Seventh Ave South, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.', 'State University System of Florida; University of South FloridaRP Hu, CM (通讯作者)，Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, 140 Seventh Ave South, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.', 'huc@usf.eduRI Hu, Chuanmin/AAB-9604-2021', 'Hu, Chuanmin/0000-0003-3949-6560', 'U.S. NASA Ocean Biology and Bio-geochemistry program [NNX13AD08G,   NNX14AL98G, NNX15AB13A]; University of South Florida fellowship; BP/Gulf   of Mexico Research Initiative through the DEEPEND consortium; BP/Gulf of   Mexico Research Initiative; NASA [NNX15AB13A, 679093, NNX14AL98G,   808932, NNX13AD08G, 475902] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER', 'This research was supported by the U.S. NASA Ocean Biology and   Bio-geochemistry program (NNX13AD08G, NNX14AL98G, NNX15AB13A) and by a   University of South Florida fellowship.

When combined, space-borne LiDAR geolocation error and the footprint size may however have considerable effects on the estimation accuracy of forest stand variables, such as aboveground biomass (AGB). The aim of this study was to draw recommendations for future space-borne LiDAR systems, which should deliver data for unbiased AGB assessments. The recommendations were drawn from AGB estimations based on space borne LiDAR waveforms simulated over a 1300 ha large study site in southern Sweden. Large-footprint, nadir looking satellite waveforms were simulated by stacking individual small-footprint, airborne LiDAR waveforms observed near a predefined sampling pattern. The stacked waveforms, represented by their metrics, were used as input for a two-phase systematic sampling in combination with model-assisted estimation or hybrid inference for estimating AGB and its variance. The second-phase sample included 264 inventory plots, whereas the first-phase sample included 1010 sample locations, where satellite waveforms were simulated. After simulating satellite waveforms with different footprint sizes and analyzing the AGB variance, the recommendation is to have a footprint size that is similar to the size of the field plots used for collecting reference data, i.e. 20 m diameter in our case. For the optimal footprint size, AGB was estimated with a precision of 2.9 Mg per hectare (2.9% of the average). The results also showed that variance estimates increased constantly with increasing geolocation error. For a geolocation error of 14 m, variance estimates increased by 17%, which justifies investing additional efforts in minimizing it.', '[Milenkovic, Milutin; Ressl, Camillo; Hollaus, Markus; Pfeifer, Norbert] Tech Univ Wien, Dept Geodesy & Geoinformat GEO, Gusshausstr 27-29, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.

It is shown for the first time that, for deciduous Indian tropical forests, seasonal changes such as leaf-fall affect the PoIInSAR based height inversion performance. For species exhibiting leaf-fall, acquisition during leaf-on season provides better height inversion accuracy (r(2)=0.75) than for leaf-fall season (r(2)=0.65). Results show consistent PoIInSAR height inversion performance for both high- and low-biomass forests in both natural and managed forest tracts. Spatial baseline is a critical factor for selection of suitable acquisitions for PoIInSAR based height estimation. The effect of spatial baseline on height inversion performance is also discussed.

The species energy hypothesis predicts that higher abundance and richness of animal species occur where available energy is higher and more consistently available. There is a wide range of remote sensing proxies for available energy, such as vegetation productivity, but it is not clear which best predict species richness. Our goal here was to evaluate different proxies for annual plant productivity from Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) as input for the Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs), and to determine how well they predict the richness of breeding bird species in six functional guilds across the conterminous United States. The DHIs are measures of vegetation productivity over the course of a year and consist of three components: (1) cumulative productivity (DHI Cum), (2) minimum productivity (DHI Min), and (3) intra-annual variation of productivity (DHI Var). We hypothesized that increases in cumulative and minimum productivity and reductions in intra-annual variation will be associated with higher species richness. We calculated the DHIs from a range of MODIS 1000-m vegetation productivity data sets for 20032014, i.e., the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Fraction of absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). We summarized bird species richness of different guilds within ecoregions (n = 85) based on abundance maps derived from the >3000 routes of the North American Breeding Bird Survey for 2006 to 2012. Generally, we found all the DHI5 had high explanatory power for predicting breeding bird species richness. However, the strength of the associations between the DHI5 and bird species richness depended on habitat, nest placement, and migratory behavior. We found highest correlations for habitat-based guilds, such as grassland breeding species (R-adj(2) 0.66-0.73 for the multiple DHI regression model; R-adj(2) 0.41-0.61 for minimum DHI) and woodland breeding species (R-adj(2), 0.34-0.60 for the multiple DHI regression model; R-adj(2), 0.26-0.51 for cumulative DHI). The strong relationship between the DHI5 and bird species richness reinforces the importance of vegetation productivity as a determinant of species diversity patterns, and the usefulness of satellite data for applying the species energy hypothesis to predictions in service to conservation.

Satellite observations from coarse resolution sensors (i.e., MODIS and AVHRR) have been widely used to study impacts of climate anomalies on vegetation phenology. The advantage of coarse resolution sensors are daily observations across the entire globe, but the coarse spatial resolution, as well as the relatively short time span covered by MODIS, are significant drawbacks in analyzing landscape-scale trends in phenology. Time series data from the medium resolution sensor Landsat may overcome these issues. However, because of Landsat\'s lower observation frequency, phenological methods developed with coarse resolution data are not directly transferable. Here, we demonstrate a new Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework for estimating inter-annual variation in vegetation phonology from Landsat time series while controlling for spatial variation. The method pools all available observations to estimate the spatial variation in phonological parameters, while specifically modeling inter-annual variation as random effect terms. The advantage of a Bayesian approach is the ability to incorporate prior knowledge from other phenology and climate observations to reduce variability in the estimates, as well as a more robust estimation of uncertainty. We demonstrate and evaluate the modeling framework with a case study of changing spring phenology in broad-leaved trees in the Bavarian Forest National Park in southern Germany. Results show that the model estimated the spatial and temporal variation in phonological parameters precisely. Temporal variation in start of season showed overall strong agreement with ground-based measures of bud-break variability (r = 0.82 [0.80-0.841). Our proposed modeling framework will help to better monitor and understand changes in vegetation phonology at scales yet unexplored by the phonological community. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In existing SPM methods, the effect of point spread function (PSF) has seldom been considered. In this paper, a generic SPM method is developed to consider the PSF effect in SPM and, thereby, to increase prediction accuracy. We first demonstrate that the spectral unmixing predictions (i.e., coarse land cover proportions used as input for SPM) are a convolution of not only sub-pixels within the coarse pixel, but also sub-pixels from neighboring coarse pixels. Based on this finding, a new SPM method based on optimization is developed which recognizes the optimal solution as the one that when convolved with the PSF, is the same as the input coarse land cover proportion. Experimental results on three separate datasets show that the SPM accuracy can be increased by considering the PSF effect. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in hybrid methods that combine initial segmentation with subsequent region merging, because they exploit spectral signals across an entire geo-object, including both the boundary signals used to delineate the initial segments, and the interior signals used to merge similar segments. However, existing algorithms commonly use a single, global parameter to control the process of region merging, thereby limiting the goodness-of-fit between segments and geo-objects, since homogeneous and heterogeneous segments are treated equally. To overcome this limitation, we developed a new hybrid segmentation method that employs local spectral angle (SA) thresholds for region merging. We implemented our local SA method in three very different landscapes, then compared our region merging method to the global SA method, as well as the global elevation method used in System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA). In all three landscapes, the results revealed that the local SA segmentation provides a better fit to reference polygons than the two global threshold methods, as measured using a modified discrepancy measure for the purpose of geo-object recognition (QR(M)). We also found that the local SA method produced segments with a greater variation in size, indicating the method is effective for achieving multi-scale segmentation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, a scheme considering vegetation growth trajectory, protection of key point, noise resistance and curve stability was proposed to evaluate the gap-filling approaches. Six approaches for gap filling were globally evaluated pixel-by-pixel based on a reference NDVI generated from MODIS observations during the past 15 years. The evaluated approaches include the Fourier-based approach (Fourier), the double logistic model (DL), the iterative interpolation for data reconstruction (IDR), the Whittaker smoother (Whit), the Savitzky-Golay filter (SG) andthe locally adjusted cubic spline capping approach (LACC). Considering the five aspects, the ranks of the overall performance are LACC > Fourier > IDR > DL > SG > Whit. The six approaches are similar in filling the gaps and remaining the curve stability but there are large difference in protection of key points and noise resistance. The SG is sensitive to noises and the Whit is poor in protection of key points. In the monsoon regions of India, all evaluated approaches don\'t work well. This paper provides some new views for evaluating the gap filling approaches that will be helpful in selecting the optimal approach to reconstruct the time series of parameters for data applications.

In a first step, the SMOS LPRM soil moisture retrievals were used as the baseline for optimizing the internal parameterization (i.e. surface roughness and single scattering albedo) of the AMSR-E LPRM retrievals. Secondly, to overcome the uniqueness of these datasets a linear scaling approach was applied resulting in a consistent soil moisture dataset. The new parameter set from the first step is similar for the two (low) frequencies of AMSR-E (i.e. C-and X-band) further improving their inter-comparability for both soil moisture and vegetation optical depth. Soil moisture retrievals from these AMSR-E frequencies were globally merged based on the availability of brightness temperatures that are free from RFI contamination (resulting in AMSR-E LPRMN). This new product was evaluated against both the SMOS LPRM product in the overlapping period (July2010 to October 2011), as well as the standard, publicly available AMSR-E LPRM dataset (AMSR-E LPRMv3) for an almost 9 year period (January 2003 to October 2011). For the overlapping period, the AMSR-E and SMOS LPRM products show high temporal correlation coefficients (0.60 < R< 0.90) and low root mean square errors (rmse < 0.04 m(3) m(-3)) for NDVI values up to 0.60. Their agreement tends to drop over the well-known challenging areas such as the arctic region and tropical rainforest. A detailed evaluation over in situ sites from 5 in situ networks worldwide showed that AMSR-E LPRMN often outperforms SMOS LPRM in sparsely vegetated areas, with generally higher correlation coefficients in areas with NDVI <03, and in general a lower unbiased rmse (ubrmse). In line with theoretical expectations, SMOS LPRM outperforms the AMSR-E LPRM product over the more densely vegetated areas. The newly developed AMSR-E LPRMN product was also compared against AMSR-E LPRMv3, revealing a significant increase (from 0.48 to 0.55) in temporal correlation coefficient over 16 in situ networks. This finding was confirmed through a large scale (50 degrees N -50 degrees S) precipitation based verification technique, the so-called R-value, which shows a superior performance of the newly developed AMSR-E LPRMN product. Additionally, the linear scaling of AMSR-E LPRMN to the SMOS LPRM leads to further reducing the ubrmse from 0.09 to 0.06 m(3) m(-3) and the average bias from 0.14 to 0.00 m(3) m(-3) over these stations. The AMSR-E LPRMN was furthermore compared against the top layer of two re-analysis models (i.e. from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications-Land and ERA-Interim/Land models) generally demonstrating increased correlation coefficients and reduced ubrmse with the exception of the challenging areas. As a result, this study shows the significant potential of SMOS LPRM to be a successful integrator to build a long term soil moisture record based on multiple passive microwave sensors.

However, the characterization of the uncertainty of mapped or estimated biomass in previous studies was either based on ad-hoc approaches (e.g., using model fitting statistics such root mean square errors derived from purposive samples) or mostly limited to the analysis of mean biomass for the whole study area. This study proposed a novel uncertainty analysis method that can characterize biomass uncertainty across multiple spatial scales and multiple spatial resolutions. The uncertainty analysis method built on model-based inference and can propagate errors from trees to field plots, individual pixels, and small areas or large regions that consist of multiple pixels (up to all pixels within a study area). We developed and tested this method over northern Minnesota forest areas of approximately 69,508 km(2) via a unique combination of several datasets for biomass mapping and estimation: wall-to-wall airborne lidar data, national forest inventory (NFI) plots, and destructive measurements of tree aboveground biomass (AGB). We found that the pixel-level AGB prediction error is dominated by lidar-based AGB model residual errors when the spatial resolution is near 380 m or finer and by model parameter estimate errors when the spatial resolution is coarser. We also found that the relative error of AGB predicted from lidar can be reduced to approximately 11% (or mean 5.1 Mg/ha; max 43.6 Mg/ha) at one-hectare scale (or at 100 m spatial resolution) over our study area. Because our uncertainty analysis method uses model-based inference and does not require probability samples of field plots, our methodology has potential applications worldwide, especially over tropics and developing countries where NFI systems are not well-established.

Based on per-pixel estimates of percentage tree cover and their associated uncertainty, the dataset currently represents binary forest cover in nominal 1990, 2000, and 2005 epochs, as well as gains and losses over time. A comprehensive accuracy assessment of the GLCF dataset was performed using a global, design-based sample of 27,988 independent, visually interpreted reference points collected through a two-stage, stratified sampling design wherein experts visually identified forest cover and change in each of the 3 epochs based on Landsat and high-resolution satellite images, vegetation index profiles, and field photos. Consistent across epochs, the overall accuracy of the static forest-cover layers was 91%, and the overall accuracy of forest-cover change was >88% among the highest accuracies reported for recent global forest- and land-cover data products. Both commission error (CE) and omission error (OE) were low for static forest cover in each epoch and for the stable classes between epochs (CE < 3%, OE < 22%), but errors were larger for forest loss (45% <= CE < 62%, 47% < OE < 55%) and gain (66% <= CE < 85%, 61% < OE < 84%). Accuracy was lower in sparse forests and savannahs, i.e., where tree cover was at or near the 30% threshold used to discriminate forest from non-forest cover. Discrimination of forest had a low rate of commission error and slight negative bias, especially in areas with low tree cover. After adjusting global area estimates to reference data, 39.28 +/- 1.34 million km(2) and 38.81 +/- 1.34 million km(2) of forest were respectively identified in 2000 and 2005 globally, and 33.16 +/- 1.36 million km(2) of forest were estimated in the available coverage of Landsat data circa-1990. Forest loss and gain were estimated to have been 0.73 +/- 0.38 and 0.28 +/- 0.26 million km(2) between 2000 and 2005, and 1.08 +/- 0.53 and 0.53 +/- 0.47 million km(2) between 1990 and 2000. These estimates of accuracy are required for rigorous use of the data in the Earth sciences (e.g., ecology, economics, hydrology, climatology) as well as for fusion with other records of global change.

In this study, land cover change detection by integrating object-based data blending model of Landsat and MODIS is proposed to solve this issue. The Estimation of Scale Parameter (ESP) tool under Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) restriction is employed to identify the optimal scale for Landsat image segmentation. The Object Based Spatial and Temporal Vegetation Index Unmixing Model (OB-STVIUM) disaggregates MODIS NDVIs to Landsat objects using the spatial analysis and the linear mixing theory. Then, the change detection method of NDVI Gradient Difference (NDVI-GD) is developed to detect change and no-change objects considering the NDVI shape and value differences simultaneously. The results of the study indicate that the approach proposed in this study can effectively detect change areas when Landsat images are acquired from different seasons. OB-STVIUM is more suitable for change detection application compared with the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) and NDVI Linear Mixing Growth Model (NDVI-LMGM), because it is less sensitive to the number and acquisition time of Landsat images.

In this paper, the random error and systematic differences in nine passive and active microwave satellite soil moisture products over Australia (time coverage: 1978-present) are estimated in a same manner for SM components at subseasonal and seasonal-to-interannual timescales separately. The multi-scale error structures are found to be non-trivial and vary between the products, giving cause for conducting multi-scale merging with awareness of these differences. Noticeable similarities between the error structures of the satellite products derived from same retrieval algorithm and same measuring frequency however suggest transferability of error parameters between them. Using partial rank correlation analysis, the error maps are linked to statistics on vegetation index, digital elevation, soil moisture and soil temperature, and land cover fractions and mixing in order to explain the observed variability and the similarities between the products.

Traditional linear fitting and stand-alone methods are usually uncertain with respect to the spatial distribution and temporal variation of derived snow cover, as they rarely consider local conditions and scene characteristics but fit the model with static empirical coefficients. In this paper, a novel method utilizing daily ground in situ observations is proposed and evaluated, with the purpose for accurate estimation of long-term daily snow cover. To solve the challenge that ground snow-free records are insufficient, a one-class classifier, namely the Presence and Background Learning (PBL) algorithm, is employed to identify daily global snow cover. Benefiting from daily ground in situ observations on a global scale, the proposed method is temporally and spatially dynamic such that estimation errors are globally independent during the entire study period. The proposed method is applied to the estimation of global daily snow cover from 1987 to 2010; the results are validated by ground in situ observations and compared with available optical-based and microwave-based snow cover products. Promising accuracy and model stability are achieved in daily, monthly and yearly validations as compared against ground observations (global omission error <0.13, overall accuracy >0.82 in China region, and keep stable in monthly and yearly averages). The comparison against the MODIS daily snow cover product (MOD10C1) shows good agreement under cloud-free conditions (Cohen\'s kappa = 0.715). The comparison against the NOAA daily Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) dataset suggests promising agreement in the Northern Hemisphere.

SMOS operates at L-band (1.4 GHz) and, at this frequency, the signal not only depends on soil moisture and vegetation optical depth but is also significantly affected by surface effects and, in particular, by the soil roughness. However, when dense vegetation is present, the L-band signal is poorly sensitive to the surface effects. First, by using multiple regressions between soil moisture (SM) and brightness temperature (TB) at different incidence angles and polarizations, the SMOS sensitivity to the surface effects was evaluated. A global-scale map of SMOS sensitivity to the surface effects was computed and showed that, for 87% of the land surface, the SMOS observations were sensitive to these effects, while very low sensitivity to the surface effects was estimated over 13% of the land surfaces. For instance, over broadleaf evergreen forest (mainly the Amazon and Congo forests), SMOS was sensitive to the surface effects over only half of the pixels considered. In a second step, in L-MEB (L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere), the forward emission model of the SMOS algorithm, the vegetation and roughness effects were combined in a single parameter, referred to as TR in this study. By inverting L-MEB, SM and TR were retrieved at global scale from the SMOS Level 3 (13) TB observations during 2011. Assuming a linear relationship between TR and the Leaf Area Index (LAI) obtained from MODIS data, the effects of roughness (H-r) and vegetation were decoupled and a global map of soil roughness effects was estimated. It was found that the spatial pattern of the H-r values could be related to the main vegetation types. Higher values of roughness (H-r = 0.32-0.39) were obtained for forests (broadleaf evergreen, deciduous and mixed coniferous) while lower values (H-r = 0.14-0.16) were obtained for deserts, shrubs and bare soils. Intermediate values (H-r = 0.20-0.23) were obtained over grasslands, tundra and cultivated land. Over vegetation biomes composed of forests and wooded grasslands, the H-r values were mainly correlated to the vegetation density (r similar to 0.55). For deserts, shrubs and bare soils, the H-r values were mainly correlated to the topography slopes (r similar to 0.53). The global maps presented in this study could lead to improved retrievals of soil moisture and vegetation optical depth for present and future microwave remote sensing missions such as SMOS and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP).

The influence of the roughness effect due to surface waves is consistent with the one found with an older version of SMOS TB. The two-layer incoherent model of foam emissivity accounts for weak volume scatterings and multiple reflections within a medium with an exponential vertical permittivity profile. The foam emissivity simulated using this model at L band varies from 0.35 to close to 1 with thickness varying from 0.01 cm to 2 cm. The wind induced brightness temperature components deduced from the multi-angular SMOS TB is used to optimize the foam void fraction (defined as the fraction of a unit volume of seawater that is occupied by air) at the air-sea interface, an effective thickness of foam layer and the dependency of foam coverage with wind speed. A new set of parameters for the foam emissivity model and the foam coverage model that can be used for WS up to 22 m s(-1) for the SMOS sea surface salinity retrieval is proposed. Our foam coverage model derived from SMOS data is now in much better agreement with other estimates derived from other sensors, although it predicts slightly lower coverage at all winds speeds, likely due to the longer wavelength of SMOS measurements.

While a large number of efforts have been made to extract coastline and detect coastline change with remotely sensed data, the temporal frequency and spatial resolution of coastline datasets obtained are generally not fine enough to reflect the detailed process of coastline retreat and/or advance, particularly in coastlines with subtle variability. To overcome these limitations, we developed a method to continuously monitor the dynamics of a muddy coastline with subtle variability in western Florida at annual and subpixel scales using time-series Landsat data (1984-2013). First, robust indicators were used to indicate the annual \"average\" location of the dynamic coastline. Due to the complexity of muddy-coast morphology, the annual average location is represented not by the coast \"line\", but by the fractional inundated \"area\" of coastline pixels (pixels where the coastline is located), namely annually inundated area. Second, the annually inundated area of coastline pixels was estimated with a model proposed in this study, and the uncertainty was estimated with the Monte Carlo method. The retrievals were validated at 10 sites with aerial imagery, and the overall RMSE (root mean square error) is 11.48%. Third, the long-term trend for the time series of annually inundated area was derived with a statistical model. The results indicate that the muddy coast in western Florida continues to shrink with an average rate of 0.42 +/- 0.05 km(2)/year during the three decades. This study demonstrates the feasibility of time-series Landsat data in continuous monitoring of coastline dynamics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, we lack robust and efficient ways to monitor the temporal dynamics of leaf traits. Here we assessed the potential of leaf spectroscopy to predict and monitor leaf traits across their entire life cycle at different forest sites and light environments (sunlit vs. shaded) using a weekly sampled dataset across the entire growing season at two temperate deciduous forests. The dataset includes field measured leaf-level directional-hemispherical reflectance/transmittance together with seven important leaf traits [total chlorophyll (chlorophyll a and b), carotenoids, mass-based nitrogen concentration (N-mass), mass-based carbon mass, concentration (C-mass), and leaf mass per area (LMA)]. All leaf traits varied significantly throughout the growing season, and displayed trait-specific temporal patterns. We used a Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) modeling approach to estimate leaf traits from spectra, and found that PLSR was able to capture the variability across time, sites, and light environments of all leaf traits investigated (R-2 = 0.6-0.8 for temporal variability; R-2 = 0.3-0.7 for cross-site variability; R-2 = 0.4-0.8 for variability from light environments). We also tested alternative field sampling designs and found that for most leaf traits, biweekly leaf sampling throughout the growing season enabled accurate characterization of the seasonal patterns. Compared with the estimation of foliar pigments, the performance of N-mass, C-mass and LMA PLSR models improved more significantly with sampling frequency. Our results demonstrate that leaf spectra-trait relationships vary with time, and thus tracking the seasonality of leaf traits requires statistical models calibrated with data sampled throughout the growing season. Our results have broad implications for future research that use vegetation spectra to infer leaf traits at different growing stages. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Motivated by the stringent requirements on SST accuracy required for Climate Data Records (CDR) we quantify sampling errors in satellite SSTs. Infrared sensors, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), have sampling errors caused by incomplete coverage primarily due to clouds and inter-swath gaps (gaps between successive swaths/orbits). Unlike retrieval errors, the sampling errors are introduced when calculating mean values and in generating gap-free SST fields. We generate MODIS-sampled SST fields by superimposing MODIS cloud masks on top of the Multi-scale Ultrahigh Resolution (MUR) SST field for the same day. Based on the MODIS-sampled fields, we calculate sampling errors at different temporal and spatial resolutions to examine the impacts at different scales. Our results indicate that sampling errors are significant, more so in the high latitudes, especially the Arctic. The 30 degrees N-30 degrees S zonal band is found to have the smallest errors; a notable exception is the persistent negative errors found in the Tropical Instability Wave area, where the mesoscale ocean-atmosphere interaction leads to a more frequently satellite sampling above the cold sections of the wave area. The global mean sampling error is generally positive and increases approximately exponentially with missing data fraction at a fixed averaging interval, while error variability is mainly controlled by SST variability. Areas with persistent cloud cover have large sampling errors in temporally averaged SSTs. We conclude that the sampling error can be an important or even dominant component of the error budget of mean and gap-free SST fields. Climate data generation and interpretation of satellite-derived SST CDRs and their application must be conducted with due regard to the sampling error. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Detecting and mapping logging impacts on forest structure is a primary conservation concern, as these impacts feed through to changes in biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Here, we test whether high-spatial resolution satellite remote sensing can be used to map the responses of aboveground live tree biomass (AGB), canopy leaf area index (LAI) and fractional vegetation cover (FCover) to selective logging and deforestation in Malaysian Borneo. We measured these attributes in permanent vegetation plots in rainforest and oil palm plantations across the degradation landscape of the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems project. We found significant mathematical relationships between field-measured structure and satellite-derived spectral and texture information, explaining up to 62% of variation in biophysical structure across forest and oil palm plots. These relationships held at different aggregation levels from plots to forest disturbance types and oil palms allowing us to map aboveground biomass and canopy structure across the degradation landscape. The maps reveal considerable spatial variation in the impacts of previous logging, a pattern that was less clear when considering field data alone. Up-scaled maps revealed a pronounced decline in aboveground live tree biomass with increasing disturbance, impacts which are also clearly visible in the field data even a decade after logging. Field data demonstrate a rapid recovery in forest canopy structure with the canopy recovering to pre-disturbance levels a decade after logging. Yet, up-scaled maps show that both LAI and FCover are still reduced in logged compared to primary forest stands and markedly lower in oil palm stands. While uncertainties remain, these maps can now be utilised to identify conservation win-wins, especially when combining them with ongoing biodiversity surveys and measurements of carbon sequestration, hydrological cycles and microclimate.

Remotely sensed predictions of fuel moisture have typically focused on live fuels; but regional estimates of dead fuel moisture have been less common. Here we develop and test the spatial application of a recently developed dead fuel moisture model, which is based on the exponential decline of fine fuel moisture with increasing vapour pressure deficit (D). We first compare the performance of two existing approaches to predict D from satellite observations. We then use remotely sensed D, as well as D estimated from gridded daily weather observations, to predict dead fuel moisture. We calibrate and test the model at a woodland site in South East Australia, and then test the model at a range of sites in South East Australia and Southern California that vary in vegetation type, mean annual precipitation (129-1404 mm year(-1)) and leaf area index (0.1-5.7). We found that D modelled from remotely sensed land surface temperature performed slightly better than a model which also included total precipitable water (MAE < 1.16 kPa and 1.62 kPa respectively). D calculated with observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra satellite was under-predicted in areas with low leaf area index. Both D from remotely sensed data and gridded weather station data were good predictors of the moisture content of dead suspended fuels at validation sites, with mean absolute errors less than 3.9% and 6.0% respectively. The occurrence of data gaps in remotely sensed time series presents an obstacle to this approach, and assimilated or extrapolated meteorological observations may offer better continuity.

Gabon has recently launched a National Climate Action Plan with the intent of establishing a National Forest Monitoring System that meets the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 guidelines for the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector. The assessment of areas of forest cover and forest cover change is essential to estimate activity data, defined as areas of various categories of land use change by the IPCC guidelines.   An appropriately designed probability sample can be used to estimate forest cover and net change and their associated uncertainties and express them in the form of confidence intervals at selected probability thresholds as required in the IPCC 2006 guidelines and for reporting to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). However, wall-to-wall mapping is often required to provide a comprehensive assessment of forest resources and as input to land use plans for management purposes, but wall-to-wall approaches are more expensive than a sample based approach based on visual interpretation and require specialized equipment and staff. The recent release of the University of Maryland (UMD) Global Forest Change (GFC) map products could be an alternative for tropical countries wishing to develop their own wall-to-wall forest map products but without the resources to do so. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of replacing national wall-to-wall forest maps with forest maps obtained from the UMD GFC initiative.   A model assisted regression (MAR) estimator was applied using the combination of reference data obtained from a probability sample and forest cover and forest cover change maps either (i) produced nationally or (ii) obtained from the UMD GFC data. The resulting activity data are potentially more accurate than the SRS estimate and provide an assessment of the precision of the estimate which is not available from map accuracy indices alone. Results obtained for 2000 and 2010 for both the national and UMD GFC datasets confirm the high level of forest cover in Gabon, more than 235 million ha representing approximately 88.5% of the country.   Although the UMD GFC dataset provides a reliable means of producing area statistics at national level combined with appropriate sample reference data, thus offering an alternative to nationally produced datasets (i) the classification errors associated with the Global dataset have non-negligible effects on both the estimate and the precision which supports the more general statement that map data should not be used alone to produce area estimates, and (ii) the maps obtained from the UMD GFC dataset require specific calibration of the tree cover percentage representing a non -negligible effort requiring specialized staff and equipment. Guidelines on how to use and further improve UMD GFC maps for national reporting are suggested. However, this additional effort would still most likely be less than the production of national based maps.

However, there is no automated tool to extract these interannual changes from remote sensing time series. To fill this gap, the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) framework was refined and implemented to decompose time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and reconstruct their interannual components. The performance of EEMD-based interannual NDVI detection was assessed using simulated time series, and its sensitivity to model and data parameters was determined to provide a basis for remote sensing applications. The sensitivity analysis highlighted application limitations for time series with low interannual to annual amplitude ratios and high irregularity in timing of growing seasons, as these factors have the strongest effects on the overall performance. However, within these limitations, the detected interannual components correspond well to simulated input components with respect to timing of episodes and composition of time scales. The applicability on real world NDVI time series was demonstrated by mapping the coupling between precipitation variability, interannual vegetation changes, and the El Nino Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole phenomena for ecoregions in East and Central Africa. In most areas where precipitation was found sensitive to oceanic forcing, the EEMD detected vegetation changes matched the predicted response, except in dense forest ecosystems.

The leading mode of the singular value decomposition analysis of SST and Sea Level Pressure (SLP) for 31 years (1981/12-2012/12) shows an apparent North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) forcing on the SST fields. Specifically, the 551 and SLP one-month phase lag covariance is notable at temporal scales of 4 to 11 months. After removing the first order component of the NAO, the residual SST (RESST) provides better estimates of the AMOC on a shorter time scale than the SST. This is because that RESST is less likely to be affected by the local SLP on these time scales. The high correlation is primarily between the RESST and variations of the geostrophic Upper Mid-Ocean transport component of the AMOC. The 31-year RESST time series in the North Atlantic subpolar region is also significantly correlated with the Gulf Stream path SST anomalies with a one-month lead, implying a fast signal transport from the subpolar North Atlantic to the Gulf Stream. A similar fast adjustment signal is also found in 500-year control simulations of the GFDL model CM2.1. These results indicate a prospective capability of satellite-derived SSTs to predict AMOC variability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Despite decades of research in soil mapping, no reliable and up-to-date salinity maps are available for large geographical regions, especially for the salinity ranges that are most relevant to agricultural productivity (i.e., salinities less than 20 dS m(-1), when measured as the electrical conductivity of the soil saturation extract). This paper explores the potentials and limitations of assessing and mapping soil salinity via linear modeling of remote sensing vegetation indices. A case study is presented for western San Joaquin Valley, California, USA using multi-year Landsat 7 ETM + canopy reflectance and the Canopy Response Salinity Index (CRSI). Highly detailed salinity maps for 22 fields comprising 542 ha were used for ground-truthing. Re-gridded to 30 x 30 m, the ground-truth data totaled over 5000 pixels with salinity values in the range 0 to 352 dS m(-1). Multi-year maximum values of CRSI were used to model soil salinity. Soil type, meteorological data, and crop type were evaluated as covariates. All considered models were evaluated for their fit to the whole data set as well as their performance in a leave-one-field-out spatial cross-validation. The best performing model was a function of CRSI, crop type (i.e., cropped or fallow), rainfall, and average minimum temperature, with R-2 = 0.728 when evaluated against all data and R-2 = 0.611 for the cross-validation predictions. Broken out by salinity classes, the mean absolute errors (MAE) for the cross-validation predictions were (all units dS m(-1)): 2.94 for the 0-2 interval (non-saline), 2.12 for 2-4 (slightly saline), 2.35 for 4-8 (moderately saline), 3.23 for 8-16 (strongly saline), and 5.64 for >16 (extremely saline). On a per-field basis, the validation predictions had good agreement with the field average (R-2 = 0.79, MAE = 2.46 dS m(-1)), minimum (R-2 = 0.76, MAE = 225 dS m(-1)), and maximum (R-2 = 0.76, MAE = 3.09 dS m(-1)) observed salinity. Overall, reasonably accurate and precise high resolution, regional-scale remote sensing of soil salinity is possible, even over the critical range of 0 to 20 dS m(-1), where researchers and policy makers must focus to prevent loss of agricultural productivity and ecosystem health.

In many places, this pixel size is closer to that of individual landscape elements, such as managed forest stands or crop fields, than those of time series more typically used in vegetation analyses (with pixel sizes ranging from about 1 km to 8 km). With such spatial resolution, combined with its increasingly long archive, MODIS data offers great potential for vegetation monitoring applications in general, and crop growth monitoring in particular. However, due to its whiskbroom design, the observation geometry of the MODIS instrument, combined with the spatial uncertainty in the registration of the images, can result in different (albeit neighbouring) physical areas being mapped onto the same pixel depending on the view zenith angle (which varies from day to the next). Rather than considering this as an inconvenience, a method is here proposed to exploit this peculiarity to identify pixels corresponding to a homogeneous plant cover, in order to retrieve surface specific time series of satellite products. This method is based on quantifying the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR, hereafter) of the daily MODIS NDVI time series, defined as the variance of smoothed temporal signal over the variance of the residues. If consecutive observations of the same pixel (which have thus sampled the spatial vicinity of that pixel) provide similar NDVI values, the resulting temporal signal is relatively stable and the SNR is high. Such stability can indicate that the signal comes from a spatially homogeneous surface, such as a single large field covered by the same crop with similar agro-management practices. On the contrary, a noisy time series indicates instead a transition zone between different land uses or between fields with different management practices. SNR maps therefore serve as a proxy for sub-pixel homogeneity from which time series originating from a specific land cover or land use can be retrieved. This approach is demonstrated over 12 contrasting agricultural landscapes across the globe from which clearly distinctive crop specific signals are extracted. Exploiting the full MODIS archive to derive surface specific information in this way should open new avenues for regional to global agricultural monitoring applications. Expanding this method to derive satellite products for specific land cover classes could also be useful for many other applications linked to dynamics of land cover and land use change.

High temporal remote sensing imagery is widely used for this purpose with the limitations of relatively low spatial resolutions. In this study, a novel method based on integration of back-propagation neural network (BP) and genetic algorithm (GA), so-called IBPGA, is proposed for super-resolution mapping of wetland inundation (SMWI) from multispectral remote sensing imagery. The IBPGA-SMWI algorithm is developed, including the fitness function and integration search strategy. IBPGA-SMWI was evaluated using Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery from the Poyanghu wetland in China and the Macquarie Marshes in Australia. Compared with traditional SMWI methods, IBPGA-SMWI consistently achieved more accurate super-resolution mapping results in terms of visual and quantitative evaluations. In comparison with GA-SMWI, IBPGA-SMWI not only improved the accuracy of SMWI, but also accelerated the convergence speed of the algorithm. The sensitivity analysis of IBPGA-SMWI in relation to standard crossover rate, BP crossover rate and mutation rate was also carried out to discuss the algorithm performance. It is hoped that the results of this study will enhance the application of median-low resolution remote sensing imagery in wetland inundation mapping and monitoring, and ultimately support the studies of wetland environment.

In this paper, we describe the work done to improve the High Resolution (1/16 degrees) interpolated product covering the Mediterranean Sea, that is obtained by combining all available satellite infrared images. Three Optimal Interpolation schemes based on different space-time covariance models and background fields are derived, compared and validated versus in situ drifting buoy measurements (leading to a minimum standard deviation error (SIDE) of 0.46 degrees K and mean bias error (MBE) of -0.15 degrees K), as well as by adopting a holdout validation approach with artificial clouds (with STDE ranging between 0.22 degrees K and 0.55 degrees K, and MBE always between 0.03 degrees K and 0.05 degrees K, depending on the cloud configuration considered). Almost negligible differences are found between the three products, revealing only a slight improvement when using spatially varying covariance parameters and a daily climatology as background, which is less risky in case of prolonged cloudy conditions, though attaining the same performance with small/rapid clouds. This scheme has thus been implemented in the Mediterranean SST operational chain since April 2014. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Nardelli, B.

Optical methods are particularly valuable for remote sensing of soil moisture since reflected solar radiation is the strongest passive signal available to satellites and thus observations at optical wavelengths are capable of providing high spatial resolution data. Since remote sensors do not measure soil water content directly, mathematical algorithms that describe the connection between the measured signal and surface water content must be derived. Here, we present a physically-based soil moisture retrieval model in the solar domain (350-2500 nm) that is based on the Kubelka-Munk two-flux radiative transfer theory. The model is designed to describe diffuse reflectance from a uniform, optically thick, absorbing and scattering medium. The theory suggests a linear relationship between a transformed reflectance and soil water content in the short wave infrared bands (e.g. band 7 of Landsat and MODIS satellites) providing an easy-to-use algorithm in these bands. Accuracy of this model was tested and preliminarily verified using laboratory-measured spectral reflectance data of different soils. Further studies on potentials and challenges of this model for large-scale application using optical satellites data remain a topic of ongoing research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Although this approach addresses the accuracy of derived geophysical properties in a straight forward fashion, it is also limited in its ability to catch systematic sensor and processor dependent behaviour of satellite products along the scan-line, which might impair the usefulness of the data in spatial analyses.   The Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) aims to create an ocean colour dataset on a global scale to meet the demands of the ecosystem modelling community. The need for products with increasing spatial and temporal resolution that also show as little systematic and random errors as possible, increases. Due to cloud cover, even temporal means can be influenced by along-scanline artefacts if the observations are not balanced and effects cannot be cancelled out mutually.   These effects can arise from a multitude of results which are not easily separated, if at all. Among the sources of artefacts, there are some sensor-specific calibration issues which should lead to similar responses in all processors, as well as processor-specific features which correspond with the individual choices in the algorithms. A set of methods is proposed and applied to MERIS data over two regions of interest in the North Atlantic and the South Pacific Gyre. The normalised water leaving reflectance products of four atmospheric correction processors, which have also been evaluated in match-up analysis, is analysed in order to find and interpret systematic effects across track. These results are summed up with a semi-objective ranking and are used as a complement to the match-up analysis in the decision for the best Atmospheric Correction (AC) processor.   Although the need for discussion remains concerning the absolutes by which to judge an AC processor, this example demonstrates clearly, that relying on the match-up analysis alone can lead to misjudgement (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.', '[Mueller, Dagmar; Krasemann, Hajo; Doerffer, Roland] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany.

Understanding forest structure proves vital in accurately estimating both forest biomass and also the natural disturbances and remote sensing is an essential method for quantification of forest properties and structure in the tropics. Our objective is to examine canopy vegetation profiles formulated from discrete return Light Detection And Ranging (lidar) data and examine their usefulness in estimating forest structural parameters measured during a field campaign. We developed a modeling procedure that utilized hypothetical stand characteristics to examine lidar profiles. In essence, this is a simple method to further enhance shape characteristics from the lidar profile. In this paper we report the results comparing field data collected at La Selva, Costa Rica (10 degrees 26\' N, 83 degrees 59\' W) and forest structure and parameters calculated from vegetation height profiles and forest structural modeling. We developed multiple regression models for each measured forest biometric property using forward stepwise variable selection that used Bayesian information criteria (BIC) as selection criteria. Among measures of forest structure, ranging from tree lateral density, diameter at breast height, and crown geometry, we found strong relationships with lidar canopy vegetation profile parameters. Metrics developed from lidar that were indicators of height of canopy were not significant in estimating plot biomass (p-value = 0.31, r(2) = 0.17), but parameters from our synthetic forest model were found to be significant for estimating many of the forest structural properties, such as mean trunk diameter (p-value = 0.004, r(2) = 0.51) and tree density (p-value = 0.002, r(2) = 0.43). We were also able to develop a significant model relating lidar profiles to basal area (p-value = 0.003, r(2) = 0.43). Use of the full lidar profile provided additional avenues for the prediction of field based forest measure parameters. Our synthetic canopy model provides a novel method for examining lidar metrics by developing a look-up table of profiles that determine profile shape, depth, and height. We suggest that the use of metrics indicating canopy height derived from lidar are limited in understanding biomass in a forest with little variation across the landscape and that there are many parameters that may be gleaned by lidar data that inform on forest biometric properties.

Riverine salmonids use discrete cold water patches, termed thermal refuges, when stream temperature exceeds their thermal tolerances. Currently, little is known about the mechanisms driving the spatial distribution of thermal refuges, particularly at large scales. Given the threat posed by climate warming to salmon populations in Europe and North America, thermal refuges are increasingly important for salmonids during summer. In this study, we used airborne thermal infrared (TIR) imagery to characterise the spatial distribution of thermal refuges from similar to 700 km of rivers in an eastern Canada salmon watershed. Thermal refuges were classified into a range of categories, and those identified as being driven by groundwater processes were observed to be both the most abundant and most spatially variable. Spatial analysis was used to assemble a range of landscape metrics that were tested for associations with the spatial distribution of groundwater-driven refuges. Associations between landscape metrics and the individual occurrence of thermal refuges were assessed using Jacobs\' selectivity index. Results showed that the occurrence of groundwater thermal refuges was significantly associated with high values of channel curvature and close proximity of incoming tributary valleys (X-2 p < 0.05, df = 9). Regression was used to assess correlations between landscape metrics and the density of thermal refuges (number per river km). Channel confinement was found to correlate strongly with the density of groundwater thermal refuges using a quadratic model (R-2 = 0.83, p < 0.05). Our study is the first to quantify the relationship between the spatial distribution of groundwater thermal refuges and landscape hydromorphology throughout a riverscape. This information can be used to aid conservation efforts and manage critical thermal habitats in rivers and streams. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The goal of this study is to introduce a new, globally applicable downscaling method and to demonstrate its applicability to derive fine resolution results from coarse global inundation estimates. The downscaling procedure predicts the location of surface water cover with an inundation probability map that was generated by bagged derision trees using globally available topographic and hydrographic information from the SRTM-derived HydroSHEDS database and trained on the wetland extent of the GLC2000 global land cover map. We applied the downscaling technique to the Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites (GIEMS) dataset to produce a new high-resolution inundation map at a pixel size of 15 arc-seconds, termed GIEMS-D15. GIEMS-D15 represents three states of land surface inundation extents: mean annual minimum (total area, 6.5 x 10(6) km(2)), mean annual maximum (12.1 x 10(6) km(2)), and long-term maximum (173 x 10(6) km(2)); the latter depicts the largest surface water area of any global map to date. While the accuracy of GIEMS-D15 reflects distribution errors introduced by the downscaling process as well as errors from the original satellite estimates, overall accuracy is good yet spatially variable. A comparison against regional wetland cover maps generated by independent observations shows that the results adequately represent large floodplains and wetlands. GIEMS-D15 offers a higher resolution delineation of inundated areas than previously available for the assessment of global freshwater resources and the study of large floodplain and wetland ecosystems. The technique of applying inundation probabilities also allows for coupling with coarse-scale hydro-climatological model simulations.

In order to characterize the polarization response as a function of growing stock volume (GSV), weather conditions and different tree species in Siberian forests, the polarization phase difference between HH and VV polarizations and the magnitude of the polarimetric HHVV-coherence have been analyzed. Moreover, the retrieval accuracy of forest growing stock volume (GSV) has been evaluated. The investigations were conducted on forest stand level and maximum GSV was 350 m(3)/ha. Using multi-temporal L-band ALOS PALSAR polarimetric coherence data and extensive sets of the forest inventory data at a stand level, we observed a clear decrease of polarimetric coherence with an increase in GSV, with Pearson\'s correlation coefficient between -0.74 and -0.79. The correlation improved to -0.87 for the forest stands with high relative stocking >70% (i.e. more homogeneous forest stand structure) and the sensitivity of the polarimetric coherence to GSV increased to similar to 250 m(3)/ha GSV. The polarization phase difference (PPD) also allowed forest to be discriminated from non-forest areas. Comparison of PPD during thawing and unfrozen weather conditions at the time of image acquisition revealed a higher contribution of a volume scattering at the latter conditions. In addition, differences in polarimetric coherence and phase difference were observed as a function of tree species. In particular, stands of larch typically exhibited a +0.1 polarimetric coherence under unfrozen conditions compared to aspen, birch and pine. There was also less variability in the PPD compared to other tree species, both under thawing and unfrozen conditions. An exponential model was used to characterize the polarimetric coherence behavior as a function of GSV. The retrieval of GSV was better under unfrozen conditions, with an RAISE of 33 m(3)/ha and R-2 of 0.73. The retrieval error was slightly higher (RMSE = 51 m(3)/ha and R-2 = 0.61) under thawing conditions. In the case of the forest stands with the area larger than 30 ha and the relative stocking of at least 70%, the GSV retrieval error decreased to RMSE of 16 m(3)/ha and to RMSE = 19 m(3)/ha respectively.

Here we show that both the frequency and severity of droughts and floods over the plateau are intensified during the recent decade from three-decade total water storage anomalies (TWSA) generated by Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data and artificial neural network (ANN) models. The developed ANN models performed well in hindcasting TWSA for the plateau and its three sub-regions (i.e., the upper Mekong River, Pearl River, and Wujiang River basins), showing coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.91, 0.83, 0.76, and 0.57, respectively. The intensified climate extremes are indicative of large changes in the hydrological cycle and brought great challenges in water resource management there. The TWSA of the plateau remained fairly stable during the 1980s, and featured an increasing trend at a rate of 5.9 +/- 0.5 mm/a in the 1990s interspersed extreme flooding in 1991 and during the second half of the 1990s. Since 2000, the TWSA fluctuated drastically, featuring severe spring droughts from 2003 to 2006, the most extreme spring drought on record in 2010, and severe flooding in 2008. The TWSA of the upper Mekong has decreased by similar to 100 mm (similar to 15 km(3)) compared with that at the end of the 1990s. In addition to hindcasting TWSA, the developed approach could be effective in generating future TWSA and potentially bridge the gap between the current GRACE satellites and the GRACE Follow-On Mission expected to launch in 2017.

As local measurements are costly, there is a great interest in obtaining reliable estimates over large areas from remote sensing data. Currently, such estimates are obtained with a variety of data sources, statistical methods and prediction standards, and there is no agreement on what are best practices for this task.   To improve our understanding of how these different methods affect prediction quality, we first conducted a systematic review of the available literature to identify the most common sensor types and prediction methods. Based on the review, we identified sample size of the reference points on the ground, prediction method (step-wise linear regression, support vector machines, random forest, Gaussian processes and k-nearest neighbor), and sensor type as the main differences that could potentially affect predictive quality. We then compared those factors in two case study areas in Germany and Chile, for which airborne discrete return Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and airborne hyperspectral as well as airborne discrete return LiDAR and spaceborne hyperspectral data were available. For each factor combination, we calculated Pearson\'s coefficient of correlation between observations and predictions (r(2)) and root mean squared error (RMSE) for bootstrapped estimates using k-fold cross-validation with a varying number of folds. Finally, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to quantify the influence of the factors on the predictive error of the biomass models.   Our results confirm previous findings that predictor data (sensor) type is the most important factor for the accuracy of biomass estimates, with LiDAR being preferable to hyperspectral data. In contrast to some previous studies, complementing LiDAR with hyperspectral data did not improve predictive accuracy. Also the prediction method had a substantial effect on accuracy and was generally more important than the sample size. In most cases, random forest performed best and stepwise linear models worst, judging from r(2) and RMSE under cross-validation. Additional results suggested that r(2) may deliver unrealistically large values when the hold-out sample during the cross-validation is too small.   In conclusion, our literature review revealed that different methods for biomass estimation are currently used, with no general agreement on best practices. In our case studies, we found substantial accuracy differences between those methods, with LiDAR data, in combination with a random forest algorithm and a large number of reference sample units on the ground yielding the lowest error for biomass predictions. The comparatively high importance of the statistical prediction method seems particularly relevant, as they suggest that choosing the appropriate statistical method may be more effective than obtaining additional field data for obtaining good biomass estimates. Considering the costs of improving accuracy of global and regional biomass estimates by ground measurements, it seems sensible to invest in further comparative studies, preferably with a wider range of sites and including also RADAR sensors, to establish robust best-practice recommendations for obtaining regional and global biomass estimates from remote-sensing data.

The separation into individual patterns, commonly named urban structure types (USTs), supports the characterization of physical, functional, and energetic factors of settlement structures, enabling associated environmental and socio-economic investigations as well as the comparison between the patterns of different cities. This study presents an automated approach for the classification of USTs based on remote sensing data in order to analyze the links between settlement structures and environmental issues, such as air pollution or urban heat islands, in a later stage of the project. Initially, an object-based classification routine is implemented to identify the land cover for the city of Berlin, utilizing spatially very high resolution aerial images and object height information. UST classes are defined based on the occurrence within the study area and are delimited by block boundaries. Afterwards, indicators for the derivation of USTs are generated based on the previously derived land cover information and the most valuable features are selected with the help of Random Forests. Finally, structural units are classified, involving common and new land cover based parameters. The focus is on the generation of an automated and transferable routine for a comprehensive UST classification covering the entire city. Comparing the results with reference data, good classification accuracies for both land cover and USTs indicate the suitability of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

These lakes are crucial water stocks to local biophysical environments and socioeconomic development. Existing studies document that individual lakes in this region have recently experienced dramatic changes under the context of enduring meteorological drought, continuous population growth, and extensive water regulation since TGD\'s initial impoundment (i.e., June, 2003). However, spatial and temporal patterns of lake dynamics across the complete downstream Yangtze basin remain poorly characterized. Using daily MODIS imagery and an advanced thematic mapping scheme, this study presents a comprehensive monitoring of area dynamics in the downstream lake system at a 10-day temporal resolution during 2000-2011. The studied lakes constitute similar to 76% (similar to 11,400 km(2)) of the total downstream lake area, including the entire + 70 major lakes larger than 20 km2. The results reveal a decadal net decline in lake inundation area across the downstream Yangtze Basin, with a cumulative decrease of 849 km(2) or 7.4% from 2000 to 2011. Despite an excessive precipitation anomaly in the year 2010, the decreasing trend was tested significant in all seasons. The most substantial decrease in the post-TGD period appears in fall (1.1% yr(-1)), which intriguingly coincides with the TGD water storage season. Regional lake dynamics exhibit contrasting spatial patterns, manifested as evident decrease and increase of aggregated lake areas respectively within and beyond the Yangtze Plain. This contrast suggests a marked vulnerability of lakes in the Yangtze Plain, to not only local meteorological variability but also intensified human water regulations from both the upstream Yangtze main stem (e.g., the TGD) and tributaries (e.g., lakes/reservoirs beyond the Yangtze Plain). The produced lake mapping result and derived lake area dynamics across the downstream Yangtze Basin provides a crucial monitoring basis for continuous investigations of changing mechanisms in the Yangtze lake system.

However, one of the limiting factors in the conventional DInSAR is that it can measure only one-dimensional (1D) ground motion along the radar line of sight (LOS) direction, thus resulting in anamorphic coseismic displacements and biased source parameters. In this paper, the three-dimensional (3D) deformation maps for this earthquake were reconstructed over an area of about 100 x 70 km(2) for the first time by a combined use of the DInSAR method for detecting LOS motion and the multiple-aperture interferometry (MAI) method for detecting along-track (AT) motion. The fault slip map for this earthquake was generated using the 3D deformation maps. Based on the fault traces on the fault slip map, we constructed a fault model with five segments and preformed a two-step inversion using the 3D deformation data as the constraint. Our results show that the maximum coseismic displacements in up-down, north-south and east-west directions are -40.4, 113.8, and -65.7 cm, respectively, and the peak-to-peak slip offset between the southern and northern fault wall is 1.82 m. Our model reveals a shallow dislocation on a NW-SE trending fault extending about 74 km, along which the four fault segments are nearly vertical (84 degrees-88 degrees) and the one fault segment dips 66.2 to the southwest. The estimated seismic moment is 2.43 x 10(19) Nm (Mw6.92), which is close to the solution provided by the Global Centroid Moment Tensor (GCMT) Project. The slip distribution derived for each fault patch shows that the slip occurrence extends down to 12 km beneath the ground surface, and a peak slip of 2.23 m appears at the depth of about 5 km right near the epicenter. Comparison with the results derived from the seismic waves, field investigation, GPS and conventional DInSAR observations indicates that the source parameters of the Yushu earthquake can be improved due to the combined use of DInSAR and MAI measurements.

Previous remote sensing approaches have lacked the temporal or spatial resolution, or ecologically appropriate mapping, to fully address this issue. This paper presents a robust, semi-automated object-based image analysis approach for mapping dominant seagrass species, percentage cover and above ground biomass using a time series of field data and coincident high spatial resolution satellite imagery. The study area was a 142 km(2) shallow, clear water seagrass habitat (the Eastern Banks, Moreton Bay, Australia). Nine data sets acquired between 2004 and 2013 were used to create seagrass species and percentage cover maps through the integration of seagrass photo transect field data, and atmospherically and geometrically corrected high spatial resolution satellite image data (World View-2, IKONOS and Quickbird-2) using an object based image analysis approach. Biomass maps were derived using empirical models trained with in-situ above ground biomass data per seagrass species. Maps and summary plots identified inter- and intra-annual variation of seagrass species composition, percentage cover level and above ground biomass. The methods provide a rigorous approach for field and image data collection and pre-processing, a semi-automated approach to extract seagrass species and cover maps and assess accuracy, and the subsequent empirical modelling of seagrass biomass. The resultant maps provide a fundamental data set for understanding landscape scale seagrass dynamics in a shallow water environment.

In image time series analysis, this is conventionally done by virtually extending the spatial dimension of the time series by spatially concatenating the different time series and then performing S-mode PCA. In S-mode analysis, samples in space are the statistical variables and samples in time are the statistical observations. This paper introduces the concept of temporal concatenation of multiple image time series to perform EPCA. EPCA can also be done with a T-mode orientation in which samples in time are the statistical variables and samples in space are the statistical observations. This leads to a total of four orientations in which EPCA can be carried out. This research explores these four orientations and their implications in investigating spatio-temporal relationships among multiple time series. This research demonstrates that EPCA carried out with temporal concatenation of the multiple time series with T-mode (tT) is able to identify similar spatial patterns among multiple time series. The conventional S-mode EPCA with spatial concatenation (sS) identifies similar temporal patterns among multiple time series. The other two modes, namely T-mode with spatial concatenation (sT) and S-mode with temporal concatenation (tS), are able to identify patterns which shate consistent temporal phase relationships and consistent spatial phase relationships with each other, respectively. In a case study using three sets of precipitation time series data from GPCP, CMAP and NCEP-DOE, the results show that examination of all four modes provides an effective basis for comparison of the series.

Usual inversion methods are based on a pixel-by-pixel approach. Therefore, they do not consider the spatial correlation between neighboring pixels, even though such pixels are often affected by the same water column if the spatial resolution is high enough.   The proposed method uses such redundant information performing local maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of depth and water quality in large zones. It provides multi-resolution maps, in which resolution depends on local depth. In shallow water, the signal-to-noise ratio is high so an accurate mapping can be performed. Therefore, we propose to model local depth variations with a linear model while water quality is still supposed to be locally homogeneous. In deep water, the signal-to-noise ratio is lower so estimating only the local mean depth with standard ML estimation is more robust and reliable. The entire image is divided into appropriate meshes. In every mesh, water column properties are estimated using both linear and constant depth models. Final maps are obtained combining these estimates. The deeper the water, the higher the influence of standard ML estimation maps. Using local information provided by neighboring pixels makes this method robust to noise. Moreover, the hyperspectral image and estimated bathymetry have the same resolution in shallow water since depth is modeled for every pixel.   The efficiency of our method was assessed with simulated and real hyperspectral images. Results proved that depth modeling improves depth and water quality estimations, especially in shallow water. In deep water, assuming that the bottom is locally flat is reasonable since depth variations are small relatively to depth mean value. With the considered water quality, the estimated bathymetry was accurate for depths up to 14 m. Estimated concentration maps were consistent for the whole range Of depths. The spatial resolution of estimated bathymetry was 50 cm in shallow water (for depths up to 10 m), and ranged from 2.5 m to 5 m in deep water (for depths between 10 m and 14 m).   The influence of bio-optical modeling is also demonstrated. We show that reliable models are absolutely necessary to obtain good estimation results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We applied variance-based global sensitivity analysis for different atmospheric conditions and observation configurations. Among 23 input parameters, crown coverage, leaf area index, leaf inclination distribution function and soil moisture were found to be the most influential parameters driving the output variance of the radiance between 400 and 2500 nm with a few exceptions. Hapke\'s soil parameters and the canopy layer dissociation factor were recognized to have marginal influence on the output radiance. It is also found that a large portion of uncertainty in the output radiance is driven by the interaction effects among input parameters in the visible (similar to 550 nm), whereas the red-near infrared (similar to 670 nm), seems to have fewer interaction effects. The effect of solar/view direction is found to be significant on TOA radiance sensitivity to the input parameters. The results also confirmed that the sensitivities of surface reflectance are comparable to the TOA radiance sensitivities when the atmosphere is clear and visibility is high. Since coupled surface-atmosphere RT models can be computationally intensive, this work also introduces an improvement to the design and sampling of screening methods for efficient sensitivity analysis of computationally expensive models. The improvement is based on three elements: a) generating sample points by Sobol\'s sequence generator; b) variational analysis in the parameter space using the winding stairs method; c) use of mean and variance sensitivity measures. The results with 1200 model runs demonstrated high correlation (92%) with variance-based global sensitivity analysis using 49,152 model runs, in determining the most influential and non-influential parameters.

This study evaluates the application of CWA to airborne imaging spectroscopy data for predicting diurnal and seasonal variation in canopy water content (CWC) for nut tree orchards. We collected CWC measurements and concurrent imagery from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) instrument twice a day (morning and afternoon) in spring and fall of 2011 in California, USA. Several robust wavelet features were determined and compared to four watersensitive spectral indices, three existing in the literature and one optimized in this study, for the assessment of predictive performance. Results showed that the best prediction using CWA (R-2 = 0.84 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.027 kg/m(2)) was produced by a combination of three wavelet features and it was considerably better than those by the existing water indices. While the best wavelet feature (1100 nm, scale 6) characterized the water absorption in the near-infrared region, the optimized index NID850,720 used a red edge band at 720 nm instead of a direct water absorption band. A bootstrap sampling of the validation data set indicated that ND850,720 predicted CWC significantly worse (p < 0.0001) and exhibited greater sensitivity to seasonality. Both CWA and ND850,720 revealed statistically significant diurnal declines of CWC in two different seasons in the context of a substantial seasonal decline, but the former detected greater declines in diurnal CWC Our results demonstrated the feasibility of applying CWA to airborne imaging spectroscopy data for CWC mapping and its superiority to spectral indices for improved prediction of CWC and understanding of spectral-chemical relations.

Where total inundation occurs, a low backscatter return is expected due to the specular reflection of the radar signal on the water surface. However, wind-induced waves can cause a roughening of the water surface which results in a high return signal. Additionally, in arid regions, very dry sand absorbs microwave energy, resulting in low backscatter returns. Where such conditions occur adjacent to open water, this can make the separation of water and land problematic using radar. In the past, we have shown how this latter problem can be mitigated, by making use of the difference in the relationship between the incidence angle of the radar signal, and backscatter, over land and water. The mitigation of wind-induced effects, however, remains elusive. In this paper, we examine how the variability in radar backscatter with incidence angle may be used to differentiate water from land overcoming, to a large extent, both of the above problems.   We carry out regression over multiple sets of time series data, determined by a moving window encompassing consecutively-acquired Envisat ASAR Global Monitoring Mode data, to derive three surfaces for each data set: the slope beta of a linear model fitting backscatter against local incidence angle; the backscatter normalised to 30 degrees using the linear model coefficients (sigma(0)(30)), and the ratio of the standard deviations of backscatter and local incidence angle over the window sample (SDR). The results are new time series data sets which are characterised by the moving window sample size.   A comparison of the three metrics shows SDR to provide the most robust means to segregate land from water by thresholding. From this resultant data set, using a single step water-land classification employing a simple (and consistent) threshold applied to SDR values, we produced monthly maps of total inundation of the variable south-western basin of the Aral Sea through 2011, with an average pixel accuracy of 94% (kappa = 0.75) when checked against MODIS-derived reference maps.

We present an approach to map the spatial distribution of such associations by using plant indicator values (IVs) for salinity, moisture and nutrients as an intermediate between spectral reflectance and association occurrences. For a 12 km(2) study site in the Netherlands, the relations between observed IVs at local vegetation plots and visible and near-infrared (VNIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) airborne reflectance data were modelled using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) (R-2 0.73, 0.64 and 0.76 for salinity, moisture and nutrients, respectively). These relations were applied to map IVs for the complete study site. Association occurrence probabilities were modelled as function of IVs using a large database of vegetation plots with known association and IVs. Using the mapped IVs, we calculated occurrence probabilities of 19 associations for each pixel, resulting in both a crisp association map with the most likely occurring association per pixel, as well as occurrence probability maps per association. Association occurrence predictions were assessed by a local vegetation expert, which revealed that the occurrences of associations situated at frequently predicted indicator value combinations were over predicted. This seems primarily due to biases in the GPR predicted IVs, resulting in associations with envelopes located in extreme ends of IVs being scarcely predicted. Although the results of this particular study were not fully satisfactory, the method potentially offers several advantages compared to current vegetation classification techniques, like site-independent calibration of association probabilities, site-independent selection of associations and the provision of IV maps and occurrence probabilities per association. If the prediction of IVs can be improved, this method may thus provide a viable roadmap to bring a priori defined plant associations into the domain of remote sensing.

Indicators of woody structure can indicate the spatio-temporal variability of biodiversity, species occurrence and assemblages. Woody cover is the simplest and most widely used structural metric. Combined with the vegetation height, it provides a volumetric indicator, which is more informative, and is simple to calculate. We therefore assessed the utility of multitemporal polarimetric RADARSAT-2 C-band imagery to map measures of woody volumetric indices in Lowveld savannahs, in the vicinity of the Kruger National Park, South Africa. RADARSAT-2 Quad-Pol fine beam images were acquired at three key phenological stages of the seasonal savannah cycle: i) wet (summer), ii) dry (winter), and iii) end of wet (autumn). Multi-polarized band intensities (C-HH, C-HV, and C-VV, with V = vertical and H = horizontal) and polarimetric decomposition variables (Freeman-Durden, Cloude-Pottier, and Van Zyl) were derived from the SAR images and used to predict structural metrics (woody canopy cover, cylindrical woody volume, and woody canopy volume, see definition in Section 3.3) derived from 1.1 m LiDAR strips acquired across the study area, and coinciding with 12% of the SAR dataset. The best single relationship (R-2 = 0.66) was obtained between the cross-polarized HV intensity band and the total canopy volume (TCV). In terms of the seasonality, the best results were obtained using the SAR imagery from the dry season when most woody plants have lost their leaves and the grass-soil layer was dry. Validation outputs of best predictive models for TCV, at the individual season level, yielded an R-2 of 0.67, a Standard Error of Prediction (SEP) of 39%, and consisted of the SAR parameters: C-HH, C-HV, C-VV, and Freeman-Durden decomposition parameters. At the multi-seasonal level, the best predictive models for TCV yielded an R-2 of 0.75, a SEP of 35%, and comprised of the same variables but for all three seasons. The C-band SAR data thus,provided encouraging results in open, semi-arid savannahs and hint at larger area structural assessments than is possible with LiDAR sensors alone. The combined use of C-band and L-band (ALOS-Palsar 2) should also be investigated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

MODIS, and SEVIRI satellite instruments are compared against each other in order to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each retrieval approach. Particular attention is paid to the effects of meteorological conditions, land surface properties, and the magnitude of the dust loading. The period of study corresponds to the time of the first Fennec intensive measurement campaign, which provides new ground-based and aircraft measurements of the dust characteristics and loading. Validation using ground-based AERONET sunphotometer data indicates that of the satellite products, the SEVIRI retrieval is most able to retrieve dust during optically thick dust events, whereas IASI and MODIS perform better at low dust loadings. This may significantly affect observations of dust emission and the mean dust climatology. MISR and MODIS are least sensitive to variations in meteorological conditions, while SEVIRI tends to overestimate the aerosol optical depth (AOD) under moist conditions (with a bias against AERONET of 0.31), especially at low dust loadings where the AOD < 1. Further comparisons are made with airborne LIDAR measurements taken during the Fennec campaign, which provide further evidence for the inferences made from the AERONET comparisons. The effect of surface properties on the retrievals is also investigated. Over elevated surfaces IASI retrieves AODs which are most consistent with AERONET observations, while the AODs retrieved by MODIS tend to be biased low. In contrast, over the least emissive surfaces IASI significantly underestimates the AOD (with a bias of -0.41), while MISR and SEVIRI show closest agreement. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Plot-based TLS foliage profiles are used as training datasets for the derivation of a scaling function applied to calibrate effective leaf area index (LAIe) from a coincident ALS point cloud. The results of this study show that: a) the mean proportion of the total number of returns within 11.3 m radius of the TLS scan station was 64%. Increasing the radius decreased the level of detail due to occlusion; b) the relationship between TLS LAIe profile and ALS foliage percentile distribution (PD) using all, primary and secondary returns are not linearly related; and c) regressions between TLS LAIe profile and ALS PD, demonstrate better correspondence using a 5th order polynomial applied to all returns (r(2) = 0.95; SE = 0.09 m(2) m(-2)) than aquasi-physically-based Weibull scaling function. The calibration routine was applied to ALS data within a GIS environment to create a 500 m radius 3D map of LAIe. This localised 3D calibration of LAIe was then used as the basis to calculate the overhead canopy extinction coefficient parameter (k), and thereby facilitate upscaling of spatial LAIe estimates to larger domains using a Beer Lambert Law assumption.

However, the mechanisms driving the underwater light climate in large rivers are poorly understood due to the complex interactions among color-producing agents (CPAs), which can vary in space and time. A compelling example of such a complex interaction among CPAs concerns the St. Lawrence River, where chromophoric dissolved organic matter and suspended inorganic particulate matter interact to structure the underwater spectral environment. Because such interactions can be complex, the combined net effect of CPAs on water color is not intuitive and remains to be evaluated. To resolve the spatial and temporal dynamics of the spectral profile in the St. Lawrence River, we analyzed a series of 44 Landsat 5 and 7 images, distributed between 1984 and 2009, which cover the main freshwater section of the river. Rather than following linear trends along the longitudinal axis, the spectral profiles on spectral bands (blue, green and red) presented three distinctive spatial patterns. We argue that matter injected by tributaries and discontinuous zones of the river strongly impacts water color by modulating the balance among CPAs. We also clearly demonstrate a marked trend between 1984 and 2009 toward decreasing reflectance values on bands 1, 2 and 3, presumably in response to changes in land use in the surrounding watershed.

Ecological rules were used to parameterize the RTM. This approach reduces the probability of an ill-posed problem in the inversion of the selected RTMs, by rejecting unrealistic combinations of input parameters. Three species representatives of each region were used to derive the ecological rules: Quercus hex L, Quercus faginea L, and Pinus halepensis Mill. for the Mediterranean region, and Fagus sylvatica L, Quercus robur L. and Eucalyptus globulus Labill for the Eurosiberian region. Equivalent Water Thickness, Dry Matter and Chlorophyll content were taken from several data sources to separately parameterize both the Mediterranean (water-limited) and Eurosiberian (energy-limited) ecoregions of Spain. GEOSAIL was parameterized using a restricted range of Leaf Area Index (LAI) and specific canopy cover values, keeping other parameters fixed. The inversion was based on the Look Up Table technique using the minimum spectral angle as merit function. Several models were tested by using different inputs from standard MODIS products, as well as the fractional cover product developed by Guerschman et al. (2009). The model based on the reflectance bands and the Normalized Difference Infrared Index computed from the Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function-Adjusted Reflectance product (MCD43A4) provided the most accurate results, with a LFMC\'s Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 27.7% (RMSE = 27.3% for the Mediterranean and 28.7% for the Eurosiberian woodland).

Novel remote sensing technologies may provide useful information for monitoring and remediating this threat. The objectives were to investigate multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) as an approach to map rangeland vegetation using hyperspectral remote sensing imagery and to test the sensitivity of MESMA to alternative image spatial resolutions and spectral waveband combinations. Data from two Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) overflights at the Jornada Experimental Range in southwestern New Mexico were used in the analysis. Endmember spectra were selected from a library of ground-based spectral observations collected with a field spectroradiometer. A 4-endmember MESMA was conducted for both AVIRIS images at their native spatial resolutions using 113 10-nm wavebands from 422 to 2339 nm. Additional MESMAs were conducted at 10 multiples of the images\' native spatial resolution and for 6 alternative combinations of spectral waveband subregions. Maps of endmember fractional cover for green shrub vegetation, nonphotosynthetic grass vegetation, and bare soil were comparable to an earlier vegetation classification map of Jornada. MESMA fractional cover estimates for the green vegetation endmember were positively correlated with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with correlation coefficients (r) greater than 0.58. Correlation coefficients between the sum of the green and nonphotosynthetic vegetation endmembers and the cellulose absorption index (CAI) were greater than 0.59. Correlation coefficients between MESMA fractional green vegetation cover and NDVI from independent multispectral images were greater than 0.57. Despite losses in spatial detail at coarser image spatial resolutions, MESMA results for images with spatial resolution degraded by a factor of 10 (similar to 150 m) were similar to aggregated results for MESMA at the native spatial resolution (similar to 15 m). Additionally, MESMA results were shown to be substantially more sensitive to the spectral wavebands used in the analysis as compared to the spatial resolution of the images. Considered together, the MESMA results at Jornada indicated that fine spectral resolution with hyperspectral remote sensing was substantially more important than incremental changes in image spatial scale from 15 m to 150 m.

The method makes use of complementary oceanic remote sensing observations: sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface height (SSH). It relies on the assumption that a state of the ocean can be locally defined by its values of SST, SSH and CHL, and that a codebook of possible (SST, SSH, CHL) situations, if large enough, allows the reconstruction of incomplete situations of CHL. To account for the spatio-temporal context, each situation is characterized by the values of the three variables CHL, SST and SSH over a 3 x 3 spatial window surrounding the pixel, and at three successive times. In a first step, the feasibility and robustness of the method was assessed on a synthetic data set derived from a high-resolution coupled bio-physical ocean model. The SOM reconstruction method was particularly powerful in the case of intense cloud cover and to reconstruct CHL at scales larger than similar to 10 km. Subsequently, the method was adapted to real satellite data, which required introducing iterative learning and dealing with multi-modal determination of the referent vectors. The proposed improvements of the method proved satisfactory in retrieving CHL missing values under heavy cloud coverage and in improving the quality of weekly CHL products. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, natural surfaces are anisotropic. Therefore, this assumption will introduce an error in surface directional reflectance estimates and consequently in the estimation of vegetation indexes such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the surface albedo retrieval. In this paper we evaluate the influence of directional effects on the atmospheric correction and its impact in the NDVI and albedo estimation. First, we derived the NDVI and surface albedo from data corrected assuming a Lambertian surface, then by using the BRDF model parameters used in the albedo retrieval, we account for the coupling effect and retrieved an improved NDVI and albedo. The study used Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) MODIS data, which has a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees. We focused our analysis on four Aeronet sites located in the United States of America: KONZA EDC (a prairie region in the Flint Hills, Kansas), Howland (a forest area in Maine), Walker Branch (a forest area in Tennessee) and GSFC (at NASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center). The results indicate that the relative errors due to the Lambertian assumption on the surface reflectance are 3-12% in the visible and 0.7-5.0% in the near-infrared, around 1% on the NDVI and less than 1% on the albedo.

Svalbard islands, Norway), by using a Brewer spectrophotometer, for almost three years (2007-2009). Given the scarcity of high-quality ground-based measurements performed at high latitudes, this dataset provides a rare opportunity to check the quality of satellite-based data recorded in Arctic. Considering the unprecedented Artic ozone loss recently derived from satellite observations, assessing the reliability of satellite readings at such high latitudes is a timely effort This study focuses on the comparisons between ground-based Brewer total ozone measurements and satellite ozone readings retrieved from EOS Aura Ozone Measurement Instrument (OM) (by using OMI-TOMS and OMI-DOAS algorithms), retrieved from ERS-2 Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) (by using TOGOMI algorithm) and from Envisat SCanning Imaging Absorption spectrometer for Atmospheric CartographY (SCIAMACHY) (by using TOSOMI algorithm).   Despite the extreme conditions that affect both ground- and satellite-based measurements, a good agreement was found (r = 0.99 for OMI-TOMS, r = 0.97 for both OMI-DOAS and GOME datasets and r = 0.96 for SCIAMACHY). Nevertheless, space-based total ozone readings were found to underestimate ground-based data, in agreement with prior results. OMI-TOMS data showed the highest negative mean bias (MB = -2.03%) whereas DOAS-based datasets showed a better agreement (MB = -0.47, -0.69 and -0.01% for OMI-DOAS, GOME and SCIAMACHY, respectively) but a greater data scatter. On the other hand, DOAS-based datasets present an important seasonal dependence; an overestimation of the Brewer total ozone up to about 3% is found in April and September with respect to OMI-DOAS and SCIAMACHY while in September with respect to GOME In contrast, differences between OMI-TOMS and Brewer total ozone do not present significant dependence on the season or on geometrical parameters (i.e., satellite solar and viewing zenith angles). Differences in total ozone values between ground-based and satellite measurements are further discussed attending to the algorithm differences in dealing with cloud cover under high surface albedo (i.e., snow) conditions.   Extending the study to Sodankyla station (67.3 degrees N, 26.6 degrees E, Finland), similarities and differences between the two stations have been highlighted. The agreement between satellite and Brewer data slightly improved when Sodankyla station is considered. On the continent, the seasonal dependence and data scatter for DOAS-based datasets and the MB for OMI-TOMS are smaller with respect to Ny-Alesund. Moreover, the roughly constant ozone summer offset (about 1%) between OMI-TOMS and OMI-DOAS, well evident for Ny-Alesund, is not present for Sodankyla. Finally, some patterns in the geographic distributions of the satellite-Brewer total ozone differences are evident only for Ny-Alesund, partly because of the peculiar characteristics of the surface albedo (higher than in Sodankyla, with a strong water/land contrast).

In this study we aimed to develop and test a new method for mapping fire scars from MODIS imagery, to examine the temporal and spatial patterns of wildfires in Israel in the 2000s and to examine the factors controlling Israel\'s wildfire regime. To map the fires we used two \'off-the-shelf\' MODIS fire products as our basis-the 1 km MODIS Collection 5 fire hotspots, the 500 m MCD45A1 burnt areas-and we created a new set of fire scar maps from the 250 m MOD13Q1 product We carried out a cross comparison of the three MODIS based wildfire scar maps and evaluated them independently against the wild fire scars mapped from 30 m Landsat TM imagery. To examine the factors controlling wildfires we used GIS layers of rainfall, land use, and a Landsat-based national vegetation map. Wildfires occurred in areas where annual rainfall was above 250 mm, mostly in areas with herbaceous vegetation. Wildfire frequency was especially high in the Golan Heights and in the foothills of the Judean mountains, and a high correspondence was found between military training zones and the spatial distribution of fire scars. The use of MODIS satellite images enabled us to map wildfires at a national scale due to the high temporal resolution of the sensor. Our MOD13Q1 based mapping of fire scars adequately mapped large (> 1 km(2)) fires with accuracies above 80%. Such large fires account for a large proportion of all fires, and pose the greatest threats. This database can aid managers in determining wildfire risks in space and in time. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The Spectral Shape Indexes (551) represent the shape of a multispectral (MODIS in this case) reflectance profile in a set of three consecutive bands.   The aims of this research were: (1) to assess AS1 and AS2 behavior over a cotton crop growing period, (2) to test whether function fitting procedures can be used to model MODIS AS1 and AS2 and NDVI time series and (3) to derive objective AS1 and AS2 phenological metrics that can be used to monitor cotton phenological stages.   Phenological stages of a cotton crop in the San Joaquin Valley (CA) were identified by linking local climatic data and producer recorded management practices. An asymmetric Gaussian function was fitted to the time series of each index using TIMESAT software. Then, specific dates in the fitted functions have been related to phenological stages and dates of agricultural practices.   Results show that AS1 and AS2 exhibit a consistent pattern clearly different from the temporal evolution of NDVI. The AS2 index shows high values during periods when vegetation is dominant, either photosynthetically active or dry, and low values when soil dominates the pixel. The AS1 index time series showed two minima during the cotton growth period. Minima and inflection points derived from the fitted functions are coincident in time with significant crop management dates during the growing period. These results show that function fitting procedures applied to AS1 and AS2 can be used to derive phenological metrics, illustrating the potential for using Spectral Shape Indexes for crop monitoring.

For operational implementation of TSEB, however, it is often difficult to obtain representative air temperature data that are compatible with the LST retrievals, which may themselves have residual errors due to atmospheric and emissivity corrections. To address this issue, two different strategies in applying the TSEB model without requiring local air temperature data were tested over a typical Mediterranean agricultural area using a set of high-resolution multispectral airborne remote sensing images. Alleviating the need for accurate local air temperature data as input, these two approaches estimate the surface-to-air temperature gradient that drives the sensible heat flux by directly exploiting the information available in the image. The two approaches indude: 1) a scene-based internal calibration (TSEB-IC) procedure that estimates air temperature over a well-watered and fully vegetated pixel in the LST image, and 2) a disaggregation scheme (DisALEXI) that uses air temperature estimates from a time-differential coupled TSEB-atmospheric boundary layer model of atmosphere-land exchange (ALEXI). A comparison of the air temperatures modeled by TSEB-IC and DisALEXI with in situ weather station observations shows good agreement, with average differences on the order of 1 K. comparable with the uncertainties in the remotely sensed surface temperature maps. Surface fluxes estimated by each method agree well with micro-meteorological measurements acquired over an olive orchard within the aircraft imaging domain. In comparison with fluxes generated with TSEB using local measurements of air temperature, instantaneous fluxes from these alternative methods show good spatial agreement, with differences of less than low m(-2) across the domain. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the three models, performed by introducing artificial errors into the model inputs, demonstrates that the DisALEXI and TSEB-IC approaches are relatively insensitive to errors in absolute surface temperature calibration, while turbulent fluxes from TSEB applications using local air temperature measurements show sensitivity of approximately 30 W m(-2) per degree temperature perturbation. This highlights the value of both internal calibration and timedifferential estimation of the surface-to-air temperature gradient within a surface energy balance framework (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

It may be helpful for protection and monitoring changes in species diversity caused by artificial regulation of hydrology, atmospheric deposition, and global change. We took a data-driven approach to explore the potential of airborne hyperspectral data in determining plant associations of treeless northern boreal peatlands in Finland (65 degrees 57\'N, 24 degrees 29\'E). The objective was to produce an ecological peatland classification on a class hierarchical level which would be as detailed as possible, and could be accurately mapped with remotely sensed hyperspectal data. The proper hierarchical class level was decided based on statistical approaches including canonical correspondence analysis, unsupervised classification, and multivariate analysis of variance. Subsequently, fuzzy classification with support vector machines was applied to map the classes in the spatial domain from airborne geo- and atmospherically corrected hyperspectal HyMap data. We conducted detailed in situ sampling for surface plant inventory, soil root zone bulk dielectric permittivity (epsilon), electrical conductivity (sigma), and pH. Constrained canonical correspondence ordination revealed that epsilon, sigma (p<0.01), and pH (p<0.001) were significantly correlated with the ordination and were thus important drivers for vegetation composition. Four biotopes were distinguishable by their spectra: Sphagnum fuscum-Emperum nigrum-Rubus chamaemorus-S. angustifolium-bog, Eriophorum vaginatum-S. lindenbergii-sedge fen, eutrophic Carex lasiocarpa-Trichophorum cespitosum-fen, and Comarum palustre-S. majus-Carex rostrata-swamp. The highest overall efficiencies of prediction (overall accuracy 87.8%, kappa 0.781) were calculated using only 10% of the original training data indicating that low numbers of properly selected training sites from class boundaries could be appropriate for the support vector machines. The class specific assessment of accuracy with receiver operating characteristics curves also confirmed moderate-to-good successes of the approach with area under the curve values: 0.946 for bog, 0.951 for sedge fen, and 0.999 for eutrophic fen. Clusters of spectrally separable cohesive communities existed but they gradually changed from one plant association to another. Thus fuzzy mapping from hyperspectral and possible complementary data with well performing support vector machines could be justified in spatially continuous inventory and monitoring of boreal peatlands at regional, landscape or national scales.

The area-level point distributions derived by ALS are not considered informative on tree species, however, and the required information is typically produced using an additional data source, such as spectral images. We developed new volumetric and structural features (so called alpha shape metrics), hypothesizing that these could produce additional information on the species-size variation as compared to the previously used ALS and image features. These metrics were tested in the prediction of species-specific, plot-level volume using the Most Similar Neighbor imputation method and a data set consisting of altogether 426 training and 142 validation field plots. The considered forest area was dominated by Scots pine, while Norway spruce and deciduous trees formed the other two species groups to be distinguished. The developed metrics improved the species-specific estimates by 13-30 or 2-4 percentage points compared to features based on ALS data alone or a combination of the ALS and image features, respectively. The metrics had a higher importance when the reference data insufficiently covered the species-size variation within the area. Although the estimates produced using a combination of the ALS and image data had a superior accuracy compared to those produced by the ALS data alone, the results indicate that species-specific estimates may be further improved by developing computational features based on ALS data.

Atmospherically corrected MODIS data reveal strong seasonal variability in the areal extent of plume water, as well as in turbidity levels, which are significantly correlated with seasonality in river discharge. A seasonal climatology of turbid plume patterns shows individual plumes merging into an extensive body of turbid waters attached to the coast during fall (April-June)-winter (July-September) (occurs about 10% of days in fall-winter). During spring (October-December) and summer (January-March), the individual plumes remain distinct and occupy a smaller area close to the coast, when observed (evident on less than 30% of days in spring-summer). In spring-summer most plumes are detected for the northern rivers (Mataquito and Maule). When the plumes merge into a coastal band in fall-winter, a turbid area of more than 1000 km(2) is observed in the study area between 34.85 degrees S and 37.15 degrees S. This occurs following peaks in river discharge combined with the effect of strong southward (downwelling-favorable) winds. An analysis of key non-dimensional numbers shows that buoyancy dominates plume dynamics during summer, whereas inertial forcing associated with river outflow is more important in winter near the coast. Farther offshore (>10 km), the effects of rotation and wind tend to dominate the plume dynamics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Information on marsh elevation is important to coastal managers, particularly for flood inundation mapping, coastal hazard assessments and modeling sea level rise. Elevation is also an important determinant of the frequency and duration of tidal flooding, which in turn affects species patterns in marshes: elevation differences of less than 10 cm can affect plant distributions and productivity. Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) can provide synoptic elevation information in many environments, but its accuracy in salt marshes is limited by a combination of sensor resolution (scan angle and frequency, pulse width, footprint size), instrument errors (GPS and inertial measurement unit errors), and poor laser penetration in dense vegetation. This means that uncorrected digital elevation models (DEM) are generally not accurate enough to distinguish elevation changes in salt marsh environments at the resolution that is used to determine tidal flooding or vegetation patterns. In this study, we used a LIDAR-derived DEM for the salt marshes surrounding Sapelo Island, GA obtained with a state-of-the-art Optech Gemini ALTM LIDAR system with a high laser pulse rate frequency of 125 kHz and advanced IMU/GPS technology, and evaluated its accuracy with elevations collected using real time kinematic (RTK) GPS. We found that DEM mean vertical errors for different cover classes ranged from 0.03 to 0.25 m in comparison to the RTK ground truth data, with the larger offsets for taller vegetation. We developed species-specific correction factors for ten cover classes and used these correction factors to modify the LIDAR-derived DEM in four areas of the study domain where vegetation boundaries were mapped directly in the field. Application of the derived correction factors greatly improved the accuracy of the LIDAR-derived DEM within these areas, reducing the overall mean DEM error from 0.10 +/- 0.12 (SD) to -0.01 +/- 0.09 m (SD), and the Root Mean Square Error from 0.16 m to 0.10 m. In the corrected DEM, the ground elevations of all vegetation classes were no longer significantly different than the true RTK ground elevations. Our results suggest that these types of corrections can greatly improve the accuracy of LIDAR-derived DEMs in salt marshes and further emphasize the importance of accuracy assessments before DEM data are used, especially in environments such as salt marshes where small differences in elevation can have significant effects on inundation patterns and plant distributions.

Similar imaging modes will be a part of the Sentinel-1 SAR sensing system. A consequence of operating at the wider swath is, however, the rather large view angle range (about 16-43 degrees), which needs to be corrected for if biophysical variables are to be retrieved from these data sets.   A soil moisture retrieval algorithm based on the Integral Equation Method (IEM) scattering model is presented that explicitly simulates the backscatter as a function of the incidence angle instead of normalizing. This algorithm is applied to 150 ASAR WS scenes collected from April 2005 to September 2007 over the central part of the Tibetan Plateau. We selected three of these images covering the study area at different view angles during the winter season for the IEM roughness derivation. Subsequently, soil moisture is retrieved from the entire sigma(degrees) data sets via inversion of the IEM model with the obtained roughness parameters as input. The retrievals are validated against soil moisture measured from July 2006 to September 2007 at four sites representative for a 10 x 10 km(2) area. Further, the uncertainties following from assumptions made for the development of the algorithm are also quantified. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

These sensors\' well-calibrated, high quality data have wide applicability and are being used in a much wider range of earth observation studies and applications, in addition to the planned SST mission. Each successive instrument has been an incremental improvement over its predecessor. Since early 1991 the ATSR sensors have provided global observations from the European Space Agency\'s Earth Observation satellites; namely ATSR-1 on ERS-1 (European Remote-sensing Satellite), then ATSR-2 on ERS-2 and then AATSR (Advanced ATSR) on ENVISAT. The missions have been operated with good overlaps between successive sensors; AATSR is currently the operational instrument. The fundamental requirement for each ATSR instrument is a design that is capable of delivering absolutely calibrated infrared data; therefore this paper concentrates on how the sensors provide the calibrated radiometric observations required for the SST retrieval algorithms to work. It does not discuss the validation of the algorithms to produce SST derived from these basic observations. Described are the rigorous pre-launch measurements over a range of simulated flight environments which verify that this aim has been achieved, a calibration which exercises the same brightness temperature algorithm that is then used when calibrating in-flight measurements. Crucially, the ATSRs measure calibration source radiances in-flight without interrupting Earth-viewing which permits continuous gain and offset monitoring and calibration. For clarity where it is thought necessary for a data user\'s better understanding of the calibration for flight data, some detail is provided concerning the differences between the three different ATSRs.

Active and passive microwave sensors are generally considered as the best technologies for retrieving soil moisture from space. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth observing system (AMSR-E) on-board the Aqua satellite and the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) on-board the MetOp (Meteorological Operational) satellite are among the sensors most widely used for soil moisture retrieval in the last years. However, due to differences in the spatial resolution, observation depths and measurement uncertainties, validation of satellite data with in situ observations and/or modelled data is not straightforward. In this study, a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of soil moisture estimations from the ASCAT and AMSR-E sensors is carried out by using observed and modelled soil moisture data over 17 sites located in 4 countries across Europe (Italy, Spain, France and Luxembourg). As regards satellite data, products generated by implementing three different algorithms with AMSR-E data are considered: (i) the Land Parameter Retrieval Model, LPRM, (ii) the standard NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) algorithm, and (iii) the Polarization Ratio Index, PRI. For ASCAT the Vienna University of Technology, TUWIEN, change detection algorithm is employed. An exponential filter is applied to approach root-zone soil moisture. Moreover, two different scaling strategies, based respectively on linear regression correction and Cumulative Density Function (CDF) matching, are employed to remove systematic differences between satellite and site-specific soil moisture data. Results are shown in terms of both relative soil moisture values (i.e., between 0 and 1) and anomalies from the climatological expectation.   Among the three soil moisture products derived from AMSR-E sensor data, for most sites the highest correlation with observed and modelled data is found using the LPRM algorithm. Considering relative soil moisture values for an similar to 5 cm soil layer, the TUWIEN ASCAT product outperforms AMSR-E over all sites in France and central Italy while similar results are obtained in all other regions. Specifically, the average correlation coefficient with observed (modelled) data equals to 0.71 (0.74) and 0.62 (0.72) for ASCAT and AMSR-E-LPRM, respectively. Correlation values increase up to 0.81 (0.81) and 0.69 (0.77) for the two satellite products when exponential filtering and CDF matching approaches are applied. On the other hand, considering the anomalies, correlation values decrease but, more significantly, in this case ASCAT outperforms all the other products for all sites except the Spanish ones. Overall, the reliability of all the satellite soil moisture products was found to decrease with increasing vegetation density and to be in good accordance with previous studies. The results provide an overview of the ASCAT and AMSR-E reliability and robustness over different regions in Europe, thereby highlighting advantages and shortcomings for the effective use of these data sets for operational applications such as flood forecasting and numerical weather prediction.

Global land cover maps have evolved rapidly in the last decade, but efforts to evaluate map uncertainties have been limited, especially in remote areas like Northern Eurasia. Northern Eurasia comprises a particularly diverse region covering a wide range of climate zones and ecosystems: from arctic deserts, tundra, boreal forest, and wetlands, to semi-arid steppes and the deserts of Central Asia. In this study, we assessed four of the most recent global land cover datasets: GLC-2000, GLOBCOVER, and the MODIS Collection 4 and Collection 5 Land Cover Product using cross-comparison analyses and Landsat-based reference maps distributed throughout the region. A consistent comparison of these maps was challenging because of disparities in class definitions, thematic detail, and spatial resolution. We found that the choice of sampling unit significantly influenced accuracy estimates, which indicates that comparisons of reported global map accuracies might be misleading. To minimize classification ambiguities, we devised a generalized legend based on dominant life form types (LFT) (tree, shrub, and herbaceous vegetation, barren land and water). LFT served as a necessary common denominator in the analyzed map legends, but significantly decreased the thematic detail. We found significant differences in the spatial representation of LFT\'s between global maps with high spatial agreement (above 0.8) concentrated in the forest belt of Northern Eurasia and low agreement (below 0.5) concentrated in the northern taiga-tundra zone, and the southern dry lands. Total pixel-level agreement between global maps and six test sites was moderate to fair (overall agreement: 0.67-0.74, Kappa: 0.41-0.52) and increased by 0.09-0.45 when only homogenous land cover types were analyzed. Low map accuracies at our tundra test site confirmed regional disagreements and difficulties of current global maps in accurately mapping shrub and herbaceous vegetation types at the biome borders of Northern Eurasia. In comparison, tree dominated vegetation classes in the forest belt of the region were accurately mapped, but were slightly overestimated (10%-20%), in all maps. Low agreement of global maps in the northern and southern vegetation transition zones of Northern Eurasia is likely to have important implications for global change research, as those areas are vulnerable to both climate and socio-economic changes.

Agricultural monitoring and yield forecasting could greatly benefit from such techniques by coupling crop growth models with crop specific information through data assimilation. An indicator which would be particularly interesting to obtain from remote sensing is the total surface of photosynthetically active plant tissue, or green area index (GAI). Currently, the major limitation is that the imagery that can be used operationally and economically over large areas with high temporal frequency has a coarse spatial resolution. This paper demonstrates how it is possible to characterise the regional crop specific GAI range along with its temporal dynamic using MODIS imagery by controlling the degree at which the observation footprints of the coarse pixels fall within the crop-specific mask delineating the target. This control is done by modelling the instrument\'s point spread function and by filtering out less reliable GAI estimations in both the spatial and temporal dimensions using thresholds on 3 variables: pixel purity, observation coverage and view zenith angle. The difference in performance between MODIS and fine spatial resolution to estimate the median GAI of a given crop over a 40 x 40 km study region can be reduced to a RMSE of 0.053 m(2)/m(2). The consistency between fine and coarse spatial resolution GAI estimations suggests a possible instrument synergy whereby the high temporal resolution of MODIS provides the general GAI trajectory and while high spatial resolution can be used to estimate the local GAI spatial heterogeneity.

The use of field spectroradiometers is common for this purpose, but the reliability of such measurements is still in question. In this paper we demonstrate the impact of various measurement uncertainties on vegetation canopy HCRF, using a combined laboratory and field experiment employing three spectroradiometers of the same broad specification (GER 1500). The results show that all three instruments performed similarly in the laboratory when a stable radiance source was measured (NE Delta L<1 mW m(-2) sr(-1) nm(-1) in the range of 400-1000 nm). In contrast, field-derived standard uncertainties (u=SD of 10 consecutive measurements of the same surface measured in ideal atmospheric conditions) significantly differed from the lab-based uncertainty characterisation for two targets: a control (75% Spectralon panel) and a cropped grassland surface. Results indicated that field measurements made by a single instrument of the vegetation surface were reproducible to within +/- 0.015 HCRF and of the control surface to within +/- 0.006 HCRF (400-1000 nm (+/- 1 sigma)). Field measurements made by all instruments of the vegetation surface were reproducible to within +/- 0.019 HCRF and of the control surface to within +/- 0.008 HCRF (400-1000 nm (+/- 1 sigma)). Statistical analysis revealed that even though the field conditions were carefully controlled and the absolute values of u were small, different instruments yielded significantly different reflectance values for the same target. The results also show that laboratory-derived uncertainty quantities do not present a useful means of quantifying all uncertainties in the field. The paper demonstrates a simple method for u characterisation, using internationally accepted terms, in field scenarios. This provides an experiment-specific measure of u that helps to put measurements in context and forms the basis for comparison with other studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Understanding the complex hydrology of riverine deltas is challenging due to the paucity of conventional ground-based measurements on river water levels and flows that result in large spatial and temporal sampling gaps. One way to bridge this sampling issue is to employ hydrodynamic models in combination with remotely-sensed water level elevation data from satellite altimetry in a data assimilation framework. However, a good understanding of the performance of models and altimetry is required beforehand. Using Bangladesh as an example of a complex delta, an inter-comparison study was therefore performed for water level estimates derived from the two methods: 1) satellite altimetry and 2) hydrodynamic-hydrologic modeling framework. The Envisat mission was selected for satellite altimetry-based water level data. For the modeling framework, a calibrated 1-D hydrodynamic model, HEC-RAS, was set up for the major rivers of Bangladesh using in-situ river bathymetry, gaged stream flow and water level data. Envisat water level estimates were generally found to be exceeded by the model-based values by 0.20 m and 1.90 m for Monsoon and dry seasons, respectively. In general, the average RMSE between Envisat and modeled estimates is more than 2.0 m. The closest agreement with altimetry was observed during the high flow Monsoon season over the Brahmaputra river. Envisat estimates are found to disagree most with model-based estimates for small to medium-sized river basins that are mountainous and flashy. This inter-comparison study provides preliminary guidance on the relative weights to assign for each type of estimate when designing a data assimilation scheme for optimal water level prediction in ungaged basins.

Local rice mapping methods have been developed previously in many studies by using the temporal change of the backscatter from C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) co-polarized data. The studies indicated in particular the need of a high observation frequency. In the past, the operational use of these methods has been limited by the small coverage and the poor acquisition frequency of the available data (ERS-1/2, Radarsat-1). In this paper, the method is adapted for the first time to map rice at large scale, by using wide-swath images of the Advanced SAR (ASAR) instrument onboard ENVISAT. To increase the observation frequency, data from different satellite tracks are combined. The detection of rice fields is achieved by exploiting the high backscatter increase at the beginning of the growing cycle, which allows the production of rice maps early in the season (in the first 50 days). The method is tested in the Mekong delta in Vietnam. The mapping results are compared to existing rice maps in the An Giang province, with a good agreement (higher than 81%). The rice planted areas are retrieved from the maps and successfully validated with the official statistics available at each province (R(2)=0.92). These results show that the method is useful for large scale early mapping of rice areas, using current and future C band wide-swath SAR data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, three sensors were used, Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection radiometer (ASTER) and Landsat5 Thematic Mapper (TM), whereas four atmospheric profiles sources were considered: i) local soundings launched near the sensor overpass time, ii) Moderate Resolution Radiometer (MODIS) atmospheric profiles product (MOD07), iii) Atmospheric Correction Parameter Calculator (ACPC) generated by the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and iv) Modified Atmospheric Profiles from Reanalysis Information (MAPRI), which includes data from NCEP and National Center of Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Reanalysis project but interpolated to 34 atmospheric levels and resampled to 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees. MODIS aerosol product (MOD04) was also used to extract Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) values at 550 nm. Analysis was performed for three test dates (12th July 2003, 18th July 2004 and 13th July 2005) over an agricultural area in Spain. Results showed that air temperature vertical profiles were similar for the four sources, whereas dew point temperature profiles showed significant differences at some particular levels. Atmospheric profiles were used as input to MODTRAN4 radiative transfer code in order to compute atmospheric parameters involved in atmospheric correction, with the aim of retrieving surface reflectances in the case of VNIR and SWIR regions, and Land Surface Temperature (LST) in the case of the TIR region. For the VNIR and SWIR region, significant differences depending on the atmospheric profile used were not found, particularly in the Visible region in which the AOT content is the main parameter involved in the atmospheric correction. In the case of TIR, differences depending on the atmospheric profile used were appreciable, since in this case the main parameter involved in the atmospheric correction is the water vapor content, which depends on the vertical profile. In terms of LST retrieval from ASTER data (2004 test case), all profiles provided satisfactory results compared to the ones obtained when using a local sounding, with errors of 0.3 K for ACPC and MAPRI cases and 0.7 K for MOD07. When retrieving LST from TM data (2005 test case), errors for MOD07 and MAPRI were 0.6 and 0.9 K respectively, whereas ACPC provided an error of 2 K. The results presented in this paper show that the different atmospheric profile sources are useful for accurate atmospheric correction when local soundings are not available. In particular, MODO7 product provides atmospheric information at the highest spatial resolution, 5 km, although its use is limited from 2000 to present, whereas MAPRI provides historical information from 1970 to present, but at lower spatial resolution.

The NEE measurements taken by a specifically developed aircraft platform (Sky Arrow ERA) over a transect in Central Italy during an 18-month period are used to validate a recently proposed modeling strategy. The strategy is based on the integration of the outputs from a NDVI-driven parametric model, C-Fix, and a model of ecosystem processes, BIOME-BGC, and can simulate both gross and net land carbon fluxes over different spatial and temporal scales. The application of this strategy to 1-km resolution ground and remotely sensed data descriptive of the study area enables the production of NEE estimates comparable to the aircraft measurements. The agreement between the two data series is high, especially when averaging the modeling outputs over areas consistent with the Sky Arrow footprint (i.e. 1-2 pixels apart from the flight line). Fractional forest cover and NDVI are the two model driving variables which explain most spatial variability of the aircraft NEE measurements. The modeling strategy yields the best performances for spring-summer seasons, when vegetation photosynthetic and respiratory processes are higher and easier to simulate. These performances are finally commented with specific emphasis on the contribution brought by remote sensing information. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

As regards remotely sensed data, such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) parameter, the presence of atmospherically contaminated data in the time series introduces some noise that may blur the change analysis. Several methods have already been developed to reconstruct NDVI time series, although most methods have been dedicated to reconstruction of acquired time series, while publicly available databases are usually composited over time. This paper presents the IDR (iterative Interpolation for Data Reconstruction) method, a new method designed to approximate the upper envelope of the NDVI time series while conserving as much as possible of the original data. This method is compared quantitatively to two previously applied methods to NDVI time series over different land cover classes. The IDR method provides the best profile reconstruction in most cases. Nevertheless, the IDR method tends to overestimate low NDVI values when high rates of change are present, although this effect can be lowered with shorter compositing periods. This method could also be applied to data before compositing, as well as to reconstruct time series for other biophysical parameters such as land surface temperature. as long as atmospheric contamination affects these parameters negatively.

For forest canopies, however, the relationship between the spectral response and leaf chemistry is confounded by factors such as background (e.g. understory), canopy structure, and the presence of non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV, e.g. woody elements)-particularly the appreciable amounts of standing and fallen dead wood found in older forests. We present a sensitivity analysis for the estimation of chlorophyll content in woody coniferous canopies using radiative transfer modeling, and use the modeled top-of-canopy reflectance data to analyze the contribution of woody elements, leaf area index (LAI), and crown cover (CC) to the retrieval of foliar Cab content. The radiative transfer model used comprises two linked submodels: one at leaf level (PROSPECT) and one at canopy level (FLIGHT). This generated bidirectional reflectance data according to the band settings of the Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) from which chlorophyll indices were calculated. Most of the chlorophyll indices outperformed single wavelengths in predicting Cab content at canopy level, with best results obtained by the Maccioni index ([R-780 - R-710]/[R-780 - R-680]). We demonstrate the performance of this index with respect to structural information on three distinct coniferous forest types (young, early mature and old-growth stands). The modeling results suggest that the spectral variation due to variation in canopy chlorophyll content is best captured for stands with medium dense canopies. However, the strength of the up-scaled Cab signal weakens with increasing crown NPV scattering elements, especially when crown cover exceeds 30%. LAI exerts the least perturbations. We conclude that the spectral influence of woody elements is an important variable that should be considered in radiative transfer approaches when retrieving foliar pigment estimates in heterogeneous stands, particularly if the stands are partly defoliated or long-lived.

Once delineated, these zones become the basis for a wide variety of scientific research and management activities. For instance, in Canada, ecozones are commonly utilized ecological management units delineated using geographic, topographic, and climatic information aided by spring and summer vegetation conditions. Snow cover has an influence on local and regional hydrological conditions and climate, as well as on animal habitats. As such, we posit that inclusion of winter conditions, incorporating spatial- and temporal-variation in snow cover is an additional element for consideration when delineating areas with homogenous conditions. In our analysis we use satellite passive microwave brightness temperatures from 19 years of Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) measurements to produce a daily time-series on snow cover, and demonstrate how these data can be used to delineate areas of similar winter conditions. We use splines and curve fitting to generalize the dense time-series (of over 6900 days) to a set of metrics, and select three for use in cluster-based generalization of snow cover regimes: annual maximum difference between 37 and 19 GHz SSM/I measurements (with differences in magnitudes indicative of snow accumulation), variation of 37-19 GHz brightness temperatures (indicative of snow cover variability), and variation in the rate of brightness temperature change during the snow melt season (indicative of seasonal change). Our results indicate that these metrics produce spatial units that are unique, and not captured by conventional ecological management units, while also producing spatial units that cohere to those generated from summer conditions. Spatial units that are found to have spatial cohesion between summer and winter data sources are located in regions where the amount of snow tends to be low, and snow cover variability minimal. We propose that snow cover regimes may be used to augment typical vegetation-based ecological zonations or to provide insights on hydrology and animal habitat conditions. Inclusion of winter conditions is especially important when areal delineations are used to monitor impacts of climate change, and as a baseline for monitoring changes in snow cover amount, extent, and/or distribution.

This algorithm can be used under both clear sky and cloudy sky conditions. Long term seasonal trend of EDVI is linked to variance of canopy resistance due to the interrelationship among leaf development, environmental condition and microwave radiation. Short term changes of EDVI caused by synoptic scale weather variations is used to parameterize the responds of vegetation resistance to the quick changes of environmental factors including water vapor deficit, water potential and others. The performance of this algorithm was test at the Harvard forest site by using satellite measurements from the SSM/I F13 and F14 sensors. Validation at the site with 169 samples shows that the correlation coefficient (R-2) between estimated and observed ETs is 0.83 with a mean bias of 3.31 Wm(-2) and a standard deviation of 79.63 Wm(-2). The overall uncertainty of our ET retrieval is similar to 30%, which is within the uncertainty of current ground based ET measurements. Furthermore, the estimated Er in different local times (up to 4 times per day) successfully captured the diurnal cycle of ET It is the first time that the diurnal variations of vegetation-atmosphere interactions were directly monitored from space. This study demonstrates that the technique reported here extends the current satellite capability of vegetation property and ET flux remote sensing from daytime, clearsky conditions to day and night times and from intermediate leaf area index (LAI) to all range of vegetation states.

During this period field spectroscopy has become established as an important technique for characterising the reflectance of natural surfaces in situ, for supporting the vicarious calibration of airborne and satellite sensors, and for providing a means of scaling-up measurements from small areas (e.g. leaves, rocks) to composite scenes (e.g. vegetation canopies), and ultimately to pixels. This paper describes the physical basis of the subject and evaluates the different methods and instruments which have been employed across a range of studies. ne development and use of field goniometers is described, and related to methods for estimating the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) from directional reflectance measurements in the field. The paper also considers the practical aspects of field spectroscopy, and identifies a number of factors affecting the useability of field spectroradiometers, including the weight and cost of the instruments, limitations of some commonly used methodologies and practical issues such as the legibility of displays and limited battery life. The prospects for the future of field spectroscopy are considered in relation to the increasingly important contribution that field spectral data will make to EO-based global measurement and monitoring systems, specifically through their assimilation into numerical models. However, for this to be achieved it is essential that the data are of high quality, with stated levels of accuracy and uncertainty, and that common protocols are developed and maintained to ensure the long-term value of field spectroscopic data. The importance of employing a precise terminology for describing the geometric configuration of measurements is highlighted in relation to issues of repeatability and reproducibility. Through such refinements in methodology, field spectroscopy will establish its credentials as a reliable method of environmental measurement, underpinning quantitative Earth observation and its applications in the environmental and Earth sciences.

LIDAR points from individual trees were identified using the field-measured tree location. Points from adjacent trees within a crown were excluded using a procedure to separate crown overlap. Mean intensity values of laser returns within individual tree crowns were compared between species. We found that the intensity values for different species were related not only to reflective properties of the vegetation, but also to a presence or absence of foliage and the arrangement of foliage and branches within individual tree crowns. The classification results for broadleaved and coniferous species using linear discriminant function with a cross validation suggests that the classification rate was higher using leaf-off data (83.4%) than using leaf-on data (73.1%), with highest (90.6%) when combining these two LIDAR data sets. The result also indicates that different ranges of intensity values between two LIDAR datasets didn\'t affect the result of discriminant functions. Overall results indicate that some species and species groups can be differentiated using LIDAR intensity data and implies the potential of combining two LIDAR datasets for one study.

Considering the vast and often remote areas under protection, Parks Canada Agency envisions Earth Observation technology to be the basis for a Park Ecological Integrity Observing System (Park-EIOS), and integral component of a larger national parks ecological integrity (EI) monitoring program. Park-EIOS is planned for operational use beginning in 2008 and includes coarse filter El indicators corresponding to landscape pattern, succession and retrogression, net primary productivity, and focal species distributions within parks and their surrounding greater park ecosystems. A primary input to produce all four indicators is a time series of land cover information derived from medium (similar to 30 m) resolution, Landsat-class sensors. This paper describes a generic, end-to-end change detection framework developed for Park-EIOS, labelled Automated Multi-temporal Updating through Signature Extension (AMUSE). AMUSE involves radiometric normalization steps, production of a baseline land cover, change vector analysis to identify changed pixels, and a new constrained signature extension approach to update the land cover of changed areas.

Our objective was to quantify and compare the extent and pattern of natural land cover, risk of conversion, and relationships with demographic and economic variables in counties near National Park Service units and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service refuges with those counties distant from either type of protected area in the coterminous United States. Our results indicate that landscapes in counties within 10 km of both parks and refuges and those within 10 km of just parks were more natural, more intact, and more protected than those in counties within 10 km of just refuges and counties greater than 10 km from either protected area system. However, they also had greater human population density and change in population, indicating potential conversion risk since the percent of landscape protected averaged <5% in both groups and human population dynamics are primary drivers of change in many landscapes. Conversion outweighed protection by at least two times (Conservation Risk Index >2) in 76% of counties near both parks and refuges, 81% of counties near just parks, 91% of counties near just refuges, and 93% of distant counties. Thirteen percent of counties in the coterminous U.S. had moderate to high amounts of natural land cover (>60%), low protection (<20%), and the greatest change in population (>20%). Although these areas are not the most critically endangered, they represent the greatest conservation opportunity, need, and urgency. Our approach is based on national level metrics that are simple, general, informative, and can be understood by broad audiences and by policy makers and managers to assess the health of lands surrounding parks and refuges. Regular monitoring of these metrics with satellite data products in counties surrounding protected areas provides a consistent, national level assessment of management opportunities and potentially adverse changes on adjacent lands.

To enable the updating of this land cover information in a consistent and continuous manner, a prototype method was developed to update land cover by an individual Landsat path and row. This method updates NLCD 2001 to a nominal date of 2006 by using both Landsat imagery and data from NLCD 2001 as the baseline. Pairs of Landsat scenes in the same season in 2001 and 2006 were acquired according to satellite paths and rows and normalized to allow calculation of change vectors between the two dates. Conservative thresholds based on Anderson Level I land cover classes were used to segregate the change vectors and determine areas of change and no-change. Once change areas had been identified, land cover classifications at the full NLCD resolution for 2006 areas of change were completed by sampling from NLCD 2001 in unchanged areas. Methods were developed and tested across five Landsat path/row study sites that contain several metropolitan areas including Seattle, Washington; San Diego, California; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Jackson, Mississippi: and Manchester, New Hampshire. Results from the five study areas show that the vast majority of land cover change was captured and updated with overall land cover classification accuracies of 78.32%, 87.5%, 88.57%. 78.36%, and 83.33% for these areas. The method optimizes mapping efficiency and has the potential to provide users a flexible method to generate updated land cover at national and regional scales by using NLCD 2001 as the baseline.

Estimates of forest fAPAR are derived from Spot-VGT NDVI images and are combined with spatially consistent data layers obtained by the elaboration of ground meteorological measurements. The original version of C-Fix is first applied to estimate monthly GPP of Italian forests during eight years (1999-2006). Next, a modification of the model is proposed in order to simulate the short-term effect of summer water stress more efficiently. The accuracy of the original and modified C-Fix versions is evaluated by comparison with GPP data taken at eight Italian eddy covariance flux tower sites. The experimental results confirm the capacity of C-Fix to monitor national forest GPP patterns and indicate the utility of considering the short-term effect of water stress during Mediterranean dry months.

The 25+ year record has enabled important time-series studies. Many applications use NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), or derivatives of it, as their operational variable. However, most AVHRR datasets have incomplete atmospheric correction, because of which there is considerable, but largely unknown, uncertainty in the significance of differences in NDVI and other short wave observations from AVHRR instruments.   The purpose of this study was to gain better understanding of the impact of incomplete or lack of atmospheric correction in widely-used, publicly available processed AVHRR-NDVI long-term datasets. This was accomplished by comparison with atmospherically corrected AVHRR data at AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) sunphotometer sites in 1999. The datasets included in this study are: TOA (Top Of Atmosphere) that is with no atmospheric correction; PAL (Pathfinder AVHRR Land); and an early version of the new LTDR (Long Term Data Record) NOW The other publicly available clatasets like GIMMS (Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping studies) and GVI (Global Vegetation Index) have atmospheric error budget similar to that of TOA, because no atmospheric correction is used in either processing stream. Of the three clatasets, LTDR was found to have least errors (accuracy = 0.0064 to -0.024, precision = 0.02 to 0.037 for clear and average atmospheric conditions) followed by PAL (accuracy = -0.145 to -0.035, precision = 0.0606 to 0.0418), and TOA (accuracy = -0.0791 to -0.112, precision = 0.0613 to 0.0684).

The developed approach is now applied to cover three new AVHRR sensors launched in recent years on NOAA-17,18, and METOP-A platforms. As in the previous study, the results are provided relative to the reference sensor AVHRR NOAA-9. The differences in reflectance among these three radiometers relative to the AVHRR NOAA-9 are similar to each other and range from -0.015 to 0.015 (-20% to +2% relative) for visible (red) channel, and from -0.03 to 0.02 (-5% to 5%) for the near infrared (NIR) channel. The absolute change in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) ranged from -0.03 to +0.06. Due to systematic biases of the visible channels toward smaller values and the NIR channels toward slightly larger values, the overall systematic biases for NDVI are positive. The polynomial approximations are provided for the bulk spectral correction with respect to the AVHRR NOAA-9 for consistency with previous study. Analysis was also conducted for the SRF effect only among the AVHRR-3 type of radiometer on NOAA-15,16,17,18 and METOP-A using AVHRR NOAA-18 as a reference. The results show more consistency between sensors with typical correction being under 5% (or 0.01 in absolute values). The AVHRR METOP-A reveals the most different behavior among the AVHRR-3 group with generally positive bias for visible channel (up to +5%, relative), slightly negative bias for the NIR channel (1%-2% relative), and negative NOVI bias (-0.02 to +0.005).

Here, we develop and apply an end-to-end analysis that relates the requirements of ecological models to the capabilities of satellite-sensors, starting with radiometric noise at the instrument, which collects the information, running through to the error on the estimated NPP output from the ecological model. In the process, the input requirements of current ecological models are reviewed. Our aim is to establish a better informed framework for the design and development of future satellite-sensor missions, which meet the needs of ecological modellers. Three mathematical models (PROSPECT, FLIGHT and 6S) are coupled and inverted using a technique based on LUT. The LUT are used to estimate biophysical variables of vegetation canopies from remotely-sensed data observed at the TOA in a number of viewing directions and in several wavebands within the visible and near-infrared spectrum. The five variables considered here are LAI, leaf chlorophyll content (C-ab), fAPAR, cover fraction and AOT. Different sensor configurations are investigated, in terms of directional and spectral sampling. The retrieval uncertainty is linked with the instrument radiometric accuracy by analysing the impact of different levels of radiometric noise. The parameters retrieved via the inversion are used to drive two LSP models, namely Biome-BGC and JULES. The effects of different sensor configurations and levels of radiometric noise on the NPP estimated are analysed. The system is used to evaluate the sensor characteristics best suited to drive models of boreal forest productivity. The results show that multiangular information improves dramatically the accuracy with which forest canopy properties are estimated. Due to problems of equifinality, the results show a persistence of error even in the presence of zero noise from the sensor, although decreasing the level of radiometric noise from 0.02 to 0.001 reduces error in the estimated NPP by 10% to 25%.

In this study, the values of Hapke\'s photometric parameters (omega, h, b, c, B0, and (theta) over bar) were retrieved from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument at locations in China\'s deserts. Four pixels represented the typical surface characteristics of the Taklimakan Desert, sand dunes of Kumtag Desert, relatively smooth areas of the Kumtag Desert and the aeolian sandy soil of Loulan. In contrast to earlier studies, we found that the retrieved parameter values were largely affected by the initial value. To combat this problem we used a Monte Carlo method with physical constraints and a conformity indicator to ensure physically meaningful inversion.   The results showed that the angular domain of MISR observations was sufficiently large to determine confidently the values of Hapke\'s photometric parameters with the exception of the opposition effect width (h). Retrieved values for the single scattering albedo (omega) and macroscopic roughness ((theta) over bar) were consistent with qualitative observations about the structure and composition of the surface material and the nature of the dune forms, respectively. At Loulan, where the surface was smoother than other sites, retrieved values exhibited the strongest backward scattering. These results indicated that at the sensor scale, a rough surface (e.g., dunes) does not necessarily mean more backward scattering than a smooth surface. This finding has significant implications for empirical methods (e.g., using the normalized index of backward-scattered radiance minus forward-scattered radiance as an indicator to indicate surface roughness) which should be used carefully for analyzing surface roughness from remote sensing data. Future research is needed to 1) understand how surface roughness at the sub-pixel scale modifies the angular characteristics of reflectance and to 2) find practical methods for rapid whole image processing for mapping the photometric parameters.

Although usually referred as chaotic, their inner organization is strongly hierarchical: turbulent flows develop cascades, which transfer properties such as energy or scalar density from larger to smaller scales. In this work, we present a novel algorithm based on the cascade and able to fill data gaps in satellite images (particularly, chlorophyll concentration maps). The first step is to show that cascade processes for chlorophyll-a concentration images take a simple, explicit form when an appropriate wavelet (here Battle-Lemarie of order 3) representation is used. A reconstruction algorithm exploiting the cascade structure is then given with a detailed description. We discuss the validity and quality of this algorithm when applied to SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua ocean color images. An application to merging data from multiple satellite missions is presented together with a demonstration of the benefit of this algorithm over two other merging methods. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Satellite remote sensing can provide spatially explicit, synoptic land cover change information to support such an assessment. However, a common challenge in conventional remote sensing change detection is the difficulty of obtaining phenologically and radiometrically comparable data from the start and end of the time period of interest. An alternative approach is to use a prior land cover classification as a surrogate for historic satellite data and to examine the self-consistency of class spectral reflectances in recent imagery. We produced a 30-meter resolution wetland change probability map for the U.S. mid-Atlantic region by applying an outlier detection technique to a base classification provided by the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI). Outlier-resistant measures - the median and median absolute deviation - were used to represent spectral reflectance characteristics of wetland class populations, and formed the basis for the calculation of a pixel change likelihood index. The individual scene index values were merged into a consistent region-wide map and converted to pixel change probability using a logistic regression calibrated through interpretation of historic and recent aerial photography. The accuracy of a regional change/no-change map produced from the change probabilities was estimated at 89.6%, with a Kappa of 0.779. The change probabilities identify areas for closer inspection of change cause, impact, and mitigation potential. With additional work to resolve confusion resulting from natural spatial heterogeneity and variations in land use, automated updating of NWI maps and estimates of areal rates of wetland change may be possible. We also discuss extensions of the technique to address specific applications such as monitoring marsh degradation due to sea level rise and mapping of invasive species. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Most previous attempts to estimate LAI from remotely sensed data have relied on empirical relationships between field-measured observations and various spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) derived from optical imagery or the inversion of canopy radiative transfer models. However, as biomass within an ecosystem increases, accurate LAI estimates are difficult to quantify. Here we use lidar data in conjunction with SPOT5-derived spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) to examine the extent to which integration of both lidar and spectral datasets can estimate specific LAI quantities over a broad range of conifer forest stands in the northern Rocky Mountains. Our results show that SPOT5-derived SVIs performed poorly across our study areas, explaining less than 50% of variation in observed LAI, while lidar-only models account for a significant amount of variation across the two study areas located in northern Idaho; the St. Joe Woodlands (R-2=0.86; RMSE=0.76) and the Nez Perce Reservation (R-2=0.69; RMSE=0.61). Further, we found that LAI models derived from lidar metrics were only incrementally improved with the inclusion of SPOT 5-derived SVIs; increases in R-2 ranged from 0.02-0.04, though model RMSE values decreased for most models (0-11.76% decrease). Significant lidar-only models tended to utilize a common set of predictor variables such as canopy percentile heights and percentile height differences, percent canopy cover metrics, and covariates that described lidar height distributional parameters. All integrated lidar-SPOT 5 models included textural measures of the visible wavelengths (e.g. green and red reflectance). Due to the limited amount of LAI model improvement when adding SPOT 5 metrics to lidar data, we conclude that lidar data alone can provide superior estimates of LAI for our study areas.

As a result, methods are required that assess the effect of management activities on the biodiversity of floodplain ecosystems. In this paper, we show that dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) in combination with regional scale derived remote sensing products can be adopted to assess both current and future ecosystem development and biodiversity status of a complex floodplain ecosystem in the Netherlands. The dynamic vegetation model SMART2-SUMO2 in combination with the nature valuation model NTM3 predicting potential floristic diversity was applied to simulate the biodiversity status of the Millingerwaard floodplain along the river Rhine in the Netherlands. Estimates of net primary production (NPP) derived from airborne HyMap imaging spectrometer data were used for validation of the simulated NPP by the DVM at the time of data acquisition in 2004. Imaging spectrometer derived NPP was in good agreement with the SMART2-SUMO2 modeled results. The NTM3 derived nature valuation in 2004 expressed as plant diversity for the floodplain was high and well in agreement with field observations. In a next step, the DVM was re-initialized using imaging spectrometer derived NPP in 2004 and a forecast of plant diversity and biomass development in 2050 was made. A comparison was performed for three pre-defined floodplain management scenarios using a data-assimilation based approach as well as one without. Significant differences in biomass development can be observed between the scenarios. Predicted plant diversity for individual ecosystems in 2050 shows increased variability for forest ecosystems compared to grass ecosystems. This shows that floodplain management should take advantage of spatiotemporal dynamics of the floodplain as a basis for fostering the development of increased biodiversity. The results of this study demonstrate that imaging spectrometer derived products can be used for validation and initialization of DVMs. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The FAPAR value is estimated from daily MERIS spectral measurements acquired at the top-of-atmosphere, using a physically based approach. The products are operationally available at the reduced spatial resolution, i.e. 1.2 km, and can be computed at the full spatial resolution, i.e. at 300 m, from the top-of-atmosphere MERIS data by using the same algorithm. The quality assessment of the MERIS FAPAR products capitalizes on the availability of five years of data acquired globally. The actual validation exercise is performed in two steps including, first, an analysis of the accuracy of the FAPAR algorithm itself with respect to the spectral measurements uncertainties and, second, with a direct comparison of the FAPAR time series against ground-based estimations as well as similar FAPAR products derived from other optical sensor data. The results indicate that the impact of top-of-atmosphere radiance uncertainties on the operational MERIS FAPAR products accuracy is expected to be at about 5-10% and the agreement with the ground-based estimates over different canopy types is achieved within +/- 0.1.

We demonstrate the use of an augmented state vector approach to enable a canopy reflectance model to be used as a non-linear observation operator. A key feature of data assimilation (DA) schemes, such as the EnKF, is that they incorporate information on uncertainty in both the model and the observations to provide a best estimate of the true state of a system. In addition, estimates of uncertainty in the model outputs (given the observed data) are calculated, which is crucial in assessing the utility of model predictions.   Results are compared against eddy-covariance observations of CO2 fluxes collected over three years at a pine forest site. The assimilation of 500 in spatial resolution MODIS reflectance data significantly improves estimates of Gross Primary Production (GPP) and Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP) from the model, with clear reduction in the resulting uncertainty of estimated fluxes. However, foliar biomass tends to be overestimated compared with measurements. Issues regarding this over-estimate, as well as the various assumptions underlying the assimilation of reflectance data are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

One of the objectives of the Soil Moisture Experiments 2004 (SMEX04) was to address some aspects of this problem, specifically variability introduced by vegetation, topography and convective precipitation. Other goals included supporting the development of soil moisture data sets that would contribute to understanding the role of the land surface in the concurrent North American Monsoon System. SMEX04 was conducted over two regions: Arizona - semi-arid climate with sparse vegetation and moderate topography, and Sonora (Mexico) - moderate vegetation with strong topographic gradients. The Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer (PSR/CX) was flown on a Naval Research Lab P-3B aircraft as part of SMEX04 (10 dates of coverage over Arizona and 11 over Sonora). Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) was observed in both PSR and satellite-based (AMSR-E) observations at 6.92 GHz over Arizona, but no detectable RFI was observed over the Sonora domain. The PSR estimated soil moisture was in agreement with the ground-based estimates of soil moisture over both domains. The estimated error over the Sonora domain (SEE=0.021 cm(3)/cm(3)) was higher than over the Arizona domain (SEE=0.014 cm(3)/cm(3)). These results show the possibility of estimating soil moisture in areas of moderate and heterogeneous vegetation and high topographic variability. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The large area extent of fire prone areas associated with human activities makes satellite remote sensing of active fires a valuable tool to help monitor biomass burning in those regions. However, identification of active fire fronts under optically thick clouds is not possible through passive remote sensing, often resulting in omission errors. Previous analyses of fire activity either ignored the cloud obscuration problem or applied corrections based on the assumption that fire occurrence is not impacted by the presence of clouds. In this study we addressed the cloud obscuration problem in the Brazilian Amazon region using a pixel based probabilistic approach, using information on previous fire occurrence, precipitation and land use. We implemented the methodology using data from the geostationary GOES imager, covering the entire diurnal cycle of fire activity and cloud occurrence. Our assessment of the method indicated that the cloud adjustment reproduced the number of potential fires missed within 1.5% and 5% of the true fire counts on annual and monthly bases respectively. Spatially explicit comparison with high resolution burn scar maps in Acre state showed a reduction of omission error (from 58.3% to 43.7%) and only slight increase of commission error (from 6.4% to 8.8%) compared to uncorrected fire counts. A basin-wide analysis of corrected GOES fire counts during 2005 showed a mean cloud adjustment factor of approximately 11%, ranging from negligible adjustment in the central and western part of the Brazilian Amazon to as high as 50% in parts of Roraima, Para and Mato Grosso.

We studied how leaf water indices relate to the LWT in cowpea, bean, and sugarbeet. In all three species, the LWT increased linearly with increasing leaf thickness. The T-1300/T-1450 leaf water index, based on light transmitted through leaves, showed a strong exponential correlation with the LWT as expected from theoretical analysis.

Together with a newly exposed ice/sediment cliff, this serves as excellent ground truthing for the GPR data. Empirical GPR frequency dependent relations are established to quantify the loss of the signal power through the layer of sediment. The loss through ice is in comparison negligible. These relations indicate that the maximum ice pocket detection depth (for this sediment type), with the different GPR systems used, are 90, 150 and 200 ns for the 800, 500 and 200 MHz systems respectively. The electromagnetic (EM) wave velocities calculated from diffractions yield velocities ranging between 0.115-0.135 m/ns for the sediment and 0.15-0.17 m/ns for the ice. With the derived EM wave velocities, these Two-Way-Travel (TWT) times correspond to a depth of similar to 6, 9 and 13 m respectively. This loss cannot be tested for the 200 and 500 MHz systems due to lack of such a deep sediment layer on top of the ice, but is consistent with the 800 MHz data. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In remotely sensed imagery, an ecotone may appear as an edge, a boundary of mixed pixels or a zone of continuous variation, depending on the spatial scale of the vegetation communities and their transition zone in relation to the spatial resolution of the imagery. Often in image classification, an ecotone is either ignored if it falls within a width of one or two pixels, or part of it may be mapped as a separate vegetation community if it covers an area of several pixel widths. A soft classification method, such as probability mapping, is inherently appealing for mapping vegetation transition. Ideally, the probability of membership each pixel has to each vegetation class corresponds with the proportional composition of vegetation classes per pixel. In this paper we investigate the use of class probability mapping to produce a softened classification of an alpine treeline ecotone in Austria using a SPOT 5 HRG image. Here the transition with altitude is from dense subalpine forest to treeless alpine meadow and herbaceous vegetation. The posterior probabilities from a Maximum Likelihood algorithm are shown to reflect the land-cover composition of mixed pixels in the ecotone. The relationships between the posterior probability of class membership for the two end-member classes of \'scrub and forest\' and \'non-forest vegetation\' and the percentage ground cover of these vegetation classes (enumerated in 15 quadrats from 1:1500 aerial photographs) were highly significant: r(2)=0.83 and r(2)=0.85 respectively (p<0.001, n=15). We identify thresholds (alpha-cuts) in the posterior probabilities of class membership of \'scrub and forest\' and \'non-forest vegetation\' to map the alpine treeline ecotone as a transition zone of five intermediate vegetation classes between the end-member communities. In addition, we investigate the representation of the ecotone as a ratio between the posterior probabilities of \'scrub and forest\' and \'non-forest vegetation\'. This displays the vegetation transition without imposing subjective boundaries, and has greater emphasis on the ecotone transition rather than on the end-member communities. We comment on the fitness for purpose of the different ways investigated for representing the alpine treeline ecotone. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The major objective of this study was to find out if it is possible to use high-resolution airborne laser scanner data to detect very small trees - the pioneers that are pushing the tree line up into the mountains and out onto the tundra. The study was conducted in a sub-alpine/alpine environment in southeast Norway. A total of 342 small trees of Norway spruce, Scots pine, and downy birch with tree heights ranging from 0.11 to 5.20 in were precisely georeferenced and measured in field. Laser data were collected with a pulse density of 7.7 m(-2). Three different terrain models were used to process the airborne laser point cloud in order to assess the effects of different pre-processing parameters on small tree detection. Greater than 91 % of all trees > 1 in tall registered positive laser height values regardless of terrain model. For smaller trees (< 1 m), positive height values were found in 5-73% of the cases, depending on the terrain model considered. For this group of trees, the highest rate of trees with positive height values was found for spruce. The more smoothed the terrain model was, the larger the portion of the trees that had positive laser height values. The accuracy of tree height derived from the laser data indicated a systematic underestimation of true tree height by 0.40 to 1.01 m. The standard deviation for the differences between laser-derived and field-measured tree heights was 0.11-0.73 m Commission errors, i.e., the detection of terrain objects - rocks, hummocks - as trees, increased significantly as terrain smoothing increased. Thus, if no classification of objects into classes like small trees and terrain objects is possible, many non-tree objects with a positive height value cannot be separated from those actually being trees. In a monitoring context, i.e., repeated measurements over time, we argue that most other objects like terrain structures, rocks, and hummocks will remain stable over time while the trees will change as they grow and new trees are established. Thus, this study indicates that, given a high laser pulse density and a certain density of newly established trees, it would be possible to detect a sufficient portion of newly established trees over a 10 years period to claim that tree migration is taking place.

It mainly depends on water availability and incoming solar radiation and then reflects the interactions between surface water processes and climate. In this paper, a methodology for retrieving ET from low spatial resolution remote sensing data is presented. It is based on the evaporative fraction concept, and it has been applied to Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AHVRR) data acquired over the Iberian Peninsula. The methodology does not require other data than the data provided by the satellite and may be applied to areas with almost spatially constant atmospheric conditions and which include wet and dry sub-areas. The comparison with high resolution ET estimation shows a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.4 mm d(-1) which is in agreement with the sensitivity analysis of the method. Finally, the methodology has been applied to temporal NOAA-AVHRR images acquired from 1997 to 2002 in order to analyze the seasonal evolution of the daily ET. The temporal study of the ET values realized in this paper shows that the highest ET values are associated with the higher development crops, while the lowest values are related with lower development or null crop. As a conclusion, it is shown that the ET values obtained with the proposed model evolve according to the variations presented in parameters such as surface temperature or vegetation index.

Such signatures of past disturbances or legacies can influence bow the ecosystem functions across broad spatio-temporal scales. The 1938 hurricane and ensuing salvage operations which swept through New England represent the most recent large, infrequent disturbance (LID) in this region. Though devastating (downing similar to 70% of the timber at Harvard Forest), the disturbance was not indiscriminate-, it left behind a heterogeneous landscape comprised of different levels of canopy damage. We analyzed large-footprint LiDAR, from the Prospect Hill tract at Harvard Forest in central Massachusetts, to assess whether damage to the forest structure from the hurricane and subsequent timber extraction could be discerned after - 65 years. Differences in LiDAR-derived measures of canopy height and vertical diversity were a function of the degree of damage from the 1938 hurricane and the predominant tree species which is, in part, a function of land use history. Higher levels of damage corresponded to slightly shorter canopies with a less even vertical distribution of return from the ground to the top. In addition, differences in canopy topography as revealed by spatial autocorrelation of canopy top heights were found among the damage classes. Less disturbed stands were characterized by lower levels of local autocorrelation for canopy height and higher levels of vertical diversity of LiDAR returns. These differences in canopy structure reveal that the forest tract has not completely recovered from the 1938 LID and salvage regime, which may have implications on arboreal and understory habitat and other ecosystem functions.

Spectral-angular profiles for each physiognomy (Seasonal, Dry and Pluvial Forests; Arboreous and Park Savanna) were obtained from nadir-normalized BRY data at each MISR band and date of image acquisition. The maximum likelihood classification technique was applied at each camera and date using a common set of pixels as training samples. A reference map was used as ground truth to obtain the classification accuracy for each physiognomy, view angle and date. Results showed that the surface anisotropy signatures of the savanna physiognomies were not unique and varied with Sun-view geometry and seasonality. Directional effects increased from data collected in the orthogonal plane to those acquired close to the solar principal plane, and with increasing Sun zenith angles. Such effects were also affected by seasonality due to differences in the dynamics of the vegetation response to precipitation, as indicated by the Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) values. Dry Forest presented a faster rate of \"green-up\" in the beginning of the rainy season and more abrupt changes in LAI values earlier in the dry season than the other physiognomies. In relation to the nadir response, the strongest anisotropy was observed in the backward scattering direction and in the red band at large Sun zenith angles. Directional effects were also observed after the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) determination. Classification accuracy of vegetation improved from the rainy to the dry season. The exception was Park Savanna, which was also well discriminated from the other physiognomies in the beginning of the rainy season due to the spectral effects of non-photosynthetic vegetation (dry grass understore) that produced an increase in the red reflectance. In general, classification accuracy of the physiognomies improved also from the forward to the backward scattering direction. The best view angles for classification purposes ranged from 0 degrees (nadir) to -45.6 degrees, and were associated with viewing directions of maximum backscattering at the different dates. In comparison with single view direction results, the use of Anisotropy Index (ANIX) images produced a general decrease in classification accuracy values. Results indicated that off-nadir viewing can improve discrimination and mapping of major physiognomies in the Brazilian savanna environment. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Linear correlations and regressions were computed between annual NDVI and annual rainfall at a 0.5 degrees latitude/longitude resolution, based on two gridded precipitation datasets (Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation [CMAP] and Climatic Research Unit [CRU]). The spatial patterns were then examined to detect how they relate to the mean annual rainfall amounts, land-cover types as from the Global Land Cover 2000 data set, soil properties and soil types. Yearly means were computed starting from the beginning of the vegetative year (first month after the minimum of the NDVI mean regime), with a one-month lead for rainfall.   One third of tropical Africa displays significant (95% c.l.) correlations between interannual NDVI variations and those of rainfall. At continental scale, soil types and soil properties are only minor factors in the overall distribution of the correlations. Mean annual rainfall amounts and land-cover types are much more discriminating. The largest correlations, mostly over 0.60, are distinctly found in semi-arid (200-600 mm annual rainfall) open grassland and cropland areas. The presence of one of these two determinants (semi-aridity, and favourable land-cover type, i.e. open grassland and cropland) in the absence of the other does not systematically result in a significant correlation between rainfall and NDVI. By contrast, NDVI variations are independent from those of rainfall in markedly and environments and in most forest and woodland areas. This results from a low signal-to-noise ratio in the former, and the fact that precipitation is generally not a limiting factor in the latter.   The marginal response of NDVI to a given increase/decrease in rainfall, as described by the slope of the regression, displays a similar pattern to that of the correlation, with maximum slopes in seim-arid regions, except that a weaker response is noted in more densely populated areas, suggesting an incidence of particular land-use and agricultural practises.   One-year lag relationships between annual rainfall and NDVI in the next year were also considered. Ten percent of the grid-points show significant correlations, but the spatial patterns remain difficult to interpret. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In both regions, sites with lidar-sensed rugosities above 1.2 were imaged by an along-track underwater videography system that incorporated the acquisition of instantaneous GPS positions. Subsequent manual interpretation of videotape segments was performed to identify substratum types that caused elevated lidar-sensed rugosity. Our study determined that massive coral colony formation, modified by subsequent physical and biological processes that breakdown patch reef framework, was the primary source of topographic complexity sensed by the EAARL in the NFRT. Sites recognized by lidar scanning to be topographically complex preferentially occurred around the margins of patch reefs, constituted a minor fraction of the reef system, and usually reflected the presence of massive coral colonies in cluster zones, or their derivatives created by mortality, bioerosion, and physical breakdown.

Reflectance terms such as BRDF, HDRF, BRF, BHR, DHR, black-sky albedo, white-sky albedo, and blue-sky albedo are defined, explained, and exemplified, while separating conceptual from measurable quantities. We use selected examples from the peer-reviewed literature to demonstrate that very often the current use of reflectance terminology does not fulfill physical standards and can lead to systematic errors. Secondly, the paper highlights the importance of a proper usage of definitions through quantitative comparison of different reflectance products with special emphasis on wavelength dependent effects. Reflectance quantities acquired under hemispherical illumination conditions (i.e., all outdoor measurements) depend not only on the scattering properties of the observed surface, but as well on atmospheric conditions, the object\'s surroundings, and the topography, with distinct expression of these effects in different wavelengths. We exemplify differences between the hemispherical and directional illumination quantities, based on observations (i.e., MISR), and on reflectance simulations of natural surfaces (i.e., vegetation canopy and snow cover). In order to improve the current situation of frequent ambiguous usage of reflectance terms and quantities, we suggest standardizing the terminology in reflectance product descriptions and that the community carefully utilizes the proposed reflectance terminology in scientific publications.

Snapshot comparisons with spatially resolved retrievals from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) instruments flown on the Terra and Aqua polar platforms show qualitative agreement with SEVIRI retrievals. In addition to the generic aerosol model used in the NOAA/NESDIS algorithm, which was tuned to optimize retrievals over global ocean, three microphysical models, specifically proposed in the aerosol literature for desert dust, have also been tested. However, comparison of the diurnal variation seen in these SEVIRI retrievals with available ground based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations from two coastal stations suggests that the phase functions associated with two of these dust representations, obtained under the assumption of particle sphericity, result in unrealistic time dependent behaviour. This tendency is removed when either the generic aerosol representation used in the NOAA/NESDIS algorithm is employed, or a more physically based non-spherical dust representation is used.

However, estimation errors of relevant forest structure variables remain too high for operational use of high spatial resolution satellite imagery, such as Landsat TM/ETM and SPOT HRV, in temperate forests. Very high spatial resolution images that have been acquired by new commercial satellites, such as IKONOS-2 or QuickBird, are expected to reduce estimation errors to a level that is acceptable by foresters. This study assessed the capability of 1-m resolution IKONOS-2 imagery to estimate the five main forest variables-age, top height, circumference, stand density and basal area-in even-aged common spruce stands. They were estimated on the basis of texture features that were derived from the grey-level 1m-occurrence matrix (GLCM). The coefficients of determination, R-2, of the best models ranged from 0.76 to 0.82 for top height, circumference, stand density and age variables. Basal area was found to be weakly correlated to texture variables (R-2 =0.35). Relative prediction errors of four out of the five studied forest variables were comparable to the usual sampling inventory errors (top height: 10%; circumference: 15%; basal area: 16%; age: 18%), but the stand density estimation error (29%) remained too high for use in forest planning. The sensitivity analysis to the GLCM parameters showed that the most important parameters were the texture feature, the displacement and the window size. The orientation parameter had minimal effects on the R-2 values, even if it influenced the values of the texture features. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

A new approach for urban land-use classification, based on the combined use of impervious surface and population density, was developed. Five urban land-use classes (i.e., low-, medium-, high-, and very-high-intensity residential areas, and commercial/industrial/transportation uses) were developed in the city of Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. Results showed that the integration of fraction images and surface temperature provided substantially improved impervious surface image. Accuracy assessment indicated that the rootmean-square error and system error yielded 9.22% and 5.68%, respectively, for the impervious surface image. The overall classification accuracy of 83.78% for five urban land-use classes was obtained. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

With a temporal resolution of 15 min MSG offers complementary information for NDVI monitoring compared to vegetation monitoring based on polar orbiting satellites. The improved temporal resolution has potential implications for accurate NDVI assessment of the African continent; e.g. the increased amount of available scenes are expected to help overcome problems related to cloud cover which makes the MSG data particularly well suited for early warning systems. Time series of 2004 MSG NDVI was compared to MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Terra and Aqua NDVI for the Dahra site in the Senegalese Sahel, West Africa. It was found that NDVI was available for 82 days with multiple cloud free acquisitions per day during the growing season as compared to 47 days with information from either MODIS Terra or Aqua for that particular site. Differences in MSG SEVIRI and MODIS BRDF on a seasonal scale were found to influence the time series of NDVI for the test site; MSG NDVI being higher than MODIS in July-August and lower in October-November. Preliminary composite analysis suggests that the period of compositing to produce continent scale cloud free products can be reduced to similar to 5 days using MSG NDVI as compared to polar orbiting data. With the availability of diurnal reflectance information the significance of differences between the red and near-infrared wavelengths due to anisotropy become evident, causing diurnal variations in observed NDVI. Diurnal MSG NDVI was compared to in situ measured MSG NDVI at the test site in Senegal and the same \"bowl-shaped\" diurnal curve was found for a medium dense cover of annual grasses. The range in observed NDVI and time of diurnal minimum was different due to different viewing geometry. Daily minimum of in situ measured NDVI was around solar noon whereas minimum MSG NDVI occurs one hour prior to noon due to the test site location 12 degrees west of the satellite sensor. Diurnal variation in observed NDVI was studied for a number of pixels characterized by different sensor view zenith angles and vegetation types. This analysis illustrated the diurnal NDVI dependency of illumination conditions, view angle and vegetation intensity and pinpoints the importance of proper BRDF modeling to produce daily values of MSG NDVI normalized for acquisition time, which will be the subject of a forthcoming paper.

For line scanners these gradients Occur in across-track direction and depend on the sensor\'s view-angle. They are greatest whenever the flight path is perpendicular to the sun-target-observer plane. A common way to correct these gradients is to normalize the reflectance factors to nadir view. This is especially complicated for data from spatially and spectrally heterogeneous urban areas and requires surface type specific models. This paper presents a class-wise empirical approach that is adapted to meet the needs of such images.   Within this class-wise approach, empirical models are fit to the brightness gradients of spectrally pure pixels from classes after a spectral angle mapping (SAM). Compensation factors resulting from these models are then assigned to all pixels of the image, both in a discrete manner according the SAM and in a weighted manner based on information from the SAM rule images. The latter scheme is designed in consideration of the great number of mixed pixels.   The method is tested oil data from the Hyperspectral Mapper (HyMap) that was acquired over Berlin, Germany. It proves superior to a common global approach based on a thorough assessment using a second HyMap image as reference. The weighted assignment of compensation factors is adequate for the correction of areas that are characterized by mixed pixels.   A remainder of the original brightness gradient cannot be found in the corrected image, which can then be used for any subsequent qualitative and quantitative analyses. Thus, the proposed method enables the comparison and composition of airborne data sets with similar recording conditions and does not require additional field or laboratory measurements.

The results suggest that it may be possible to successfully reprocess historical AVHRR data sets to provide continuity of NDVI products through future sensor systems. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Laser data were acquired under leaf-on and leaf-off canopy conditions. The plots covered stand conditions from young forest to mature forest. The plots were divided into two categories, i.e., coniferous forest dominated by spruce and pine, and mixed forest with an average proportion of deciduous species of 31-42%. Height percentiles, mean and maximum height values, coefficients of variation of the heights, and canopy density at different height intervals above the ground were computed from the laser-derived canopy height distributions. In the mixed forest, corresponding metrics derived from the two laser data acquisitions were compared. In general, canopy metrics derived from the last returns were more affected by canopy conditions than the first return data. Furthermore, canopy height measures of the lower and intermediate parts of the canopy were more affected than maximum canopy height, and the variability of the height distribution tended to increase from leaf-on to leaf-off conditions. The coniferous plots were used to demonstrate to what extent canopy properties derived from airborne lasers may be affected by sensor-specific characteristics. The same laser system was used during the two acquisitions, but the repetition frequency was upgraded from 10 to 33 kHz in between the two missions. Comparison of the two acquisitions showed that the first return measurements of canopy height tended to be unaffected or shifted somewhat upwards by system upgrade and ground penetration was reduced, whereas the last return data indicated unaffected or downwards shifted canopy heights and increased penetration.

The determination of the related inherent optical properties from remote sensing is addressed for a site located in the northern Adriatic Sea using coincident SeaWiFS images and field measurements. The proposed methodology first combines regional algorithms to determine the spectra of irradiance reflectance and diffuse attenuation coefficient from the normalized water leaving radiance by accounting for the bidirectional structure of the light field. These spectra are then used as inputs to an inverse model that yields the absorption, scattering, and backscattering coefficients of seawater (considered without the contribution of pure water). The uncertainties associated with the different steps in the sequence of calculations are quantified and discussed. Specifically, the analysis of 48 match-ups comparing in situ irradiance reflectance with that derived from remote sensing water leaving radiance shows mean absolute differences below 20% between 490 and 555 nm and approximately 30% at 443 and 670 nm. Lower discrepancies are obtained if more stringent criteria for the selection of match-ups are implemented (12-15% and 20-22%, respectively). The results obtained with 42 matchups show a reasonable agreement for the absorption coefficient from 412 to 490 nm (approximately 35%), the scattering coefficient from 443 to 555 nm (approximately 30%), and the attenuation coefficient in the spectral range 412-555 nm (approximately 30%). Based on 17 matchups, the comparison for the backscattering coefficient gives mean absolute differences in the range of 31-53%. The comparison between field and derived scattering properties suggests that the particulate scattering phase function inherent to the inverse model is not appropriate for the site considered. Finally, in the framework of the selected inversion scheme, uncertainties associated with the satellite derived irradiance reflectance in the blue and the determination of K-d at 490 tun through an empirical band ratio algorithm appear as the elements where improvements would be particularly needed to derive high quality spectra of inherent optical properties.

Optical remote sensing techniques can help address this need by providing accurate, consistent, and reliable approximations of photosynthetic activity at large scales. However, converting photosynthetic activity into NPP requires estimates of light-use efficiency, which has been shown to vary among vegetation types. In this study. we compare remotely sensed estimates of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation with ground-based NPP estimates to determine appropriate light-use efficiency values for grasslands and croplands. We contrast the performance of models with and without information about vegetation type and light-use efficiency downregulation due to unfavorable environmental conditions. Our results suggest that: 1) current models may include overestimates of grassland light-use efficiency; 2) including vegetation information in light-use efficiency calculations causes a dramatically better fit between ground-based and remotely sensed estimates of primary production, and 3) incorporating environmental downregulation to light-use efficiency yields only minor improvements, which may be a result specific to annual estimates in grassland and cropland systems. In addition, this study presents a regional dataset of ground-based primary production estimates that may prove useful for future studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Structural features of forests can serve as useful indicators of forest condition and have the potential to be assessed with remotely sensed imagery, which can provide quantitative information on forest ecosystems at high temporal and spatial resolutions. Herein, we investigate the utility of remote sensing for assessing, predicting and mapping two important forest structural features, stem density and basal area, in tropical, littoral forests in southeastern Madagascar. We analysed the relationships of basal area and stem density measurements to the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and radiance measurements in bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 from the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). Strong relationships were identified among all of the individual bands and field based measurements of basal area (p<0.01) while there were weak and insignificant relationships among spectral response and stem density measurements. NDVI was not significantly correlated with basal area but was strongly and significantly correlated with stem density (r=-0.69, p<0.01) when using a subset of the data, which represented extreme values. We used an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict basal area from radiance values in bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 and to produce a predictive map of basal area for the entire forest landscape. The ANNs produced strong and significant relationships between predicted and actual measures of basal area using a jackknife method (r=0.79, p<0.01) and when using a larger data set (r=0.82, p<0.01). The map of predicted basal area produced by the ANN was assessed in relation to a pre-existing map of forest condition derived from a semi-quantitative field assessment. The predictive map of basal area provided finer detail on stand structural heterogeneity, captured known climatic influences on forest structure and displayed trends of basal area associated with degree of human accessibility. These findings demonstrate the utility of ANNs for integrating satellite data from the Landsat ETM+ spectral bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 with limited field survey data to assess patterns in basal area at the landscape scale.

Lichen is a primary food source for caribou and is a good indicator of caribou herd activity because of its sensitivity to overgrazing and overtrampling, its widespread distribution over northern areas, and its influence on herd demography. In this paper, we used Landsat TM imagery for mapping lichen in the summer range of the George River caribou herd in northern Quebec, Canada. Results from the enhancement-classification method (ECM) and from spectral mixture analysis (SMA) were evaluated for their suitability to characterize lichen land cover and for their potential to be applied over large territories. ECM and SMA are assessed individually and also for potential synergistic use. ECM is based on guided unsupervised classification of enhanced satellite images. Validation based on 3536 pixels from a relatively smaller number of field sites (20) showed an overall accuracy of 74.5% (kappa=0.70) for 10 classes and good discrimination between lichen and nonlichen classes, although we interpret these results with caution due to spatial autocorrelation and nonrandom sampling within field sites. However, discrimination amongst different lichen classes using ECM was more problematic. SMA derives the proportion of individual scene components at subpixel scales. This method provided good results in characterizing variations in lichen abundance validated against field observations and provided additional and new information not provided by ECM which is important since the abundance of lichen as a primary food source is a key indicator of migration and demographic patterns essential for effective wildlife management. We concluded that the ECM and SMA methods are appropriate for different aspects of lichen mapping. ECM provided good discrimination between lichen and nonlichen classes, whereas SMA provided additional lichen information not available by classification yet critical to the environmental application, which is also appropriate for application over much larger areas and in spatiotemporal studies. A synergistic use of SMA and ECM is therefore recommended for future research. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', 'Univ Laval, Dept Geog, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.

Here, we used kernel density interpolation to convert the original data on wildland fire ignition into an expression of areal units, defined by a raster grid and, subsequently, by the administrative borders of the municipalities in two study areas in Spain.

However, there were I I days during this study period when MODIS measured AOD at the site, but the MFRSR did not due to excessive cloud cover. There were also 7 days when clear skies prevailed at the site during the time of MODIS overpass, but there was no AOD retrieved by MODIS. Surface measurements of fine particle (PM2.5) mass, chemical composition, and optical properties were also performed during summer 2001. A good correlation (R = 0.87) between fine particle mass and AOD measured by the MFRSR was observed. A comparison between fine particle light extinction at the surface and MFRSR AOD (at the same wavelength) also showed good agreement (R = 0.80).

We compared traditional CTA results to SGB for three remote sensing based data sets, an IKONOS image front the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California, a Probe-1 hyperspectral image from the Virginia City mining district of Montana, and a series of Landsat ETM+ images from the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). SGB improved the overall accuracy of the IKONOS classification from 84% to 95% and the Probe-1 classification from 83% to 93%. The worst performing classes using CTA exhibited the largest increases in class accuracy using SGB. A slight decrease in overall classification accuracy resulted from the SGB analysis of the Landsat data. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Although many studies have been conducted to estimate moisture in bare soil fields with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, little success has been achieved in vegetated areas. The purpose of this study is to extract soil moisture in sparsely to moderately vegetated rangeland surfaces with ERS-2/TM synergy. We developed an approach to first reduce the surface roughness effect by using the temporal differential backscatter coefficient (Deltasigma(wet-dry)(0)). Then an optical/microwave synergistic model was built to simulate the relationship among soil moisture, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Deltasigma(wet-dry)(0). With NDVI calculated from TM imagery in wet seasons and Deltasigma(wet-dry)(0) from ERS-2 imagery in wet and dry seasons, we derived the soil moisture maps over desert grass and shrub areas in wet seasons. The results showed that in the semiarid rangeland, radar backscatter was positively correlated to NDVI when soil was dry (m(v) < 10%), and negatively correlated to NDVI when soil moisture was higher (m(v)>10%). The approach developed in this study is valid for sparse to moderate vegetated areas. When the vegetation density is higher (NDVI>0.45), the SAR backscatter is mainly from vegetation layer and therefore the soil moisture estimation is not possible in this study. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The method combines the advantages of automated multispectral classification for clean glacier ice and vegetation with slope information derived from a digital elevation model (DEM). Neighbourhood analysis and change detection is applied for further improvement of the resulting glacier/debris map. A significant percentage of the processing can be done automatically. In order to test the sensitivity of our method against different DEM qualities, it was also applied to a DEM obtained from ASTER stereo data.

We found the IKONOS imagery to be a valuable resource for these applications, and were able to achieve map accuracies comparable to manual aerial photo interpretation. We were also able to use derived data sets for consistent assessments over areas that would be difficult to accomplish with traditional photographic mapping methods. For example, we found that a stream health rating of excellent required no more than 6% impervious cover in the watershed, and at least 65% tree cover in the riparian zone. A rating of good required less than 10% impervious and 60% tree cover. A number of issues associated with application of the IKONOS data arose, however, including logistics of image acquisition related to phenological and atmospheric conditions, shadowing within canopies and between scene elements, and limited spectral discrimination of cover types. Cost per unit area was also a nontrivial consideration for the image data products we used, but allowed us to provide valuable derived products to agencies in support of their planning and regulatory decision-making processes.

There were several notable findings from these applications. For example, modeling and estimation approaches developed for Landsat TM data for continuous variables such as take water clarity and impervious surface area can be applied to high-resolution satellite data. The rapid delivery of spatial data can be coupled with current GPS and field computer technologies to bring the imagery into the field for cover type validation. We also found several limitations in working with this data type. For example, shadows can influence feature classification and their effects need to be evaluated. Nevertheless, high-resolution satellite data has excellent potential to extend satellite remote sensing beyond what has been possible with aerial photography and Landsat data, and should be of interest to resource managers as a way to create timely and reliable assessments of land and water resources at a local scale.

Thus, there is a need of methods aimed at classifying many one-dimensional signals, such as airborne laser profiles, on the basis of their spatial structure. The present paper proposes a theoretical framework ensuring a consistent combination of a multi-scale pattern characterization, based on the Haar wavelet variance (also called in ecology Two Terms Local Variance, TTLV), with two multivariate techniques such as principal components analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis. We illustrate our approach by comparing and classifying 257 laser profiles, with a length of 64 measurements (448 m), that were collected by the BRGM in French Guiana over three main landscape units with distinct geomorphological and ecological characteristics. We calculate for each profile a scalogram that summarized the multi-scale pattern and analyze the structural variability of profiles via a typology and a classification of one-dimensional patterns. More than 80% of the variability between spatial patterns of laser profiles has been summarized by two PCA axes, while four classes of spatial patterns were identified by cluster analysis. Each landscape unit was associated with one or two dominant classes of spatial patterns. These results confirmed the ability of the method to extract landscape scaling properties from complex and large sets of remotely sensed data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

To optimise the use of this kind of data, the heterogeneity of the target and its effects on the radar measurements need to be investigated and modelled, particularly in the view of retrieving geophysical parameters. In this paper, wind scatterometer measurements over three different test sites, the NOPEX region in Sweden, the HAPEX-Sahel site in Niger and the Niger delta area in Nigeria, are analysed. For these regions, a forward model is developed by considering the backscatter contributions of the bare surface, the seasonal and evergreen vegetation and the open water areas. Colocated high spatial resolution SAR data and ground information are used to characterise the target scene. The model is then inverted to retrieve monthly soil roughness, dielectric properties and vegetation parameters. It is shown that the measurements contain enough information to characterise these three different regions and to monitor their temporal evolution. The retrieved values obtained for the bare surface and the vegetation parameters are consistent with ground measurements collected in these areas. Further improvements are achieved by incorporating the time scale variability of the variables investigated into the retrieval scheme. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Specifically, it was determined that this multiscaling behavior is consistent with the scaling of soil hydraulic properties and vegetation cover, while the multifractal behavior is associated with the temporal evolution of soil moisture fields. Here, we apply these findings by directly incorporating information on the spatial structure of soil texture and vegetation water content to the spatial interpolation of remotely sensed soil moisture data.   A downscaling model is presented which consists of a modified fractal interpolation method based on contraction mapping. This methodology is different from other fractal interpolation schemes because it generates unique fractal surfaces. It is different from other contraction mapping models because it includes spatially and temporally varying scaling functions as opposed to single-valued scaling factors. The scaling functions are linear combinations of the spatial distributions of ancillary data.

Problems induced by mixed pixels were reduced since the ground spatial resolution was 20 m. First, linear kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models were used to retrieve the BRDF and then to compute the hemispherical reflectance in the PolDER channels. We tested the four most classical models: Li-Ross, MRPV, Roujean. and Walthall. They presented similar interpolation performances, whereas the quality of the hemispherical reflectance estimates was also driven by the extrapolation performances. Second, the albedo was computed as a linear combination of the waveband hemispherical reflectances. We used several sets of coefficients proposed in the literature for different sensors. The validation of the albedo maps against field measurements showed that it was possible to achieve a relative accuracy about 9% when using an appropriate coefficient set.

Two fires were analyzed: the Malibu Topanga fire (3 November 1993) and the Calabasas fire (21 October 1996). SMA was compared to the results of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to assess vegetation recovery. An unburned control plot (within the past 20 years), having similar environmental features, was used to generate two relative fire regeneration indices, Regeneration Index (RI) and Normalized Regeneration Index (NRI). Indices were calculated using the Green Vegetation (GV) endmember and the NDVI. These indices were determined to be largely independent of AVIRIS radiometric calibration uncertainty, minor errors in the atmospheric correction, topographic distortions. and differences in the phenological state of the vegetation because of interannual or seasonal differences. The temporal evolution of the two fires were combined to produce a longer observation period and used to fit a logarithmic regression model for each Mediterranean shrub community. The NRI developed from the GV endmember (NRIGV) produced the closest estimate for the time of recovery in both communities based on recovery times in the literature. The use of NDVI worked very well for recovery in the northern mixed chaparral, but was less successful in the coastal sage scrub, mainly because of extensive herbaceous cover during the first years of the regeneration process. Endmembers, generated from hyperspectral images were more accurate because they are tuned to capture the greenness of the shrub type of vegetation. Use of matching plots having similar environmental features, but which were burned in different years were demonstrated to improve estimates of the recovery within each community.

To investigate this problem, we developed a neural network approach for simultaneous retrieval of cloud parameters of inhomogeneous clouds with fractional cloud cover. We defined a simple inverse inhomogeneous cloud model with four parameters: mean optical depth, effective radius, relative cloud inhomogeneity and fractional cloud cover. The retrieval algorithm, based on the use of a mapping neural network (MNN) with two hidden layers, was implemented and tested with synthetic multispectral reflectance data prepared for 2D clouds generated with a modified bounded cascade cloud model. We found that these cloud parameters could be retrieved from the moderate-resolution multispectral reflectance data with reasonable accuracy: for example with our data base, optical depth has a root mean square error of 1.7 for an ensemble of 1000 samples with optical depth up to 30, However. this accuracy depends on measurements errors and noises. A comparison with plan-parallel hypothesis shows the expected improvement of such an inhomogeneous cloud model. We show that the relevance of these cloud parameters is a function of the horizontal scale of averaging due to the net horizontal photon transport to and from adjacent cloud pixels. We tested the inclusion of ancillary data (reflectance of the neighbouring pixels) into the retrieval algorithm, and showed that the use of these ancillary data could partially correct the modeling error and significantly improve the performance of cloud parameter retrieval.

The RBVC method yields a new set of radiometric coefficients that convert the hyperspectral data from digital numbers (DNs) to radiances, and that are applicable to flight lines taken under different conditions. For both the Raglan and the Goose Bay projects, the calibration site was a gravel airstrip, and ground-based reflectance measurements were made with a GER3700 field spectrometer using a Spectralon panel for reference. This represents a novel use of the RBVC method for validation and correction of the sensor\'s radiometric calibration at the time of data acquisition, applied in an operational setting that lacks a large, bright and homogeneous calibration tal get and well-characterized atmospheric conditions.

Because water has such a low reflectance, sources of radiance other than the water-leaving radiance contribute significantly to the at-sensor radiance and vary with wavelength and spatially. While radiative transfer models have improved significantly, there are still large uncertainties in prescribing the spatial and spectral properties of aerosol scattering. In addition, errors in the sensor calibration of radiance can lead to additional uncertainty. An atmospheric correction method based entirely on scene information, but not in situ data, is described. This approach accounts for nonuniform aerosol scattering, glint from the water surface, and reflected skylight. Normalization by an estimate of the direct solar irradiance reaching the surface, also derived from scene information, then provides an estimate of reflectance. This method is applied to AVIRIS data acquired over a temperate estuary. The resultant reflectance estimates are shown to be consistent with field observations. While the method is empirical, it is based on physical principles that allow it to be applied under a wide range of conditions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

In order to reduce the confounding effects of surface roughness on soil moisture inversion, the application of multifrequency SAR systems have shown promise.

End member spectra for green vegetation (GVd), nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), water (W), and the three soil types were selected by inspecting scatter plots derived from the principal components analysis (PCA) of 140 AVIRIS bands. They were then used to compose a six end member unmixing model to characterize the spectral reflectance variations associated with the different scene components, the spatial distribution of the soil types, and the effects of spectral mixing on the spectral-chemical composition relationships. Finally, regression equations fitted to soil constituents and their highly correlated spectral bands were used to produce maps showing the chemical variability in the scene for areas dominated by the presence of exposed soils, as indicated by the results from the unmixing model. The results showed a very good agreement between the spatial variability of the soil types and of the soil constituents. The largest squared correlation results were obtained for Fe2O3, TiO2, and Al2O3, but the relationships were affected in the transition from the red to the near-infrared interval by the presence of nonsoil residues (e.g., senescent vegetation or litter) over the soil surfaces. In comparison with the light and loamy sand S-AQ, the dark-red clay S-TE and S-LE presented higher contents of Fe2O3, Al2O3, and TiO2, and consequently lower overall reflectance in the scene, because of the presence of greater amounts of opaque minerals. The prediction of these constituents from remote sensing data and their close association with the spatial distribution of the different soil types demonstrate the importance of the present investigation for soil mapping and soil erosion studies.

Actual measured reflectance spectra from field work are used as input data. Four coral species are considered, to survey the natural range of coral reflectance: Montastrea cavernosa, Acropora palmata, Dichocoenia stokesii, and Siderastrea siderea. Four noncoral objects associated with reefs are also considered: sand, coralline algae, green macroalgae, and algal turf. The reflectance spectra as would be measured at the top of the atmosphere are substantially different from the in situ spectra, due to differential attenuation by the water column and, most importantly, by atmospheric Rayleigh scattering. The result is that many of the spectral features that can be used to distinguish coral species from their surroundings or from one another, which have been used successfully with surface or aircraft data, would be obscured in spectral measurements from a spacecraft. However, above the atmosphere, the radiance contrasts between most coral species and most brighter noncoral objects remain noticeable for water column depths up to 20 m. Over many spectral intervals, the reflectance from dark coral under shallow water is smaller than that of deep water. The maximum top-of-atmosphere radiances, and maximum contrasts between scene types, occur between 400 nm and 600 nm. This study supports the conclusions of recent satellite reef mapping exercises, suggesting that coral reef identification should be feasible using satellite remote sensing, but that detailed reef mapping (e.g., species identification) may be more difficult.

This is a continuation of the paper where relationships at the leaf level between leaf reflectance and chlorophyll fluorescence were found and demonstrated to the consistent with theory using the Fluorescence-Reflectance-Transmittance (FRT) model. Experiments using the hyperspectral CASI sensor in the laboratory to observe a canopy of maple seedlings are performed as an intermediate step to demonstrate the link between the results at leaf-level and the CASI field canopy levels. Scene observations of the seedling utilizing a long-pass blocking filter showed that apparent canopy reflectance in the laboratory is affected by changes in fluorescence emissions. A laboratory experiment on seedlings on seedlings subjected to diurnally induced change shows the strong link between CASI canopy reflectance optical indices in the 680-690-nm region and Fv/Vm dark-adapted chlorophyll fluorescence. Stressed and healthy maple seedlings are used to demonstrate the use of optical indices calculated from the 680-690-nm spectral region to track changes in steady-state fluorescence: the curvature index R6832/(R675-691) and the R685/R655 ratio calculated from the canopy reflectance are related to leaf-measured Ft, Fm\' and DeltaF/Fm\' steady-state features, and are in agreement with theoretical simulations using the leaf Fluorescence-Reflectance-Transmittance model. To test these findings in a field setting, airborne field hyperspectral CASI data of 2-m spatial resolution, 7.5-nm spectral resolution, and 72 channels was used, collected in deployments over 12 sites of Acer saccharum M. in the Algoma Region, Ontario (Canada) in 1997 and 1998. A field sampling campaign was carried out for biochemical contents of leaf chlorophyll and carotenoids, chlorophyll fluorescence, and leaf reflectance and transmittance. Leaf-level relationships obtained between optical indices and physiological indicators were scaled up to canopy level through canopy reflectance models using input model parameters related to the canopy structure and viewing geometry at the time of data acquisition. Results show that scaled-up optical indices in the 680-690-nm region are related to Fv/Fm chlorophyll fluorescence measured in the 20x20-m study sites. Consistency between leaf, laboratory, and field canopy hyperspectral data is shown in this and the previous paper, demonstrating the effect of fluorescence on observations of apparent vegetation reflectance.

The data used were obtained by the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) with a spatial resolution of 2 m over the flux tower sites in the BOREAS study area in the winter of 1994 and in the summer of 1996. The FLIM (Forest-Light Interaction Model) was adapted to describe the reflectance properties of the boreal forest canopies investigated by considering the effect of the ellipticity of the conifer crowns on shadows and crown transmittance. The LAI and canopy closure images were produced for the flux tower sites investigated from the CASI winter images using the modified FLIM. Visual evaluation shows that the spatial patterns shown in the canopy LAI and canopy closure images are consistent with those exhibited by the color composite CASI images for the same sites. The canopy LAI images were further validated by field-measured LAI along specific transects. The R-2 between the retrieved canopy LAI and the field-measured LAI ranges from 0.51 to 0.86 for the sites investigated. Furthermore, the CASI summer image over the Old Black Spruce site in the BOREAS souther study area (SOBS) was used to investigate the effect of the understory reflectance on the retrieval of the canopy LAI. The R-2 between the field-measured LAI and the retrieved LAI is 0.27, under the assumption that the reflectance is uniform for each understory vegetation in the SOBS site. the R-2 increases to 0.78 when the understory reflectance is allowed to vary within the range of variability as determined by field measurements. This result conforms to the sensitivity analysis result in which the at-canopy reflectance is expressed as a function of the understory reflectance at the CASI viewing geometry. The results imply that it is questionable to assume a uniform understory reflectance in canopy model inversions in the boreal forest summer scenes.

There are several modulation transfer functions between SAR images and the actual periodic surface parameters, and the image brightness is sensitive to the local incidence angle. According to previous studies, a linear mapping process can describe these modulation processes. This study proposes an algorithm for estimating the linear dune features including linear dune direction (the prevailing wind direction), interdune spacing, and rms slope and dune height from SAR images. To estimate rms slope, two algorithms were developed, a local incidence angle method and a modulation transfer function method. The linear dune height was then calculated based on the rms slope of the surface. Finally, the obtained results were compared with the truth data from field investigations. The estimated physical quantities did not completely agree with the truth data, and possible error sources are discussed.

K. Fung and colleagues, without the need to prescribe time-varying land-surface attributes as constraining parameters. Specifically, the dependence of backscatter coefficients obtained from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) on the soil dielectric constant, surface-roughness height, and correlation length was investigated. The IEM was used in conjunction with an inversion model to retrieve soil moisture by using multifrequency and multipolarization data (L-, C-, and X-bands) simultaneously. The results were cross validated with gravimetric observations obtained during the Washita \'94 field experiment in the Little Washita Watershed, Oklahoma. The average error in the estimated soil moisture was of the order of 3.4%, which is comparable to that expected due to noise in the SAR data. The retrieval algorithm performed very well for low incidence angles and over bare soil fields, and it deteriorated slightly for vegetated areas and overall for very dry soil conditions. Although the original IEM model was developed for bare soil conditions only, one important result of this study was the fact that the retrieval algorithm performed well for vegetated conditions, as demonstrated by the fact that the convergence ratio varied between 92% (dry conditions) and 98% (wet conditions) of all pixels for all days of the experiment. The sensitivity of soil-moisture estimates to spatial aggregation of remote-sensing data before and after the retrieval also was investigated. The results suggest that there is potential to improve the operational utility of high-resolution SAR data for soil-moisture monitoring by compressing the SAR data (pre-aggregation) to a spatial resolution at least one order of magnitude above that of measurement.

A simple reflectance model is presented. Scattering is treated by Mie theory applied to a collection of particles of real refractive index m(p) and obeying a Jungle size distribution law. A sensitivity study performed on the model shows that both concentration ann refractive index and both cutoff particle diameters of the Junge size distribution law cannot be accurately determined from a given reflectance spectrum. Two model parameters, among a total of six, are estimated from model inversion: m(p) and a parameter characterizing the yellow substance absorption spectrum, a(y0)=a(y) (440 nm). The derived values are realistic as compared to the values that can be found in literature. Other combinations of parameters could be determined by inversion but measurement of m(p) and a(y0) from reflectance spectra already has interesting applications in a satellite remote sensing perspective. Increasing the number of parameters of the model is feasible, but much work is needed to envisage the inverse problem.

The effects of the atmosphere on the indices were also examined, using the 6S atmospheric code, and a short section is devoted to an analysis of Landsat Thematic Mapper data. Overall, the indices were not linear with respect to forest cover and, in many situations, an index did not have a unique value for a given cover The general form of the indices\' responses to changes in cover could be explained by shadowing effects, linked to the heterogeneous nature of forest. The indices were also significantly affected by perturbations including solar zenith angle, background reflectance, stand structure, and leaf-area index. The relative importance of these perturbations depended on both the cover and on the particular spectral index tested. Existing indices should be selected according to the characteristics of the site under investigation, since no single index performed well over all covers. At low covers, GEMI performed best, where a decrease in the value of GEMI corresponded to an increase in crown cover. There was some evidence that the soil-adjusted indices (PVI, SAVI, TSAVI, and GEMI) partially reduced background reflectance effects in the data, although the reductions were not always associated with increased sensitivity to crown;. cover. At high covers, SAVI and TSAVI were found to perform best, since these indices had large dynamic ranges and small susceptibility to atmospheric perturbations.

Within these defined limits, variations in solar and viewing angles introduced no more than 4% systematic (and rectifiable)error in estimation of crop canopy cover while errors associated with atmospheric correction were of a similar magnitude. Although sugar beet has large leaves close to the ground and was expected to generate a large hot spot effect, the effect of ;uncertainty in leaf size appears to be negligible. Leaf angle distribution is effectively accounted for by the use of crop cover as an index of productivity, except when the crop is wilting, but this is unlikely to occur in sugar beet at the time of satellite overpass. Subject to the uncertainties of modeling, the estimation of crop canopy cover within an absolute error of 5% appears to be achievable.

This method has been applied over sea surfaces and over land on two databases. The first dataset contains AVHRR/NOAA9 and ATSR-IR/ERS1 data coincident with radio soundings over Europe (land areas). The second one includes ATSR-IR images and water vapor content estimations derived from the microwave radiometer ATSR-MW on board ERS1 over the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. The results show the necessity of using two different algorithms: one for land and another for sea pixels because of the effects of surface emissivity.

A region grouping algorithm was applied to these three regression estimate images to identify the limits of the forest stands.

Preliminary application of the proposed method to real images acquired with the MEIS-II airborne sensor yielded good segmentation and per stand structure estimates. Some errors were generated due to the fact that the moving window sometimes overlapped two different forest stands because of the presence of areas covered by nonforest vegetation or human made structures.

Microwave data were acquired by the airborne multifrequency radiometer PORTOS (5 GHz, 10.6 GHz, 23.8 GHz, 36.5 GHz, and 90 GHz) over a test site in Les Landes Forest (France). The test site consists of large homogeneous stands of maritime pines (Pinus pinaster). The stands are monospecies and even-aged and cover a large range of age and biomass conditions (the above-ground dry biomass ranges from 0 to about 180 tons/ha). The stands were flown over twice in May and August 1994. The microwave response to the coniferous stand characteristics is analyzed. A statistical study is carried out to investigate the potential interest of the PORTOS data to discriminate between the different stand categories. The sensitivity of the stand emissivity to view angle, frequency, measurement date, and stand characteristics is analyzed. If is found that the range of forest stand microwave emissivity is relatively narrow for a vegetation coverage exceeding 95%. Although different stand categories can be distinguished from the PORTOS data, the level of discrimination is not sufficient to allow the development of accurate rules of classification. No relationship could be found between low frequency measurements and the stand biovolume. On the other hand, a linear negative relationship is found between emissivity at 10.6 GHz and average tree variables of the stands (age, height, trunk diameter) for well-developed pine stands. Also, potential interest of PORTOS to estimate forest stand characteristics seems to be significant at 90 GHz. For this frequency channel, good correlation is found between emissivity and tree basal area B-A. The results presented in this work contribute to better assess the potential applications of the future ESA/MIMR instrument over coniferous areas.

Because radar backscatter is sensitive to surface roughness, it is possible to map relative surface age using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. We have examined surface roughness estimates in Death Valley from Shuttle Imaging Radar-C SAR data with the use of a technique that we call fore ground/background analysis (FBA), with the goal of establishing a robust inversion method that is extendible to a range of surfaces and conditions. In this method, a foreground entity (in this case roughness) is distinguished from complicating background factors (including the distribution of intermediate-scale slopes, vegetation, and dielectric constant). The inversion for roughness is non-unique even when constrained by the use of field measurements. When the range of possible selections is examined it is observed that they fall into a small number of domains, each with distinct characteristics that are probably associated with physical factors such as the scale of roughness. Solutions were compared with those determined from the semiempirical (SEM) and integral equation (IEM) models, and all selections were evaluated with respect to field knowledge. The SEM and IEM solutions, and those obtained using FBA together with the field measurements, fall into a common domain of solutions that are susceptible to contamination by background effects and hence may not be extendible to other geographic locations. A domain of stable solutions that are more extendible does exist; however, this extendibility is achieved at the expense of reduced resolution of roughness levels. For Death Valley, we estimate that it is possible to resolve only four levels of roughness, which is far fewer than can be theoretically resolved with existing inversion algorithms.

The rationale for the coupling of the two models was to assess the dependency of these differences on changing surface conditions (i.e., growing vegetation). A simulation was carried out for a 3-month period corresponding to a typical growth seasonal cycle of an herbaceous canopy in the Sahel region of West Africa (Goutorbe et al., 1993). The results showed that the ratio of radiative-aerodynamic temperature difference to radiative-air temperature difference was constant for a given day. However, the seasonal trend of this ratio was changing with respect to the leaf area index (LAI). A parameterization involving radiative surface temperature, air temperature, and LAI was then developed to estimate aerodynamic-air temperature gradient, and thus sensible heat flux. This parameterization was validated using data collected over herbaceous site during the Hapex-Sahel experiment. This approach was further advanced by using a radiative transfer model in conjunction with the above models to simulate the temporal behavior of surface reflectances in the visible and the near-infrared spectral bands. The result showed that sensible heat flux can be fairly accurately estimated by combining remotely sensed surface temperature, air temperature, and spectral vegetation index. The result of this study may represent a great opportunity of using remotely sensed data to estimate spatiotemporal variabilities of surface fluxes in arid and semiarid regions.

Surface temperatures can be determined from radiance measurements in both the 3-5 mum and 8-14 mum atmospheric windows, given some estimate of surface emissivity. The 3-5 mum region offers a potential advantage in the accuracy of temperature determination, because temperature estimates are more than two times less sensitive to emissivity errors in this region. However, very little is known about the emissivities of land surface materials in the 3-5 mum region, If emissivities were more variable in the 3-5 mum region than in the 8-14 mum region, this might cancel the advantage of lower sensitivity to emissivity error in the shorter wavelength region. This article documents the directional hemispherical spectral reflectance, from which emissivity can be calculated, of a wide variety of earth surface materials in the 3-5 mum region, and compares their average reflectances in AVHRR Band 3 (3.55-3.93 mum) to that in Bands 4 (10.3-11.3 mum) and 5 (11.5-12.5 mum). It appears from these data that, based on natural variations in emissivity of different surface materials, AVHRR Band 5 is best used for temperature remote sensing of rocks, soils, and senescent vegetation, while Band 3 is best for green vegetation and water. Band 4 is preferred for thermal remote sensing of ice, especially rough ice. Emissivity and reflectivity in the 3-5 mum region affect other significant remote sensing measurements of global change besides those of surface temperature alone. The accuracy of atmospheric sounding of CO near 4.7 mum, for example, depends in part on knowledge of such surface properties to account for surface upwelling radiation. Because of the multiple uses to which our data can be put, digital records of all spectra used in the figures are available from 2.01 mum to 14 mum upon request.RP SALISBURY, JW (通讯作者)，JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV,DEPT EARTH & PLANETARY SCI,34TH & CHARLES ST,BALTIMORE,MD 21218, USA.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 26, 170, 178, 1, 30, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Correlation analysis showed that TM Band 4 (near infrared) accounted for 78 % of the variability in percent trees (r = -0.88). In multiple regression, percent trees, total soil loss, and percent total nonliving cover together accounted for nearly 70 % of the variability in TM Bands 2, 3, 4, and 5. TM spectral data were consistently better predictors of soil erosion factors than any combination of field factors. TM data were more sensitive to vegetation variations than the USLE C factor.

Direct measurements of rate of soil loss using the SEDIMENT (Soil Erosion DIrect measureMENT) technique, indicated high and varying rates of soil loss among the sites since tree establishment. Erosion estimates from the USLE and SEDIMENT methods suggest that erosion rates have been severe in the past, but because significant amounts of soil have already been eroded, and the surface is now armored by rock debris, present erosion rates are lower. Indicators of accelerated erosion were still present on all sites, however, suggesting that the USLE underestimated erosion within the study area.

This correlation was statistically significant and constant from 450 to 900 nm, but the rate of change in the spectral reflectance with TSS concentration peaked in the red region of the spectrum.RP NOVO, EMLM (通讯作者)，INST PESQUISAS ESPACIAIS,DEPT APLICRACOES & TRANSFERENCIA,CP 515,BR-12201 SAO JOSE CAMPOS,SP,BRAZIL.RI Novo, Evlyn/M-6883-2016', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Novo, Evlyn/0000-0002-1223-9276', NULL, NULL, 26, 37, 44, 1, 3, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

They also play important roles in climate and biogeochemical cycles, including through nutrient deposition in the ocean. Volcanic ash studies in the ocean have focused on the phytoplankton response, generally quantifying changes in chlorophyll-a concentration. Many gaps remain in addressing fundamental questions regarding why volcanic ash deposition may enhance or limit both phytoplankton growth and/or drive community composition shifts. Here we outline a wide, multidisciplinary vision for monitoring volcanic eruptions near ocean ecosystems from satellites, including considerations for characteristics of airborne volcanic ash and ash geochemistry in seawater. Ultimately, observations beyond chlorophyll-a are needed to quantify phytoplankton communities (including harmful algal blooms) and possible impacts across higher trophic levels. We synthesize relevant research from volcanic studies as well as atmospheric and ocean sciences to identify the \'known unknowns\' in ash-ecosystem studies. Our goal is to move toward an improved understanding of how real-time and near-realtime monitoring of volcanic eruptions can help address societally relevant questions.', '[Bisson, K.

The automated operational monitoring of icebergs remains challenging, largely due to a lack of generality in existing approaches. Previous efforts to map icebergs have often exploited synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data but the majority are designed for open water situations, require significant operator input, and are susceptible to the substantial spatial and temporal variability in backscatter that characterises SAR time-series. We propose an adaptive unsupervised classification procedure based on Sentinel 1 SAR data and a recursive Dirichlet Process implementation of Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model. The approach is robust to inter-scene variability and can identify icebergs even within complex environments containing mixtures of open water, sea ice and icebergs of various sizes.

To comprehend the spectral characteristics of natural leaves, understanding the relationship between TIR reflectance and leaf water content is helpful. In this study, we selected Magnolia cylindrica E.H.Wilson, Canna indica Rosc. and Gardenia jasminoides J. Ellis leaves to isolate cuticles with varying thicknesses. Subsequently, we constructed a leaf thermal infrared model (Leaf-TIR model) to examine the impact of cuticle thickness and inside wet epidermal cell wall on the TIR reflectance of natural leaves. Our findings indicate that the cuticle thicknesses of the three selected leaves are 12.2, 5.5, and 1.1 mu m, respectively. Moreover, as cuticle thickness decreases, the similarity between the isolated cuticle and the leaf reflectance behaviors also decreases because a thinner cuticle has lower absorptance and a weaker effect on the reflection characteristics of natural leaves. Moreover, we observed that as the water content in the cell wall decreases, the reflectance of the leaves significantly increases when the cuticle thickness becomes 5.5 or 1.1 mu m. This outcome is due to the increasing difference in the refractive indices of the cuticle and cell wall with declining water content. Our findings suggest that the Leaf-TIR model can quantitatively determine the relationship between TIR reflectance and water content in the cell wall.

The multi-frequency radiometers AMSR-E and AMSR2 provide >20 years of data records, enabling the development of long-term SM and VOD products. Most of the current retrieval algorithms either only focus on SM or VOD, and generally ignore the polarization or simplify the frequency dependence of vegetation effects for reducing the unknowns and facilitating the retrieval process, limiting the synergic applicability of VOD and SM products in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. In this study, a new global SM and frequency- and polarization-dependent VOD product from 2002 to 2021 was developed using the multi-channel collaborative algorithm (MCCA), based on the inter-calibrated AMSR-E/2 multi-frequency passive microwave measurements. The MCCA algorithm comprehensively considers the physical relationship between multiple microwave channels and could retrieve frequency- and polarization-dependent VOD while considering the accuracy of the SM retrievals. In the overall comparison with other SM products (AMSR-ANN, CCI-passive v07.1, LPRM-C/X, JAXA) over 25 dense SM networks, MCCA achieved the best scores in terms of root mean square error (RMSE = 0.074 m3/m3), unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE = 0.073 m3/m3) and bias (0.007 m3/m3), and presented slightly lower value of Pearson\'s correlation coefficient (R = 0.709) than LPRM-X (R = 0.735). For the indirect evaluation of VOD with aboveground biomass (AGB) and MODIS NDVI, the MCCA product showed the performance comparable to other products (LPRM-C/X, VODCA-C/X/Ku). MCCA-derived VODs, especially for the H-polarized VODs, exhibited smooth non-linear density distribution with AGB and high temporal correlations with MODIS NDVI over most regions of the globe. In particular, MCCA-derived VODs can physically present reasonable variations across the microwave spectrum (values of VOD increase with microwave frequency), which is superior to the LPRM and VODCA products. It is expected that the MCCA algorithm can be extended to the observations of the ongoing AMSR2 or other similar satellite missions with multi-frequency capability, such as FY-3B/C/D/F/G or the upcoming AMSR3 and CMIR missions.', '[Hu, Lu; Ju, Weimin] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.

When LSMs are coupled with atmospheric prediction models, such errors will eventually degrade the accuracy of lower atmosphere forecasts. Here, we investigate the potential of two remote sensing (RS)-based rho references for addressing LSM rho bias. To minimize meteorological uncertainty and maximally attribute LSM rho bias to land sources, we focus specifically on off-line LSM calibration forced using high-quality, observation-based meteorological data. Both rho references are based on a newly proposed two-system approach for eliminating the impact of random errors in RS retrievals and quantified using the temporal correlations of soil moisture (SM) versus both evapotranspiration (ET) and the diurnal amplitude of surface temperature (dT). Experiments are conducted to calibrate an off-line LSM individually against each resulting rho reference and using a combination of both dT- and ET-represented rho references. The resulting calibrated LSM is further evaluated using independent ground-based ET observations and RS dT retrievals. Results show that although dT- and ET-represented rho references are physically consistent across space, model calibration results based on them are quite different. Specifically, the calibration experiment targeting ET-represented rho outperforms that targeting dT-represented rho in ET and dT modeling. Diagnostic results indicate that the failure of dT-based calibration experiments is due to the confounding impacts of transpiration/evapotranspiration partitioning error and large dT uncertainties in LSM. However, results also confirm the potential of both dT- and ET-represented rho references for jointly diagnosing and understanding LSM rho bias. As a result, we suggest diagnosing LSM rho bias using both ET- and dT-represented rho references - but calibrating LSM using only ET-represented rho reference data.', '[Zhou, Jianhong; Yang, Kun; Zhao, Long; Lu, Hui; Jiang, Yaozhi] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Global Change Studies, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ,Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.

Intertidal areas are exposed to particularly high levels of pressures owing to increased population density in coastal areas. Traditional methods of monitoring intertidal areas do not provide datasets with full coverage in a cost-effective or timely manner, and so the use of remote sensing to monitor these areas is becoming more common. Monitoring of ecologically important monospecific habitats, such as seagrass beds, using remote sensing techniques is well documented. However, the ability for multispectral data to distinguish efficiently and accurately between classes of vegetation with similar pigment composition, such as seagrass and green algae, has proved difficult, often requiring hyperspectral data. A ma-chine learning approach was used to differentiate between soft-bottom intertidal vegetation classes when exposed at low tide, comparing 6 different multi-and hyperspectral remote and in situ sensors. For the library of 366 spectra, collected across Northern Europe, high accuracy (>80%) was found across all spectral resolutions. While a higher spectral resolution resulted in higher accuracy, there was no discernible increase in accuracy above 10 spectral bands (95%: Sentinel-2 MSI sensor with a spatial resolution of 20 m). This work highlights the ability of multispectral sensors to discriminate intertidal vegetation types, while also showing the most important wavelengths for this discrimination (-530 and -730 nm), giving recommendations for spectral ranges of future satellite missions. The ability for multispectral sensors to aid in accurate and rapid intertidal vegetation classi-fication at the taxonomic resolution of classes, could be a significant contribution for future sustainable and effective ecosystem management.', '[Davies, Bede Ffinian Rowe; Gernez, Pierre; Geraud, Andrea; Oiry, Simon; Rosa, Philippe; Barille, Laurent] Nantes Univ, Inst Subst & Organismes Mer, ISOMer, UR2160, F-44000 Nantes, France.

Satellite remote sensing began with sensors limited to the visible and near infrared (VNIR, 380 nm to 1000 nm), and advancing to sensors spanning the whole solar domain (350 nm to 2500 nm) over the last five decades. However, NPV is still difficult to distinguish from BS in satellite images covering large spatial areas, since their spectral reflectances are always mixed and have subtly different spectral features. Many spectral indices have been proposed to identify NPV, however, most include a short-wave infrared band which is lacking on many current and historical spaceborne sensors. To fully utilize current and historical airborne/satellite images with only VNIR bands, a novel spectral index - the VNIR spectral shape index (SSI) - is proposed in this paper. Using spectra of PV, NPV, and BS acquired from world-recognized spectral libraries, the SSI was devised using only blue, green, red, and NIR bands. When applied to Sentinel-2 MSI images, the SSI was effective in estimating/mapping the fractional cover of PV, NPV, and BS using the triangular space method. The resulting fractional cover was evaluated in three 3 km x 2 km study areas including one grassland, one woodland, and one cropland. The spectral reflectance collected by spectroradiometer in field work and digital image collect by digital camera mounted on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) support that the triangular space method is able to estimate the fractional cover of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic vegetation simultaneously, and that endmember selection relying solely on satellite images is reasonable. Comparing the abundance of each target in UAV images to corresponding MSI pixels, the SSI index and triangular space method proved effective for fractional cover estimation in varied vegetated ecosystems. For fractional cover evaluation in grassland, woodland, and cropland, the R2 reaching to 0.59, 0.62, and 0.70, respectively. These results demonstrate that the SSI is feasible for multiple sensors, enabling potential large temporal and/or spatial scale applications.', '[Tian, Jia] Beihang Univ, Sch Instrumentat & Optoelect Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.

These extreme events have more significantly altered the marine environment than normal events; however, relevant in-situ measurements are usually lacking for such extreme events. In our previous study, we established a method to estimate particulate organic carbon (POC) flux by combining satellite data with a numerical model. Based on this method, this study aimed to quantify the impact of typhoons and strong seasonal winds (with a wind speed of >10.8 m/s) on POC flux and transport outside the Changjiang River estuary (CRE). Wind data in CRE during 2010-2019 revealed that the annual durations of strong winds (849.7 +/- 111.7 h/yr) and typhoons (204.4 +/- 64.5 h/yr) increased by 15.3% and 143.3%, respectively, compared to those during 1980-2009. The seasonal durations of typhoons and strong winds during 2010-2019 increased in autumn and in winter and spring, respectively. Considering northward Typhoon Bolaven as an example, we found that its passage strengthened the southward POC transport and the POC erosion outside CRE. Four scenarios with special wind characteristics were further simulated to analyze the annual effect of strong winds on POC transport. The proportion of northerly winds in strong winds affected the southward POC transport, whereas strong winter winds triggered 23.0% of the southward transport of POC flux. Finally, based on eight groups of numerical simulation experiments, the increasing proportion of northerly winds in strong wind events during 2010-2019 enhanced the southward POC transport and POC erosion by 15.9% and 2.8%, respectively, compared with the transport and erosion during 1980-2009. The increased durations of typhoons in autumn and strong winds in winter are expected to increase the proportion of northerly winds in extreme winds, thus enhancing the southward POC transport in CRE and affecting the southeastern coast of China. The combination of high-spatiotemporal-resolution satellite data and the numerical model provides novel insights into the impact of short-term wind extremes on POC transport in the estuary, with important implications for relevant biogeochemical processes, in particular, carbon cycle, in the coastal ocean.', '[Wang, Zhihong; Bai, Yan; Bai, Ruofeng] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Oceanog, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.

Here we investigate new modifications to this methodology with the goal of improving accuracy and consistency in results and increasing flexibility for operational usage and future development. The modified method (Band-First Probability, or CCD-BFP) change detection procedure works by calculating a test for each band through time before summarizing between bands. We evaluate the CCD-BFP method compared to an existing implementation of CCDC using a variety of approaches, including a validation dataset of human -interpreted locations, comparison with data from fire events, use of simulated remote sensing data, and qualitative inspection of areas of interest. We find CCD-BFP improves consistency across time and space compared to the existing implementation of CCDC, with more similarity in rates of change across Landsat swath boundaries and before and after the launch of Landsat 7. Also, we find that CCD-BFP detects more of the change events in the validation dataset while reducing the overall number of change detections, indicating that it is able to more accurately capture the most notable land surface change events.', '[Tollerud, Heather J.] US Geol Survey, Earth Resources Observat & Sci EROS Ctr, Sioux Falls, SD 57198 USA.

We used ScanSAR C- and L-band imagery from RADARSAT-2, ALOS PALSAR and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2, to identify ice types in the North Water Polynya (NOW) and Victoria Strait (VS) region of the Canadian Arctic. We investigated the HH-polarized microwave backscatter coefficient (sigma(0)(HH)) and its GLCM texture parameters for six ice classes and open water. We found very low sigma(0)(HH) for nilas at both C- and L-band. Although similar sigma(0)(HH) found for grey ice at both frequencies, sigma(0)(HH) decrease with increasing ice thickness at L-band from grey ice, whereas, at C-band, sigma(0)(HH) increases from grey to grey-white ice and then decreases as the ice grows. GLCM texture parameters show lower values for L-band than C-band; however, separability among classes was found only for a few selected parameters. We used the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for ice type classification from SAR scenes using sigma(0)(HH) and GLCM texture statistics. Due to overlapping sigma(0)(HH) signatures at C-band, early-stage ice classes were substantially misclassified. L-band identified early-stage ice classes with higher accuracy compared to C-band but misclassified thicker ice types and open water. L-band alone provided very good classification results (similar to 80% accuracy) and combining L- and C-band (i.e., dual-frequency approach) further increased accuracy to >90%. C-band alone resulted in the lowest accuracy of <60%. We acknowledge that developing a universal ice classification is still a challenge and requires some manual supervision to adopt variable ice conditions into the classification method. However, a dual-frequency approach can achieve higher classification accuracy than conventionally used single-frequency approaches. This research highlights the value of upcoming L-Band SAR missions to improve sea ice classification in regions where a variety of ice types exist, including many thinner types, which are now dominating an increasingly warming Arctic.', '[Mahmud, Mallik S.; Nandan, Vishnu; Singha, Suman; Geldsetzer, Torsten; Yackel, John] Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.

Unfortunately, few high-level land surface products have been produced and publicly released. The numerical inversion of radiative transfer model (RTM) has long been used for the retrieval of land surface and atmospheric variables from satellite data; however, it is computationally intensive. Some methods (e.g., using look-up tables) are efficient but are most suitable for estimating individual variable. Various machine learning (ML) models have been developed, mostly trained by either ground measurements that may not be adequate to represent different conditions, or RTM simulations that may not be realistic due to model uncertainty and unnecessary combinations of illumination-viewing geometries and variable values. In this study, we replaced the numerical inversion scheme by the ML algorithm that is trained using RTM inversion for estimating multiple variables simultaneously. Our training dataset for the ML models was generated by inverting the land and atmospheric variables from VIIRS top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data using a coupled land-surface-atmosphere RT model. Two multi-output ML algorithms were explored: backpropagation neural networks and random forest (RF) regression. The best-performing RF model was then applied to estimate seven land and atmospheric variables globally from VIIRS TOA data: the leaf area index (LAI), incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), incident shortwave radiation (ISR), land surface albedo, land surface reflectance, and TOA albedo. The inversion results were validated using ground measurements at 54 sites and showed comparable accuracy to the numerical inversion scheme that is suitable for only small regions. An experiment was also conducted to test this method on a much larger region for detailed evaluation. Finally, seven global estimates in 2013 were experimentally produced. Inter-comparison with the existing satellite products showed that the VIIRS estimates had high consistency with the LAI and FAPAR products of the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) products suite. Moreover, the VIIRS officially released the VNP43MA3 albedo and VNP09A1 surface reflectance products, the retrieved estimates also matched them well. It was also shown that simultaneous estimation of all seven variables was more accurate and efficient than estimating individual variable sequentially.', '[Zhang, Guodong; Ma, Han; He, Tao] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430010, Hubei, Peoples R China.

Manual classification and deep learning approaches based on very-high resolution imagery have been applied successfully, but the required resources limits their capacity to map urban land use at larger scales. Here, we use a combination of open-source satellite imagery, constituting of data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, and socioeconomic data, constituting of points-of-interest and spatial metrics from road networks to classify urban land-use at a national scale, using a deep learning approach. A related challenge for large-scale mapping is the availability of ground truth data. Therefore, we focus our analysis on the transferability of our classification approach, using ground truth labels from a nationwide land-use dataset for the Netherlands. By dividing the country into four regions, we tested whether a combination of satellite data and socioeconomic data increases the transferability of the classification approach, compared to using satellite data only. The results indicate that socioeconomic data increases the overall accuracy of the classification for the Netherlands by 3 percentage points. In a transfer learning approach we find that adding socioeconomic data increases the accuracy between 3 and 5 percentage points when trained on three regions and tested on the independent fourth one. In the case of training and testing on one region and testing on another, the increase in overall accuracy increased up to 9 percentage points. In addition, we find that our deep learning approach consistently outperforms a random forest model, used here as benchmark, in all of the abovementioned experiments. Overall, we find that socioeconomic data increases the accuracy of urban land use classification, but variations between experiments are large.', '[Rosier, Job F.; Verburg, Peter H.; van Vliet, Jasper] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1105 Amsterdam, Netherlands.

However, when the soil is dry, the radar waves penetrate deeper into the soil, potentially sensing subsurface scatterers such as near-surface rocks and stones. In this paper we propose an exponential model to describe the impact of such subsurface scatterers on CBand backscatter measurements acquired by the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) on board of the METOP satellites. The model predicts an increase of the subsurface scattering contributions with decreasing soil wetness that may counteract the signal from the soil surface. This may cause anomalous backscatter signals that deteriorate soil moisture retrievals from ASCAT. We test whether this new model is able to explain ASCAT observations better than a bare soil backscatter model without a subsurface scattering term, using k-fold cross validation and the Bayesian Information Criterion for model selection. We find that arid landscapes with Leptosols and Arenosols represent ideal environmental conditions for the occurrence of subsurface scattering. Nonetheless, subsurface scattering may also become important in more humid environments during dry spells. We conclude that subsurface scattering is a widespread phenomenon that (i) needs to be accounted for in active microwave soil moisture retrievals and (ii) has a potential for soil mapping, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments.', '[Wagner, Wolfgang; Lindorfer, Roland; Melzer, Thomas; Hahn, Sebastian; Bauer-Marschallinger, Bernhard; Quast, Raphael; Greimeister-Pfeil, Isabella; Vreugdenhil, Mariette] Tech Univ Wien, Dept Geodesy & Geoinformat, Vienna, Austria.

The radiance spectra were collected using the Thermal And Near-infrared Sensor for carbon Observation Fourier-Transform Spectrometer (TANSO-FTS) onboard the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT). Our retrieval method uniquely utilizes reflected sunlight with two orthogonal components of polarization and thermal emissions. We defined megacity concentration enhancement due to surface CO2 emissions as XCO2LT minus XCO2UT, allowing us to overcome some of the challenges in the enhancement analysis using existing column density data. We examined the relationship between the XCO2LT enhancements from the time series of intensive target observations over megacities and the inverse of simulated wind speed, which could be potentially used to estimate surface emissions. Next, we attempted to estimate the average emission intensity for each city from the linear regression slope. We also compared our obtained emission estimates with the Open-Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO2 (ODIAC) inventory for evaluation.

While within-season biomass can be measured or estimated in the field, it is often impractical to make field measurements in extensive rangeland systems with adequate frequency and spatial representation for responsive decision-making by rangeland managers. We sought to develop a single model to accurately predict daily herbaceous biomass across seasonally and annually varying conditions from the Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel satellite time series. We also sought to assess how information about plant community composition derived from a high-spatial resolution map would improve model performance. We used herbaceous biomass data from 1764 ground observations collected over 8 years in North American shortgrass steppe for training in a cross-validated model selection approach to evaluate (1) predictive performance of candidate models both spatially and temporally, (2) relative variable importance of individual spectral bands, vegetation indices, and recently developed broadband spectral angle indices, and (3) the degree to which including plant community composition improved model performance. All 11 candidate models identified in the model selection procedure contained a band angle index and an individual spectral band, and 6 contained one of each input feature type, demonstrating the benefit of combining spectral features for predicting herbaceous biomass across varying conditions. The spatial and temporal cross-validation and selection procedures produced the same top model with similar performance (mean absolute error = 151-182 kg ha(-1); R-2 = 0.75-0.79), suggesting that a single model performs well over space and time. Including plant community composition in the model reduced mean absolute error by 11-13%. Bootstrapping revealed that -six to seven years of training data were required to achieve consistent model performance across years with varying environmental conditions (e.g., wet, average, dry). The top model could accurately detect (70-87% accuracy) the week that biomass dropped below management-related thresholds as low as 450 kg ha(-1) in an independent dataset (n = 950) with modest commission error (10-26%). We discuss how maps showing the probability that herbaceous biomass is below a given threshold can support adaptive management in extensive semiarid rangelands across differing scenarios of risk perception and avoidance. In addition to producing maps to support precision rangeland management strategies, this study demonstrates the importance of combining complementary vegetation indices and acquiring long-term training datasets to achieve reliable predictions of herbaceous standing biomass in highly variable systems.', '[Kearney, Sean P.; Porensky, Lauren M.; Augustine, David J.; Gaffney, Rowan] USDA ARS, Rangeland Resources & Syst Res Unit, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA.

It is however unclear if these contrasting patterns have led to net fractional woody cover loss or gain. Here we used non-parametric fractional woody cover (WC) predictions and breakpoint detection algorithms driven by satellite observations (Landsat and MODIS) and airborne laser scanning to unveil the net fractional WC change during 2001-2019 over Ethiopia and Kenya. Our results show that total WC loss was 4-times higher than total gain, leading to net loss. The contribution of abrupt WC loss (59%) was higher than gradual losses (41%). We estimated an annual WC loss rate of up to 5% locally, with cropland expansion contributing to 57% of the total loss in the region. Major hotspots of WC loss and degradation corridors were identified inside as well as surrounding protected areas, in agricultural lands located close to agropastoral and pastoral livelihood zones, and near highly populated areas. As the dominant vegetation type in the region, Acacia-Commiphora bushlands and thickets ecosystem was the most threatened, accounting 69% of the total WC loss, followed by montane forest (12%). Although highly outweighed by loss, relatively more gain was observed in woody savanna than in other ecosystems.

Glacier fragmentation, disappearance, and proglacial lake development also accelerated, as did the retreat of glaciers to higher elevations. Our annually-resolved method relies on the existence of previously published and manually validated glacier inventories from the mid-1980s and mid-2000\'s. Our methods performed well for clean ice glaciers, had occasional errors when proglacial lakes were present, and consistently underestimated the area of debris-covered glaciers. Clean ice glacier area loss accelerated sevenfold between the early [1984-2010] and late [2011-2020] epochs. This acceleration yielded rates of area shrinkage of-49 +/- 7 km(2) a(-1) [early] and -340 +/- 40 km(2) a(-1) [late] with accelerated losses (32-fold increase) for small glaciers on Vancouver Island over the last decade. Glacier fragmentation accelerated from 26 +/- 5.6 fragments a(-1) to 88 +/- 39 fragments a(-1).

The equatorial rainforests of Central Africa are the second largest and least disturbed of the biodiversly-rich and highly productive rainforests on Earth. Currently, there is a dearth of knowledge about the phenological behavior and long-term changes that these forests are experiencing. Thus, this study reports on leaf area seasonality and its time trend over the past two decades as assessed from multiple remotely sensed datasets. Seasonal variations of leaf area in Congolese forests derived from MODIS data co-vary with the bimodal precipitation pattern in this region, with higher values during the wet season. Independent observational evidence derived from MISR and EPIC sensors in the form of angular reflectance signatures further corroborate this seasonal behavior of leaf area. The bimodal patterns vary latitudinally within this large region. Two sub-seasonal cycles, each consisting of a dry and wet season, could be discerned clearly. These exhibit different sensitivities to changes in precipitation. Contrary to a previous published report, no widespread decline in leaf area was detected across the entire extent of the Congolese rainforests over the past two decades with the latest MODIS Collection 6 dataset. Long-term precipitation decline did occur in some localized areas, but these had minimal impacts on leaf area, as inferred from MODIS and MISR multi-angle observations.', '[Sun, Yuanheng; Knyazikhin, Yuri; She, Xiaojun; Ni, Xiangnan; Chen, Chi; Myneni, Ranga B.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA.

Second, an accuracy assessment is done specifically for main crop types from farmers declarations from 6 EU member countries or regions totaling >3 M parcels and 8.21 Mha. Finally, the crop areas derived by classification are compared to the subnational (NUTS 2) area statistics reported by Eurostat.

In this paper, we focus on the branch of GNSS-R that is based on the conventional geodetic receiver. In order to improve precision and promote the actual application, we present a multi-site multi-signal GNSS-R combination method. Furthermore, to address the phenomenon of \"double peaks\" in spectrograms of GPS L2P/L2W signal, we present a strategy to retrieve water levels from the L2P/L2W signal captured using Z-tracking method. Data of a GNSS network, which included a base station and three monitoring sites, established in a reservoir of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project were analyzed. The multi-site, multi-signal combination method was used to form a 6-h water level retrieval series and the retrievals showed a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.0 mm. This is the first example of GNSS-R water-level retrieval achieving a millimeter to centimeter scale precision. The ability of the GNSS technology to simultaneously monitor water level and displacement based on the same GNSS network were also discussed and demonstrated.

Thus, understanding the correlation of climate and carbon cycling systems is important in assessing the anthropogenic and natural impacts. Here, we report decadal CO2 variabilities in western Pacific based on data from several ground-based stations in the region and Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). In addition to the well-established El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), there exists a decadal changing CO2 trend in the datasets mentioned above. Analysis of ground-based CO2 measurements in northern Taiwan shows a decadal signal at amplitudes of -5 ppm. In contrast, AIRS shows a similar trend but at a reduced amplitude of -1 ppm. We attribute the decadal signal to dynamical factors related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).

Though N2O emissions are largely derived from agricultural activities, urban sources of N2O also contribute significantly to anthropogenic emissions, but are not well understood and difficult to quantify. This study employs a top-down approach to derive urban N2O emissions for the Los Angeles megacity using a unique dataset from a mountaintop remote sensing instrument, which has been observing greenhouse gas mixing ratios in LA since 2011. CLARS-FTS observations yield a weighted mean of 15.0 ? 0.1 ppb excess XN2O above background in the LA basin from 2013 to 2019. Time series of XN2Oxs show a seasonal cycle with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 5.6 ? 2.5 ppb, where greater XN2Oxs values are observed during the winter/spring and minima occur in late summer/early fall. A tracer-tracer ratio method is applied using XN2Oxs and XCO2,xs observations to estimate top-down N2O emissions for the LA basin during 2013?2018. Estimated monthly emissions range from 6 to 19 Gg N2O per month and exhibit a similar seasonal cycle to that observed in XN2Oxs. Estimated annual emissions fall within the range 124?144 Gg per year for the years 2014?2018. These top-down annual estimates are roughly 3 times the official statewide bottom-up inventory for the same time period, but consistent considering uncertainties with other top-down estimates for the LA basin. The discrepancy between top-down emission estimates and the statewide bottom-up inventory highlights the difficulty in constraining N2O emissions, especially for an urban environment.', '[Addington, Olivia] Occidental Coll, Dept Phys, Los Angeles, CA USA.

Importantly, although Bridger Photonics knew there was a ground team working in the area to deploy wind sensors as part of the broader survey of facilities, they had no knowledge whatsoever that controlled releases were taking place and were not informed of this until all data processing was complete. Thus, the presented data allow a true, fully-blinded assessment of the airborne technology?s ability to both detect and locate unknown methane sources within active oil and gas facilities, as well as to quantify their release rates. Results were used to derive a lower-sensitivity limit threshold as a function of wind speed, which matches well with the broader field survey results. Comparison of measurement results with and without the benefit of on-site wind data reveal that uncertainty in the GML source quantification is a direct linear function of the uncertainty in the wind speed. Quantification uncertainties (1?) of ?31?68% can be expected for sources near the sensitivity limit. The derived sensitivity limit function was incorporated into exploratory simulations using the Fugitive Emissions Abatement Simulation Toolkit (FEAST), which suggest that the Bridger GML technology has comparable performance to optical gas imaging (OGI) camera surveys both in terms of fraction of total emissions detected and anticipated net mitigation. The relative performance of the Bridger GML technology would be expected to improve or worsen as the assumed underlying distribution of source magnitudes becomes more or less positively skewed (i.e. more or less dominated by larger sources such as tank vents). Overall, the Bridger GML technology is shown to be capable of detecting, locating, and quantifying individual sources at or below the magnitudes of recent regulated venting limits.

However, SIF observations are subject to directional effects which can lead to considerable uncertainties in various applications. Practical approaches for normalizing directional SIF observations to nadir viewing, to minimize the directional effects, have not been well studied. Here we developed two practical and physically-solid approaches for removing the directional effects of anisotropic SIF observations: one is based on near-infrared or red reflectance of vegetation (NIRv and Red(v)), and the other is based on the kernel-driven model with multi-angular SIF measurements. The first approach uses surface reflectance while the second approach directly leverages multi-angular SIF measurements. The performance of the two approaches was evaluated using a dataset of multi-angular measurements of SIF and reflectance collected with a high-resolution field spectrometer over different plant canopies. Results show that the relative mean absolute errors between the normalized nadir SIF and the observed SIF at nadir decrease by 3-6% (far-red) and 6-8% (red) for the first approach, and by 7-13% and 6-11% for the second approach, compared to the original data, respectively.

To further prepare, the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) platform was used to observe cropland sites across the southern United States to support the development of L-band (24 cm) prototype science products. Time series flights flew over four independent areas during the growing season of 2019 while crop ground measurements were collected. Major crops include corn, cotton, pasture, peanut, rice, and soybean. A suite of cropland classification experiments applied a set of machine learning (ML) algorithms (random forest, feedforward fully connected neural network, support vector machine), the recently developed Multi-temporal Binary Tree Classification (MBTC), and a phenology (Coefficient of Variation; CoV) approach to synergistically assess performance, scattering mechanisms, and limitations. Specific objectives of this research application included 1.) evaluation of L-band mapping performance across multiple independent agricultural production areas with field scale training data, and 2.) assessment of the CoV approach for the generation of prototype NISAR Level 2 science products. Collectively, SAR terms with sensitivity to volume scattering performed well and consistently across CoV mapping experiments achieving accuracy greater than 80% for cropland vs not cropland. Dynamic phenology classes, such as herbaceous wetlands, had some confusion with CoV agriculture requiring further regionalized training optimization. Volume scattering and cross-pol terms were most useful across the different ML techniques with overall accuracy and Kappa consistently over 90% and 0.85, respectively, for crop type by late growth stages for L-band observations. As expected, time series information was more valuable compared to any single ML technique, site, or crop schema. Ultimately, as more SAR platforms launch, the user community should leverage physical contributions of different wavelengths and polarizations along with growing open access time series for efficient and meaningful agricultural products.', '[Huang, Xiaodong; Ziniti, Beth; Torbick, Nathan] Appl Geosolut, Durham, NH 03824 USA.

By extracting the daily variations of nighttime SUHI features using the Gaussian model and investigating their correlations with various explanatory factors, we have attempted to determine the controls on SUHIs on a daily-basis over Chinese cities. Specific controls of weather conditions on the intensity, extent, shape, and centroid of the SUHIs were identified. Our results show that: (1) SUHI intensity (SUHII) was considerably more sensitive to weather conditions than the SUHI footprint (i.e., extent, shape, and centroid). (2) Meteorological variables including relative humidity, accumulated precipitation, and aerosol optical depth, had the greatest impact on SUHI intensity; whereas factors related to temperature fluctuations (day-to-day fluctuations of surface and air temperature) were the main factors influencing SUHI extent, shape, and the direction in which SUHI centroid varies. (3) Antecedent precipitation substantially impacted the subsequent SUHIs under clear-skies, changing both the SUHI itself and its sensitivity to other factors. Typically, the clear-sky SUHIs directly following rainfall showed a higher dependence on the relative humidity, soil moisture and aerosol, but were less affected by wind. (4) The meteorological contributions to the daily nighttime SUHIIs varied among Chinese cities with different bioclimatic conditions. In general, they were stronger in temperate zones than in subtropical zones.

However, the change magnitude and duration of ULCCs have rarely been discussed in the context of high-frequency ULCCs. Moreover, previous models for quantifying high-frequency changes commonly required numerous clear-sky observations. Such requirement is difficult to be satisfied in widespread cloud-prone cities. Considering these characteristics of ULCCs and data availability, we developed a novel approach that can comprehensively quantify ULCCs with relatively limited data. The approach successfully integrated two commonly used approaches in change detection, namely temporal segmentation and trajectory classification. In addition, sparse clear-sky observations were used in the time series of fractional land cover (TSFLC). Specifically, we first conducted classifications for each year, and then extracted the TSFLC from each block. Second, we used temporal segmentation to segment the TSFLC based on the local change trend. Third, we classified the segments of time series by trajectory classification, and recorded the change information. The proposed approach can provide comprehensive details for ULCCs including the frequency of changes during the observation time, the transition, the change time, and the change magnitude for each change. The approach quantifies multiple changes with a slightly higher accuracy (93.33%) than that of previous approaches for only one change (91.00%). The categories/ transitions of ULCC were also quantified, with an accuracy of 81.67%. Moreover, the approach effectively monitored ULCCs in a cloud-prone city and successfully captured and analyzed two common transitions, block construction and urban renewal. The present approach offers a new perspective for providing complete and accurate ULCC information with scarce clear-sky observations.', '[Jing, Chuanbao; Zhou, Weiqi; Qian, Yuguo; Yu, Wenjuan; Zheng, Zhong] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.

However, they are not well protected and are consequently being replaced by agricultural systems worldwide. Current monitoring efforts using remote sensing and ground-based methods are insufficient, and accordingly the mapping of grassland to cropland conversions must be improved to better document these changes in the Canadian Prairies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate different structural break methods and remote sensing datasets for their temporal accuracy in detecting grassland conversions in two Alberta study areas from 2010 to 2018. Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST), BFAST Seasonal and Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonality and Trend (BEAST) methods were applied to evaluate their sensitivity to rangeland and pasture conversions. The best model was BFAST Seasonal, correctly predicting the year of change for 76% of rangelands and 66% of pastures. This demonstrates that seasonal models are effective in detecting interannual changes in vegetation composition amidst background noise from climate and management induced phenological changes. MODIS data outperformed Landsat, outlining the importance of high temporal resolution remote sensing data to successful change detection, even at the expense of higher spatial resolution. Overall, this study demonstrates that structural break methods are effective in identifying grassland to agriculture transitions and may be useful for the operational monitoring of grassland inventories in the future.', '[Mardian, Jacob; Berg, Aaron] Univ Guelph, Dept Geog Environm & Geomat, 50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.

In crops, prior studies have generally been limited in scope, either to a small wavelength range (e.g., 400-1300 nm), a small number of crop cultivars, a single growth stage or single growing season. Methods that are not time- or site-specific are needed to use imaging spectroscopy for routine monitoring of crop status. Using data from four cultivars of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.), three growth stages and two growing seasons, we demonstrate the capacity of full-range (400-2350 nm) imaging spectroscopy to quantify nutrient status (petiole nitrate, whole leaf and vine total nitrogen) and predict tuber yield in potatoes across cultivars, growth stages and growing seasons. We specifically tested the capabilities of: (1) ordinary least-squares regression (OLSR) using traditional hyperspectral vegetation indices (VIs); (2) partial least-squares regression (PLSR) using full spectrum (400-2350 nm), VNIR-(visible-to-near infrared: 400-1300 nm) or SWIR-only (shortwave infrared: 1400-2350 nm) wavelengths; (3) predictive models developed for one potato type or planting season on withheld data from a different type or season. Our results show that OLSR models produced poor predictions with data from all dates pooled together (validation R-2 < 0.01). Single-date OLSR models performed better (R-2 = 0.20-0.60, relative RMSE = 15-30%). PLSR models performed well and were comparable using different spectral regions (full-spectrum, VNIR-only and SWIR-only), with validation R-2 = 0.68-0.82 and RRMSE = 12-25%. Testing across potato types, models produced reliable predictions (R-2 = 0.45-0.75, RRMSE = 13-30%), but with some bias. Cross-season models had validation R-2 = 0.46-0.75 and RRMSE = 17-100%, with a more significant bias than the cross-potato type models. To achieve models that are generalizable and robust, we recommend: (1) obtaining ground measurements that capture the full range of plant growth conditions and developmental stages, and (2) ensuring that image processing approaches minimize spectral discrepancies among dates.', '[Liu, Nanfeng; Townsend, Philip A.; Hills, William B.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

Estimation of foliar protein content is the key to monitor the nitrogen cycle in terrestrial ecosystems, in particular to assess the photosynthetic capacity of plants and to improve nitrogen management in agriculture. However, until now physically based leaf RT models have not allowed for proper spectral decomposition and estimation of leaf dry matter as nitrogen-based proteins and other carbon-based constituents (CBC) from optical properties of fresh and dry foliage. Such an achievement is the key for subsequent upscaling to canopy level and for development of new Earth observation applications.   Therefore, we developed a new version of the PROSPECT model, named PROSPECT-PRO, which separates the nitrogen-based constituents (proteins) from CBC (including cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose, starch and sugars). PROSPECT-PRO was calibrated and validated on subsets of the LOPEX dataset, accounting for both fresh and dry broadleaf and grass samples. We applied an iterative model inversion optimization algorithm and identified the optimal spectral ranges for retrieval of proteins and CBC. When combining leaf reflectance and transmittance within the selected optimal spectral domains, PROSPECT-PRO inversions revealed similarly accurate CBC estimates of fresh and dry leaf samples (respective validation R-2 = 0.96 and 0.95, NRMSE = 9.6% and 13.4%), whereas a better performance was obtained for fresh than for dry leaves when estimating proteins (respective validation R-2 = 0.79 and 0.57, NRMSE = 15.1% and 26.1%). The accurate estimation of leaf constituents for fresh samples is attributed to the optimal spectral feature selection procedure.   We further tested the ability of PROSPECT-PRO to estimate leaf mass per area (LMA) as the sum of proteins and CBC using independent datasets acquired for numerous plant species. Results showed that both PROSPECT PRO and PROSPECT-D inversions were able to produce comparable LMA estimates across an independent dataset gathering 1685 leaf samples (validation R-2 = 0.90 and NRMSE = 16.5% for PROSPECT-PRO, and R-2 = 0.90 and NRMSE =18.3% for PROSPECT-D). Findings also revealed that PROSPECT-PRO is capable of assessing the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio based on the retrieved CBC-to-proteins ratio (R-2 = 0.87 and NRMSE = 15.7% for fresh leaves, and R-2 = 0.65 and NRMSE= 28.1% for dry leaves). The performance assessment of newly designed PROSPECT-PRO demonstrates a promising potential for its involvement in precision agriculture and ecological applications aiming at estimation of leaf carbon and nitrogen contents from observations of current and forthcoming airborne and satellite imaging spectroscopy sensors.', '[Feret, Jean-Baptiste; de Boissieu, Florian] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, CIRAD, TETIS,INRAE,AgroParisTech, Montpellier, France.

The complexity of the hydrodynamic environment and estuarine processes in the Changjiang River estuary (CRE) results in a POC flux with high spatiotemporal variability. In this study, we proposed a new method for time series monitoring of riverine POC flux by combining satellite ocean color and numerical modeling data. We used 500-m resolution geostationary satellite data from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) to retrieve surface POC concentrations in the CRE and used the numerical Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) to simulate three-dimensional (3D) current and sediment distribution. Diurnal, seasonal, and annual variations in POC flux through the lower reaches (Datong Hydrological Station), upper estuary (Xuliujing Hydrological Station), and outlets of the CRE, as well as transportation and deposition outside the CRE, were examined from July 2011 to June 2018. The annual mean POC fluxes through the Datong, Xuliujing, and outlet sections were 1.16 +/- 0.16 Tg C/yr, 1.29 +/- 0.11 Tg C/yr, and 1.17 +/- 0.11 Tg C/yr, respectively. After passing through the estuary, 35.2% of POC was deposited in the sandbar outside the outlets, 52.9% was transported to the south, and a small amount entered the eastern shelf. Thus, these results indicated that POC flux through the river and estuary sections differed from the effective riverine POC flux into the sea. The proposed method combining high spatiotemporalresolution satellite data and numerical modeling not only makes full use of their advantages, but also reduces the uncertainty of their individual estimates. This approach also supports long-term monitoring of riverine fluxes to the sea and helps clarify the effects of terrestrial inputs on marginal seas under multiple stresses from human activities and climate change.', '[Wang, Zhihong; Bai, Yan; He, Xianqiang; Tao, Bangyi; Li, Teng; Chen, Xiaoyan; Wang, Tianyu; Gong, Fang] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 2, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Hangzhou 310012, Peoples R China.

What we measured by remote sensing or near-surface platforms is top-of-canopy (TOC) SIF (SIFtoc), which is not necessarily equal or proportional to total emitted SIF (SIFtot) from the entire canopy due to the (re)absorption and scattering effects. However, photosynthesis, the process that plants use to fix carbon from the atmosphere, occurs at the entire vertical canopy. Here, by using the recollision theory, we calculated SIFtot at 760 nm from the measured SIFtoc, hyperspectral reflectance (R), canopy interception (i) and leaf albedo (omega(l)). Among them, both SIFtoc and R can be obtained from concurrent TOC spectral measurements; i and omega(l) in the near-infrared region can be estimated from the open access datasets with a good accuracy. Our result confirms that the measured SIFtoc only accounts for a small fraction of SIFtot: the above-the-canopy sensor can only \"see\" on average 22.9% of SIFtot at Harvard Forest. SIFtot has the following advantages over SIFtoc in estimating GPP: (1) SIFtot improves the diurnal estimate of canopy GPP, especially capable to capture the midday depression of photosynthesis which may cause the large discrepancies between SIFtoc and GPP on a diurnal basis, (2) SIFtot produces a stronger correlation with GPP from plants with complex canopy structure or under sky conditions with more diffuse irradiance, and (3) the SIFtot-GPP relationship shows a stronger resilience to environmental stresses. The fluorescence escape ratio (f(esc)), the ratio between SIFtoc multiplied by pi and SIFtot, is mostly determined by the sun-canopy-sensor geometry and leaf inclination distribution. The effect of LAI and the leaf chlorophyll concentration on f(esc) is marginal at the 760 nm wavelength. Our results suggest that converting SIFtoc into SIFtot provides a better tool to understand and estimate GPP.', '[Lu, Xiaoliang; Liu, Zhunqiao] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.

This land-loss crisis might become a global problem because most major deltas are expected to be vulnerable to land loss during the remainder of the 21st century and beyond. Despite this predicament, we do not understand how land loss in a deltaic environment proceeds in time and space. Here, we evaluate the spatial and temporal trends of land loss in the Lower Mississippi River Delta (LMRD) region using spatial statistics and landscape metrics. We used nearly 4800 Landsat images to construct a series of three-year cloud-free composites from 1983 to 2016. From these data, we created a stability index (SI), which is a dimensionless measure of the number of land-to -water transitions that a land pixel makes before being considered lost. Our results indicate that on the LMRD, 75% of land loss is a single transition from land to water, while about 25% of land pixels have two or more transitions before being considered lost. Using a local indicator of spatial association, we show that pixels with similar SI tend to cluster together. Single transition clusters (low SI) form elongated shapes, they are densely packed, and they are predominantly, but not always, found on marsh edges. On the other hand, multi-transition clusters (high SI) form square-like shapes, they are more fragmented, and they are usually found in marsh interiors. Our analysis further shows that the land-loss area within the spatial patches with both high and low stability is strongly related to the density of land patches and their shape (R2 of 0.717 and 0.545 respectively). Our analysis suggests that land-loss pixels on the marsh edges undergo different temporal patterns of land loss compared to those in the marsh interior. We hypothesize that this arises because wave edge-erosion drives land loss on marsh edges, whereas subsidence-related flooding drives land loss in marsh interiors. The stability index provides a useful way to characterize the processes causing land loss.', '[Roy, Samapriya; Robeson, Scott M.] Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.

Although a variety of remote sensing approaches have been developed, more research is still needed to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of fire severity mapping. This study proposes a unitemporal simulation approach based on the generation of synthetic spectral databases from linear spectral mixing. To fully exploit the potential of these training databases, the Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm was applied to build a classifier and regression model. The predictive models parameterized with the synthetic datasets were applied in a case study, the Sierra de Luna wildfire in Spain. Single date Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A imagery of the immediate post-fire environment were used to develop the validation spectral datasets and a Pleiades orthoimage, providing the ground truth data. The four defined severity categories - unburned (UB), partial canopy unburned (PCU), canopy scorched (CS), and canopy consumed (CC) - demonstrated high accuracy in the bootstrapped (about 95%) and real validation sets (about 90%), with a slightly better performance observed when the Sentinel-2A dataset was used. Abundance of four ground covers (green vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, soil, and ash) was also quantified with moderate (similar to 45% for NPV) or high accuracy (higher than 75% for the remaining covers). No specific pattern in the comparison of sensors was observed. Variable importance analysis highlighted the complementary behavior of the spectral bands, although the contrast between the near and shortwave infrared regions stood out above the rest. Comparison of procedures reinforced the usefulness of the approach, as RF image-derived models and the multiple endmember spectral unmixing technique (MESMA) showed lower accuracy. The capabilities for detailed mapping are reflected in the development of different types of cartography (classification maps and fraction cover maps). The approach holds great potential for fire severity assessment, and future research needs to extend the predictive modeling to other burned areas - also in different ecosystems - and analyze its competence and the possible adaptations needed.', '[Montorio, Raquel; Perez-Cabello, Fernando] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Geog & Spatial Management, C Pedro Cerbuna 12, Zaragoza 50009, Spain.

Its observations are expected ultimately to become the main global source of active fire (AF) detections and fire radiative power (FRP) retrievals for the mid-morning and evening low earth orbit timeslots - data currently supplied by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra. Here we report for the first-time the significant adjustments made to the pre-launch Sentinel-3 AF detection and fire characterisation algorithm required to optimize its performance with real SLSTR data collected from the Sentinel-3A and -3B satellites. SLSTR possesses both an S7 \'standard\' and an F1 \'fire\' channel that operate in the same middle infrared (MIR) waveband, but which use different detectors with differing dynamic ranges and which are located at different focal plane locations. When S7 provides saturated observations, for example over higher FRP active fire pixels, F1 must be used to provide a reliable MIR spectral measurement. However, the two channels differing data characteristics (slightly different size, shape and spatial location of the matching pixels) means that swapping between their measurements is non-trivial. The main algorithm enhancement has therefore been the addition of a dedicated active fire pixel clustering component, required to cluster the detected AF pixels into individual fires as a solution to this issue. Focusing on night-time data due to the added complexity of daytime implementation, we compare AF information derived with this updated SLSTR algorithm to that from near-simultaneous MODIS Terra, and we find that SLSTR has a lower minimum FRP detection limit which enables more lower FRP active fire pixels to be identified than is the case with MODIS. When both sensors detect the same fire cluster at the same time, SLSTR typically measures a slightly higher FRP due to it being able to detect more of the low FRP AF pixels lying at the cluster edge (the OLS linear best fit between matched SLSTR and MODIS per-fire FRP matchups has a slope of 1.08). At the regional scale, SLSTR detects 90% of the AF pixels that the matching MODIS data contains, but also identifies an additional 44% more AF pixels - the vast majority of which have FRP < 5 MW. Regional FRP totals derived from SLSTR appear slightly higher than those from MODIS because of this, and the OLS linear best fit between these regional FRP matchup datasets has a slope of 1.10. Global fire mapping at 1 degrees grid cell resolution for January 2019 shows very similar fire patterns and FRP totals from SLSTR onboard of Sentinel-3B and MODIS Terra, with SLSTR detecting seven times more AF pixels but very similar FRP totals. Case studies in 5 degrees grid cell areas show the same pattern, and longer-term comparisons like these will provide the data required to mesh MODIS and SLSTR data into a single compatible time-series for long-term trend analysis. The night-time SLSTR AF product based largely on this algorithm has been fully operational from March 2020 and is available from near real-time feeds.

This review examines the coral physiological and bleaching forecasting literature to identify biological and geophysical parameters that explain variance in coral bleaching and knowledge gaps related to the application of this knowledge to bleaching prediction. Identified areas for the advancement of prediction methods include improvements in sea surface temperature product resolution and past datasets, incorporating the influence of UV irradiance on coral bleaching, and locally-varying thermal bleaching thresholds.

Recent studies have demonstrated the usefulness of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from plants for estimating GPP. In this study, the relationships of GPP to SIF and Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) under different environmental conditions are established using carbon flux data at 61 sites distributed globally and coincident SIF data from OCO-2 and PRI data from MODIS. We analyzed OCO-2 SIF data at both 757 nm and 771 nm against instantaneous and daily GPP values derived from the tower flux data. Our results for these four cases are similar, and those with SIF at 757 nm and daily GPP show that: (1) a significant relationship is found between GPP and observed SIF (SIFobs) for all vegetation types (R-2 = 0.53, RMSE = 4.28 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) p < .001); (2) NIRv, a product of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and near-infrared reflectance, can be used as an approximation of the canopy-escaping probability of emitted SIF to convert observed SIF at one angle to the hemispherical SIF emission that is better correlated to GPP. The relationship between GPP and SIFobs/NIRv was considerably improved from that between GPP and SIFobs (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 3.39 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), p < .001); (3) The remaining scatter in the relationship between GPP and SIFobs/NIRv is significantly negatively correlated to PRI (R-2 = 0.28-0.34, p < .001), and PRI can be used to improve the relationship between GPP and SIFobs/NIRv, (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 3.04 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), p < .001); and (4) After the use of PRI in the regression, the variability of the slope of GPP against SIF among different plant functional types is greatly reduced from 33% to 19%. As PRI is an indicator of the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), a pathway that is in parallel of photochemical quenching and chlorophyll fluorescence, these improvements suggest that the information of NPQ from PRI can be used in addition to SIF for better GPP estimation.', '[Wang, Xiaoping; Chen, Jing M.; Ju, Weimin] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.

While many remote sensing methods have been developed for the detection and quantification of mortality in forested environments, woodland ecosystems present unique challenges to accurately mapping tree die-off due to relatively lower canopy covers, smaller and irregularly-shaped tree crowns, and greater influence of understory vegetation and soil cover on reflectance. To address these challenges, we developed a multi-sensor, multi-scale approach combining the analytical strengths of centimeter-resolution unmanned aerial system imagery for interpreting individual tree-level mortality, airborne lidar for crown mapping and quantifying percent canopy mortality, and Landsat imagery for upscaling mortality estimates to a regional scale. This approach utilizes a new algorithm for delineating the shapes of small, irregular woodland tree crowns using lidar. To demonstrate the application of this method, we map the extent and severity of a recent tree mortality event in pinon-juniper (PJ) woodlands of southeastern Utah. Our results suggest that 39% of PJ in this region has experienced some level of mortality, with patches exceeding 50% mortality. An analysis of potential mortality drivers revealed that canopy cover, terrain, and recent winter precipitation conditions are most directly linked with mortality, although the explanatory power of the mortality driver model was low. Our approach demonstrates a methodology that could be used for tree mortality mapping and scaling in a variety woodland ecosystems, and can provide a strong basis for further ecophysiological, ecological, and carbon cycle studies involving woodland tree mortality.', '[Campbell, Michael J.] Ft Lewis Coll, Dept Geosci, 1000 Rim Dr, Durango, CO 81301 USA.

We present a robust method to generate a consistent, continuous daily river water temperature (RWT) data series for medium and large rivers using the combined techniques of remote sensing and water temperature modelling. In order to validate our approach, we divided this study into two parts: (i) we evaluated methods to derive RWT from Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 TIRS imagery; and (ii) we evaluated the calibration and validation of river temperature models, using these data, to generate the continuous RWT data series. A 1.2 km section of the White River located near Hazleton, IN, USA, was selected to assess this method mainly due to river width and data availability. We tested three methods to retrieve RWT from Landsat 7 and four from Landsat 8, and we also applied a simple thermal sharpening technique. For Landsat 7, the methods showed bias and RMSE of 0.01-0.46 degrees C and 1.32-1.84 degrees C, while for Landsat 8, the methods showed bias and RMSE of 0.08-1.27 degrees C and 1.74-2.17 degrees C, and in both cases, the best results were found applying the radiative transfer equation with NASA\'s Atmospheric Correction Parameter Calculator. For the second part of the validation process, we compared a stochastic model and a hybrid model, air2stream, using as input two datasets: the RWT data derived from Landsat 7 only, and a combined dataset of both Landsat 7 and 8 derived RWT. The air2stream model outperformed the stochastic model when calibrated with Landsat 7 data only, with RMSE of 1.83 degrees C, but both models showed similar results when calibrated with the combined Landsat data, when air2stream showed RMSE of 1.58 degrees C. Due to its physical basis, better calibration procedure, and higher consistency, air2stream was considered the best model for deriving the continuous RWT data series. When compared to the measured daily mean RWT data, there was no observed tendency in under or overestimating the RWT in low or high temperature conditions by the modelled series. While further tests are needed in order to evaluate if our approach can be applied to analyse past behaviour and present trends, and the impacts of climate change on the temperature of rivers, the consistent results indicate that this approach has the potential to be applied in rivers with no measured temperature data, for example, in the spatial modelling of longitudinal profiles of rivers and the modelling of tributary river temperatures.', '[Tavares, Matheus Henrique; Farias Cunha, Augusto Hugo; Motta-Marques, David; Ruhoff, Anderson Luis] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Pesquisas Hidrdul, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.

Since the 1980s, the operational National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\'s (NOAA) airborne gamma radiation soil moisture (SM) and SWE survey has provided over 20,000 SWE observations to regional National Weather Service (NWS) River Forecast Centers (RFCs). Because the gamma SWE algorithm is based on the difference in natural gamma emission measurements from the soil between bare (fall) and snow-covered (winter) conditions, it requires a baseline fall SM for each flight line. The operational approach assumes the fall SM remains constant throughout that winter\'s SWE survey. However, early-winter snowmelt and rainfall events after the fall SM surveys have the potential to introduce large biases into airborne gamma SWE estimates. In this study, operational airborne gamma radiation SWE measurements were improved by updating the baseline fall SM with Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) enhanced SM measurements immediately prior to winter onset over the north-central and eastern United States and southern Canada from September 2015 to April 2018. The operational airborne gamma SM had strong agreement with the SMAP SM (Pearson\'s correlation coefficient, R = 0.69, unbiased root mean square difference, ubRMSD = 0.057 m(3)/m(3)), compared to the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) SM (R = 0.45, ubRMSD = 0.072 m(3)/m(3)) and the North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2) Mosaic SM products (R = 0.53, ubRMSD = 0.069 m(3)/m(3)) in non-forested regions.

One of the objectives of SMELR is to serve as an assessment tool and demonstration for a new Terrestrial Water Resources Satellite (TWRS) concept with one-dimensional synthetic aperture microwave techniques, for which soil moisture retrieval under variable satellite observing configurations (mainly in terms of incidence angels) is the greatest challenge. This proposed mission is targeted to provide continuity for the current satellite L-band microwave observations, and further improve the accuracy and spatial resolution of soil moisture mapping through the synergistic use of active, passive and optical remote sensing data. Multi-resolution, multi-angle and multi-spectral airborne data were obtained four times over a 70 km by 12 km area in the Shandian River basin, and one time over a 165 km by 5 km area that includes the Xiaoluan River basin. The near surface soil moisture (0 cm-5 cm) was measured extensively on the ground in fifty 1 km by 2 km quadrats (targeted to compare with the airborne radiometer), and two hundred and fifty 200 m by 200 m quadrats corresponding to radar observations. Two networks were established for continuous measurement of the soil moisture and temperature profile (3 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm, 50 cm) and precipitation in the Shandian and Xiaoluan River basin, respectively. Supporting ground measurements also included ground temperature, vegetation water content, surface roughness, continuous measurement of microwave emission and backscatter at a pasture site, reflectance of various land cover types, evapotranspiration and aerosol observations. Preliminary results within the experimental area indicate that (1) the near surface soil moisture spatial variability at a 200 m scale was up to similar to 0.1 cm(3)/cm(3) at an intermediate value of similar to 0.35 cm(3)/cm(3). (2) The difference of soil and vegetation temperature in grass and croplands reach its maximum of 11 K around solar noon time, and the soil temperature gradient is largest at around 15 P.M. (3) Both the airborne and ground measurements cover a wide range of conditions. The L-band active and passive observations exhibit a large variation of similar to 30 dB and similar to 80 K, respectively, corresponding to soil moisture range from 0.1 cm(3)/cm(3) to 0.5 cm(3)/cm(3). The sensitivity of both active and passive data to soil moisture is compared at corresponding spatial resolutions and show high information complementarity for better accuracy and resolution soil moisture retrieval.', '[Zhao, Tianjie; Shi, Jiancheng; Jia, Li; Chen, Liangfu; Zhao, Limin; Zheng, Chaolei; Ji, Dabin; Wang, Tianxing; Li, Rui; Pan, Jinmei; Wen, Jianguang; Yu, Chao; Zheng, Yaomin; Hu, Lu; Geng, Deyuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, 20 Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) provides CTH parameters with high accuracy, but with limited temporal-spatial resolution. Recently, the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard Japanese Himawari-8/-9, provides high temporal (every 10 min) and high spatial (2 km at nadir) resolution measurements with 16 spectral bands. This paper reports on a study to derive the CTH from combined AHI and CALIPSO using advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms with better accuracy than that from the traditional physical (TRA) algorithms. We find significant CTH improvements (1.54-2.72 km for mean absolute error, MAE) from four different machine learning algorithms (original MAE from TRA method is about 3.24 km based on CALIPSO data validation), particularly in high and optically thin clouds. In addition, we also develop a joint algorithm to combine optimal machine learning and traditional physical (TRA) algorithms of CTH to further reduce MAE to 1.53 km and enhance the layered accuracy (CTH < 18 km). While the ML-based algorithm improves CTH retrieval over the TRA algorithm, the lower or higher clouds still exhibit relatively large uncertainty. Combining both methods provides the better CTH than either alone. The combined approach could be used to process data from advanced geostationary imagers for climate and weather applications.', '[Min, Min] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China.

In contrast to other multiplexing hyperspectral solutions (e.g Michelson interferometer), it does not require moving parts, allowing for a robust system without aggressive engineering solutions.

Owing to its pixel resolution of 500 m and large set of spectral solar channels, GOCI can also be considered for applications related to the characterization of vegetation and the retrieval of aerosol properties over land. However, to apply it for the full characterization of land, it is mandatory to properly remove clouds from the images. Such a procedure has limitations when there is a lack of thermal bands, as is the case with GOCI. However, GOCI data are impacted by shadows and radiation scattering effects during the daily course of the sun. Although this yields strong directional effects, the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) can be determined to a high level of accuracy. This information is used as a reference to detect clouds over land because surface BRDF varies slowly with time compared to that of clouds. The proposed algorithm relies on knowledge of the BRDF field derived from the application of a semi-empirical model that simulates the minimum difference between top and bottom of atmosphere reflectance values as the baseline of clear atmosphere. This step also serves to estimate background surface reflectance underneath clouds. Accuracy assessment of the new GOCI cloud mask product is appraised through a comparison with high-resolution vertical profiles of lidar data from the polar orbiting Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO). The results for the Probability Of Detection (POD) of all cloud types was found to be 0.831 for GOCI; this is comparable to that of MODIS (0.772). For the case of only thin cirrus, GOCI POD value was assessed to be 0.849, similar to that of MODIS, underlining the improved efficiency of determining thin cloud pixels.', '[Yeom, Jong -Min; Kim, Hye-Won] Korea Aerosp Res Inst, Daejeon, South Korea.

Among many sources, the multi-decade Landsat archive is certainly the best known, but legacy and current data from other sensors is available as well through the USGS data portals: these include CBERS, ASTER, and more. Though the particular band combinations or non-global missions have made their integration into analyses more challenging, these data, in conjunction with the entire Landsat record, are available to contribute to multi-decade surveys of land-cover change.   With the goal of tracing forest change through time near the Roosevelt River in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, we used BULC and Google Earth Engine to fuse information from 13 space-borne imagers capturing 140 images spanning 45 years. With high accuracy, the resulting time series of classifications shows the timing and location of land-use/land-cover change-both deforestation and regrowth-at sub-annual time scales. Accuracy estimates showed that the synthesized BULC classification time series was better than nearly all of the single-day image classifications, covering the entire study area at sub-annual frequency while reducing the impact of clouds and most unwanted noise as it fused information derived from a wide array of imaging platforms. The time series improved and gradually sharpened as the density of observations increased in recent decades, when there were three or more clear, higher-resolution views of a pixel annually from any sensor combination. In addition to detailing the methodology and results of multi-source data fusion with the BULC approach, this study raises timely points about integrating information from early satellite data sources and from sensors with footprints smaller than Landsat\'s. There are decades of research deriving sensor-specific techniques for classifying land use and land cover from a single image in a variety of settings.

If not treated, the effect of bottom reflectance will interfere with the correct retrieval of Water Constituent Concentrations (WCCs) from hyperspectral and multi-spectral remote sensing observations. To study this phenomenon in more detail, the existing semi-infinite 2SeaColour Radiative Transfer (RT) model was modified into a finite water layer model, bounded by a diffusely reflecting surface at the sea-bottom. From simulations with the new model, called Water - Sea Bottom (WSB) model, it was observed that a ratio of spectral bands in the Near-Infrared, bands 750 nm and 900 nm, is nearly insensitive to the WCCs and increases with the shallowness of the water, and therefore can be used as a robust index to detect OSWs. The newly established Near-Infrared Bottom Effect Index (NISEI) was applied to a series of satellite observations over the Wadden Sea during high and low tidal phases. Images from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) were processed to retrieve WCCs of the study area. The results indicate that the sea-bottom effect in OSWs affects the accuracy of atmospheric correction and retrievals. On the other hand, applying the NIBEI to flag OSWs improves the reliability and consistency of WCCs maps. The application of proposed NIBEI on satellite images requires only Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) radiances at 750 nm and 900 nm and does not depend on atmospheric correction and ancillary local input data (e.g., bathymetry map, bottom type, empirical coefficients, in-situ measurements). As a result, the proposed NISEI can readily be applied to detect OSWs on various ocean colour remote sensors in various shallow coastal regions.', '[Arabi, Behnaz; Salama, Mhd.

These integrated analyses allow examination of temporal and spatial variations of the soil moisture response between locations dominated by sulfate soils and those with immature, silicate-mineral soils. The radar dataset captures at least four separate rain events within the 2015-2017 timeframe, two of which were regionally devastating. The lack of vegetation in this region allows us to discriminate between contributions to the InSAR coherence from permanent changes of the landscape (e.g., erosion or deposition) and transient changes associated with soil moisture variability. The spatial distribution and character of the transient InSAR response depends strongly on soil type, and is remarkably repeatable between rain events. The areas that experienced permanent changes included river channels, steep slopes, playas, and sites of anthropogenic activity, such as roads, mines, or telescope construction. Ground-based observations of soil moisture after each event also exhibit a strong dependence on soil type. The observations presented here demonstrate how InSAR data can constrain variations in soil moisture with high spatial resolution over large regions, complementing the higher-sensitivity but sparser field sites and enabling discrimination of inter-event variability and analysis of longer-term changes in soil mineralogy in arid regions.', '[Jordan, Teresa E.; Lohman, Rowena B.] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.

The optimality of OE depends on the errors in the prior, measurements and forward model being zero mean and having well-known error covariance. Often these assumptions are not met. We show how to use matches of satellite observations to in situ reference measurements to estimate parameters for use in OE that bring the retrieval framework closer to the theoretical optimality. This is done by retrieving bias correction and error covariance parameters. Bias correction parameters for some components of the retrieved state and for the satellite radiances are anchored by the in situ reference measurements, and are obtained by a modification of Kalman filtering. Error covariance matrices for the prior state and for the observation-simulation difference are iteratively obtained by applying equations for diagnosing internal retrieval consistency. The theory is applied to the case of OE of sea surface temperature from a sensor on a geostationary platform. Relative to an initial OE implementation, all measures of retrieval performance are improved when the optimised OE is tested on independent data: mean difference from validation data is reduced from -0.08 K to -0.01 K, and the standard deviation from 0.47 to 0.45 K; retrieval sensitivity to sea surface temperature increases from 71% to 76%; and a 20% underestimation of retrieval uncertainty is corrected. Perhaps more significant than the quantitative improvements are the coherent new insights into the forward model simulations and prior assumptions that are also obtained. These include estimates of prior bias in the absence of in situ information, an important consideration when in situ information is not globally distributed. Biases and lack of information about error covariances arise in remote sensing very often. While illustrated here for a particular case, the principles and methods we present for constraining that lack of knowledge systematically using ground truth will be widely applicable in remote sensing.', '[Merchant, Christopher J.; Waller, Joanne] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6AL, Berks, England.

We assume that CNNs, due to their potential invariance to size and illumination of objects, are best suited to predict the highly context-based LCZs on a large scale. As a first step, the proposed workflow includes a fully automated generation of cloud-free S2 composites. These composites serve as training data basis for the LCZ classifications carried out over eight German cities. Results show that by using a CNN, overall accuracies can be increased by an average of 16.5 and 4.8 percentage points when compared to a pixel-based and a texture-based Random Forest approach, respectively. If sufficient training data is available, CNN models proved to be robust in classifying unknown cities and achieved overall accuracies of up to 86.5%.

Despite the reticence of using satellite soil moisture data in forest areas, there is evidence that in some cases, good and reliable results have been obtained. Forests cover very important continental areas and have great importance in many natural processes related to water resources, biodiversity and climate. For these reasons, it is interesting to investigate the applicability of remote sensing soil moisture products for new applications in these environments. In the present study, the CCI (Climate Change Initiative, Global Monitoring of Essential Climate Variables, European Space Agency) soil moisture (CCISM) database has been correlated with the tree-growth series of 22 samples of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) in Spain in different locations and environmental conditions. Aleppo pine is the most widespread pine species in the Mediterranean basin, and therefore, it is highly representative of the bioclimatic conditions in these water-limited environments. The series spans from 1978 to 2016, and the daily CCISM has been correlated with the annual tree-growth anomalies. The daily CCISM has been obtained using a moving window scheme with 1-, 7-, 15- and 30-day averages, starting on October 1st of the previous year and finishing on December 31st of the corresponding year. Another soil moisture product (Lisflood model) and precipitation have also been used in a similar approach to strengthen the assessment analysis. The results obtained show a clear temporal pattern of the relationship between satellite soil moisture and Aleppo pine tree growth, and the influence of soil moisture on tree-growth dynamics increases with reduced water availability. The CCISM was able to detect a bimodal pattern of tree growth with a maximum in May and a secondary peak in autumn. This temporal pattern was much clearer than that obtained using the modeled soil moisture and the precipitation. This study proves that satellite soil moisture is sensitive enough to track the phenology of this forest species.

Merged satellite (SeaWiFS-MODIS/Aqua-MERIS-VIIRS) Chl-a was calculated using the OC5 Ifremer algorithm which is optimized for moderately-turbid waters. The seasonal cycle in satellite-derived Chl-a was compared with in situ measurements made at seven coastal stations located in the southern side of the English Channel and in the northern Bay of Biscay. The results firstly showed that the satellite Chl-a product, derived from a suite of space-borne marine reflectance data, is in agreement with the coastal observations. For compliance with the directives of the European Union on water quality, time-series of 6-year moving average of Chl-a were assessed over the region. A clear decline was observed in the mean and 90th percentile of Chl-a at stations located in the mixed waters of the English Channel. The time-series at the stations located in the Bay of Biscay showed yearly fluctuations which correlated well with river discharge, but no overall Chl-a trend was observed. In the English Channel, the shape of the seasonal cycle in Chl-a changed over time. Narrower peaks were observed in spring at the end of the studied period, indicating an earlier limitation by nutrients. Monthly averages of satellite Chl-a, over the periods 1998-2003 and 2012-2017, exhibited spatial and temporal patterns in the evolution of the phytoplankton biomass similar to these observed at the seven coastal stations. Both the in situ and satellite Chl-a times-series showed a decrease in Chl-a in the English Channel in May, June and July. This trend in phytoplankton biomass is correlated with lower river discharges at the end of the period and a constant reduction in the riverine input of phosphorus through improvements in the water quality of the surrounding river catchments.', '[Gohin, Francis; Andrieux-Loyer, Francoise; Lampert, Luis] IFREMER, Lab Ecol Pelag, DYNECO PELAGOS, CS 10070, F-29280 Plouzane, France.

Satellite imagery has opened numerous ways for mapping population distribution - previously unattainable without conducting a resource intensive census. While great advances have been made in urban population mapping, large gaps still exist for rural and remote populations which tend to be the most vulnerable to environmental, economic, and socio-political change. Moderate resolution remote sensing data, such as Landsat, has generally been viewed as insufficient for rural mapping given its coarseness relative to the size of a rural dwelling. This paper presents an approach for detecting small rural settlements within Ann Township of Rakhine State, a remote region of Myanmar with a highly mobile population, by combining Landsat data with publicly available auxiliary geospatial data. The key to the success of detecting small settlements at the Landsat resolution was the inclusion of multi-temporal auxiliary data sensitive to human activity patterns in the regions, such as distance to water, change in seasonal vegetation signals, and distance to a recent active fire. The use of active fire in this context is novel and provided a key metric that increased the accuracy of the resultant map. The final dataset has a classification accuracy of 86.5% on a per-pixel basis and 93.1% on a location identification basis. Numerous small settlements (on the order of 2-3 structures in some cases) not previously mapped by other datasets are identified, revealing that the population of Ann Township is far more dispersed and isolated than previously mapped. This study concludes that by incorporating regionally specific characteristics, moderate resolution remotely sensed data can be used to successfully map geographically marginalized communities so that services and aid are better able to reach them.', '[Hoffman-Hall, Amanda; Loboda, Tatiana V.; Hall, Joanne V.; Chen, Dong] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, 2181 LeFrak Hall,7251 Preinkert Dr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

Documenting and protecting ACH is the common responsibility and duty of all humanity. It is governed by UNESCO along with the scientific communities that foster and encourage the use of advanced non-invasive techniques and methods for promoting scientific research into ACH and conservation of ACH sites. The use of remote sensing, a non-destructive tool, is increasingly popular by specialists around the world as it allows fast prospecting and mapping at multiple scales, rapid analysis of multisource datasets, and dynamic monitoring of ACH sites and their surrounding environments. The cost of using remote sensing is lower or even zero in practical applications. In this review, in order to discuss the advantages of airborne and spaceborne remote sensing (ASRS), the principles that make passive (photography, multispectral and hyperspectral) and active (synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and light detection and ranging radar (LiDAR)) imaging techniques suitable for ACH applications are first summarized and pointed out; a review of ASRS and the methodologies used over the past century is then presented together with relevant highlights from well-known research projects. Selected case studies from Mediterranean regions to East Asia illustrate how ASRS can be used effectively to investigate and understand archaeological features at multiple-scales and to monitor and assess the conservation status of cultural heritage sites in the context of sustainable development.

Moderate spectral and spatial resolution satellite observation has become a tool to perform such monitoring across different spatial and temporal scales. Yet, one major challenge in urban remote sensing is the high spatial heterogeneity causing the presence of image pixels constituting a mixture of different land cover materials. Here we apply an automated unmixing procedure specifically designed to optimally account for the pronounced spectral variability (i.e. high within-class and low between-class variability) prevailing in urban settings. The approach is based on Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA), a data dimensionality reduction technique in which between-class variability is maximized and within-class variability is minimized while transforming spectra from the reflectance to the Fisher feature space. We integrated the FDA transformation in the widely-applied Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) approach in an attempt to more effectively address the endmember variability problem. We made use of online spectral libraries to train the Fisher transformation parameters and steer the automated selection of image endmembers. Our Fisher transformed MESMA algorithm (F-MESMA) was tested on medium spatial resolution Landsat scenes and impervious fraction maps were generated for five major cities located in different regions of the world. The output of F-MESMA was compared to the output of state-of-the-art spectral mixture analysis approaches which were specifically designed to reduce endmember variability issues. We could demonstrate that compared to other spectral transformation approaches, the ratio of within- vs between-class variability of the endmembers was most strongly reduced after applying the Fisher transformation. As a direct consequence, across all five cities F-MESMA consistently provided the most accurate impervious surface fraction estimates (RMSEF-MESMA = 0.13 vs. RMSEalternative approaches = [0.16-0.17]).', '[Xu, Fei; Somers, Ben] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, Leuven, Belgium.

However, the cloud droplet size distribution estimated using the conventional POLDER algorithm is limited by its coarse spatial resolution (150 km) and insufficient information for large droplets (CDR > 15 mu m). In this study, we proposed an improved primary cloudbow retrieval (PCR) algorithm to estimate CDR and EV from POLDER. Simulated retrievals based on a radiative transfer model indicate that primary cloudbow measurements are sensitive to large droplets (CDR > 15 mu m) and enable the retrieval to be applied at a higher spatial resolution; therefore, we employ POLDER polarized measurements from both primary and supernumerary cloudbow regions in the PCR algorithm. Retrieval cases using POLDER measurements reveal that the PCR algorithm is robust when the cloud fields are homogeneous. When the cloud field is heterogeneous, the estimation of CDR is sensitive to the scattering angle ranges as well as the grid size, with uncertainty < 1 mu m. In addition, a spatial resolution of 40-60 km is suitable for the PCR algorithm based on the relationship between the retrieval grid size and the total successful retrievals. Further comparisons between the PCR retrievals and operational products are conducted on the global scale using POLDER measurements for February, May, August and November 2008, revealing that PCR retrievals agree well with operational products on the global scale as CDR < 15 mu m. Our analysis indicates that most of the large droplets estimated using the conventional procedure are overestimated due to the absence of primary cloudbow measurements. The PCR algorithm permits an extended range of CDR (3-25 mu m) and EV (0.01-0.29) estimates and a higher resolution (40-60 km) in the retrieval.', '[Shang, Huazhe; Letu, Husi; Ma, Run; Wang, Ziming; Chen, Liangfu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.

Accurate and up to date information on areas affected by fire is critical to better understand drivers of fire activity, as well as its relevance for biogeochemical cycles, climate, air quality, and to aid fire management. Mapping burned areas was traditionally done from field sketches. With the launch of the first Earth observation satellites, remote sensing quickly became a more practical alternative to detect burned areas, as they provide timely regional and global coverage of fire occurrence. This review paper explores the physical basis to detect burned area from satellite observations, describes the historical trends of using satellite sensors to monitor burned areas, summarizes the most recent approaches to map burned areas and evaluates the existing burned area products (both at global and regional scales).

The results of the comparisons with the former v02.2 version (before the inclusion of the SM retrieved by the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission, SMOS, in the CCI dataset) showed that the combined CCI performed better than the active or passive, affording correlation coefficients (R) above 0.8 and errors between 0.03 and 0.08 m(3) m(-3) for the area-average, with biases close to zero. Regarding the land uses and environmental conditions, the stations that were located in the agricultural areas and some forested areas showed the best results, and those that were located in pasture and certain specific agricultural locations showed the poorest results.   To test the opportunity of including SMOS in CCI, both datasets were compared over the same areas and coincident periods. After the results, the combined CCI and SMOS SM products matched very well (R = 0.83 on average), although the SMOS and CCI under- and overestimate the ground soil moisture measurements, respectively.   Finally, the new version of the combined CCI (v03.2, after including SMOS) showed similar correlations to the previous one, but it significantly reduced the bias, leading to slightly lower errors (RMSD and cRMSD).

In August of 2014, we examined the vertical structure of a cyanobacteria bloom across the western basin of Lake Erie with new technologies, including LIDAR and a digital holographic system. In addition, vertical profiles of environmental and optical properties were made. The active LIDAR penetrated the water column, and provided a detailed picture of the particle distribution for the whole water column. The holographic system provided digital images processed for particle size, count and identification of Microcystis and Planktothrix - the two main cyanobacteria genera that were present. The correlations between the LIDAR backscatter intensity and the cyanobacteria cell counts from holography averaged to 0.53 and ranged from -0.13 to 0.96 based on nearest matchups. The vertical structure of the overall cyanobacteria population was influenced by wind speed, and to a lesser degree the solar heating of surface waters. On a more detailed level, Microcystis populations were consistently nearer to the surface relative to Planktothrix. Pigments from surface samples revealed a higher degree of photoprotection for Planktothrix-dominated communities. The vertical distributions of the cyanobacteria genera were related to light intensity in the water column and known tolerances and/or preferences for each genus. Vertical profiles of optical properties supported the patterns seen in the LIDAR and holographic data, and had direct implications on the exiting light field. These combined data provide a unique view into the natural variations in spatial (vertical and horizontal) distribution patterns of cyanobacteria and resulting impacts on remote sensing detection and associated interpretations, and demonstrate the potential for these technologies to observe cyanobacteria in lake environments.', '[Moore, Timothy S.] Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA.

Until new satellite platforms and sensors are available, only nighttime images taken with DSLR cameras from the International Space Station (ISS), airplanes, balloons or other such platforms can provide the required information. Here we describe a theoretical approach using colour-colour diagrams to analyse images taken by astronauts on the ISS to estimate spatial and temporal variation in the spectrum of artificial lighting emissions. We then evaluate how this information can be used to determine effects on some key environmental indices: photopic vision, the Melatonin Suppression Index, the Star Light Index, the Induced Photosynthesis Index, production of NO2-NO radicals, energy efficiency and CO2 emissions, and Correlated Colour Temperature.

However, due to the trade-off between the spatial and temporal resolutions in remote sensing, such data are still unavailable. Many studies have been conducted to resolve this dilemma, but difficulties remain in generating high-spatiotemporal-resolution (i.e., diurnal, e.g., 30 m resolution) LSTs. Accordingly, this study proposes a weighted combination of kernel-driven and fusion-based methods (termed CKFM) to enhance the resolution of time series LSTs; the kernel-driven process can obtain abundant spatial details from visible bands, while the fusion-based process is applied for its spatiotemporal prediction ability. CKFM contains three parts. First, a kernel-driven method is applied to predict high-resolution LSTs via a regression relationship between simulated medium-resolution LSTs and kernels. Second, a fusion-based method is applied to predict the medium-resolution LST, the result of which is used for thin plate spline (TPS) downscaling. Finally, the results of the kernel-driven and fusion-based processes are combined via weights calculated from error estimations. Compared with existing thermal sharpening methods, CKFM has the following strengths: (1) it fully utilizes the available visible and thermal bands from multiple sensors, thereby obtaining spatial details in a variety of ways; (2) it downscales LSTs in a dynamic manner; and (3) it is suitable for heterogeneous regions. CKFM is tested with Landsat 8 and MODIS data and successfully downscales the 1 km resolution MODIS LSTs into 30 m resolution data. In both visual and quantitative evaluations, CKFM is more accurate and robust than the kernel-driven method with an improvement of 0.1-0.6 K, and it reconstructs more spatial details than the fusion-based process. Based on these characteristics, CKFM is a promising method for generating daily high spatial resolution LSTs for various environmental studies.', '[Xia, Haiping; Chen, Yunhao; Li, Ying] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

Tree defoliation is usually assessed with field campaigns, where experts estimate multiple tree health indicators per sample site. Campaigns span entire countries to come up with a holistic, nationwide picture of forest health. Surveys are very laborious, expensive, time-consuming and need a large number of experts. We aim at making the monitoring process more efficient by casting tree defoliation estimation as an image interpretation problem. What makes this task challenging is the strong variance in lighting, viewpoint, scale, tree species, and defoliation types. Instead of accounting for each factor separately through explicit modeling, we learn a joint distribution directly from a large set of annotated training images following the end-to-end learning paradigm of deep learning.   The proposed workflow works as follows: (i) Human experts visit individual trees in forests distributed all over Switzerland, (ii) acquire one photo per tree with an off-the-shelf, hand-held RGB camera, and (iii) assign a defoliation value. The CNN approach is (iv) trained on a subset of the images with expert defoliation assessments and (v) tested on a hold-out part to check predicted values against ground truth.   We evaluate our supervised method on three data sets with different level of difficulty acquired in Swiss forests and achieve an average mean absolute error (avgMAE) of 7.6% for the joint data set after cross-validation. Comparison to a group of human experts on one of the data sets shows that our CNN approach performs only 0.9% points worse. We show that tree defoliation estimation from ground-level RGB images with a CNN works well and achieves performance close to human experts.', '[Kalin, Ursula; Lang, Nico; Wegner, Jan Dirk] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing Grp, EcoVis Lab, Zurich, Switzerland.

Most existing approaches retrieve SIF at around few discrete absorption lines. However, the full SIF spectrum can provide more information on the functional status of photosynthetic machinery. European Space Agency\'s FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) mission, to be launched in 2022, is dedicated to the accurate reconstruction of the full SIF spectrum over land and incorporates the heights and positions of the two SIF peaks and the total fluorescence emission (spectrally-integrated value) into planned Level-2 products.   In this paper, an advanced Fluorescence Spectrum Reconstruction (aFSR) method was proposed to reconstruct the full SIF spectrum by capitalizing on the features of existing methods. The aFSR method used linear combinations of basis spectra to approximate the spectra of SIF and the reflectance factor and exploited all available bands within the spectral range of SIF emission for spectral fitting of SIF and reflected radiance. The number of basis spectra of the reflectance factor used was self-adaptively determined based on the Bayesian information criterion. A comprehensive intercomparison between the aFSR method and three other methods (i.e., the Fluorescence Spectrum Reconstruction method, the Full-spectrum Spectral Fitting Method, and the SpecFit method) was performed using simulated and experimental datasets. For simulated datasets, the impact of spectral resolution (SR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), atmospheric correction, canopy structure, leaf biochemical parameters and directional effect on the accuracy of SIF spectrum reconstruction was considered. Results show that while all methods could achieve the accuracy standard set by the FLEX mission (average absolute relative error of spectrally-integrated SIF < 10%) when spectral resolving power and SNR were high (e.g., SR s 0.3 nm and SNR >= 700), aFSR generally provided the highest reconstruction accuracy. For the first time we investigated the performance of the SIF spectrum reconstruction on 3-D radiative transfer (RT) simulations and compared with that on typical 1-D simulations. The increase of canopy heterogeneity from 1-D to 3-D did not noticeably deteriorate the accuracy of aFSR, implying that aFSR was applicable to different canopy structures. The aFSR method was also more robust than other methods as it was less affected by atmospheric correction and directional effect. For the experimental dataset, the SIF spectra reconstructed by aFSR agreed well with literature in terms of shape, magnitude and diurnal variation and were in agreement with the other methods: the coefficient of determination and the root-mean-square error between the reconstruction results of aFSR and the average of the SIF spectra reconstructed through three other methods were higher than 0.93 and lower than 0.09 W.m(-2).sr(-1).mu m(-1), respectively.', '[Zhao, Feng; Li, Rong] Beihang Univ, Sch Instrumentat Sci & Optoelect Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.

The intrinsic black-sky albedo (BSA) and white-sky albedo (WSA) values of the surface are derived at the six shortwave spectral bands of Sentinel-2A\'s Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI). A specific set of narrow-to-broadband conversion coefficients is derived from radiative transfer simulations and presented for the generation of broadband albedos. Initial evaluation uses well-calibrated ground-based albedo measurements by pyranometers mounted on the towers at seven sites of the Surface Radiation Network (SURFRAD). Over those sites where pyranometer measurement footprints are not spatially representative of the landscape covered by the satellite pixels (i.e., spatially nonrepresentative) at the grid scales (500 m to 1 km) of the MODIS and VIIRS products, the finer-resolution Sentinel 2A albedos manifested a pronounced decrease in root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean bias in the evaluation against the ground-based data as compared to the coarser resolution albedo products of MODIS and VIIRS. This decrease occurs because the 20-m Sentinel-2A albedo values are better able to resolve the spatial details of surface albedo within the ground-based instrument footprints than the coarser resolution sensors. This preliminary evaluation also demonstrates the consistency of the Sentinel-2A albedo results whether using the MODIS BRDF or the VIIRS BRDF products for the surface anisotropy information. The RMSEs and mean biases of the Sentinel-2A albedos over all the seven validation sites are both within the accuracy requirement of 0.05 absolute albedo units for satellite derived albedo products. This study, to generate Sentinel-2A MSI albedo with either MODIS or VIIRS BRDFs, extends previous efforts of Landsat TM, ETM + and OLI albedo and enhances the continuity of finer-resolution albedo data. Such long-term and higher resolution records of surface albedo improve the investigations into the changes and drivers of local/regional surface energy balance over heterogeneous regions and increasingly fragmented landscapes across the globe due to natural and human-induced land cover changes.', '[Li, Zhan; Erb, Angela; Sun, Qingsong; Liu, Yan; Shuai, Yanmin; Boucher, Peter; Schaaf, Crystal] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Environm, Boston, MA 02125 USA.

Since the late 1990s, however, this tendency of spring phenology advancement has been weakened in over 60% of boreal forests, particularly in Siberia (- 0.58 day yr(-1) for 1982-1997 vs. - 0.17 day yr(-1) for 1982-2013) and northwestern North America (NWNA; -0.42 day yr(-1) for 1982-1997 vs. 0.07 day yr(-1) for 1982-2013). This study investigated the major factor in the weakening trends in the advancement of the start of the growing season (SOS) based on the satellite-observed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in two regions by quantifying the effects of four climatic fields winter duration (WD; the number of freezing days), pre-season temperature (PT; accumulated temperature from late winter to early spring), green-up temperature (GT; accumulated temperature around the green-up date), and pre-season precipitation (PR; accumulated precipitation before the green-up date) on changes in the spring green-up trend. The GT explained the majority of the slowdown in the SOS trends in recent decades. In Siberia, the GT increases contributed to the advancement of the SOS during the 1980s and 1990s; however, the GT increase reduced to less than half of these periods resulting in a slowdown of the SOS advancing trend since the early 2000s. In NWNA, GT increases and WD shortening drove the SOS advancement until the late 1990s; however, both effects have been diminished to near zero to result in no further SOS advancements. This study demonstrates that the recent slowdown of the SOS advancing trends over Siberia and NWNA was largely attributed to the weakening of the warming trends, rather than the sensitivity changes of spring phenology to climate variables. This study suggests that the natural climate variability strongly affects the decadal variations in the boreal forest spring phenology.', '[Park, Hoonyoung; Ho, Chang-Hoi] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul, South Korea.

Overall strong decorrelation was observed for images acquired under unfrozen conditions or thawing conditions. Coherence was best preserved under stable frozen conditions and, in addition, short perpendicular component of the interferometric baseline (i.e., < 300 m). Stem volume was estimated with the Interferometric Water Cloud Model (IWCM) and multi-temporal combination of single-image estimates.

Breeding colonies of the Antarctic petrel are often found on isolated nunataks far from inhabited stations, some up to hundreds of kilometers from the shoreline. It is difficult therefore to monitor and census known colonies, and it is believed that undiscovered breeding locations remain to be found. We developed an algorithm that can detect Antarctic petrel colonies and used it to complete a continent-wide survey using Landsat-8 Operational Line Imager (OLI) imagery in Antarctica up to the southernmost extent of Landsat\'s orbital view at 82.68 degrees S. Our survey successfully identified 8 known Antarctic petrel colonies containing 86% of the known population of Antarctic petrels. The survey also identified what appears to be a significant population of breeding birds in areas not known to host breeding Antarctic petrel colonies. Our survey suggests that the breeding population at Mt. Biscoe (66 degrees 13\'S 51 degrees 21\'E), currently reported to be in the 1000s, may actually be on the order of 400,000 breeding pairs, which would make it the largest known Antarctic petrel breeding colony in the world. The algorithm represents a first-ever attempt to apply satellite remote sensing to assess the distribution and abundance of the Antarctic petrel on a continent-wide basis. As such, we note several algorithm shortcomings and identify research topics for algorithm improvement. Even with these caveats, our algorithm for identifying Antarctic petrel colonies with Landsat imagery demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring their populations using satellite remote sensing and identifies breeding locations, including Mt. Biscoe, that should be considered high priorities for validation with directed field surveys.', '[Schwaller, Mathew R.; Lynch, Heather J.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.

This paper described the construction of a novel population spatialization method by combining land use/cover data and night-light data. Based on the analysis of data characteristics, the method used partial correlation analysis and geographically weighted regression to improve the distribution accuracy and reduce regional errors. China\'s census data for the years 1990, 2000, and 2010 were assessed. The results showed that the method was better at population spatialization than methods that use only night-light data or land use/cover data and global linear regression.

However, the 3D distribution of the point clouds depends not only on stand structure, but also on scan angle, because the probability for an oblique beam to be reflected by the canopy increases with the distance it must travel through the canopy. Thus, the canopy appears to increase in density as the incidence angle increases, all else being equal. The resulting variation between and within datasets can induce bias in LiDAR metrics derived from the vertical distribution of points. In this study, we modelled the effect of scan angle on the vertical structure of the point clouds to predict the bias of metrics derived from points sampled off-nadir. Comparison with paired observations from different flightlines (off- and at-nadir observations of the same point) demonstrated that the model accurately reproduced the bias of metrics calculated for a northern hardwood forest with relatively continuous canopy. Thus, the model could be used to correct the bias of LiDAR metrics, and provides a mathematical framework that could be used to inform the selection of maximum incidence angle in LiDAR surveys, considering the trade-off between decreasing acquisition costs and obtaining unbiased measurements.', '[Roussel, Jean-Romain; Achim, Alexis] Univ Laval, Pavillon Gene H Kruger, Ctr Rech Mat Renouvelables, Dept Sci Bois & Foret, 2425 Rue Terrasse, Laval, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.

Such information includes solar reflectance, thermal emission, passive microwave emissions at a higher frequency, radar backscatter, soil or surface attributes such as topography and soil properties, and land surface modelling.

The relationships between precipitation and topography in the TP were investigated using 17 years of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar (PR) data and 2 years of Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR) data. First, the retrieval and total errors of the two radars were quantified in the TP using ground-based precipitation datasets. The TRMM PR and GPM DPR both significantly underestimate the precipitation, with total errors up to 40% and 53%, respectively. Then, precipitation of the two radars was corrected prior to effective application. The correction was separately performed for each river basin in the TP by adding total errors. Finally, precipitation topography relationships were documented using corrected radar data. The main findings on precipitation topography relationships are: (1) precipitation generally decreases with increasing elevation from 2 to 6 km in the TP. However, the trend is inverse in the Qaidam Basin which is characterized by extremely low precipitation in the interior basin and high precipitation along the windward slopes of surrounding mountains; (2) quantitative relationships between precipitation and elevation can be depicted for most exorheic basins in the TP using exponential fitting. The coefficients of determination for the fitting are higher than 0.9 in six basins; (3) the relationships based on GPM DPR data are less robust due to its fewer samples, whereas the GPM DPR probably resolves the problem of overestimating precipitation in some grid pixels with high elevation, compared to the TRMM PR; (4) three typical mountains (i.e., Himalaya, Hengduan, and Tianshan mountains) exhibit significantly negative correlation between precipitation and elevation. Particularly, there are two bands of precipitation maxima along the southern slopes of the central Himalayas (78 degrees E-88 degrees E), corresponding to the two-step topography, which affects the vegetation distribution. This study provides insights into the precipitation topography relationships in the TP and its surrounding regions based on data from spaceborne precipitation radars.', '[Tang, Guoqiang; Long, Di; Hong, Yang; Gao, Jinyu; Wan, Wei] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Room A207, Beijing, Peoples R China.

Besides spatial, seasonal and interannual variations, GPP also exhibits strong diurnal variations. Satellite retrieved solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) provides a spatially continuous, but temporally discrete measurement of plant photosynthesis, and has the potential to be used to estimate GPP at global scale. However, it remains unclear whether the seasonal time series of SIF snapshots taken at a fixed time of the day can be used to infer daily total GPP variation at spatial and seasonal scales. In this study, we first used GPP estimates from 135 eddy covariance flux sites, covering a wide range of geographic locations and biome types, to investigate the relationship between the instantaneous GPP (GPP(inst)) and daily GPP (GPP(daily)) on the seasonal course for different times of the day. Latitudinal and diurnal patterns were found to correspond to variations in photo-synthetically active radiation (PAR) and light use efficiency (LUE), respectively. We then used the Soil-Canopy Observation Photosynthesis and Energy Balance (SCOPE) model and the FluxCom GPP product to investigate the instantaneous and daily SIF-GPP relationships at five flux tower sites along a latitudinal gradient and at a global scale for different biome types. The results showed that daily SIF had a stronger linear correlation with daily GPP than instantaneous SIF at the seasonal scale, with an instantaneous to daily SIF conversion factor following the latitudinal and seasonal pattern driven by PAR. Our study highlights the necessity to take the latitudinal and diurnal factors into consideration for SIF-GPP relationship analyses or for physiological phenology analyses based on SIF.', '[Zhang, Yao; Xiao, Xiangming] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Microbiol & Plant Biol, Ctr Spatial Anal, Norman, OK 73019 USA.

Newly formed sea ice areas both provide favourable routing for ship traffic, and are key to Arctic climate science because they enable heat exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere. Our data set encompasses three different frequencies, X-, C- and L-band, at a range of incidence angles, and were acquired under different environmental conditions. Our results suggest that by combining the scattering entropy and the co-polarization ratio we can successfully separate the newly formed sea ice from open water and thicker sea ice within all three frequencies throughout the winter and spring season. We observe a high correlation between scattering entropy values calculated using quad-polarization C- and L-band data and scattering entropy values calculated using the same scenes reduced to the co-polarization channels (HH and VV). We therefore conclude that dual-polarization (HH and VV) X-band scenes can be directly used to complement quad-polarimetric C- and L-band scenes for studies of newly formed sea ice. To confine the quad-polarimetric data sets to their co-polarization channels one can ensure a higher signal-to-noise ratio. Incidence angles below 35 degrees are needed to keep the signal-to-noise ratios sufficiently high for the scattering entropy and co-polarization ratio. Due to its lack of incidence angle dependency, the polarization difference can provide additional support in newly formed sea ice studies.

Such initiatives commonly rely on spatially aligned forest inventory plot measurements and LiDAR covariates to inform model-based estimators for small area estimation. There are many examples where such linking models provide the desired accuracy and precision of forest parameter estimates for small areas where paucity of inventory plot observations preclude design-based inference. This paper builds on previous small area estimation (SAE) work by linking LiDAR covariates with variable radius forest inventory plot measurements within a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Using this framework, we compare SAE of forest aboveground biomass using: i) Fay-Herriot (FH); ii) FH with conditional autoregressive random effects (FHCAR); and ill) FHCAR with smoothed sampling variance (FHCAR-SMOOTH) models. Candidate models and the direct estimate based on plot measurements alone were compared using coefficient of variation (CV). On average, the FH model reduced the CV by 52.3% compared to the direct estimate. Incorporating spatial structure via the FHCAR model reduced the CV by 56.9% and 10.8% relative to the direct and the FH model estimates, respectively. Overall, these results illustrate the applicability and utility of using a SAE framework for linking LiDAR with typical forest inventory data.', '[Planck, Neil R.

Imagery had the pixel resolution (30 m) and extent (30,000 km(2)) of a Landsat scene, with multi-seasonal (spring, summer, fall) acquisitions from year 2013. Primary study objectives were to assess differences in map accuracy related to Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) and Random Forests (RF) classifiers, spectral resolution (hyperspectral vs. multispectral), and temporal resolution (multi-seasonal vs. summer). The RF classifier generally outperformed MESMA by 1.1 to 9.0% overall accuracy, with the exception of summer HyspIRI reflectance data. There were no clear patterns in accuracy when comparing HyspIRI and simulated multispectral reflectance bands with RF and MESMA classifiers. With summer data, HyspIRI had significantly higher accuracy for MESMA (+ 5.5 to + 8.7%) and significantly lower accuracy for RF (-9.7 to -16.4%). There were no significant differences in accuracy when using multi-seasonal HyspIRI and multispectral data with RF or MESMA (< 1.2% differences). There were highly significant improvements in overall accuracy (1.7 to 20.9%) with multi-season over summer-only images for all sensors, sample scales and classifiers. This result indicates that repeat image acquisitions from satellite sensors are important for land -cover classification, irrespective of sensor spectral resolution. A companion study (Clark & Kilham, 2016) that used RF with hyperspectral metrics derived from HyspIRI reflectance bands (from indices, derivatives, and absorption fitting) showed significant improvements in overall accuracy relative to map classifications in this study, which all used independent reflectance bands.

We have investigated the use of multi-frequency SAR data from different sensors (ALOS/PALSAR and ENVISAT/ASAR) for estimating forest biomass in two test areas in Central Italy (San Rossore and Molise), where detailed in-situ measurements and Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data were available. The study focused on the estimation of growing stock volume (GS, in m(3)/ha) by using an inversion algorithm based on artificial neural networks (ANN). The ANN algorithm was first appropriately trained using the available GS estimates obtained from ALS data. The potential of this algorithm was then improved through the innovative use of a simulated dataset, generated by a forward electromagnetic model based on the Radiative Transfer Theory (RTT). The algorithm is able to merge SAR data at L and C bands for predicting GS in diversified Mediterranean environments. The performed analyses indicated that GS was correctly estimated by integrating information from L and C bands on both test areas, with the following statistics: R > 0.97 and RMSE = 28.5 m(3)/ha for the independent test, and R = 0.86 and RMSE approximate to 77 m(3)/ha for the final independent validation, the latter performed on the forest stands of both areas not included in the ALS acquisitions and where conventional measurements were available. The research then illustrates the potential of using the obtained GS estimates from SAR data to drive the simulations of forest net primary production (NPP). This experiment produced spatially explicit estimates of GS current annual increments that are slightly less accurate than those obtained from ground observations (R = 0.75 and RMSE approximate to 1.5 m(3)/ha/year).', '[Santi, Emanuele; Paloscia, Simonetta; Pettinato, Simone; Fontanelli, Giacomo] Natl Res Council Italy IFAC CNR, Inst Appl Phys, Via Madonna Piano 10, I-50019 Florence, Italy.

Directional effects were examined by considering two ten day periods of Sentinel-2A data acquired close to the solar principal and orthogonal planes over approximately 20 degrees x 10 degrees of southern Africa. More than 6.6 million (January 2016) and 10.6 million (April 2016) pairs of reflectance observations sensed 3 or 7 days apart in the forward and backscatter directions in overlapping Sentinel-2A orbit swaths were considered. The Sentinel-2A data were projected into the MODIS sinusoidal projection but first had to be registered due to a misregistration issue evident in the overlapping orbits. The top of atmosphere reflectance data were corrected to surface reflectance using the SEN2COR atmospheric correction software. Only pairs of forward and backward reflectance values that were cloud and snow-free, unsaturated, and had no significant change in their 3 or 7 day separation, were considered. The maximum observed Sentinel-2A view zenith angle was 11.93 degrees. Greater BRDF effects were apparent in the January data (acquired close to the solar principal plane) than the April data (acquired close to the orthogonal plane) and at higher view zenith angle. For the January data the average difference between the surface reflectance in the forward and backward scatter directions at the Sentinel-2A scan edges increased with wavelength from 0.035 (blue), 0.047 (green), 0.057 (red), 0.078 (NIR), to about 0.1 (SWIR). These differences may constitute a significant source of noise for certain applications.   The suitability of a recently published methodology developed to generate Landsat nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) was examined for Sentinel-2A application. The methodology uses fixed MODIS BRDF spectral parameters and is attractive because it has little sensitivity to the land cover type, condition, or surface disturbance and can be derived in a computationally efficient manner globally. It was applied to the southern Africa Sentinel 2A data and shown to reduce Sentinel-2A BRDF effects. The average difference between the reflectance in the forward and backward scatter directions at the Sentinel-2A scan edges was smaller in the NBAR data than in the corresponding surface reflectance data. Residual BRDF effects in the Sentinel-2A NBAR data occurred likely because of atmospheric correction and sensor calibration errors and inadequacies in the NBAR derivation approach. These issues are discussed with recommendations for future research including global and red-edge Sentinel-2A NBAR derivation that were not considered in this study. (C) 2017 The Authors.

However, over regions with seasonal snow cover, remotely-sensed land surface phenology may be dominated by snow seasonality, rather than showing true plant phenology. Overlooking snow influences may lead to inaccurate plant phenology estimation, and consequently to misinterpretation of climate-vegetation interactions. To address the problem we apply the recently developed plant phenology index (PPI) to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for estimating plant phenology metrics over northern Europe. We compare PPI-derived start and end of the growing season with ground observations by professionals (6 sites) and nonprofessional citizens (378 sites), with phenology metrics derived from gross primary productivity (GPP, 18 sites), and with data on the timing of snow cover. These data are also compared with land surface phenology metrics derived from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using the same MODIS data. We find that the PPI-retrieved plant phenology agrees with ground observations and GPP-derived phenology, and that the NDVI-derived phenology to a large extent agrees with the end-of-snowmelt for the start-of-season and the start-of-snowing for the end of-season. PPI is thereby useful for more accurate estimation of plant phenology from remotely sensed data over northern Europe and other regions with seasonal snow cover.

Accurate, well-documented, and automated cloud detection algorithms are necessary to effectively leverage large collections of remotely sensed data. The Landsat project is uniquely suited for comparative validation of cloud assessment algorithms because the modular architecture of the Landsat ground system allows for quick evaluation of new code, and because Landsat has the most comprehensive manual truth masks of any current satellite data archive. Currently, the Landsat Level-1 Product Generation System (LPGS) uses separate algorithms for determining clouds, cirrus clouds, and snow and/or ice probability on a per-pixel basis. With more bands onboard the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)/rhermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) satellite, and a greater number of cloud masking algorithms, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is replacing the current cloud masking workflow with a more robust algorithm that is capable of working across multiple Landsat sensors with minimal modification. Because of the inherent error from stray light and intermittent data availability of TIRS, these algorithms need to operate both with and without thermal data. In this study, we created a workflow to evaluate cloud and cloud shadow masking algorithms using cloud validation masks manually derived from both Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) and Landsat 8 OLI/FIRS data. We created a new validation dataset consisting of 96 Landsat 8 scenes, representing different biomes and proportions of cloud cover. We evaluated algorithm performance by overall accuracy, omission error, and commission error for both cloud and cloud shadow. We found that CFMask, C code based on the Function of Mask (Fmask) algorithm, and its confidence bands have the best overall accuracy among the many algorithms tested using our validation data. The Artificial Thermal-Automated Cloud Cover Algorithm (AT-ACCA) is the most accurate nonthermal-based algorithm. We give preference to CFMask for operational cloud and cloud shadow detection, as it is derived from a priori knowledge of physical phenomena and is operable without geographic restriction, making it useful for current and future land imaging missions without having to be retrained in a machine-learning environment.

Those sites provide well calibrated in situ soil moisture measurements within SMAP product grid pixels for diverse conditions and locations. The estimation of the average soil moisture within the SMAP product grid pixels based on in situ measurements is more reliable when location specific calibration of the sensors has been performed and there is adequate replication over the spatial domain, with an up-scaling function based on analysis using independent estimates of the soil moisture distribution. SMAP fulfilled these requirements through a collaborative Cal/Val Partner program. This paper presents the results from 34 candidate core validation sites for the first eleven months of the SMAP mission. As a result of the screening of the sites prior to the availability of SMAP data, out of the 34 candidate sites 18 sites fulfilled all the requirements at one of the resolution scales (at least). The rest of the sites are used as secondary information in algorithm evaluation. The results indicate that the SMAP radiometer-based soil moisture data product meets its expected performance of 0.04 m(3)/m(3) volumetric soil moisture (unbiased root mean square error); the combined radar-radiometer product is close to its expected performance of 0.04 m(3)/m(3), and the radar-based product meets its target accuracy of 0.06 m(3)/m(3) (the lengths of the combined and radar-based products are truncated to about 10 weeks because of the SMAP radar failure). Upon completing the intensive Cal/Val phase of the mission the SMAP project will continue to enhance the products in the primary and extended geographic domains, in co-operation with the Cal/Val Partners, by continuing the comparisons over the existing core validation sites and inclusion of candidate sites that can address shortcomings.

The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) has been shown to be sensitive to vegetation photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE), GPP and canopy water-stress. Here, we use the NASA EOS MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) based PRI with eddy covariance CO2 flux measurements and meteorological observations from 20 tower sites representing major plant functional type (PFT) classes within the continental USA (CONUS) to assess GPP sensitivity to soil moisture related water stress. The sPRI (scaled PRI) metric derived using MODIS band 13 as a reference channel (sPRI(13)) shows generally higher correspondence with tower GPP estimates than other potential MODIS reference bands. The sPRI(13) observations were used as a proxy for soil moisture related water supply constraints to LUE within a satellite data driven terrestrial carbon flux model to estimate GPP (GPP(PRI)). The GPP calculations show generally favorable correspondence with tower GPP estimates (0.457 <= R-2 <= 0.818), except for lower GPP(PRI) performance over evergreen needleleaf forest (ENF) sites. A regional model sensitivity analysis using the sPRI(13) as a water supply proxy indicated that water restrictions limit GPP over more than 21% of the CONUS domain, particularly in drier climate areas where atmospheric moisture deficits (VPD) alone are insufficient to represent both atmosphere demand and water supply controls affecting productivity. Our results indicate strong potential of the MODIS 5PRI(13) to represent soil moisture related water supply controls influencing photosynthesis, with enhanced (1-km resolution) delineation of these processes closer to the scale of in situ tower observations. These observations may provide an effective tool for characterizing sub-grid spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture related controls that inform coarser scale observations and estimates determined from other satellite observations and earth system models.

Two periods when simultaneous observations from both GERB-2 and GERB-1 were available, January 13th to February 11th 2007 and May 1st to May 10th 2007, are also compared. For these two overlap periods respectively, averaged over all CERES \'unfiltered-to-filtered radiance ratio\' subsets, the GERB-1/CERES unfiltered radiance ratio is on average found to be 1.6% and 1.9% lower than the associated GERB-2/CERES unfiltered radiance ratio. Over the two longer time series the GERB/CERES unfiltered radiance ratio shows a general decrease with time for both GERB-2 and GERB-1. The rate of decrease varies through time but no significant seasonal dependence is seen. Averaged over all subsets the GERB-2/CERES unfiltered radiance ratio showed a decrease of 1.9% between June 2004 and June 2006. Between June 2007 and June 2012, the corresponding decrease in the GERB-1/CERES unfiltered radiance ratio was 6.5%. The evolution of the GERB/CERES unfiltered radiance ratio for both GERB-2 and GERB-1 shows a strong dependence on the CERES unfiltered-to-filtered radiance ratio, indicating that it is spectrally dependent. Further time-series analysis and theoretical work using simulated spectral radiance curves suggests that for GERB-1 the evolution is consistent with a darkening in the GERB shortwave spectral response function which is most pronounced at the shortest wavelengths. For GERB-2, no single spectral cause can be identified, suggesting that the evolution is likely due to a combination of several different effects. (C) 2016 The Authors.

This study evaluated spectral indices for multispectral sensors that correlate with the seed yield of Brassica oilseed crops. A small-plot experiment was conducted near Adams, Oregon in which spring canola was grown under varying water regimes and nitrogen treatments to create a wide range in oilseed yield. Plot measurements consisted of canopy reflectance at flowering using a hand-held spectroradiometer and seed yield at physiological maturity. Spectroradiometric measurements were converted to MODIS band equivalent reflectance. Selected indices were computed from spectra obtained with the radiometer and correlated with seed yield. A normalized difference yellowness index (NDYI), computed from the green and blue wavebands, overcame limitations of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) during flowering and best modeled variability in relative yield potential. NDYI was more linear and correlated with county-wide oilseed yield data and MODIS satellite data from North Dakota (r(2) <= 0.72) than NDVI (r(2) <= 0.66). NDYI only requires wavebands in the visible region of the spectrum and can be applied to any satellite or aerial sensor that has blue and green channels. These findings highlight the benefit of using a spectral index that is sensitive to reproductive growth of vegetation instead of vegetative growth for crops with spectrally prominent reproductive canopy elements. Our results indicate that NDYI is a better indicator of yield potential than NDVI during mid-season development stages, especially peak flowering.

Estimates of lake volume, however, are limited by the availability of in situ measurements of water depth, which in turn also limits the assessment of remotely sensed lake depths. Given the logistical difficulty of collecting physical bathymetric measurements, methods relying upon in situ data are generally restricted to small areas and thus their application to largescale studies is difficult to validate. Here, we produce and validate spaceborne estimates of supraglacial lake volumes across a relatively large area (1250 km(2)) of west Greenland\'s ablation region using data acquired by the WorldView-2 (WV-2) sensor, making use of both its stereo-imaging capability and its meter-scale resolution. We employ spectrally-derived depth retrieval models, which are either based on absolute reflectance (single channel model) or a ratio of spectral reflectances in two bands (dual-channel model). These models are calibrated by using WV-2 multispectral imagery acquired early in the melt season and depth measurements from a high resolution WV-2 DEM over the same lake basins when devoid of water. The calibrated models are then validated with different lakes in the area, for which we determined depths. Lake depth estimates based on measurements recorded in WV-2\'s blue (450-510 nm), green (510-580 nm), and red (630-690 nm) bands and dual-channel modes (blue/green, blue/red, and green/red band combinations) had near-zero bias, an average root-mean squared deviation of 0.4 m (relative to post-drainage DEM5), and an average volumetric error of <1%. The approach outlined in this study- image-based calibration of depth-retrieval models - significantly improves spaceborne supraglacial bathymetry retrievals, which are completely independent from in situ measurements.

For outputs to be informative, however, they must be accurate. The finer spatial resolution of recent large-scale forest products comes at a cost of lower temporal resolution. With few input images available for a given year, appropriate image selection in the creation of forest cover and forest-cover change maps is critical. This work highlights the need for more careful consideration of seasonality in mapping forest cover in the tropics. While most studies of seasonality on forest mapping focus on deciduousness and potential errors of omission, this study highlights seasonal fluctuations in non-forested vegetation and likely errors of comission. Vegetation indices provided good separability between tropical forests and low vegetation including commercial crops, pasture and young fallow, in the dry season, but not in the wet season. Forest-cover maps and change analyses that combine wet and dry-season images without accounting for seasonality risk overestimating initial forest cover and subsequent deforestation. Likewise, analyses that do not distinguish between truly aseasonal wet equatorial regions and seasonal regions of the tropics risk overestimating forest cover in the former. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A new one-minute gravity anomaly grid is determined. The modeled gravity anomalies show a 6-mgal RMS discrepancy with shipborne measurements in shallow waters. An altimeter-only bathymetric model is derived from the new gravity grid by the gravity-geological method that uses the latest global and regional models of the ocean depth and marine gravity as a priori knowledge. The new model outperforms current SCS bathymetric models and is accurate to 100 m, based on comparison with multi-beam depth measurements. Optical images from IKONOS-2, QuickBird-2, GeoEye-1, WorldView-1-2 and -3, are rectified and digitized to derive the zero (coastline) and 20-m depth contours (reef lines) around 44 atolls, which are integrated with the altimeter-only depths, giving significantly improved accuracies and spatial resolutions in modeled depths. The improvement percentages of coastlines by the satellite imagery range from 50% to 97% at 41 of the 44 atolls. We establish a webpage for free access to the optical and depth images, and the depth and gravity grids.

A series of derived phenological metrics are analysed using the random forests statistical method to determine the relative importance of seasonal vegetation characteristics. Results indicate negative relationships between Ochotona spp. presence and EVI showing a preference for low-biomass habitats. However, EVI values during green-up and senescence periods are also shown to be important, potentially resulting from improved detectability of low-biomass grassland habitats at these times. Improved detection of Ochotona spp. preferred habitats via time-series EVI imagery offers better understanding of the distributions of this Em host, and the potential for monitoring the changes in Ochotona spp. optimal habitat distributions resulting from landscape change.

In particular, data fluctuations based on sensor zenith angle (SZA) can cause variable uncertainties in derived time series, as well as regional or global means. This study analyses single- and merged-sensor datasets from SeaWiFS, MODIS, and VIIRS for the Gulf of Mexico region, finding pronounced variation within and between satellites as a function of SZA. Such effects are generally restricted to data with SZA above 40, although large variation exists between satellites and products. The non-tilted MODIS and VIIRS also show residual errors during summer time for SZA < 30 degrees due to imperfect sun glint and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) corrections. Furthermore, certain algorithms and products are more resilient to angular dependence in R-rs data. Overall, this study provides a framework for interpretation and account of SZA dependence in satellite ocean color data products, towards creation of cross-sensor time series as required for analysis of changes on multi-decadal scales. Finally, these findings can inform design and calibration of future geostationary sensors, for which targets have fixed viewing geometry.

However, satellite remote sensing is limited by spatial and temporal resolutions and the high costs involved in data acquisition. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based glaciological studies are gaining pace in recent years due to their advantages over conventional remote sensing platforms. UAVs are easy to deploy, with the option of alternating the sensors working in visible, infrared, and microwave wavelengths. The high spatial resolution remote sensing data obtained from these UAV-borne sensors are a significant improvement over the data obtained by traditional remote sensing. The cost involved in data acquisition is minimal and researchers can acquire imagery according to their schedule and convenience. We discuss significant glaciological studies involving UAV as remote sensing platforms. This is the first review work, exclusively dedicated to highlight UAV as a remote sensing platform in glaciology. We examine polar and alpine applications of UAV and their future prospects in separate sections and present an extensive reference list for the readers, so that they can delve into their topic of interest. Because the technology is still widely unexplored for snow and glaciers, we put a special emphasis on discussing the future prospects of utilising UAVs for glaciological research.

Furthermore, the spatial and temporal information extracted from the time-series data enables the attribution of various forest change types over large areas. In this paper we apply spectral trend analysis of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data from 1984 to 2012 to detect, characterize, and attribute forest changes in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. Change detection is performed using breakpoint analysis of the spectral trends and change events are characterized using a set of metrics derived from an image time series that relate the temporal, spectral, and geometrical properties on an object basis. Change objects are attributed to a change type (i.e., fire, harvesting, road, and non-stand-replacing changes) using a Random Forest classifier. Non-stand-replacing changes are generally low magnitude, punctual, trend anomalies that relate year-on-year ephemeral changes that do not lead to a change in land cover class (i.e., phenology, insects, water stress). The results confirm that land cover changes are detected with high overall accuracy (92.2%), with the majority of changes labeled to the correct occurrence year (91.1%) or within +/- 1 year (98.7%). Characterization of changes enables accurate attribution both at the object (91.6%) and area levels (98%), with fire and harvesting events the most successfully attributed (commission error < 10%), and roads, the most challenging to attribute correctly (commission error > 13%). Our approach, prototyped over the forested area of Saskatchewan, has enabled a highly automated and systematic depiction of a 30-year history of forest change, providing otherwise unavailable insights on disturbance trends including spatial, temporal, and categorical characteristics. The generation and application of metrics that relate a range of change characteristics allow for depiction of a broad range of change events, types, and conditions.

There is a need for the detection of emerging changes and the potential loss of the natural or semi-natural ecosystems accompanied by a decrease in water quality. Accessibility both from sea and land is very poor, which makes the monitoring and mapping of tidal flat environments from in situ measurements very difficult In this study, a multi-sensor concept for the classification of intertidal areas in the Wadden Sea is developed. The basis for this method is a combined analysis involving RapidEye (RE) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellite data combined with ancillary vector data about the distribution of vegetation, shellfish beds and sediments for the accuracy assessment The overall methodology is based on a hierarchical decision tree. First, the water coverage is separated from the tidal flats by using the normalized difference water index (NDWI). Second, the shellfish beds are estimated with the textural features of the TSX data and morphologic filters (MFs). Third, the classification of vegetation (salt marsh, sea grass/algae) is based on the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), object-based features and exclusionary criteria. The remaining area is then separated into different sediment types with an algorithm that uses a thresholding technique applied to radiometric values, the MSAVI and a majority filter. The results show that we are able to identify the location and shape of salt marsh and shellfish beds (a true positive rate of 0.63 and a precision of 0.55) by using multi-sensor remote sensing data. A detailed shellfish bed classification can only be done with radar sensors, like TSX. The extraction of the sea grass areas from the multi-sensor approach is difficult Sea grass often grows very sparsely in the study area which, with respect to the spatial resolution of RE, leads to a mixture of the spectral signatures of sediment and sea grass. The classification of the sediment types in tidal flats is a challenge compared to vegetation and shellfish beds. An overall accuracy of 64.53%, 66.85%, 68.22% and 68.2% was achieved. The results emphasize that a sediment-type classification cannot be achieved with high accuracy using spectral properties alone due to their similarity, which is predominately caused by their water content.

Studies based on misclassified land use data can generate biased parameter estimates and standard errors, inaccurate predictions, and incorrect policy recommendations. To address these challenges and improve the accuracy of land use analyses, we implement a post-classification strategy to detect misclassified land use observations using a latent multinomial logit model. This strategy is tested using both Monte Carlo simulations and a time series dataset based on supervised classification of remotely sensed data corresponding to land use decisions observed in a Mexican coffee growing region during the period 1984-2006. The results indicate that the strategy is useful for identifying land use observations with a high probability of being wrongly classified, even between categories with low discriminative spectral signatures. Reclassification of the land use data, based on the model results, increases the magnitudes of the marginal effects of the analyzed land use drivers in the theoretically expected directions, and in some cases improves the statistical significance of the parameter estimates.

With an increasing amount of satellite data being released to the public free of charge, understanding forest change dynamics in the tropics is gradually becoming a reality. Methods to track forest changes using dense satellite time series allow for description of forest changes at unprecedented spatial, temporal and thematic resolution. We developed a data-driven approach based on structural change monitoring methods to track disturbance-regrowth dynamics using dense Landsat Time Series (LTS) in a tropical forest landscape in Madre de Dios, southern Peru. Whereas most existing post-disturbance regrowth monitoring methods rely on annual or near-annual time series, our method uses all available Landsat data. Using our disturbance-regrowth method, we detected annual disturbance from 1999 to 2013 with a total area-weighted accuracy of 91 +/- 2.3%. Accuracies of the regrowth results were strongly dependent on the timing of the original disturbance. We estimated a total area-weighted regrowth accuracy of 61 +/- 3.9% for pixels where original disturbances were predicted earlier than 2006. While the user\'s accuracy of the regrowth class for these pixels was high (84 +/- 8.1%), the producer\'s accuracy was low (56 +/- 9.4%), with markedly lower producer\'s accuracies when later disturbances were also included. These accuracies indicate that a significant amount of regrowth identified in the reference data was not captured with our method. Most of these omission errors arose from disturbances late in the time series or a lack of sensitivity to long-term regrowth due to lower data densities near the end of the time series. Omission errors notwithstanding, our study represents the first demonstration of a purely data-driven algorithm designed to detect disturbances and post-disturbance regrowth together using all available LTS data. With this method, we propose a continuous disturbance-regrowth monitoring framework, where LTS data are continually monitored for disturbances, post-disturbance regrowth, repeat disturbances, and so on.

In order to process this large amount of satellite images an almost automatic monitoring system was developed. With the Global Digital Elevation Map V2 (GDEM-V2) of the Advanced Spacebome Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) an improved orthorectification was applied which, in combination with a destriping correction of the Landsat 7 products with Scan Line Corrector (SLC) failure, leads to more precise flow-velocity information. In addition, outliers were removed using an adaptive, recursive filter approach. For the time span 1972-2012 more than 100,000 flow-velocity fields were derived from over 16,000 optical multi-sensoral Landsat scenes (Landsat 1 to Landsat 7) allowing the determination of the long-term flow-velocity trend. Moreover, the high temporal resolution facilitates the analysis of seasonal flow-velocity variations of numerous outlet glaciers. For many of the major outlet glaciers the results show an acceleration pattern that is consistent with most of the previously published analyses. However, the flow-velocity changes do not have a uniform pattern in their temporal and spatial distribution. This study provides both a high temporal densification and an extension of existing flow-velocity information of the GrIS margin. Finally, this processing chain in its generality allows for the determination of various types of surface displacements and can be applied to other glacier regions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Increasing air temperatures have led to widespread thawing and degradation of permafrost which in turn has affected ecosystems, socioeconomics, and the carbon cycle of high latitudes. Here we overcome complex interactions among surface and subsurface conditions to map near-surface permafrost through decision and regression tree approaches that statistically and spatially extend field observations using remotely sensed imagery, climatic data, and thematic maps of a wide range of surface and subsurface biophysical characteristics. The data fusion approach generated medium-resolution (30-m pixels) maps of near-surface (within 1 m) permafrost, active-layer thickness, and associated uncertainty estimates throughout mainland Alaska. Our calibrated models (overall test accuracy of similar to 85%) were used to quantify changes in permafrost distribution under varying future climate scenarios assuming no other changes in biophysical factors. Models indicate that near-surface permafrost underlies 38% of mainland Alaska and that near-surface permafrost will disappear on 16 to 24% of the landscape by the end of the 21st Century. Simulations suggest that near-surface permafrost degradation is more probable in central regions of Alaska than more northerly regions. Taken together, these results have obvious implications for potential remobilization of frozen soil carbon pools under warmer temperatures. Additionally, warmer and drier conditions may increase fire activity and severity, which may exacerbate rates of permafrost thaw and carbon remobilization relative to climate alone. The mapping of permafrost distribution across Alaska is important for land-use planning, environmental assessments, and a wide-array of geophysical studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

An innovative approach was developed by integrating multiple sources of information to quantify shrubland components as continuous field products within the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). The approach consists of several procedures including field sample collections, high-resolution mapping of shrubland components using WorldView-2 imagery and regression tree models, Landsat 8 radiometric balancing and phenological mosaicking, medium resolution estimates of shrubland components following different climate zones using Landsat 8 phenological mosaics and regression tree models, and product validation. Fractional covers of nine shrubland components were estimated: annual herbaceous, bare ground, big sagebrush, herbaceous, litter, sagebrush, shrub, sagebrush height, and shrub height Our study area included the footprint of six Landsat 8 scenes in the northwestern United States. Results show that most components have relatively significant correlations with validation data, have small normalized root mean square errors, and correspond well with expected ecological gradients. While some uncertainties remain with height estimates, the model formulated in this study provides a cross-validated, unbiased, and cost effective approach to quantify shrubland components at a regional scale and advances knowledge of horizontal and vertical variability of these components.

Previous estimates of foliar N at the landscape scale have primarily focused on intact forests and grasslands using aircraft imaging spectrometry and various techniques of statistical calibration and modeling. The present study extends this work by examining the potential to estimate the foliar N concentration (%N) of residential, agricultural and other cultivated grassland areas within a suburbanizing watershed in southeastern New Hampshire. These grasslands occupy a relatively small fraction (17.5%) of total land area within the study watershed, but are important to regional biogeochemistry and are highly valued by humans. In conjunction with ground-based vegetation sampling (n = 20 sites with 54 sample plots), we developed partial least squares regression (PLSR) models for predicting mass-based canopy %N across management types using input from airborne and field-based imaging spectrometers. Models yielded strong relationships for predicting canopy %N from both ground- and aircraft-based sensors (r(2) = 0.76 and 0.67, respectively) across sites that included turf grass, grazed pasture, hayfields and fallow fields. Similarities in spectral resolution between the sensors used in this study and the proposed HyspIRI mission suggest promise for detecting canopy %N across multiple forms of managed grasslands, with the possible exception of areas containing lawns too small to be captured with HyspIRI\'s planned 60 m spatial resolution.

In order to understand the dynamics of savanna ecosystems, information on the spatial distribution of woody vegetation over large areas is needed. In this study we sought to assess multi-temporal ALOS PALSAR L-band backscatter to map woody cover in southern African savannas. The SAR data were acquired from the JAXA archive, covering various modes and seasons between 2007 and 2010. We used high resolution airborne LiDAR data as reference data to interpret SAR parameters (including backscatter intensities and polarimetric decomposition components), to develop SAR-based models as well as to validate SAR-based woody cover maps. The LiDAR survey was carried out in April 2008 with the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO, http://cao.ciw.edu). The highest correlations to the reference data were obtained from SAR backscatters of the dry season, followed by the wet season, and the end of the wet season. The volume components from polarimetric decompositions (Freeman-Durden, Van Zyl) were calculated for the end of wet season, and showed similar correlations to the LiDAR data, when compared to cross-polarized backscatters (HV). We observed increased correlation between the SAR and LiDAR datasets with an increase in the spatial scale at which datasets were integrated, with an optimum value at 50 m. We modeled woody cover using three scenarios: (1) a single date scenario (Le., woody cover map based on a single SAR image), (2) a mule-seasonal scenario (i.e., woody cover map based on SAR images from the same year and different seasons, based on key phonological difference), and (3) a multi-annual scenario (i.e., woody cover map based on SAR data from different years). Predicted SAR-based woody cover map based on Fine Beam Dual Polarization dry season SAR backscatters of all years yielded the best performance with an R-2 of 0.71 and RMSE of 7.88%. However, single dry season SAR backscatter achieved only a slightly lower accuracy (R-2 = 0.66, RMSE = 8.45%) as multi-annual SAR data, suggesting that a single SAR scene from the dry season can also be used for woody cover mapping. Moreover, we investigated the impact of the number of samples on the model prediction performance and showed the benefits of a larger spatially explicit LiDAR dataset compared to much smaller number of samples as they can be collected in the field. Collectively, our results demonstrate that L-band backscatter shows promising sensitivity for the purposes of mapping woody cover in southern African savannas, particularly during the dry season leaf-off conditions.

Satellite soil moisture retrievals and brightness temperature observations, such as those available from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, can be a valuable source of information for data assimilation and merging with other satellite retrieval datasets. To correct for biases in these data sets, bias correction methods such as cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching, linear rescaling and copulas are used to map satellite soil moisture climatology to that of in situ or model values. This study compared SMOS retrievals to soil moisture observations from the SCAN network for a calibration period of 2010-2011 and validation period of 2012-2013 before and after bias correction. The focus of the study was on the presence and removal of multiplicative bias when comparing SMOS retrievals to SCAN data. Additive bias between SMOS retrievals and SCAN observations was removed by standard bias correction techniques and a new resampling approach was found to reduce multiplicative biases. In addition, the new bias correction technique was found very competitive with the benchmark methods for both the calibration and validation periods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, a hybrid inversion method was developed to estimate the LAI values of crops. Based on PROSAIL simulation datasets, 43 hyperspectral vegetation indices (VIs), including the optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSVAI) and modified triangular vegetation index (MTVI2), were analyzed to identify optimal VIs for estimating LAI values. Hybrid inversion models were then built to determine the relationships between optimal simulated VIs and the LAI values (generated by the PROSAIL model) using modeling methods, including curve fitting, artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest regression (RFR) algorithms. Finally, remote sensing mapping of a Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) image was completed using the inversion model to verify the LAI estimation accuracy. The remote sensing mapping of the CHRIS image yielded an accuracy of R-2 = 0.928 and RMSE = 0.485 for OSAVI and R-2 = 0.910 and RMSE = 0.554 for MTVI2, demonstrating the feasibility of high-accuracy estimation of crop LAI using hyperspectral VIs and a hybrid inversion method. The estimation results of various VIs suggested that the identification of the appropriate VIs is critical to improve the inversion accuracy. In addition, to obtain the appropriate VIs, the factors must be evaluated with respect to two aspects, i.e., the sensitivity to target parameters and the insensitivity to interference. In this study, OSVAI and MTVI2 were sensitive to LAI and relatively insensitive to the effects of interference factors, such as chlorophyll, soil background, sky scattered light and observed geometry. Therefore, these indices could be primarily used as VIs for an LAI estimation. The inversion results of different datasets demonstrated that prior information is critical for improving the inversion accuracy and identifying the optimal VIs. Additionally, based on the comparison of the curve fitting, ANN, and RFR algorithms, RFR was an optimal method for modeling in this study, as indicated by the higher R-2 and lower RMSE values for different datasets and various VIs.

A procedure for the spatial enhancement of ocean color products, including chlorophyll and inherent optical properties (IOPs), is developed using a sharpened visible water-leaving radiance spectrum for the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS). A new approach for spectral sharpening is developed by utilizing the spatial covariance of the spectral bands for sharpening the M bands (412, 443,486, 551, 671 nm; 750-m resolution) with the I-1 band (645 nm; 375-m resolution). The spectral shape remains consistent by the use of a dynamic, wavelength-specific spatial resolution ratio that is weighted as a function of the relationship between proximate I- and M-band variance at each pixel. A comparison of bio-optical satellite products at 375-m and 750-m spatial resolution with in situ measurements of water leaving radiance and bio-optical properties show an improved capability of the VIIRS 375-m products in turbid and optically complex waters, such as the Chesapeake Bay and Mississippi River Plume. We demonstrate that the increased spatial resolution improves the ability for VIIRS to characterize bio-optical properties in coastal waters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Different mechanisms for this impact have been proposed, but its magnitude, sign and even presence remain poorly understood. In this study the dependence of the phase, the coherence magnitude as well as the phase triplets on soil moisture was inferred empirically with regression techniques: this was done for two airborne data sets at L-band. The phase dependence was significant (at a significance level of 0.05) for more than 70% of the fields at HH polarization, its sign corresponding to an increase in optical path upon wetting, and the magnitude of the associated deformation commonly exceeding 2 cm for a change in soil moisture of 20%. This trend was similar in both campaigns, whereas the prevalence of soil moisture-related decorrelafion differs. These results are only consistent with a dielectric origin of the soil moisture effects, and not with soil swelling or the penetration depth hypothesis. Changes in vegetation impact the phase depending on the crop and polarization, with the vegetation influence at VV being more pronounced for the agricultural crops present in the study area.

The interannual variability and climatology of the ITCZ is presented from 12 years of refractivity data. This new method captures all the general features of ITCZ extent and its variability. We also examine the effects of the ITCZ vertically during different seasons. The ITCZ is observed mostly at eastern Pacific in May month, and it is zonally distributed in the September and October months of each year. The zonal variability is large between lower and higher levels, particularly over the Indian monsoon and western Pacific.

This has been particularly evident during extreme conditions in recent years (e.g. Europe 2003 and Russia 2010 heat waves, Horn of Africa 2010 drought, and Australia 2010 drought recovery). Weather parameters are sensitive to the vegetation state and particularly to albedo and Leaf Area Index (IAI) that controls the partitioning of the surface energy fluxes into latent and sensible fluxes, and the development of planetary boundary conditions and clouds. An optimal interpolation analysis of a satellite-based surface albedo and LAI is performed through the combination of satellite observations and derived climatologies, depending on their associated errors. The final analysis products have smoother temporal evolution than the direct observations, which makes them more appropriate for environmental and numerical weather prediction.   The impact of assimilating these near-real-time (NRT) products within the land surface scheme of the European Centre of Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is evaluated for anomalous years. It is shown that: (i) the assimilation of these products enables detecting/monitoring extreme climate conditions where the LAI anomaly could reach more than 50% and in wet years albedo anomaly could reach 10%, (ii) extreme NRT LAI anomalies have a strong impact on the surface fluxes, while for the albedo, which has a smaller inter-annual variability, the impact on surface fluxes is small, (iii) neutral to slightly better agreement with in-situ surface soil moisture observations and surface energy and CO2 fluxes from eddy-covariance towers is obtained, and (iv) in forecast using a land-atmosphere coupled system, the assimilation of NRT LAI reduces the near-surface air temperature and humidity errors both in wet and dry cases, while NRT albedo has a small impact, mainly in wet cases (when albedo anomalies are more noticeable).

They also show a large diversity of optical characteristics, and the potential to optically classify these waters and distinguish similarities between regions is a fruitful application for satellite ocean color. Recognizing the specificities and complexity of coastal waters in terms of optical properties, a training data set is assembled for coastal regions and marginal seas using full resolution SeaWiFS global remote sensing reflectance RRs data that maximize the geographic coverage and seasonal sampling of the domain. An unsupervised clustering technique is operated on the training data set to derive a set of 16 classes that cover conditions from very turbid to oligotrophic. When applied to a global seven-year SeaWiFS data set, this set of optical water types allows an efficient classification of coastal regions, marginal seas and large inland water bodies. Classes associated with more turbid conditions show relative dominance close to shore and in the mid-latitudes. A geographic partition of the global coastal ocean serves to distinguish general optical similarities between regions. The local optical variability is quantified by the number of classes selected as dominant across the period, averaging 5.2 classes if the cases accounting for 90% of the data days are considered. Optical diversity is more specifically analyzed with a Shannon index computed with the class memberships. Regions with low optical diversity are the most turbid waters as well as closed seas and inland water bodies. Oligotrophic waters also show a relatively low diversity, while intermediate regions between coastal domain and open ocean are associated with the highest diversity, which has interesting connections with ecological features.

It is well known that SAR interferomeby is sensitive to the structural changes taking place in the target between image acquisitions; e.g. changes caused by wind in vegetated areas. As regards nonsimultaneous InSAR imaging, temporal changes in the target lead to loss of coherence and consequently to digital elevation models of low quality. Therefore, repeat-pass InSAR data have limited use-in forest resource mapping. The problem of low coherence in forested areas can be partially avoided by using simultaneous InSAR data acquisition, e.g. the bistatic TDX SAR satellite system, which was launched in June 2010. We processed five interferometric TDX pairs from a test site located in Southern Finland, and collected data from 335 field plots, to study the accuracy of TDX InSAR elevation models and coherence data in forest resource mapping at a resolution of 314 m(2). The SAR-derived elevation models (16 m(2) pixel size) were converted to heights above the ground level using a digital terrain model based on airborne laser scanning data. The random forest (RF) method was used to create a model for estimating the forest attributes using remote-sensing-derived metrics as the predictors. The results for accuracy of prediction were the following: the relative RMSE of 32% was obtained for stem volume, 20% for Lorey\'s height, and 29% for basal area. The forest inventory attributes were derived from the TDX data with an accuracy equivalent with the accuracy of other remote sensing techniques. This result shows the potential of TDX data in robust and cost-effective forest inventory covering large areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The lakes represent oligotrophic, mesotrophic and humic (high a(CDOM), low TSM) lake types. Our validation data was extensive, consisting of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) measured in the field, detailed measurements of (specific) inherent optical properties ((S)IOP) and water quality measurements. Validation measurements were collected at stations and as spatially intensive transects. The tested processors were Boreal lakes (BOR) and Free University of Berlin WeW WATER processor (FUB). In the case of BOR we included two versions, the original one available in 2008 and the most recent version. The processing chains of these versions differed in terms of MERIS archive reprocessing (2nd reprocessing (RP2) and 3rd reprocessing (RP3) were used), version of adjacency effect correction (ICOL) and rectification method. However, all these had only minor effect on the estimated R-rs when compared to the effect caused by the differences in the atmospheric correction versions. The use of ICOL improved the estimation of R-rs and therefore all IOP and water quality validations were made with ICOL pre-processed data. R-rs was best estimated with RP2 BOR, although it somewhat overestimated R-rs in blue in the humic lake. RP3 BOR greatly overestimated the R-rs in blue. FUB was outside its aCDOM training range in most of the studied lakes. RP2 BOR estimated water quality with the best accuracy in mesotrophic lakes, but failed in humic and clear water lakes. BOR overestimated Chl-a, particularly with RP3. The best TSM correlation was for RP2 BOR. All processors underestimated a(CDOM). The SIOP measurements showed that overestimation of Chl-a was not due to incorrect conversion factors, and that underestimation of TSM was to some extent explained by lower average conversion factor than that measured in the validation lakes. The inaccuracies in Chl-a and a(CDOM)(443) estimation were related to the partition of a(tot) to phytoplankton and CDOM absorption, which emphasizes the importance of including IOP measurements in the validation studies. Z(SD) was best estimated on the basis of a(tot) and b(tot), which were separately calculated from BOR output and the bio-optical model assumed in the processor. For the needs of transparency estimation the processors should produce a(tot) and b(tot) for all MERIS bands as standard output. Atmospheric correction over humic lakes is another problem to be solved in future versions of the processors. The 2008 version of BOR provided better atmospheric correction results in humic lakes and is thus more applicable in the boreal zone where these lakes are common. This suggests that before a new processor version is published it should be validated with existing in situ data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We compared the MOD16 ETa and LSA-SAF MSG ETa products and evaluated them against in-situ measurements at 15 ground sites with biome types ranging from croplands, grasslands, shrublands, savannas, to forests over Europe for 2011. The intercomparison results at local scale demonstrate that LSA-SAF MSG ETa is closer to eddy covariance (EC) measurements than MOD16 ETa product, with larger correlation coefficient Rest-obs, smaller root mean square error RMSEest-obs and bias of LSA-SAF MSG vs. EC at most of the 15 flux sites. Spatial distributions of the RMOD16-MSG and RMSEMOD16-MSG between MOD16 and LSA-SAF MSG ETa for 2011 show that both ETa data products are consistent over most of Europe, except for some semi-arid regions where the water availability is the main limiting factor of land surface evapotranspiration. LSA-SAF MSG ETa is shown to have a more adequate response to the forest fire. Our study contributes to assess the quality and uncertainty of each product, which can be beneficial for improving ETa algorithm and product quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This is partly due to the scarcity of available change detection algorithms suitable for identifying and characterizing both abrupt and non-abrupt changes, without sacrificing accuracy or computational speed. We propose a user-friendly program for analysing vegetation time series, with two main application domains: generalising vegetation trends to main features, and characterizing vegetation trend changes. This program, Detecting Breakpoints and Estimating Segments in Trend (DBEST) uses a novel segmentation algorithm which simplifies the trend into linear segments using one of three user-defined parameters: a generalisation-threshold parameter delta, them largest changes, or a threshold 0 for the magnitude of changes of interest for detection. The outputs of DBEST are the simplified trend, the change type (abrupt or non-abrupt), and estimates for the characteristics (time and magnitude) of the change. DBEST was tested and evaluated using simulated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data at two sites, which included different types of changes. Evaluation results demonstrate that DBEST quickly and robustly detects both abrupt and non-abrupt changes, and accurately estimates change time and magnitude.   DBEST was also tested using data from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) NDVI image time series for Iraq for the period 1982-2006, and was able to detect and quantify major change over the area. This showed that DBEST is able to detect and characterize changes over large areas. We conclude that DBEST is a fast, accurate and flexible tool for trend detection, and is applicable to global change studies using time series of remotely sensed data sets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Shrubs have been observed to lower the albedo as compared to lichen or graminoid-tundra. Despite its importance, the quantification of the effect of shrubification on summer albedo has not been addressed in much detail. We manipulated shrub density and height in an Arctic dwarf birch (Betula nana) shrub canopy to test the effect on shortwave radiative fluxes and on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a proxy for vegetation productivity used in satellite-based studies. Additionally, we parametrised and validated the 3D radiative transfer model DART to simulate the amount of solar radiation reflected and transmitted by an Arctic shrub canopy. We compared results of model runs of different complexities to measured data from North-East Siberia. We achieved comparably good results with simple turbid medium approaches, including both leaf and branch optical property media, and detailed object based model parameterisations. It was important to explicitly parameterise branches as they accounted for up to 71% of the total canopy absorption and thus contributed significantly to soil shading. Increasing leaf biomass resulted in a significant increase of the NDVI, decrease of transmitted photosynthetically active radiation, and repartitioning of the absorption of shortwave radiation by the canopy components. However, experimental and modelling results show that canopy broadband nadir reflectance and albedo are not significantly decreasing with increasing shrub biomass. We conclude that the leaf to branch ratio, canopy background, and vegetation type replaced by shrubs need to be considered when predicting feedbacks of shrubification to summer albedo, permafrost thaw, and climate warming.

Remote monitoring of aboveground biomass of emergent wetland vegetation will help address this need. Differences in sensor spatial resolution, bandwidth, temporal frequency and cost constrain the accuracy of biomass maps produced for management applications. In addition the use of vegetation indices to map biomass may not be effective in wetlands due to confounding effects of water inundation on spectral reflectance. To address these challenges, we used partial least squares regression to select optimal spectral features in situ and with satellite reflectance data to develop predictive models of aboveground biomass for common emergent freshwater marsh species, Typha spp. and Schoenoplectus acutus, at two restored marshes in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, California, USA. We used field spectrometer data to test model errors associated with hyperspectral narrowbands and multispectral broadbands, the influence of water inundation on prediction accuracy, and the ability to develop species specific models. We used Hyperion data, Digital Globe World View-2 (WV-2) data, and Landsat 7 data to scale up the best statistical models of biomass. Field spectrometer-based models of the full dataset showed that narrowband reflectance data predicted biomass somewhat, though not significantly better than broadband reflectance data [R-2 = 0.46 and percent normalized RMSE (%RMSE) = 16% for narrowband models]. However hyperspectral first derivative reflectance spectra best predicted biomass for plots where water levels were less than 15 cm (R-2 = 0.69, %RMSE = 12.6%). In species-specific models, error rates differed by species (Typha spp.: %RMSE = 18.5%; S. acutus: %RMSE = 24.9%), likely due to the more vertical structure and deeper water habitat of S. acutus. The Landsat 7 dataset (7 images) predicted biomass slightly better than the WV-2 dataset (6 images) (R-2 = 0.56, %RMSE = 20.9%, compared to R-2 = 0.45, RMSE = 21.5%). The Hyperion dataset (one image) was least successful in predicting biomass (R-2 = 027, %RMSE = 33.5%). Shortwave infrared bands on 30 m-resolution Hyperion and Landsat 7 sensors aided biomass estimation; however managers need to weigh tradeoffs between cost, additional spectral information, and high spatial resolution that will identify variability in small, fragmented marshes common to the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and elsewhere in the Western U.S. Published by Elsevier Inc.', '[Byrd, Kristin B.] US Geol Survey, Western Geog Sci Ctr, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.

The current satellite algorithm using the data of ocean color scanners, such as SeaWiFS and MODIS, is based on retrieval of the bacicscattering coefficient and then estimation of the calcite concentration via an empirical relationship. The regional algorithm for the Black Sea is also an empirical relationship between the coccolithophore concentration and the particle bacicscattering coefficient, based on in situ measured data. The drawback of the both algorithms is that \"non-coccolithophore\" backscattering is not accounted for. This shortcoming is particularly significant for the Black Sea which is strongly influenced by river runoff.   We analyze the problem of taking into account the \"non-coccolithophore\" backscattering by using the integrated approach with the comprehensive data set including satellite data and optical, hydrological and biogeochemical parameters measured in situ in the eastern part of the Black Sea. The main result obtained is a new algorithm for retrieval of coccolithophore concentration in the Black Sea from satellite ocean color data. The algorithm is based on the two-parametric model of the particle backscattering coefficient, which takes into account both coccolithophore bloom and river runoff. Application of the new algorithm to satellite ocean color data in 1998-2011 gave an opportunity to separate the changes associated with the abovementioned factors. Several new interesting results were obtained. It was shown that coccolithophore blooms occupied only a part of the area with high values of the particle backscattering coefficient, and there were the years with no coccolithophore bloom in the Black Sea in June even though the high values of the particle backscattering coefficient were observed.   The other problems to be solved for improvement of the satellite algorithm, providing a quantitative assessment of the intensity of coccolithophore blooms in the Black Sea, were discussed.

Physically-based approaches have higher transferability and are therefore better suited than empirically-based approaches for estimating LAI and Cab at global scales. These approaches, however, require the inversion of radiative transfer (RT) models, which is an ill-posed and underdetermined problem. Four regularization methods have been proposed, allowing finding stable solutions: 1) model coupling, 2) using a priori information (e.g. Bayesian approaches), 3) spatial constraints (e.g. using objects), and 4) temporal constraints. For mono-temporal data, only the first three methods can be applied.   In an earlier study, we presented a Bayesian object-based algorithm for inverting the SLC-MODTRAN4 coupled canopy-atmosphere RT model, and compared it with a Bayesian LUT inversion. The results showed that the object-based approach provided more accurate LAI estimates. This study, however, heavily relied on expert knowledge about the objects and vegetation classes. Therefore, in this new contribution, we investigated the applicability of the Bayesian object-based inversion of the SLC-MODTRAN4 model to a situation where no such knowledge was available.   The case study used a 16 x 22 km(2) simulated top-of-atmosphere image of the upcoming Sentinel-2 sensor, covering the area near the city of Zurich, Switzerland. Seven APEX radiance images were nadir-normalized using the parametric Li-Ross model, spectrally and spatially resampled to Sentinel-2 specifications, geometrically corrected, and mosaicked. The atmospheric effects between APEX flight height and top-of-atmosphere level, were added based on two MODTRAN4 simulations. The vegetation objects were identified and delineated using a segmentation algorithm, and classified in four levels of brightness in the visible domain. The LAI and Cab maps obtained from the Bayesian object-based inversion of the coupled SLC-MODTRAN4 model presented realistic spatial patterns. The impact of the parametric Li-Ross nadir-normalization was evaluated by comparing 1) the angular signatures of the SLC-MODTRAN4 and Li-Ross models, and 2) the LAI and Cab maps obtained from a Li-Ross nadir-normalized image (using nadir viewing geometry) and from the original image (using the original viewing geometry). The differences in angular signatures were small but systematic, and the differences between the LAI and Cab maps increased from the center towards the edges of the across-track direction. The results of this study contribute to preparing the RS community for the arrival of Sentinel-2 data in the near future, and generalize the applicability of the Bayesian object-based approach for estimating vegetation variables to cases where no field data are available.

Using our newly developed empirical angular models for smoke aerosols we calculate the SWARF over South America for eight years (2000-2008) during the biomass burning season. Our results indicate that when compared to our new angular distribution model-derived values, the instantaneous SWARF is underestimated by the CERES data by nearly 3.3 Wm(-2).

Light attenuation is traditionally quantified as the diffuse attenuation coefficient of the photosynthetically available radiation (K-d(PAR)). Global coverage of K-d(PAR) at high spatial and temporal resolution can be provided by satellite measurements, and these data can be used to improve our understanding of the physical, chemical and biological processes in Lake Taihu, a large shallow lake in China, of considerable importance as a source of drinking water for several large cities.   The primary dominated contributor to K-d(PAR) was determined firstly using linear regression. There was a significant positive correlation between K-d(PAR) and concentrations of total suspended matter (TSM). The determination coefficient between K-d(PAR) and TSM (R-2 = 0.91) was significantly higher than that between K-d(PAR) and chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a) (R-2 = 0.11), and between K-d(PAR) and absorption of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) (R-2 = 0.01). Our results therefore could demonstrate that TSM usually plays a dominant role in the attenuation of light in Lake Taihu.   A retrieval model of K-d(PAR) values for Lake Taihu was subsequently developed using top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance of Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) image data at band 10, which was strongly correlated with in situ K-d(PAR) (R-2 = 0.74, p < 0.005, N = 48). In contrast, the atmospheric corrected reflectance of MERIS image data was not strongly correlated with in situ K-d(PAR). Thus, atmospheric correction was not a prerequisite for estimations of K(PAR) in this highly turbid and hyper-eutrophic lake, and a simple empirical model of the K-d(PAR) estimation for Lake Taihu was effective.   With the simple model, the seasonal and spatial distributions of K-d(PAR) in Lake Taihu were studied using the MERIS measurements from 2003 to 2010. Our results show distinct seasonal, spatial, and wind driven, K-d(PAR) values in Lake Taihu. The highest and the lowest K-d(PAR) values were found in summer and in winter, respectively. The increase of K-d(PAR) in summer can be attributed to the phytoplankton blooms, and wind-driven sediment resuspension. Spatially, the K-d(PAR) values were high in the southern part and the lake center, and low K-d(PAR) in East Lake Taihu. Based on the MERIS derived K-d(PAR) values, a significant correlation was found between K(PAR) and wind speeds, suggesting a critical role of wind speeds in the K-d(PAR) variations in Lake Taihu.

ECV estimates and the corresponding MCD15A3 Collection 5 and GEOLAND-2 (GE0v1) products are compared with ECV reference maps derived from BV-NNET applied on 105 high spatial resolution images (Formosat-2, 8 m) which were acquired from 2006 to 2010 in Southwest France. These latter are compared with local scale in situ measurements. The validation shows an uncertainty of 035 and 0.07 for LAI and FAPAR, respectively.   The comparison shows that the ECV estimates from the three products properly capture the crops phenology in agreement with reference maps. Results indicate that MCD15A3 uncertainties (023 and 0.07 for LAI and FAPAR, respectively) are similar to previous intercomparison studies. GE0v1 shows a systemic positive bias for both LAI and FAPAR. The best agreement with the reference maps is found for MODIS BV-NNET products with r2 higher than 0.9 and relative uncertainties lower than 17%. The use of BRDF-corrected surface reflectances as input of BV-NNET tool improves the uncertainty of LAI estimates (0.11, compared to 0.17 when directional surface reflectances are used as input) but not the uncertainty of FAPAR estimates. The deviation between FAPAR products which mostly.affects low winter FAPAR, is related to the discrepancy of the soil directional assumption in PROSAIL model and BRDF correction method. The temporal stability of the daily MODIS BV-NNET products is better than the 4-day composite MCD15A3 products. Finally, BV-NNET tool applied at finer resolutions demonstrates that the increase of the resolution results in a decrease of the LAI and FAPAR uncertainties and a conservation of the biases.

LAI and Cab can be estimated from remote sensing data using either empirical or physically-based approaches. The latter are more generally applicable because they can easily be adapted to different sensors, acquisition geometries, and vegetation types. They estimate vegetation variables through inversion of radiative transfer models. Such inversions are ill-posed but can be regularized by coupling models, by using a priori information, and spatial and/or temporal constraints. Striving to improve the accuracy of LAI and Cab estimates from single remote sensing images, this contribution proposes a Bayesian object-based approach to invert at-sensor radiance data, combining the strengths of regularization by model coupling, as well as using a priori data and object-level spatial constraints.   The approach was applied to a study area consisting of homogeneous agricultural fields, which were used as objects for applying the spatial constraints. LAI and Cab were estimated from at-sensor radiance data of the Airborne Prism EXperiment (APEX) imaging spectrometer by inverting the coupled SLC-MODTRAN4 canopy-atmosphere model. The estimation was implemented in two steps. In the first step, up to six variables were estimated for each object using a Bayesian optimization algorithm. In the second step, a look-up-table (WT) was built for each object with only LAI and Cab as free variables, constraining the values of all other variables to the values obtained in the first step. The results indicated that the Bayesian object-based approach estimated LAI more accurately (R-2 = 0.45 and RMSE = 1.0) than a LUT with a Bayesian cost function (LUT-BCF) approach (R-2 = 022 and RMSE = 2.1), and Cab with a smaller absolute bias (-9 versus -23 mu g/cm(2)).   The results of this study are an important contribution to further improve the regularization of ill-posed RT model inversions. The proposed approach allows reducing uncertainties of estimated vegetation variables, which is essential to support various environmental applications. The definition of objects and a priori data in cases where less extensive ground data are available, as well as the definition of the observation covariance matrix, are critical issues which require further research.

The strategy follows the recommendations of the CEOS/WGCV Land Product Validation for LAI global products validation. Several criteria of performance were evaluated, including continuity, spatial and temporal consistency, dynamic range of retrievals, statistical analysis per biome type, precision and accuracy. The spatial and temporal consistencies of GEOV1 products were assessed by intercomparison with reference global products (MODIS c5, CYCLOPES v3.1, GLOBCARBON v2 LAI, and JRC SeaWIFS FAPAR) over a global network of homogeneous sites (BELMANIP-2) during the 2003-2005 period. The accuracy of GEOV1 was evaluated against a number of available ground reference maps. Our results show that GEOV1 products present reliable spatial distribution, smooth temporal profiles which are stable from year to year, good dynamic range with reliable magnitude for bare areas and dense forests, and optimal performances with ground-based maps. GEOV1 outperforms the quality of reference global products in most of the examined criteria, and constitutes a step forward in the development of consistent and accurate global biophysical variables within the context of the land monitoring core service of GMES.

Accurately quantifying these properties is important for characterizing the dynamics of mass and energy exchanges between vegetation and the atmosphere. The overall objective of this research was to validate the spatial and temporal performance of the MODIS LAI/FPAR products for a boreal forest landscape in northern Manitoba, Canada. We examined both the MODIS collection 4 (C4) and updated collection 5 (C5) versions over a multiyear period (2004 to 2006) and spatially across seven different-aged forests originating from wildfire and ranging in age from 1-to 154-years-old. We made optical measurements of LAI and FPAR, which were empirically scaled to high-resolution imagery (ASTER; 15-30 m pixel size) to derive detailed reference LAI and FPAR maps. These maps were then aggregated to MODIS resolution (i.e. 1 km) for comparison. We characterized the temporal accuracy of the MODIS products using repeat measurements of LAI and FPAR, and through comparisons with continuously operating measurements of canopy light interception.   MODIS captured the general phenological trajectory of these aggrading forests, however the MODIS LAl and FPAR products overestimated and underestimated the LAI and FPAR for the youngest and oldest sites, respectively. In addition, MODIS displayed larger seasonal variation in LAI and FPAR compared to field measurements for the needle-leaf evergreen dominated sites. The peak growing season difference between MODIS and spatially aggregated ASTER reference values of LAI and FPAR decreased significantly by 69% and 55%, respectively, for the updated C5 versus the previous C4 LAI/FPAR products. The overall uncertainty (i.e. RMSE) in the MODIS LAI retrievals decreased from 1.6 (C4) to 0.63 m(2) m(-2) (C5) and from 020 (C4) to 0.07 (C5) for FPAR. The incorporation of understory vegetation into the validation of the MODIS products yielded significantly higher agreement between observed and MODIS values, likely due to the relatively open canopy architecture and abundant understory found within boreal forests.

In this study we used a new downscaling-calibration procedure of the freely accessible Version 7 of TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) 3B43 product, in conjunction with limited rain gauge data sets, to generate improved monthly pixel-based precipitation data at higher spatial resolution (1 km). The spatial downscaling from 0.25 degrees to 1 km grids was achieved by using site-specific non-linear relationships between annual precipitation and annually averaged NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). The calibration was based on Geograhical Difference Analysis (GDA) and Geographical Ratio Analysis (GRA). The new integrated procedure was tested for Lake Tana Basin (LTB) in Ethiopia with a humid climate (rainfall 1395 mm/yr during 1998-2004) and for the Caspian Sea Region (CSR) in Iran with a semi-arid climate (rainfall 442 mm/yr during 1999-2003). The best 1 km annual precipitation data were achieved through downscaling followed by GDA calibration for most cases. The monthly fractions derived from the un-calibrated TRMM 3B43 product can be used to disaggregate 1 km annual precipitation to 1 km monthly precipitation. The disaggregated 1 km monthly precipitation has not only significant improvement in the spatial resolution, but also good agreements with rain gauge data were achieved for both LTB (R-2=0.87, RMSE=56 mm, MAE=32 mm and Bias=0.01) and the CSR (R-2=0.79, RMSE=23 mm, MAE=16 mm and Bias=0.14).

We show that exploiting the 8.7 mu m channel, in addition to the \"traditional\" wavelengths of 10.8 and 12.0 mu m, improves OE SST retrieval statistics in validation. However, the main benefit is an improvement in the sensitivity of the SST estimate to variability in true SST.   In a fair, single-pixel comparison, the 3-channel OE gives better results than the SST estimation technique presently operational within the Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility. This operational technique is to use SST retrieval coefficients, followed by a bias-correction step informed by radiative transfer simulation. However, the operational technique has an additional \"atmospheric correction smoothing\", which improves its noise performance, and hitherto had no analogue within the OE framework. Here, we propose an analogue to atmospheric correction smoothing, based on the expectation that atmospheric total column water vapour has a longer spatial correlation length scale than SST features. The approach extends the observations input to the OE to include the averaged brightness temperatures (BTs) of nearby clear-sky pixels, in addition to the BTs of the pixel for which SST is being retrieved. The retrieved quantities are then the single-pixel SST and the clear-sky total column water vapour averaged over the vicinity of the pixel. This reduces the noise in the retrieved SST significantly. The robust standard deviation of the new OE SST compared to matched drifting buoys becomes 0.39 K for all data. The smoothed OE gives SST sensitivity of 98% on average. This means that diurnal temperature variability and ocean frontal gradients are more faithfully estimated, and that the influence of the prior SST used is minimal (2%). This benefit is not available using traditional atmospheric correction smoothing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Merchant, C.

The majority of the degraded pixels are filled using multi-temporal images as referable information by building a regression model between the corresponding pixels. When the auxiliary multi-temporal data cannot completely recover the missing pixels, a non-reference regularization algorithm is used to implement the pixel filling. To assess the efficacy of the proposed method, simulated and actual SLC-off ETM + images were tested. The quantitative evaluations suggest that the proposed method can predict the missing values very accurately. The method performs especially well in edges, and is able to keep the shape of ground features.

High resolution, multi-directional and hyperspectral image acquisitions start to be abundant With regard to the multi-angular remote sensing data, the hot spot, i.e. the exact backscattering direction of direct sunlight together with its neighboring directions, is of special interest. Accurate hot spot models have to be used to adequately simulate the hot spot signature and to allow reliable inversion of multi-angular data. In this paper, we propose a physical hot spot model (Leaf Spatial Distribution based Model, LSDM) assuming that for a given point inside the vegetation to be sunlit (respectively, observed) it should be located within a cylinder free from leaf centers. The cylinder is oriented to the sun (respectively, sensor) direction. Assuming a leaf random, regular or clumped spatial distributions, the gap probabilities in the sun and sensor directions are expressed as a function of these cylinder volumes. Based on the same hypothesis, the bidirectional gap probability is estimated as a function of the total volume of the two cylinders. The evaluation of the needed common volume of two cylinders having different radii is reduced to calculation of some elliptic integrals. Finally, the hot spot signature is estimated based on the bidirectional gap probability distribution. Different model versions with different leaf spatial distribution functions are compared. Particularly, it is shown that compared to the random distribution, the regular (the clumped, respectively) distribution increases (decreases, respectively) the reflectance due to single scattering contribution from foliage. The proposed model is validated using the ROMC web-based tool and its better performance compared to the Semi-Discrete Model and Kuusk\'s model is confirmed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, aerosol observations for this area are sparse and hence there is considerable uncertainty in the knowledge on the properties of the Arctic aerosol. Atmospheric remote sensing using satellite-based instruments offers an opportunity to obtain information on aerosol properties, in particular the aerosol optical depth (AOD) on an extended spatial scale as determined by the instrument\'s swath width. However, ADD retrieval over a bright surface is a difficult task because it is difficult to separate and explicitly describe the contribution of the surface and that due to back-scattering by aerosols to the radiance observed by a satellite at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), especially at large Solar Zenith Angles (SZA). In this paper, an approach to achieve this is presented based on a synergetic approach using data from both Moderate Resolution Imaging.Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments flying on the TERRA and AQUA satellites. The approached also uses prior knowledge for aerosol properties retrieval over snow as well as a Snow Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model. The detailed analysis of the model results demonstrates that the Aerosol Properties Retrieval over Snow (APRS) algorithm is suitable for Arctic region Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrieval. The study periods include April 2010 and April 2011, when the Arctic haze mostly occurs. Six AERONET stations at high latitude (Andenes, Barrow, Ittoqqortoormiit, OPAL, Thule, and PEARL) were used for comparison. The correlation coefficient between retrieved AODs and AERONET AODs was 0.8 and the relative error is between 10% and 20%, demonstrating the potential of the APRS method to retrieve ADD over the Arctic, with highly reflective snow/ice surfaces and large solar zenith angles.

Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) can be used for both classification and modeling fractional composition, and has been applied to map multiple biogeophysical variables. Our major objectives in this research were to 1) test a sampling design for building independent and representative training and validation spectral libraries; 2) compare endmember selection by a combination of two established techniques (count-based selection (CoB) and endmember average root mean square error (EAR)) with a recently introduced one (iterative endmember selection (IES)); and 3) develop and test a hybrid method, which combines the strengths of the previous two methods. We applied CoB/EAR, IES, and the new hybrid technique to mapping plant species and cover types in the Santa Ynez Mountains and Santa Barbara urban area, California, USA, using Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data. For all endmember selection techniques, the number of selected endmembers varied across 25 random training samples. IES was consistently more accurate than CoB/EAR, but resulted in spectral libraries more than twice as large and failed to model rare species. The hybrid endmember selection technique resulted in the highest overall accuracy and kappa values and proved to be least sensitive to the random sampling protocols, but also produced the largest spectral libraries. A modified hybrid method, in which the number of endmembers selected was limited, produced the second highest accuracies, combining the strengths of the more parsimonious endmember selection by CoB/EAR with improved endmember selection by IES. Both IES and the hybrid methods selected endmembers that successfully classified a wide range of plant species and cover types, indicating their usefulness for these applications.

We propose a new methodology, based on spectral optimization in the near-infrared, to simultaneously estimate the contributions generated by atmospheric signals and oceanic particles, which is valid for case-1 and case-2 waters. This approach, denoted NeuroVaria, combines a neural network to model the radiative transfer with a variational algorithm for the spectral inversion.   NeuroVaria was applied to MERIS data recorded between August 2003 and September 2005 over the Adriatic Sea, off the Venice Lagoon. for which, in situ measurements of the water-leaving reflectance and aerosol optical thickness were available. We present comparisons between the results obtained using NeuroVaria and the MERIS second reprocessing (Megs7.4), and those derived from in situ measurements. We show that NeuroVaria achieves better estimations of the Aerosol optical properties, and improves the atmospheric correction for case-2 waters. Using MERIS multi-spectral images, it was thus possible to detect typical features of the Po River discharge into the northern Adriatic, as well as suspended sediments due to the shoaling of wind waves on their approach to the seashore shallow waters.

In this study, we evaluated seasonal variations in MODIS Collection 5 (C5) LAI products for an evergreen coniferous forest area in southern Finland. A time series of field measurements of LAI and nine fine resolution satellite images (SPOT4 HRVIR, EO-1 Hyperion) for the snow free period in 2010 were used for developing empirical regression models for LAI estimation. We used two different reference LAI: the first one corresponded to an effective overstory LAI, and the second one was a clumping-corrected LAI that included both over- and understory vegetation. According to the results, MODIS LAI retrievals were closer to the effective LAI in the spring and autumn, when saturation of MODIS LAI main algorithm did not occur. On the other hand, in the summer, when saturation occurred, MODIS LAI was closer to the total LAI. Therefore, as a result of high LAI retrieved under the condition of saturation, the seasonal course of LAI was exaggerated in comparison to the reference LAI time series. Furthermore, MODIS LAI retrievals were unrealistically small before the leaf burst if considering the large proportion of evergreen coniferous forest in the study area. The results emphasize the need for multi-seasonal validation data sets in order to better understand the performance of LAI retrieval algorithms for evergreen coniferous forests throughout the snow free period.

Cross-validated median AUROC values were mostly between 0.70 and 0.80, or \"fair,\" in this focused pilot study, but much better results are to be expected at the landscape scale. Permutation-based spatial variable importance measures indicate that Gabor features corresponding to texture wavelengths between 10 and 30 m are the most important predictors, which is consistent with typical ridge spacing on rock glaciers. Confounding occurred mostly in areas with linear erosion features and ridges or scarps in morainic and thermokarst terrain. We suggest that texture filters and the chosen methodological approach are relevant not only for rock glacier mapping but also for delineating debris-covered glaciers and characterizing glacier surfaces, as well as for other geomorphological and cryospheric applications.

This is an extended study after a successful demonstration of PRI simulations for a cornfield previously conducted at an early vegetative growth stage. Consistent with previous in situ studies, sunlit leaves exhibited lower PRI values than shaded leaves. Since sunlit (shaded) foliage dominates the canopy in the reflectance hotspot (coldspot), the canopy PRI derived from field hyperspectral observations displayed sensitivity to both view zenith angle and relative azimuth angle at all growth stages. Consequently, sunlit and shaded canopy sectors were most differentiated when viewed along the azimuth matching the solar principal plane. These directional PRI responses associated with sunlit/shaded foliage were successfully reproduced by the ACRM. As before, the simulated PRI values from the current study were closer to in situ values when both sunlit and shaded leaves were utilized as model input data in a two-layer mode, instead of a one-layer mode with sunlit leaves only. Model performance as judged by correlation between in situ and simulated values was strongest for the mature corn crop (r = 0.87, RMSE = 0.0048), followed by the early vegetative stage (r = 0.78; RMSE = 0.0051) and the early senescent stage (r = 0.65; RMSE = 0.0104). Since the benefit of including shaded leaves in the scheme varied across different growth stages, a further analysis was conducted to investigate how variable fractions of sunlit/shaded leaves affect the canopy PRI values expected for a cornfield, with implications for remote sensing monitoring options. Simulations of the sunlit to shaded canopy ratio near 50/50 +/- 10 (e.g., 60/40) matching field observations at all growth stages were examined. Our results suggest the importance of the sunlit/shaded fraction and canopy structure in understanding and interpreting PRI. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Our results support the established postulation that the onset of summer rain in the southern region is associated with the migration of the inter-tropical convergence zone and in phase with the meridional moisture transport from the Gulf of Guinea. We present recent satellite measurements that illustrate the phase shift of the precipitation in the northern region, the Sahel, with respect to the region to the south. These satellite data and associated analysis techniques let us combine the effect of the onshore flow at the surface and offshore transport aloft to demonstrate with sufficient clarity that the depth-integrated moisture advection across the west coast, from the open Atlantic Ocean into the Sahel region, is in-phase with the annual and inter-annual variations of Sahel rainfall, but out-of-phase with rainfall in the southern region around the Gulf of Guinea. The peak Sahel rainfall is associated with the short-lived net moisture influx from the Atlantic, which may interact with local instability related to the African Easterly Waves.

The algorithm is based on the canopy spectral invariants theory and provides a computationally efficient way of parameterizing the Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF) as a function of spatial resolution and wavelength. LAI retrievals from the application of this algorithm to aggregated Landsat surface reflectances are consistent with those of MODIS for homogeneous sites represented by different herbaceous and forest cover types. Example results illustrating the physics and performance of the algorithm suggest three key factors that influence the LAI retrieval process: 1) the atmospheric correction procedures to estimate surface reflectances; 2) the proximity of Landsat-observed surface reflectance and corresponding reflectances as characterized by the model simulation: and 3) the quality of the input land cover type in accurately delineating pure vegetated components as opposed to mixed pixels. Accounting for these factors, a pilot implementation of the LAI retrieval algorithm was demonstrated for the state of California utilizing the Global Land Survey (GLS) 2005 Landsat data archive. In a separate exercise, the performance of the LAI algorithm over California was evaluated by using the short-wave infrared band in addition to the red and near-infrared bands. Results show that the algorithm, while ingesting the short-wave infrared band, has the ability to delineate open canopies with understory effects and may provide useful information compared to a more traditional two-band retrieval. Future research will involve implementation of this algorithm at continental scales and a validation exercise will be performed in evaluating the accuracy of the 30-m LAI products at several field sites.

As a result, the current methods for large area monitoring of land cover change using medium spatial resolution imagery (10-50 m) typically employ Landsat data. Most large area products quantify forest cover change. Forests are a comparatively easy cover type to map as well as a current focus of environmental monitoring concerning the global carbon cycle and biodiversity loss. Among existing change products, supervised or knowledge-based characterization methods predominate. Radiometric correction methods vary significantly, largely as a function of geographic/algorithmic scale. For instance, products created by mosaicking per scene characterizations do not require radiometric normalization. On the other hand, methods that employ a single index or classification model over an entire study area do require radiometric normalization. Temporal updating of cover change varies between existing products as a function of regional acquisition frequency, cloud cover and seasonality. With the Landsat archive opened for free access to terrain-corrected data, future product generation will be more data intensive. Per scene, interactive analyses will no longer be viable. Coupling free and open access to large data volumes with improved processing power will result in automated image pre-processing and land cover characterization methods. Such methods will need to leverage high-performance computing capabilities in advancing the land cover monitoring discipline. Robust validation efforts will be required to quantify product accuracies in determining the optimal change characterization methodologies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Conversely, Landsat data are more widely available, but exhibit a weaker relationship with structure under medium to high leaf area conditions. One potentially valuable means of enhancing the relationship between Landsat reflectance and forest structure is to incorporate Landsat spectral trends prior to a date of interest. Because the condition of a forest stand at any point in time is linked to the stand\'s disturbance history, an approach that directly leverages the temporal information of Landsat time series should improve estimates of forest structure. The main objective of this study was to test and demonstrate the utility of disturbance and recovery metrics derived from spectral profiles of annual Landsat time series (LTS) to predict current forest structure attributes (as compared to more traditional approaches, including airborne, discrete return lidar and single-date Landsat). We estimated aboveground live biomass (AGB(live)), dead woody biomass (AGB(dead)), basal area (live and dead), and Lorey\'s mean stand height for a mixed-conifer forest in eastem Oregon, USA, and compared the results with estimates from lidar and single, current-date Landsat imagery. Annual time-series stacks for the entire Landsat record (1972-2010) were obtained to characterize all long-term (insect, growth) and short-term (fire, harvest) vegetation changes that occurred during that period. This required the additional objective of integrating Landsat data from MSS and TM/ETM + sensors, and we describe here our approach. To extract spectral trajectories and change metrics associated with forest disturbances and recovery we applied a temporal segmentation to the calibrated time series.   Lidar predicted forest structure of live trees most accurately (e.g. AGB(live): R-2 = 0.88, RMSE = 35.3 Mg ha(-1)). However, LTS metrics significantly improved model predictions (e.g. AGB(live): R-2 = 0.80, RMSE = 46.9 Mg ha(-1)) compared to single-date Landsat data (AGB(live), R-2 = 0.58, RMSE = 65.1 Mg ha(-1)). Conversely, distributions of AGB(dead) were more strongly associated with disturbance history than current structure of live trees. As a result, LTS models performed significantly better in estimating AGB(dead) (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 31.0 Mg ha(-1)), than lidar models (R-2 = 0.21, RMSE= 43.8 Mg ha(-1)); and single-date Landsat data failed completely (R-2 = 0, RMSE= 47.8 Mg ha(-1)). Further, ITS metrics that integrated disturbance and recovery history over the entire time series generally predicted AGB(dead) better than metrics describing single events only (e.g. the greatest disturbance). This study demonstrates the unique value of the long, historic Landsat record, and suggests new potentials for mapping current forest structure with Landsat. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

One of TROPOMI\'s primary goals will be to accurately monitor methane (CH4) concentrations in the Earth\'s atmosphere by measuring spectra of sunlight backscattered by the Earth\'s surface and atmosphere in the shortwave-infrared (SWIR) spectral range. Absorption by CH4 along the lightpath allows for the spectroscopic retrieval of its atmospheric abundance given accurate knowledge of the lightpath. Scattering by aerosol and cirrus particles, however, can modify the lightpath substantially causing retrieval errors if not appropriately taken into account. We propose and evaluate a method to minimise these errors by simultaneously retrieving CH4 total column concentrations and scattering properties of the atmosphere. The method exploits observations by TROPOMI\'s SWIR and near-infrared (NIR) channels and is based on a parameterisation of particle amount, height distribution, and microphysical properties. Retrieval performance is tested for a trial ensemble of simulated observations that cover a realistic range of aerosol and cirrus loaded scenes. For more than 90% of the trials, residual scattering induced CH4 errors are less than 1%. Retrievals with residual errors larger than 1% and non-convergent retrievals typically occur for difficult scenes with high particle load or very small surface albedo. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

ESA\'s role in GMES is to provide the definition and the development of the space- and ground-related system elements. GMES Sentinel-2 mission provides continuity to services relying on multi-spectral high-resolution optical observations over global terrestrial surfaces. The key mission objectives for Sentinel-2 are: (1) To provide systematic global acquisitions of high-resolution multi-spectral imagery with a high revisit frequency, (2) to provide enhanced continuity of multi-spectral imagery provided by the SPOT (Satellite Pour l\'Observation de la Terre) series of satellites. and (3) to provide observations for the next generation of operational products such as land-cover maps, land change detection maps, and geophysical variables. Consequently, Sentinel-2 will directly contribute to the Land Monitoring, Emergency Response, and Security services. The corresponding user requirements have driven the design toward a dependable multi-spectral Earth-observation system featuring the Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) with 13 spectral bands spanning from the visible and the near infrared to the short wave infrared. The spatial resolution varies from 10 m to 60 m depending on the spectral band with a 290 km field of view. This unique combination of high spatial resolution, wide field of view and spectral coverage will represent a major step forward compared to current multi-spectral missions. The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having a 7.25-year lifetime over a 15-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-2A foreseen in 2013. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in the same orbit with a phase delay of 180 degrees providing a revisit time of five days at the equator. This paper provides an overview of the GMES Sentinel-2 mission including a technical system concept overview, image quality. Level 1 data processing and operational applications.

Previously, a Normalized Difference between Hotspot and Darkspot (NDHD) index has been proposed to accurately retrieve the global CI using POLarization and Directionality of the Earth\'s Reflectances (POLDER) data at similar to 6 km resolution (Chen et al., 2005). In this study, we show for the first time a global Cl map at 500 m resolution derived using the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) product from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which currently provides the finest pseudo multi-angular data for the global land surface. In computing the NDHD we found that the hotspot calculated from the MODIS BRDF product is underestimated in comparison with POLDER measurements very near the hotspot. Without correcting the bias in MODIS data, the MODIS-derived Cl could be overestimated. We have developed an approach to correct the MODIS hotspot magnitude with co-registered POLDER-3 data acquired at about the same time. Field-measured element-Cls in zenith angles of 30-60 by the Tracing Radiation and Architecture of Canopies (TRAC) instrument from 38 sites together with corresponding needle-to-shoot area ratios were used to evaluate the performance of hotspot-corrected NDHD and to tune the parameters to get accurate CI. It is found that the MODIS-derived CI has a dependence on the solar zenith angle, and this dependence in the red band is smaller than that in the near infrared (NIR) band. The highest correlation between field measurements and MODIS-derived CI is achieved when hotspot at nadir is used. The correct estimation of forest species (and therefore the crown shapes) from land cover is very important to the accuracy of MODIS-derived CI. For the red band, the coefficient of determination (R-2) between MODIS-derived CIand field-measured CI is 0.76 for all sites and le is 0.53 for only the needle-leaved forest sites after the hotspot correction, indicating that a strong correlation between MODIS-derived NDHD and CI indeed exists. The MODIS-derived CI is regularly smaller than the field measurement. The red band in the MODIS BRDF product is found to be better than the NIR band for deriving CI for the vegetation covers investigated (mostly dense forests). Therefore a global clumping index map has been produced using the corrected MODIS hot\\spot in the red band and optimized parameters. However there were 10 broad-leaved forest sites used in the validation, which are too few for a reliable validation. For the broad-leaved forest area, where the same crown shape (ellipsoid) is used in the algorithm, the global CI spatial pattern is interestingly very similar to the pattern of the land cover distribution, suggesting that the MODIS-derived map has effectively captured the structural differences among cover types.

Different crops have their own representative phenological stages during their growing seasons, which differ considerably from other natural vegetation types. During the last decade, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has become a key tool for vegetation monitoring because of its high temporal resolution, extensive scope, and rapid availability of various products. However, mixed pixels caused by the moderate spatial resolution produce significant errors in crop area estimation. Here we propose a Crop Proportion Phenology Index (CPPI) to express the quantitative relationship between the MODIS vegetation index (VI) time series and winter wheat crop area. The utility of this index was tested in two experimental areas in China: one around Tongzhou and the other around Shuyang, as representative districts around a metropolis and a rural area, respectively. The CPPI performed well in these two regions, with the root mean square error (RMSE) in fractional crop area predictions ranging roughly from 15% in the individual pixels to 5% above 6.25 km(2). The training samples containing mixtures of crop types mitigated the challenges of pure end-member selection in a spectral mixture analysis. A small number of training samples are sufficient to generate the CPPI, which is adaptable to other crop types and larger regions. Estimating the CPPI parameters across larger spatial scales helped improve the stability of the model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

An analysis of the technical potential of the current orbital sensors capable of measuring NO2 in the proximity of the tropopause has been conducted. In order to estimate an upper bound for the NO2 column related to aircraft emissions, the Canary Islands Corridor has been selected for conducting a simple emission calculation exercise based on real air traffic and operational data, assuming an ideal atmospheric scenario. The results obtained in this approximation have been compared to the actual information retrieved from space sensors. An in-depth inspection of the NO2 column data for two particular areas (Canary Islands Corridor and North Atlantic Flight Corridor) obtained in recent years by SCIAMACHY and OMI has also been carried out.   The general conclusions of this viability study are not optimistic. The estimated maximum NO2 column value attributable to aircraft emissions at cruise altitudes were lower than the detection limits associated with SCIAMACHY and OMI for NO2 column measurements. As a result, detecting and quantifying the actual NO2 levels in aircraft corridors by space remote sensing is a very challenging task. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

However, the most widespread type of algorithm used is the mathematical combination of visible and near-infrared reflectance bands, in the form of spectral vegetation indices. Applications of such vegetation indices have ranged from leaves to the entire globe, but in many instances, their applicability is specific to species, vegetation types or local conditions. The general objective of this study is to evaluate different vegetation indices for the remote estimation of the green leaf area index (Green LAI) of two crop types (maize and soybean) with contrasting canopy architectures and leaf structures. Among the indices tested, the chlorophyll Indices (the CIGreen, the CIRed-edge and the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index, MTCI) exhibited strong and significant linear relationships with Green LAI and thus were sensitive across the entire range of Green LAI evaluated (i.e., 0.0 to more than 6.0 m(2)/m(2)). However, the CIRed-edge was the only index insensitive to crop type and produced the most accurate estimations of Green LAI in both crops (RMSE = 0.577 m2/m2). These results were obtained using data acquired with close range sensors (i.e., field spectroradiometers mounted 6 m above the canopy) and an aircraft-mounted hyperspectral imaging spectroradiometer (AISA). As the CIRed-edge also exhibited low sensitivity to soil background effects, it constitutes a simple, yet robust tool for the remote and synoptic estimation of Green LAI. Algorithms based on this index may not require re-parameterization when applied to crops with different canopy architectures and leaf structures, but further studies are required for assessing its applicability in other vegetation types (e.g., forests, grasslands).

Because of its stochastic nature temporal decorrelation is hard to model and isolate. In this paper we analyze temporal decorrelation statistically as observed in a large swath of SIR-C L-Band InSAR data collected over the eastern United States, with a repeat pass duration of one day in October 1994 and a near zero perpendicular baseline. The very small baseline for this particular pair makes the effect of volumetric scattering on correlation magnitude statistics nearly imperceptible, allowing for a quantitative analysis of temporal effects alone. The swath analyzed in this paper spans more than a million hectares of terrain comprised primarily of deciduous and evergreen forests, agricultural land, water and urban areas. The relationships of these different land-cover types, phenology and weather conditions (i.e. precipitation and wind) on the measures of interferometric correlation is analyzed in what amounts to be the most geographically extensive analysis of this phenomenon to date.

We used forest inventory plots in old growth, secondary succession, and forest plantations at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica to examine the spatial variability of AGB and its impact on the L-band and P-band polarimetric radar estimation of AGB at multiple spatial scales. Field estimation of AGB was determined from tree size measurements and an allometric equation developed for tropical wet forests. The field data showed very high spatial variability of forest structure with no spatial dependence at a scale above 11 m in old-growth forest. Plot sizes of greater than 0.25 ha reduced the coefficients of variation in AGB to below 20% and yielded a stationary and normal distribution of AGB over the landscape. Radar backscatter measurements at all polarization channels were strongly positively correlated with AGB at three scales of 0.25 ha, 0.5 ha, and 1.0 ha. Among these measurements, PHV and LHV showed strong sensitivity to AGB<300 Mg ha(-1) and AGB<150 Mg ha(-1) respectively at the 1.0 ha scale. The sensitivity varied across forest types because of differences in the effects of forest canopy and gap structure on radar attenuation and scattering. Spatial variability of structure and speckle noise in radar measurements contributed equally to degrading the sensitivity of the radar measurements to AGB at spatial scales less than 1.0 ha. By using algorithms based on polarized radar backscatter, we estimated AGB with RMSE = 22.6 Mg ha(-1) for AGB<300 Mg ha(-1) at P-band and RMSE = 23.8 Mg ha(-1) for AGB<150 Mg ha(-1) at L-band and with the accuracy optimized at 1-ha scale within 95% confidence interval. By adding the forest height, estimated from the C-band Interferometry data as an independent variable to the algorithm, the AGB estimation improved beyond the backscatter sensitivity by 20% at P-band and 40% at L-band. The results suggested the estimation of AGB can be improved substantially from the fusion of lidar or InSAR derived forest height with the polarimetric backscatter. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Comparing forest structural parameters retrieved using EVI data with extensive ground measurements, we found excellent agreement at the site level using five EVI scans (plots) per site (R-2 = 0.94-0.99): very good agreement at the plot level for stem count density and biomass (R-2 = 0.90-0.85); and good agreement at the plot level for mean DBH and basal area (R-2 = 0.48-0.66). The observed variance at site and plot levels suggest that a sample area of at least 1 ha (10(4) m(2)) is required to estimate these parameters accurately at the stand level using either lidar-based or conventional methods. The algorithms and procedures used to retrieve these structural parameters are dependent on the unique ability of the Echidna (R) lidar to digitize the full waveform of the scattered lidar pulse as it returns to the instrument, which allows consistent separation of scattering by trunks and large branches from scattering by leaves. This successful application of ground-based lidar technology opens the door to rapid and accurate measurement of biomass and timber volume in areal sampling scenarios and as a calibration and validation tool for mapping biomass using airborne or spaceborne remotely sensed data.

However, the main uncertainties using existing SWE algorithms arise from snow metamorphism which evolves during the winter season, and changes the snow emissivity. To consider the evolution in snow emissivity a coupled snow evolution-emission model can be used to simulate the brightness temperature (T-B) of the snowpack.   During a dedicated campaign in the winter season. from November to April, of 2007-2008 two surface-based radiometers operating at 19 GHz and 37 GHz continuously measured the passive microwave radiation emitted through a seasonal snowpack in southern Quebec (Canada). This paper aims at modeling and interpreting this time series of T-B over the whole season, with an hourly step, using a coupled multi-layer snow evolution-emission model. The thermodynamic snow evolution model, referred as to Crocus, was driven by local meteorological measurements. Results from this model provided, in turn, the input variables to run the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS) in order to predict T-B at 19 GHz and 37 GHz for both vertical (V) and horizontal (H) polarizations. The accuracy of T-B predicted by the Crocus-MEMLS coupled model was evaluated using continuous measurements from the surface-based radiometers.   The weather conditions observed during the winter season were diverse, including several warm periods with melting snow and rain-on-snow events, producing very complex variations in the time series of T-B. To aid our analysis, we identified days with melting snow versus days with dry snow. The Crocus-MEMLS coupled model was able to accurately predict melt events with a success rate of 86%. The residual error was due to an overestimation of the duration of several melt events simulated by Crocus. This problem was explained by 1) a limitation of percolation, and 2) a very long-acting melt of lower layers due to geothermal flux.   When the snowpack was completely dry, the global trend of T-B during the season was characterized by a decrease of T-B due to growth in the snow grain size. During most of the season, Crocus-MEMLS correctly predicted the evolution of T-B resulting from temperature gradient metamorphism; the root mean square errors ranged between 2.8 K for the 19 GHz vertical polarization (19V) and 6.9 K for the 37 GHz horizontal polarization (37H). However, during dry periods near the end of the season, the values of T-B were strongly overestimated. This overestimation was mainly due to a limitation of the growth of large snow grains in the wet snowpack simulated by Crocus. This effect was confirmed by estimating snow grain sizes from the observed T-B and the coupled model. The estimated snow grain sizes were larger and more realistic than those initially predicted by the Crocus model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Non-native saltcedar poses significant threats to native vegetation and groundwater resources in the southwestern U.S. and Mexico, and quantifying spatial and temporal distribution patterns is essential for monitoring its spread. Considerable research focuses on determining the accuracy of various remote sensing techniques for distinguishing saltcedar from native woody riparian vegetation through sub-pixel, or soft classifications. However, there is a lack of research quantifying spatial distribution patterns from these classifications, mainly because landscape metrics, which are commonly used to statistically assess these patterns, require bounded classes and cannot be applied directly to soft classifications. This study tests a new method for discretizing sub-pixel data to generate landscape metrics using a continuum of fractional cover thresholds. The developed approach transforms sub-pixel classifications into discrete maps compliant with metric terms and computes and interprets metric results in the context of the region to explain patterns in the extent, distribution, and connectivity of saltcedar in the Rio Grande basin. Results indicate that landscape metrics are sensitive to sub-pixel values and can vary greatly with fractional cover. Therefore spectral unmixing should be performed prior to metric calculations. Analysis of metric trends provides evidence that saltcedar has expanded away from the immediate riparian zones and is displacing native vegetation. This information, coupled with control management strategies, can be used to target remediation activities along the Rio Grande. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Equally important for studying carbon dynamics is the ability to distinguish the cause or type of forest disturbance occurring on the landscape. Wildfire and timber harvesting are common disturbances occurring in boreal forests, with each having differing carbon consequences (i.e., biomass removed, recovery rates). Development of methods to not only map, but distinguish these types of disturbance with satellite data will depend upon an improved understanding of their distinctive spectral properties. In this study, we mapped wildfires and clearcut harvests occurring in a Landsat time series (LTS) acquired in the boreal plains of Saskatchewan, Canada. This highly accurate reference map (kappa = 0.91) depicting the year and cause of historical disturbances was used to determine the spectral and temporal properties needed to accurately classify fire and clearcut disturbances. The results showed that spectral data from the short-wave infrared (SWIR; e.g., Landsat band 5) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum was most effective at separating fires and clearcut harvests possibly due to differences in structure, shadowing, and amounts of exposed soil left behind by the two disturbance types. Although SWIR data acquired 1 year after disturbance enabled the most accurate discrimination of fires and clearcut harvests, good separation (e.g., kappa >= 0.80) could still be achieved with Landsat band 5 and other SWIR-based indices 3 to 4 years after disturbance. Conversely, minimal disturbance responses in near infrared-based indices associated with green leaf area (e.g.. NDVI) led to unreliably low classification accuracies regardless of time since disturbance. In addition to exploring the spectral and temporal manifestation of forest disturbance types, we also demonstrate how Landsat change maps which attribute cause of disturbance can be used to help elucidate the social, ecological and carbon consequences associated with wildfire and clearcut harvesting in Canadian boreal forests.

Both of these drivers frequently result in gradual vegetation change and landscape-scale trend analysis based on yearly vegetation estimates can capture such changes. Such trend analyses based on high-resolution time series of satellite imagery have so far not widely been used and existing studies in drylands relied on different vegetation measures. Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) has been chosen due to its superiority to simpler vegetation estimates in quantifying vegetation cover in single-date studies, however SMA can be challenging to implement for large areas. Here, we quantify the trade-off involved when using simple vegetation estimates instead of SMA fractions for subsequent trend analyses. We calculated NDVI, SAVI and Tasseled Cap Greenness, as well as SMA green vegetation fractions for a time series of Landsat images from 1984-2005 for a study region in Crete. Linear trend analysis showed that trend coefficients and the spatial patterns of trends were similar across all vegetation estimates and the entire study region, especially for areas where vegetation changed gradually. On average, trends based on simple measures differed less than 5% from SMA-based trends with decreasing similarity in trend results from Tasseled Cap Greenness to SAVI and NDVI. Vegetation estimates differed markedly in their response to disturbance events such as fires. Trend analyses based on qualitative measures can easily be applied across very large areas and using multi-sensor time series based on high-resolution data. While the subtle differences between vegetation estimates may still be important for some applications, the robustness of trend analyses regarding the choice of vegetation estimate bears considerable promise to reconstruct fine-scale vegetation dynamics and land use histories and to assess climate change impacts on the world\'s drylands.

Coarse resolution MODIS white-sky albedo data are compared with actual blue-sky field albedometer measurements from the Greenland GC-Net. By utilizing large area averages of the MODIS data product that combine both high quality and poor quality data indiscriminately, the authors erroneously conclude that the accuracy deteriorates for solar zenith angle (SZA)>55 degrees and often becomes physically unrealistic for SZA>65 degrees. Once the quality flags are considered, however, the comparisons demonstrate that the MODIS product performs quite well out to the recommended limit for product use of 70 degrees SZA. This verifies the conclusions of an earlier more rigorous evaluation performed by Stroeve et al. [Stroeve, J., Box, J. E., Gao, F., Liang, S., Nolin, A., & Schaaf, C. B. (2005).

Surface heterogeneity induces uncertainty in estimating subpixel temperature. To take an advantage of simultaneous, multi-resolution observations at coincident nadirs by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), LST products from the two sensors were examined for a portion of suburb area in Beijing, China. We selected Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Normalized Multi-band Drought Index (NMDI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) as representative remote sensing indices for four land cover types (vegetation, bare soil, impervious and water area), respectively. By using support vector machines, the overall classification accuracy of the four land cover types with inputs of the four remote sensing indices, extracted from ASTER visible near infrared (VNIR) bands and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands, reached 97.66%, and Kappa coefficient was 0.9632. In order to lower the subpixel temperature estimation error caused by re-sampling of remote sensing data, a disaggregation method for subpixel temperature using the remote sensing endmember index based technique (DisEMI) was established in this study. Firstly, the area ratios and statistical information of endmember remote sensing indices were calculated from ASTER VNIR/SWIR data at 990 m and 90 m resolutions, respectively. Secondly, the relationship between the 990 m resolution MODIS LST and the corresponding input parameters (area ratios and endmember indices at the 990 m resolution) was trained by a genetic algorithm and self-organizing feature map artificial neural network (GA-SOFM-ANN). Finally, the trained models were employed to estimate the 90 m resolution subpixel temperature with inputs of area ratios and endmember indices at the 90 m resolution. ASTER LST product was used for verifying the estimated subpixel temperature, and the verified results indicate that the estimated temperature distribution was basically consistent with that of ASTER LST product. A better agreement was found between temperatures derived by our proposed method (DisEMI) and the ASTER 90 m data (R-2=0.709 and RMSE = 2.702 K). (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The observational period covered one strong negative Indian Ocean Dipole Zonal Mode (IODZM) event in 2005 and a strong positive IODZM event in 2006. The Argo profiles in each box captured the impact of these IODZM events with a larger impact in the EIO box showing salting (positive SSSA, +0.9) during negative IODZM (November 2005) and freshening (negative SSSA, -0.6) during positive IODZM (November 2006). A band of positive (negative) SSSA occurs in the central EIO during negative (positive) IODZM event in 2005 (2006) under the influence of IODZM dynamics. The impact of IODZM event in the SEAS is more evident during boreal winter months. The observed anomalous eastward (westward) surface current contributed to the observed intense salting (freshening) during negative (positive) IODZM event in the E10. Following the IODZM events, the East India Coastal Current (EICC) gets modulated through the propagation of downwelling/upwelling Kelvin Waves and further lead to the freshening/salting in the SEAS during boreal winter. These are well corroborated with the HYCOM simulations of SSS and currents. This study emphasizes that the HYCOM simulated salinity fields would be useful to provide rapid checks revealing either problems or successes in the satellite retrievals of salinity from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Aquarius missions.

LAI is very important in determining the carbon and water balance of a stand, but is difficult to measure during a complete stand rotation and at large scales. Remote-sensing methods allowing the retrieval of LAI time series with accuracy and precision are therefore necessary. Here, we tested two methods for LAI estimation from MODIS 250m resolution red and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance time series. The first method involved the inversion of a coupled model of leaf reflectance and transmittance (PROSPECT4), soil reflectance (SOILSPECT) and canopy radiative transfer (4SAIL2). Model parameters other than the LAI were either fixed to measured constant values, or allowed to vary seasonally and/or with stand age according to trends observed in field measurements. The LAI was assumed to vary throughout the rotation following a series of alternately increasing and decreasing sigmoid curves. The parameters of each sigmoid curve that allowed the best fit of simulated canopy reflectance to MODIS red and NIR reflectance data were obtained by minimization techniques. The second method was based on a linear relationship between the LAI and values of the GEneralized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (GESAVI), which was calibrated using destructive LAI measurements made at two seasons, on Eucalyptus stands of different ages and productivity levels. The ability of each approach to reproduce field-measured LAI values was assessed, and uncertainty on results and parameter sensitivities were examined. Both methods offered a good fit between measured and estimated LAI (R(2) = 0.80 and R(2) = 0.62 for model inversion and GESAVI-based methods, respectively), but the GESAVI-based method overestimated the LAI at young ages.

Using the data from SeaWiFS, MODIS-AQUA and MERIS for the 2002-2009 time period, the average daily coverage of a merged product is similar to 25% of the world ocean which is nearly twice that of any single mission\'s observations. The frequency at which a particular area is sampled from space is also greatly improved in merged data as some areas can be sampled as frequently as 64% of the time (in days). The merged data presented here are validated through matchup analyses and by comparing them to the data sets obtained from individual missions. Further, a complete error budget for the final merged data products was developed which accounts for uncertainty associated with input water-leaving radiances and provides uncertainty levels for the output products (i.e. the chlorophyll concentration, the combined dissolved and detrital absorption coefficient and the particulate backscattering coefficient). These merged products and their uncertainties at each pixel were developed within the NASA REASON/MEaSUREs and ESA GlobColour projects and are available to the scientific community. Our approach has many benefits for the creation of unified Climate Data Records from satellite ocean color observations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Differences in the shape and spatial density of these objects result in distinct bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) in different biomes. We examined how allometry may constrain the variability of canopy architectural parameters in BRDF models, and consequently alter the attribution of variation in the simulated bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF). Allometry is the covariation between the size or number of organisms and their component parts.   To test the importance of realistic variation and covariation of canopy architecture on BRDF, we incorporated the 3-D radiative transfer model DISORD (which uses the geometric optics (GO) model of Li and Strahler) into a Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm. The MC algorithm generated an ensemble of tree canopies whose parameters fulfilled the allometry of a set of measured forest plots from Russian forest inventory. The role of view geometry was directly considered using perturbations of the parameters to evaluate the sensitivity of the BRF itself, evaluated at different view angles, and the difference in BRF (Delta BRF) as measured at two view angles representing paired satellite observations.   The allometrically constrained forest plots had reduced variation in Delta BRF compared to the uncorrelated plots, but the variation of the BRF itself is dramatically increased by allometry. The variation of the BRF is relatively constant among the view angles examined, whereas the variation in Delta BRF increases dramatically with larger phase angles. The BRF was most sensitive to canopy attributes that were important in radiative transfer, such as LAI and stem area index (SAI), but there were also large (similar to 40% of variance) contributions of geometric components such as tree number, crown size, and ground cover. By contrast, sensitivity of Delta BRF was dominated by ground cover, crown size and tree number, which all play a role in the GO calculations. The mix of sensitive parameters was not dramatically different between gymnosperms and angiosperms, nor between allometric and correlated runs. Together these results indicate that forest structure and leaf area could be usefully inverted together using paired observations with different viewing geometries. Ideal pairs of observations are those with large difference in phase angle, and along the gradient of the BRF peak, which most commonly occur with sequential MODIS/Terra overpasses.

The epicenter of a catastrophic earthquake measured at 8.0 Ms (China Seismological Bureau), occurred within this area at Wenchuan (31 degrees 01\'16\"N, 103 degrees 22\'01\"E) at 14:28 May 12, 2008 (Beijing time). The earthquake triggered numerous types of landslide transport and hazards, including soil and debris avalanches, rockfalls, slumps, debris flows, creation of barrier lakes and slope fattenings. This paper examines the landslide hazards in the Longmenshan area caused by the earthquake using remotely sensed images, mainly Beijing-1 Microsatellite data before and after the earthquake, compared to digital elevation maps and slope gradient maps, land use and vegetation cover maps. Areas of erosion and loss of vegetation were compared from pre- and post-earthquake data, from which were calculated changes in vegetated areas, bare slopes, and mass movement during the earthquake. These events occurred over altitudes from 1000 to 4000 m and on slope angles between 25 and 55 degrees. The results show that the total area of erosion and land movement due to the earthquake increased by 86.3 km(2) (19.2% of the study area). Compared with pre-earthquake, the areas of very low intensity soil erosion and moderate intensity soil erosion were respectively reduced by 3.6 km(2), 24.3 km(2) and 30.9 km(2). On the other hand, the areas of severe and very severe intensity soil erosion were substantially increased by 45.8 km(2) and 99.2 km(2). In the post-earthquake stage, the bare areas (vegetation cover <15%) have increased by 65.8 km(2). Without vegetation, the denuded earthquake damaged slopes and other high risk sites have become severe erosion problems. Thus, it is essential to continue long-term monitoring of mass wasting in the denuded areas and evaluate potential risk sites for future landslides and debris flows. We anticipate that these results will be helpful in decision making and policy planning for recovery and reconstruction in the earthquake-affected area. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Consequently, rock units are often mapped at coarse-scales, resulting in lithological maps that have generalised contacts which in many cases are inaccurately located. Remote sensing data, such as aerial photographs and satellite imagery are commonly incorporated into geological mapping programmes to obtain geological information that is best revealed by overhead perspectives. However, spatial and spectral limitations of the imagery and dense vegetation cover can limit the utility of traditional remote sensing products. The advent of Airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) as a remote sensing tool offers the potential to provide a novel solution to these problems because accurate and high-resolution topographic data can be acquired in either forested or non-forested terrain, allowing discrimination of individual rock types that typically have distinct topographic characteristics. This study assesses the efficacy of airborne LiDAR as a tool for detailed lithological mapping in the upper section of the Troodos ophiolite, Cyprus. Morphometric variables (including slope, curvature and surface roughness) were derived from a 4 m digital terrain model in order to quantify the topographic characteristics of four principal lithologies found in the area. An artificial neural network (the Kohonen Self-Organizing Map) was then employed to classify the lithological units based upon these variables. The algorithm presented here was used to generate a detailed lithological map which defines lithological contacts much more accurately than the best existing geological map. In addition, a separate map of classification uncertainty highlights potential follow-up targets for ground-based verification. The results of this study demonstrate the significant potential of airborne LiDAR for lithological discrimination and rapid generation of detailed lithological maps, as a contribution to conventional geological mapping programmes.

Despite the key role they play in ecosystem functioning, lianas remain one of the least studied life forms in tropical environments. This paper contrasts leaf traits and spectral properties (400-1100 nm) of liana and tree communities from a tropical dry forest and a tropical rainforest in Panama, Central America. Differences between lianas and tree leaf traits were analyzed using spectroscopy, leaf histology and pigment extractions. Results from this study indicate that many of the biochemical, structural, and optical properties of lianas and trees are different in the dry forest site but not in rainforest sites. In the dry forest site, liana leaves exhibited significantly lower chlorophyll and carotenoid contents and were thinner than the leaves of their host trees. Specific leaf area, dry to fresh mass ratio, and mean water content of liana leaves were significantly higher when compared with tree leaves. The differences observed in the tropical dry forest site indicate that lianas may have a higher rate of resource acquisition and usage, whereas trees tend to conserve acquired resources. We suggest that our results may be indicative of the presence of a liana syndrome related to water availability and thus best exhibited in tropical dry forests. Our findings have important implications for using remote sensing to accurately map the distribution of liana communities at regional scales and for the continued expansion of lianas in tropical environments as a result of global change.

Three explosive eruptions (24 December 2006, 11 May 2007, and 14 October 2007) generated PFs that were dominated by juvenile material and were emplaced primarily due to column collapse. Following this, a gravitational lava flow front collapse event generated block and ash flow on 5 November 2007. Moderate spatial resolution data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument were collected between October 2006 and December 2007 to assist in post-eruption monitoring and interpretation of the volcanological processes that produced the PF deposits. Using multitemporal ASTER thermal infrared (TIR) data, three periods of increased activity were observed that coincided with each eruption and subsequent activity. During a field campaign in August 2007, the May 2007 PF deposit was investigated in detail. Eight ASTER TIR pixels (90 m spatial resolution) were selected from the 30 June 2007 ASTER TIR image, seven of which were accessible in the field. Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) image and thermocouple data over these areas were collected to observe thermal heterogeneities with distance along the PF deposit. Although synchronous ASTER data were not possible at the time of fieldwork due to cloud cover, a held survey of blocks versus ash in each pixel was carried out to investigate thermal and textural variation with distance from the vent and to provide preliminary field results. Based on the field-derived temperature data and surface block percentages, the May 2007 PF deposit was more block-rich in the medial portion of the flow surface, but more ash-dominated at the PF terminus region, which promoted more rapid cooling. We present multitemporal ASTER data spanning a 14 month period and highlight ground-based observations acquired within the same period of eruptive and dome-growth activity. These data collectively provide thermal radiative and emissivity information on an actively changing explosive volcanic system and specifically documents changes over recently-emplaced and cooling PF deposits.

An advantage of k-NN is that the same parameters (e.g., k-value, distance metric, weight vector for the feature space variables) can be used for all variables, whether continuous or categorical. An obvious question is the degree to which accuracy can be improved if the k-NN estimation parameters are tailored for specific variable groups such as volumes by tree species or categorical variables. We investigated prediction of categorical forest attribute variables from satellite image spectral data using k-NN with optimisation of the weight vector for the ancillary variables obtained using a genetic algorithm. We tested several genetic algorithm fitness functions, all derived from well-known accuracy measures. For a Finnish test site, the categorical forest attribute variables were site fertility and tree species dominance, and for an Italian test site, the variables were forest type and conifer/broad-leaved dominance. The results for both test sites were validated using independent data sets. Our results indicate that use of the genetic algorithm to optimize the weight vector for prediction of a single forest attribute variable had a slight positive effect on the prediction accuracies for other variables. Errors can be further decreased if the optimisation is done by variable groups. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

It is now widely understood that large errors may occur in the estimation of surface albedo without taking into consideration the anisotropy reflectance effect, which is a general feature of the earth surface. Two major anisotropic correction methods exist for the retrieval of land surface albedo under clear sky conditions. One method involves linearly converting from top of the atmosphere (TOA) albedo to surface albedo, and another is based on the inversion of the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model of the surface. In the present study, a new approach that utilizes an empirical model for estimating surface albedo has been proposed for snow free land surfaces under clear sky conditions. We analyzed the bidirectional reflectance data set with numerous samples representing various land cover types, which derived from POLDER/ADEOS-1 multi-angle imagery data and distributed by MEDIAS-France. Through the analysis, an empirical relation between bidirectional reflectance and albedo was established and has been discussed in detail. The proposed model can be used for direct estimation of surface albedo from a single BRF observation when the sun-target-sensor geometry is known. No BRDF model inversion scheme is necessary. The present model has no or weak dependence on the existing land surface classifications, and is insensitive to wavelength. The theoretical absolute accuracy of the estimated albedo is approximately 0.010 for visible (0.4-0.7 mu m), 0.023 for near infrared (0.7-3.0 mu m) and 0.016 for shortwave (0.2-3.0 mu m), respectively. Albedo consistency with viewing geometry has been verified, resulting in good agreement for albedo estimated from various viewing directions. Validation of the satellite estimated albedo derived by the proposed method, using field observations were also presented and results show it can give reasonably accurate estimation. The proposed method is expected to be a suitable candidate for practical applications of albedo estimation for sensors that do not perform multi-angle observations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Direct and indirect human-derived impacts have led to significant seagrass declines worldwide and the alteration of services linked to their biodiversity. Effective conservation and the provision of sustainable recovery goals for ecologically significant species are limited by the absence of reliable information on seagrass extent. This is especially true for the Wider Caribbean region (WCR) where many conservation initiatives are under way, but are impaired by the lack Of accurate baseline habitat maps. To assist with such a fundamental conservation need using high-resolution remote sensing data, both environmental and methodological challenges need to be tackled. First, the diversity of environments, the heterogeneity of habitats, and the vast extent of the targeted region mean that local expertise and field data of adequate quality and resolution are seldom available. Second, large-scale high-resolution mapping requires several hundred Landsat 5 and 7 images, which poses substantial processing problems.   The main goal of this study was to test the feasibility of achieving Landsat-based large-scale seagrass mapping with limited ground-truth data and acceptable accuracies. We used the following combination of methods to map seagrass throughout the WCR: geomorphological segmentation, contextual editing, and supervised classifications. A total of 40 Landsat scenes (path-row) were processed. Three major classes were derived (\'dense seagrass\', \'medium-sparse seagrass\', and a generic \'other\' class). Products\' accuracies were assessed against (i) selected in situ data; (ii) patterns detectable with very high-resolution IKONOS images; and (iii) published habitat maps with documented accuracies. Despite variable overall classification accuracies (46-88%), following their critical evaluation, the resulting thematic maps were deemed acceptable to (i) regionally Provide an adequate baseline for further large-scale conservation programs and research actions; and (ii) regionally re-assess carrying capacity estimates for green turtles. They certainly represent a drastic improvement relative to current regional databases. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, accurately monitoring the snow depth and the associated aerial coverage are critical issues for monitoring the global climate system. Passive microwave satellite measurements provide an optimal means to monitor the snowpack over the arctic region. While the temporal evolution of snow extent can be observed globally from microwave radiometers, the determination of the corresponding snow depth is more difficult. A dynamic algorithm that accounts for the dependence of the microwave scattering on the snow grain size has been developed to estimate snow depth from Special Sensor Microwave/ Imager (SSM/I) brightness temperatures and was validated over the U.S. Great Plains and Western Siberia.   The purpose of this study is to assess the dynamic algorithm performance over the entire high latitude (land) region by computing a snow depth multi-year field for the time period 1987-1995. This multi-year average is compared to the Global Soil Wetness Project-Phase2 (GSWP2) snow depth computed from several state-of-the-art land surface schemes and averaged over the same time period. The multi-year average obtained by the dynamic algorithm is in good agreement with the GSWP2 snow depth field (the correlation coefficient for January is 0.55). The static algorithm, which assumes a constant snow grain size in space and time does not correlate with the GSWP2 snow depth field (the correlation coefficient with GSWP2 data for January is -0.03), but exhibits a very high anti-correlation with the NCEP average January air temperature field (correlation coefficient -0.77), the deepest satellite snow pack being located in the coldest regions, where the snow grain size may be significantly larger than the average value used in the static algorithm. The dynamic algorithm performs better over Eurasia (with a correlation coefficient with GSWP2 snow depth equal to 0.65) than over North America (where the correlation coefficient decreases to 0.29).

Thus, there is a pressing need for increased automation in the change mapping process. The objective of this research is to compare the performance of three machine learning algorithms (MLAs); two classification tree software routines (S-plus and C4.5) and an artificial neural network (ARTMAP), in the context of mapping land-cover modifications in northern and southern California study sites between 1990/91 and 1996. Comparisons were based on several criteria: overall accuracy, sensitivity to data set size and variation, and noise. ARTMAP produced the most accurate maps overall (similar to 84%), for two study areas - in southern and northern California, and was most resistant to training data deficiencies. The change map generated using ARTMAP has similar accuracies to a human-interpreted map produced by the U.S. Forest Service in the southern study area. ARTMAP appears to be robust and accurate for automated, large area change monitoring as it performed equally well across the diverse study areas with minimal human intervention in the classification process.

It constitutes an efficient bio-indicator of impacts of climate changes and a key parameter for understanding and modelling vegetation-climate interactions and their implications on carbon cycling. Numerous studies were devoted to the remote sensing of vegetation phenology. Most of these were carried out using data acquired by AVHRR instrument onboard NOAA meteorological satellites. Since 1999, multispectral images were acquired over the whole earth surface every one to two days by MODIS instrument onboard Terra and Aqua platforms. In comparison with AVHRR, MODIS constitutes a significant technical improvement in terms of spatial resolution, spectral resolution, geolocation accuracy, atmospheric corrections scheme and cloud screening and sensor calibration. In this study, 250 in daily MODIS data were used to derive precise vegetation phenological dates over deciduous forest stands. Phenological markers derived from MODIS time-series and provided by MODIS Global Land Cover Dynamics product (MOD12Q2) were compared to field measurements carried out over the main deciduous forest stands across France and over five years. We show that the inflexion point of the asymmetric double-sigmoid function fitted to NDVI temporal profile is a good marker of the onset of green-up in deciduous stands. At plot level, the prediction uncertainty is 8.5 days and the bias is 3.5 days. MODIS Global Land Cover Dynamics MODI2Q2 provides estimates of onset of green-up dates which deviate substantially from in situ observations and do not perforin better than the null model. RMSE values are 20.5 days (bias -17 days) using the onset of greenness increase and 36.5 days (bias 34.5 days) using the onset of greenness maximum. An improvement of prediction quality is obtained if we consider the average of MOD12Q2 onset of greenness increase and maximum as marker of onset of green-up date. RMSE decreases to 16.5 days and bias to 7.5 days. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, the biodiversity and ecosystem areas need information on landscape composition, structure of forests, species richness, as well as their changes. Field sample plots from National Forest Inventories (NFI) are, in combination with satellite data, a tremendous resource for fulfilling these information needs. NFIs have a history of almost 100 years and have developed in parallel in several countries. For example, the NFIs in Finland and Sweden measure annually more than 10,000 field plots with approximately 200 variables per plot. The inventories are designed for five-year rotations. In Finland nationwide forest cover maps have been produced operationally since 1990 by using the k-NN algorithm to combine satellite data, field sample plot information, and other georeferenced digital data. A similar k-NN database has also been created for Sweden. The potentials of NFIs to fulfil diverse information needs are currently analyzed also in the COST Action E43 project of the European Union. In this article, we provide a review of how NFI field plot information has been used for parameterization of image data in Sweden and Finland, including pre-processing steps like haze correction, slope correction, and the optimization of the estimation variables. Furthermore, we review how the produced small-area statistics and forest cover data have been used in forestry, including forest biodiversity monitoring and habitat modelling. We also show how remote sensing data can be used for post-stratification to derive the sample plot based estimates, which cannot be directly estimated from the spectral data. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The unscented Kalman filter (UKF), the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), the sampling importance resampling particle filter (SIR-PF) and the unscented particle filter (UPF) are described in the state-space model framework in the Bayesian filtering background. We first evaluated those methods with a simple highly nonlinear Lorenz model and a scalar nonlinear non-Gaussian model to investigate the filter stability and the error sensitivity, and then their abilities in the one-dimensional estimation of the soil moisture content with the synthetic microwave brightness temperature assimilation experiment in the land surface model VIC-3L. All the results are compared with the EnKF. The advantages and disadvantages of each filter are discussed.   The results in the Lorenz model showed that the particle filters are suitable for the large measurement interval assimilation and that the Kalman filters were suitable for the frequent measurement assimilation as well as small measurement uncertainties. The EnKF also showed its feasibility for the non-Gaussian noise. The performance of the SIR-PF was actually not as good as that of the UKF or the EnKF regarding a very small observation noise level compared with the uncertainties in the system. In the one-dimensional brightness temperature assimilation experiment, the UKF, the EnKF and the SIR-PF all proved to be flexible and reliable nonlinear filter algorithms for the low dimensional sequential land data assimilation application. For the high dimensional land surface system that takes the horizontal error correlations into account, the UKF is restricted by its computational demand in the covariance propagation; we must use the EnKF, the SIR-PF and other covariance reduction algorithms. The large computational cost prevents the UPF from being applied in practice. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

However, the varied optical properties of phytoplankton taxa may present a means to their discrimination via remote sensing data. This paper presents the results of an experimental study in which the spectral dissimilarities of brown, green, blue-green and red algae were examined with a view to establishing a basis upon which broad changes in phytoplankton communities might be monitored through remote sensing. Pseudo phytoplankton communities were simulated in a series of mesocosm experiments from which spectral reflectance measurements were acquired. The results demonstrated that the phytoplankton colour groups examined were indeed spectrally dissimilar. The spectral distinction between colour groups was noted to be greatest at high concentrations of chlorophyll a and between pseudo-communities dominated by a single species; spectral differences were lower in mixed pseudo-communities with co-dominant species. Moreover, it proved possible to quantify the concentration of two potential biomarker pigments, fucoxanthin and C-phycocyanin, through the derivation of simple spectral indices. The coincidental presence of varying concentrations of SPM (SPIM and SPOM) caused significant attenuation of the spectral response of the pseudo-communities and affected the accuracy of biomarker pigment estimation. It is considered that the realisation of a remote sensing technique for the discrimination of phytoplankton taxa in inland waters would be an extremely useful tool for limnological research and water resource management and thus the future application of this research to inland waters is also discussed.

The STEP model is coupled with a radiative transfer model of the radar backscattering and NDVI signatures of the soil and herbaceous vegetation. These models are driven by field data (rainfall time series, soil properties, etc.). While some model parameters have fixed values, some other parameters have target values to be optimized. The study focuses on a well documented 1 km(2) homogeneous area in a semi-arid region (Gourma, Mali).   We here investigate whether departures between model predictions and the corresponding data result from field data errors, in situ data lack of representativeness or some model shortcomings. For this purpose we introduce an evolutionary strategy (ES) approach relying on a bi-objective function to be minimized in the data assimilation/inversion process. Several numerical experiments are conducted, in various mono-objective and bi-objective modes, and the performances of the model predictions compared in terms of NDVI, backscattering coefficient, leaf area index (LAI) and biomass.   It is shown that the bi-objective ES leads to improved model predictions and also to a better readability of the results by exploring the Pareto front of optimal and admissible solutions. It is also shown that the information brought from the optical sensor and the radar is coherent; that the corresponding radiative transfer models are also coherent; that the representativeness of in situ data can be compared to satellite data through the modeling process. However some systematic biases on the biomass predictions (errors in the range 140 to 300 kg ha(-1)) are observed. Thanks to the bi-objective ES, we are able to identify some likely shortcoming in the vegetation dynamics model relating the LAI to the biomass variables. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

A radiative thermal anomaly was remotely sensed throughout a 19,682-km(2) landscape covering Yellowstone National Park in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. The anomaly is the residual terrestrial emittance measured using the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper after accounting for elevation and solar effects, and was hypothesized to be an estimator of a lower bound for geothermal heat flux (GHF). Continuous variations in the anomaly were measured ranging from 0 W m(-2) up to a maximum heat flux of at least 94 W m(-2) (at the 28.5 m pixel scale). An independent method was developed for measuring GHF at smaller scales, based on inversion of a snowpack simulation model, combined with field mapping of snow-free perimeters around selected geothermal features. These perimeters were assumed to be approximately isothermal, with a mean GHF estimated as the minimum heat flux required to ablate the simulated snowpack at that location on the day of field survey. The remotely sensed thermal anomaly correlated well (r=0.82) with the snowpack-inversion measurements, and supported the hypothesis that the anomaly estimates a lower bound for GHF. These methods enable natural resource managers to identify, quantify and predict changes in heat flux over time in geothermally active areas. They also provide a quantitative basis for understanding the degree to which Yellowstone\'s famous wildlife herds are actually dependent on geothermal activity. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The method is based on a k-nearest neighbour rule and uses field plots from the NFI, land cover maps, and satellite image data from Landsat Thematic Mapper. The inventory method is used to produce maps of selected forest variables and to estimate the selected forest variables for large areas such as municipalities. In this study, focus has been on the qualitative variables \'dominating species group\' and \'development class\' because these variables are of central interest to forest managers. A mid-summer Landsat 5 TM scene was used as image data, and all NFI plots inside the scene were used as a reference dataset. The relationship between the spectral bands and the forest variables was analysed, and it was found that the levels of association were low. A leave-one-out method based on the reference dataset was used to estimate the pixel-level accuracies. They were found to be relatively low with 63% agreement for species groups. An independent control survey was available for a municipality and estimates from the MSFI were compared to it. The levels of error were quite high. It was concluded that the large area estimates were biased by the reference dataset. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

LAI of forest ecosystems has routinely been mapped using spectral vegetation indices (SVI) derived from remote sensing imagery. The application of SVI-based approaches to map LAI in peatlands presents a challenge, mainly due to peatlands characteristic multi-layer canopy comprising shrubs and open, discontinuous tree canopies underlain by a continuous ground cover of different moss species, which reduces the greenness contrast between the canopy and the background. Our goal is to develop a methodology to map tree and shrub LAI in peatlands and similar ecosystems based on multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA). This new mapping method is validated using LAI field measurements from a precipitation-fed (ombrotrophic) peatland near Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. We demonstrate first that three commonly applied SVI are not suitable for tree and shrub LAI mapping in ombrotrophic peatlands. Secondly, we demonstrate for a three-endmember model the limitations of traditional linear spectral mixture analysis (SMA) due to the unique and widely varying spectral characteristics of Sphagnum mosses, which are significantly different from vascular plants. Next, by using a geometric-optical radiative transfer model, we determine the nature of the equation describing the empirical relationship between shadow fraction and tree LAI using nonlinear ordinary least square (OLS) regression. We then apply this equation to describe the empirical relationships between shadow and shrub fractions obtained from mixture decomposition with SMA and MESMA, respectively, and tree and shrub LAI, respectively. Less accurate fractions obtained from SMA result in weaker relationships between shadow fraction and tree LAI (R-2 =0.61) and shrub fraction and shrub LAI (R-2 =0.49) compared to the same relationships based on fractions obtained from MESMA with R-2 = 0.75 and R-2 =0.68, respectively. Cross-validation of tree LAI (R-2 =0.74; RMSE=0.48) and shrub LAI (R2=0.68; RMSE=0.42) maps using fractions from MESMA shows the suitability of this approach for mapping tree and shrub LAI in ombrotrophic peatlands. The ability to account for a spectrally varying, unique Sphagnum moss ground cover during mixture decomposition and a two layer canopy is particularly important. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

To support detailed Great Lakes coastal wetland mapping, the optimal spatial resolution of imagery was determined to be less than 2 in. There was a 23% change in classification resiliency using the SAM classifier upon resampling the original 1-meter, 18-band imagery to 2-meter pixels, and further classifications with larger pixels (4 and 8 in) increased overall classification change to 35% and 50%, respectively. We performed a series of image classification experiments incorporating three independent band selection methodologies (derivative magnitude, fixed interval and derivative histogram), in order to explore the effects of spectral resampling on classification resiliency. This research verified that a minimum of seven, strategically located bands in the VIS-NIR wavelength region (425.4 nm, 514.9 nm, 560.1 nm, 685.5 nm, 731.5 nm, 812.3 nm and 916.7 nm) are necessary to maintain a classification resiliency above the 85% threshold. Significantly, these seven bands produced the highest classification resiliency using the fewest number of bands of any of the 63 band-reduction strategies that were tested. Analyzing only derivative magnitudes proved to be an unreliable tool to identify optimal bands. The fixed interval method was adversely influenced by the starting band location, making its implementation problematic. The combined use of derivative magnitude and frequency of occurrence appears to be the best method to determine the \"optimal\" bands for a wetland mapping hyperspectral application.

Various measures have been developed to describe and compare the accuracy of maps and the performance of different classifiers, but the extent to which these measures are consistent with each other is largely unknown. In this paper the consistency of fourteen category-level and twenty map-level accuracy measures was tested on 595 published error matrices using nonparametric correlation coefficients (Spearman\'s rho and Kendall\'s tau-b) as well as the probability of concordance. The results show that four groups can be identified for the category-level measures and three groups for map-level measures. The consistency among the measures within a group is generally higher than that among the measures from different groups though all the measures at the same level are highly consistent with each other. We recommend that user\'s accuracy and producer\'s accuracy and the overall accuracy should be provided as primary accuracy measures and the two relative entropy change measures and the mutual information normalized by the arithmetic mean of the entropies on map and ground truthing be provided as supplementary measures.

This is due to the measurement, model errors and the inadequacy between the model and reality, which produces similar reflectances for the different combination of the input parameters into the radiative transfer model. This leads to unstable and often inaccurate inversion results. The ill-posed nature of the inverse problem requires some regularization. Regularization means that one tries to consider only those solutions that are in the proximity of the true value. In order to regularize the model inversion, we propose kernel-based regularization by support vector machines regression (SVR) method.   The formulation of the SVR contains meta-parameters C (regularization) and e-insensitive loss. The SVR generalization performance (estimation accuracy) depends on these two parameters and the kernel parameters. Often the meta-parameters are selected using prior knowledge and/or user expertise. In this paper we adopt methods for the estimation of the meta-parameters from the input data itself instead of relying on any prior information. This paper is focused on the retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) from multiangle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR) data. The proposed methodology was implemented by inverting a ID canopy reflectance model (PROSAIL) using SVR over MISR data. The results were validated against the LAI retrievals at the Alpilles EOS validation core site. An RMSE of 0.64 was obtained using both near-infrared (NIR) in conjunction with the red band and an RMSE of 0.50 using only the NIR band. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

With this relationship, we develop an algorithm that can constrain the standard, wind-driven glint/white cap model that defines the ocean-surface boundary condition in MISR aerosol retrievals. The key geometric factor determining wind retrieval quality is the angular distance between the reflection vector and the closest MISR multi-angle observation - the minimum Sun Glint Angle (SGA).   MISR-retrieved winds are within 2.4 m/s of buoy-measured values for minimum SGA below about 15 degrees for the 38 cases studied, and usually better than 1.1 m/s, except one for which the wind speed was extremely low. For minimum SGA above about 15 degrees, MISR angular glint pattern reflectance sampling is not adequate to perform wind retrievals. An ambiguity in the retrieval that can occur for minimum SGA greater than 6 degrees or 7 degrees is resolved by the minimum observed absolute reflectance. We also confirm the high accuracy of the Cox-Munk ocean surface reflectance model, used to analyze the glint pattern dependence on wind speed. The wind-retrieval method could be used in an operational multi-angle aerosol retrieval algorithm to dynamically constrain the ocean surface boundary condition when glint pattern angular sampling is adequate.

The inherent complexity of clouds makes this information difficult to obtain from observations alone and cloud resolving models (CRMs) are often used to generate synthetic datasets that can be used as proxies for real data. We test the ability of a CRM to reproduce the observed structure of low-level clouds detected by the Earth Observing System (EOS) validation program in north central Oklahoma on March 3, 2000. A threedimensional radiative transfer model is applied to bigh-resolution cloud fields generated by the CRM in order to simulate the top of atmosphere radiances. These synthetic radiances are then statistically compared with observations from the airborne Multiangle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (AirMISR), flown on the NASA ER-2 high-altitude aircraft. Simulations match well the blue channel radiance distributions at oblique view angles but overestimate the minimum in reflectance at near-nadir viewing angles, The model reproduces correctly the angular change in the width of radiance distribution, as measured by the standard deviation but the change in skewness of these distributions is captured only qualitatively. The model biases are suggestive of the simulated cloud boundaries being too sharp and the distribution of the vertical liquid water path being too narrow. A power spectrum analysis shows a close agreement between simulations and observations including a break in the scaling properties of the radiance fields around 400 in. The scaling properties of the ID power spectrum of simulated radiance at smaller scales exhibit directional dependence not seen in corresponding observations. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

To minimize latency, we eliminated the algorithm\'s dependency on upstream MODIS products. For example, although the standard MODIS LST requires prior retrieval of air temperature and water vapor from the MODIS scene, the RR LST employs a climatological database of atmospheric values based on a 25-year record of NOAA TOVS observations. The standard and RR algorithms also differ in upstream processing, surface emissivity determination, and use of a cloud mask (RR product does not contain one). Comparison of the MODIS RR and standard LST products suggests that biases are generally less than 0.1 K, and root-mean-square differences are less than I K despite the presence of some larger outliers. Initial validation with field data suggests the absolute uncertainty of the RR product is below I K. The MODIS RR land surface temperature algorithm is a stand-alone computer code. It has no dependencies on external products or toolkits, and is suitable for Direct Broadcast and other processing systems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The sensors are Thermal Airborne Broadband Imager (TABI), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Two algorithms were developed for land surface temperature (LST) retrieval from TABI image and ASTER thermal infrared (TIR) channels 13 and 14. In addition, ASTER LST and MODIS LST products were also collected. All the LST images were assessed by analyzing the relationship between LST and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and by spatial distributions of LST profiles, derived from typical transects over the LST images. In this study, a strong negative relationship between LST and NDVI has been demonstrated although the degree of correlation between NDVI and LST varies slightly among the different LST images. Cross-validation among the LST images retrieved from the three thermal sensors of different spatial resolutions indicates that the LST images retrieved from the 2 channel ASTER data and a single band TABI thermal image using our developed algorithms are reliable. The LST images retrieved from the three sensors should have different potential to urban environmental studies. The MODIS thermal sensor can be used for the synoptic overview of an urban area and for studying urban thermal environment. The ASTER, with its TIR subsystem of 90-m resolution, allows for a more accurate determination of thermal patterns and properties of urban land use/land cover types, and hence, a more accurate determination of the LST. In consideration of the high heterogeneity of urban environment, the TABI thermal image, with a high spatial resolution of 2 m, can be used for rendering and assessing complex urban thermal patterns and detailed distribution of LST at the individual house level more accurately.

High spectral resolution allows detection of leaf reflected and emitted radiance fields in two narrow absorption bands at 687 and 760 nm, respectively, where solar irradiance is strongly reduced owing to molecular oxygen absorption of the terrestrial atmosphere. The flux emitted due to chlorophyll fluorescence was measured using the Fraunhofer line depth principle by spectrally modelling the signal, capitalizing on the high resolution of the spectroradiometer devices. An experiment was conducted on two potted bean plants. One was maintained in good health for use as a reference while the other was treated with a photosystem II inhibitor. Collected spectra show that the fluorescence emission produces a pair of characteristic peaks superimposed on the typical leaf-specific reflectance curve. The magnitude of the fluorescence signal of the herbicide-treated leaf was four times greater than that of the control plant, thus indicating damage to the photosynthetic apparatus of the plant.

Image masking involves restricting an analysis to a subset of a region\'s pixels rather than using all of the pixels in the scene. Cropland masking, where all sufficiently cropped pixels are included in the mask regardless of crop type, has been shown to generally improve crop yield forecasting ability, but it requires the availability of a land cover map depicting the location of cropland. The authors present an alternative image masking technique, called yield-correlation masking, which can be used for the development and implementation of regional crop yield forecasting models and eliminates the need for a land cover map. The procedure requires an adequate time series of imagery and a corresponding record of the region\'s crop yields, and involves correlating historical, pixel-level imagery values with historical regional yield values. Imagery used for this study consisted of 1-km, biweekly AVHRR NDVI composites from 1989 to 2000. Using a rigorous evaluation framework involving five performance measures and three typical forecasting opportunities, yield-correlation masking is shown to have comparable performance to cropland masking across eight major U.S. region-crop forecasting scenarios in a 12-year cross-validation study. Our results also suggest that I I years of time series AVHRR NDVI data may not be enough to estimate reliable linear crop yield models using more than one NDVI-based variable. A robust, but suboptimal, all-subsets regression modeling procedure is described and used for testing, and historical United States Department of Agriculture crop yield estimates and linear trend estimates are used to gauge model performance.

In this study, image-based algorithms for atmospheric correction were evaluated on QuickBird imagery for retrieving surface reflectance (rho(lambda)) of corn and potato canopies in Minnesota. The algorithms included the dark object subtraction technique (DOS), the cosine approximation model (COST), and the apparent reflectance model (AR). The comparison with ground-based measurements of canopy reflectance during a 3-year field campaign indicated that the AR model generally overestimated rho(lambda) in the visible bands, but underestimated rho(lambda) in the near infrared (NIR) band. The DOS-COST model was most effective for the visible bands and produced rho(lambda) with the root mean square errors (RMSE) of less than 0.01. However, retrieved rho(lambda) in the NIR band were more than 20% (mean relative difference or MRD) lower than ground measurements and the RMSE was as high as 0.16. The evaluation of the COST model showed that atmospheric transmittance (T-lambda(theta)) was substantially overestimated on humid days, particularly for the NIR band because of the undercorrection of water vapor absorption. Alternatively, a contour map was developed to interpolate appropriate T-lambda(theta) for the NIR band for clear days under average atmospheric aerosol conditions and as a function of precipitable water content and solar zenith angle or satellite view angle. With the interpolated T-lambda(theta), the accuracy of NIR band rho(lambda) was significantly improved where the RMSE and MRD were 0.06 and 0.03%, respectively, and the overall accuracy of rho(lambda) was acceptable for agricultural applications.

ASTER thermal infrared (TIR) images from February 2003, however, indicate warmer areas within the summit crater. Average whole-pixel temperatures of adjacent summit slopes are in the range of 250-252 K, while many summit-crater whole pixel temperatures are similar to 2-6 K greater. A two component Planck solution for the warmer pixels yields a solution of 275-277 K for 10-15% of the Chikurachki summit crater and 285-295 K for 25-35% of a prominent \"botspot\" on its flank. An interpretation of this enhanced pre-eruption beat flow is the presence of surface melt water. The detection in ASTER data of such subtle precursory heat-flow enhancement, even retrospectively, raises important issues for remote monitoring of \"dormant\" snow-capped volcanoes, especially those that threaten nearby populations, like Mt.

Four hyperspectral vegetation indices provided metrics of forest canopy structure, biochemistry and physiology to compare along gradients of annual rainfall (750 to >6000 mm year(-1)) and substrate age (0 to 250,000 years). The canopy greenness index NDVI increased with annual precipitation and substrate age, but saturated in forests with rainfall of 3000 min year(-1). Precipitation and substrate age were roughly equal contributors to the observed greenness of the forests. A canopy water content index (NDWI) also increased with precipitation and substrate age, but did not reach a maximum until very wet (> 5000 mm year(-1)) forest conditions were encountered on the oldest substrates. The water index appears superior to the NDVI in capturing spatial and climate-substrate driven variations in canopy structure. The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) indicated highest light-use efficiency levels in canopies on the most developed substrates and at annual precipitation levels of 3-4500 min year(-1). A leaf carotenoid index (CRI) suggested a maximum canopy photosynthetic capacity at similar to 4000 min rainfall year(-1) on the oldest substrates. These results quantify the sensitivity of rainforest canopies to changing precipitation and soil conditions, and they corroborate plot-scale analyses in native Hawaiian forests ecosystems. Structural and functional studies of remote rainforest regions are possible with spacebome imaging spectroscopy, and could be used to understand the dynamics of rainforests with climate change.

In this study, we used Landsat TM/ ETM data at a spatial resolution of 30 in to reconstruct spatial and temporal patterns of cropland across China for the time period of 1990-2000. Our estimate has indicated that total cropland area in China in 2000 was 141.1 million hectares (ha), including 35.6 million ha paddy land and 105.5 million ha dry farming land. The distribution of cropland is uneven across the regions of China. The North-East region of China shows more cropland area per capita than the South-East and North regions of China. During 1990-2000, cropland increased by 2.79 million ha, including 0.25 million ha of paddy land and 2.53 million ha of dry farming land. The North-East and North-West regions of China gained cropland area, while the North and South-East regions showed a loss of cropland area. Urbanization accounted for more than half of the transformation from cropland to other land uses, and the increase in cropland was primarily due to reclamation of grassland and deforestation. Most of the lost cropland had good quality with high productivity, but most gained cropland was poor quality land with less suitability for crop production. The globalization as well as changing environment in China is affecting land-use change. Coordinating the conflict between environmental conservation and land demands for food will continue to be a primary challenge for China in the future. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

A secondary objective was evaluating the potential use of MODIS 250 in resolution data for crop classification. A field study (24 fields) was conducted during the 2.000 crop season in McLean County, Illinois, in the U.S. Midwest to evaluate the applicability of the MODIS 8-day, 250 in resolution composite imagery (version 4) for operational assessment of crop condition and yields. Ground-based canopy and leaf reflectance and leaf area index (LAI) measurements were used to calibrate a radiative transfer model to create a look up table (LUT) that was used to simulate LAI. The seasonal trend of MODIS derived LAI was used to find crop model parameters by adjusting the LAI simulated from the climate-based crop yield model. Other intermediate products such as crop phenological events were adjusted from the LAI seasonal profile. Corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.)

Complex ecosystem models, implemented at small scales (<10 km(2)), are impractical at global scales and, therefore, require simplifying logic based on key ecological first principles and model drivers derived from remotely sensed data. There is a need for an improved understanding of the factors that influence the variability of NPP model estimates at different scales so we can improve the accuracy of NPP estimates at the global scale. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of using leaf area index (LAI) and three different aggregated land cover classification products-two factors derived from remotely sensed data and strongly affect NPP estimates-in a light use efficiency (LUE) model to estimate NPP in a heterogeneous temperate forest landscape in northern Wisconsin, USA. Three separate land cover classifications were derived from three different remote sensors with spatial resolutions of 15, 30, and 1000 m. Average modeled net primary production (NPP) ranged from 402 gC m(-2) year(-1) (15 m data) to 431 gC m(-2) year(-1) (1000 in data), for a maximum difference of 7%. Almost 50% of the difference was attributed each to LAI estimates and land cover classifications between the fine and coarse scale NPP estimate. Results from this study suggest that ecosystem models that use biome-level land cover classifications with associated LUE coefficients may be used to model NPP in heterogeneous land cover areas dominated by cover types with similar NPP. However, more research is needed to examine scaling errors in other heterogeneous areas and NPP errors associated with deriving LAI estimates. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

A multitemporal analysis was conducted, based on a mega file of 294 wavebands, made from 42 MODIS images each of 7 bands. Complementary field data were gathered from 196 locations. The study began with the development of two cloud removal algorithms (CRAs) for MODIS 7-band reflectivity data, named: (a) blue-band minimum reflectivity threshold and (b) visible-band minimum reflectivity threshold.   A series of innovative methods and approaches were introduced to analyze time-series MODIS data and consisted of. (a) brightness-greenness-wetness (BGW) RED-NIR 2-dimensional feature space (2-d FS) plots for each of the 42 dates, (b) end-member (spectral angle) analysis using RED-NIR single date (RN-SD) plots, (c) combining several RN-SDs in a single plot to develop RED-NIR multidate (RNMDs) plots in order to help track changes in magnitude and direction of spectral classes in 2-d FS, (d) introduction of a unique concept of space-time spiral curves (ST-SCs) to continuously track class dynamics over time and space and to determine class separability at various time periods within and across seasons, and (e) to establish unique class signatures based on NDVI (CS-NDVI) and/or multiband reflectivity (CS-MBR), for each class, and demonstrate their intra- and inter-seasonal and intra- and inter-year characteristics. The results from these techniques and methods enabled us to gather precise information on onset-peak-senescence-duration of each irrigated and rainfed classes.   The resulting 29 land use/land cover (LULC) map consisted of 6 unique irrigated area classes in the total study area of 133,021,156 ha within the Ganges and Indus basins. Of this, the net irrigated area was estimated as 33.08 million hectares-26.6% by canals and 73.4z5 by groundwater. Of the 33.08 Mha, 98.4% of the area was irrigated during khariff (Southwest monsoonal rainy season during June-October), 92.5% irrigated during Rabi (Northeast monsoonal rainy season during November-February), and only 3.5% continuously through the year. Quantitative Fuzzy Classification Accuracy Assessment (QFCAA) showed that the accuracies of the 29 classes varied from 56% to 100%-with 17 classes above 80% accurate and 23 classes above 70% accurate.   The MODIS band 5 centered at 1240 nm provided the best separability in mapping irrigated area classes, followed by bands 2 (centered at 859 nm), 7 (2130 nm) and 6 (1640 rim). (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The derivation of concise conclusions from these series largely depends on their quantitative consistency; hence, a completely standardized analysis of multi-temporal time series is mandatory. In the context of the required radiometric rectification, sensor calibration is an essential component, the accuracy of which largely determines the overall result. While for newer sensor systems extensive documentation on the development of the sensor\'s sensitivity exists, older systems often lack the corresponding information.   A methodology has been developed, tested and validated to radiometrically intercalibrate different sensor systems based on the precondition of simultaneous image acquisition, which is for example provided by the Landsat TM and MSS sensor systems hosted on Landsat 5. Different interpolation and processing steps within the procedure have been analyzed, and an intercalibration scheme is proposed to derive Landsat MSS calibration factors from Landsat TM, which is used as a calibrated reference. It supports a full radiometric rectification of Landsat MSS data and enables their incorporation into satellite image time series, which can thus be significantly extended by a maximum of 12 years.

The use of lichen as an endmember in spectral mixture analysis (SMA) may overcome these limitations. Because lichens rarely completely occupy the Instantaneous Field of View (IFOV), it is difficult to define a lichen endmember from an image using visual or automated endmember extraction tools. Spectral similarity of various crustose/foliose lichen species in the short wave infrared (SWIR) suggests that spectral unmixing of rock and lichens may be successfully accomplished using a single lichen endmember for this spectral range. We report the use of a spectral normalization method to minimize differences in SWIR reflectance between five lichen species (U. torrefacta, R. bolanderi, R. geminatum, R. geographicum, A. cinerea). When the normalization is applied to reflectance spectra from 2000-2400 nm acquired for a lichen encrusted quartzite rock sample we show that only a single lichen endmember is required to account for the lichen contribution in the observed mixtures. In contrast, two such endmembers are required when the normalization is not applied to the reflectance data. We illustrate this point using examples where endmembers are extracted manually and automatically, and compare the SMA results against abundances estimated from digital photography. For both the reflectance and normalized reflectance data, SMA results correlate well (R-2 > 0.9) with abundances estimated from digital photography. The use of normalized reflectance implies that any field/laboratory lichen spectrum can be selected as the lichen endmember for SMA of airborne/spaceborne imagery. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Ground ET measurements obtained from eddy covariance towers at four riparian sites were correlated with MODIS VIs, MODIS land surface temperatures (LSTs), and ground micrometeorological data over four years. Sites included two saltcedar (Tamarix ramosissima) and two Rio Grande cottonwood (Populus deltoides ssp. Wislizennii) dominated stands. The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was more closely correlated (r=0.76) with ET than the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; r=0.68) for ET data combined over sites and species. Air temperature (T.) measured over the canopy from towers was the meteorological variable that was most closely correlated with ET (r=0.82). MODIS LST data at 1- and 5-km resolutions were too coarse to accurately measure the radiant surface temperature within the narrow riparian corridor; hence, energy balance methods for estimating ET using MODIS LSTs were not successful. On the other hand, a multivariate regression equation for predicting ET from EVI and T. had an r(2)=0.82 across sites, species, and years. The equation was similar to VI-ET models developed for crop species. The finding that ET predictions did not require species-specific equations is significant. inasmuch as these are mixed vegetation zones that cannot be easily mapped at the species level.

Supervised classifications by depth range were made of both types of image. A direct comparison of overall accuracy between SPOT 2.5 m and SPOT 10 m revealed that this tool provided accurate mapping in both cases (between 73% and 96% accuracy). Although SPOT 2.5 m provides lower overall accuracy than SPOT 10 m, it is a very useful tool for the mapping of P. oceanica, as it allows the patchiness of the formations to be better taken into account. The opportunity to use a reliability scale, which takes into account the effects of extrinsic factors on the processing of the images, confirmed the usefulness of the option of using a reduced pixel size in order to obtain an improved match between the results from mapping and field observations.

Unfortunately, remote sensing technology does not currently resolve the land surface at a scale that is easily observed with ground measurements. One approach to validation is to use existing soil moisture measurement networks and scale these point observations up to the resolution of remote sensing footprints. As part of the Soil Moisture Experiment 2002 (SMEX02), one such soil moisture gaging system in the Walnut Creek Watershed, Iowa, provided robust estimates of the soil moisture average for a watershed throughout the summer of 2002. Twelve in situ soil moisture probes were installed across the watershed. These probes recorded soil moisture at a depth of 5 cm from June 29, 2002 to August 19, 2002. The sampling sites were analyzed for temporal and spatial stability by several measures including mean relative difference, Spearman rank, and correlation coefficient analysis. Representative point measurements were used to estimate the watershed scale ( similar to 25 km) soil moisture average and shown to be accurate indicators with low variance and bias of the watershed scale soil moisture distribution. This work establishes the validity of this approach to provide watershed scale soil moisture estimates in this study region for the purposes of satellite validation with estimation errors as small as 3%. Also, the potential sources of error in this type of analysis are explored. This study is a first step in the implementation of large-scale soil moisture validation using existing networks such as the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) and several Agricultural Research Service watersheds as a basis for calibrating satellite soil moisture products, for networks design, and designing field experiments.

Remote sensing is a valuable tool for burned area mapping, providing spatially explicit information on the scorched areas, even for remote regions.   Various sensors have been used for burned land mapping in recent years, covering local (10-30 m pixel size) and global scales (500-1000 m pixel size). Regional inventories require higher detail than global studies, but typically cover larger territories than local studies. For this purpose, the use of medium spatial resolution sensors (100-300 in pixel size) is highly advisable. Few studies have evaluated these sensors, and none have specifically assessed the performance of images acquired by the Argentinian Satellite for Scientific Applications-C/Multispectral Medium Resolution Scanner (SAC-C/MMRS) for mapping burned areas, which is the main objective in this paper.   Since information on calibration parameters was not available, raw data was converted into ground reflectance values after a \"cross-calibration\" method, using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data as reference. Estimated radiance values showed very high correlation with those for the ETM+ (r(2)>0.9). Several spectral indices were generated and tested. The Burned Area Index (BAI), derived from red and near infrared (NIR) reflectances showed the greatest sensitivity to discriminate burned areas from other land cover types, although the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII), based on the Red and Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) bands also provided good discrimination capability.   Image segmentation was performed by using a multi-threshold approach, based on the BAI and the NDII since these two spectral indices have the highest sensitivity to (1) discriminate burned areas and (2) to avoid confusion with water and cloud shadows.   Burned perimeters delineated using a seeded region growing algorithm showed good agreement with the perimeters digitised on Landsat ETM+ data, providing accurate estimation of the burned areas compared to statistics provided by the Spanish forest fire authorities. In the first study area (Almeria, south-eastern Spain), the perimeters showed a 90% agreement. In the second study site (Madrid), two fires were studied. The first one (Cadalso, south-west of Madrid) showed an agreement of 64%, and for the second one (Patones, north-east of Madrid), the agreement was 84%. The lower accuracy of the former was caused by the great spatial discontinuity of that fire, which includes many patches of unaffected vegetation within the scar perimeter. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

New techniques introduced include automated Monte Carlo unmixing (AutoMCU) and several new approaches for mapping land-cover. A diversity of sensors are utilized, including ETM+, IKONOS, SPOT-4, Airborne P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and L-band SAR.

Given the complex nature of the data to be expected from these missions, a thorough preparation for them is essential and this can be accomplished by realistic simulation of the imagery data, years before the actual launch. Based on given spectral and directional capabilities of the instrument, and in combination with biophysical land surface properties obtained from existing imagery, the spectral and directional responses of several types of vegetation and bare soil have been simulated pixel by pixel using the radiative transfer models PROSPECT (for hyperspectral leaf reflectance and transmittance), GeoSAIL (for two-layer canopy bidirectional spectral reflectance), and MODTRAN4 (for atmospheric hyperspectral and directional effects). In this way, one obtains realistically simulated hyperspectral and directional top-of-atmosphere spectral radiance images, with all major effects included, such as heterogeneity of the landscape, non-Lambertian reflectance of the land surface, the atmospheric adjacency effect, and the limited spatial resolution of the instrument. The output of the image simulations can be used to demonstrate the capabilities of future earth observation missions. In addition, instrument specifications and image acquisition strategies might be optimized on the basis of simulated image analysis results, and new advanced data assimilation procedures could be validated with realistic inputs under controlled circumstances. This paper describes the applied methodology, the study area with the input images, the set-up of the actual image simulations, and discusses the final results obtained. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

MODIS snow-cover products represent potential improvement to or enhancement of the currently available operational products mainly because the MODIS products are global and 500-m resolution, and have the capability to separate most snow and clouds. The MODIS snow-mapping algorithms are automated, which means that a consistent data set may be generated for long-term climate studies that require snow-cover information. Extensive quality assurance (QA) information is stored with the products.. The MODIS snow product suite begins with a 500-m resolution, 2330-km swath snow-cover map, which is then gridded to an integerized sinusoidal grid to produce daily and 8-day composite tile products. The sequence proceeds to a climate-modeling grid (CMG) product at 0.05degrees resolution, with both daily and 8-day composite products. Each pixel of the daily CMG contains fraction of snow cover from 40% to 100%. Measured errors of commission in the CMG are low, for example, on the continent of Australia in the spring, they vary from 0.02% to 0.10%. Near-term enhancements include daily snow albedo and fractional snow cover.

A conditional probability test was conducted between this phenomenon and NDVI values. It was found that the negative ENSO phase is associated with drought conditions with a delay of 4 - 6 months related to the start of event, while the positive phase is related to high NDVI values during the driest season in the region. Clustering the NDVI values by terciles, it was determined that summers with high NDVI values are related to an intensification of the Mexican summer monsoon; while, in dry summers, the flow is characterized by the presence of an enhanced ridge of high-pressure aloft over most of the national territory. In winters with high NDVI values, a very intense low-pressure trough induces a meridional flow with penetration of humid air associated with frontal activity. This circulation pattern is common during the ENSO warm phase. Winters with low NDVI are associated atmospheric circulation patterns typical of the so-called Pacific North American (PNA) type. Based on the bio-seasonality and precipitation modulation in northwest Mexico due to the ENSO, it is concluded that the delay of a few months observed in NDVI values with respect to precipitation inputs supports the Seed Hydration Memory (SHM) concept. The ecological implications of this phenomenon for the region are also discussed. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.', 'BCS, CIBNOR, La Paz, Mexico.

Satellite remote sensing using coarse resolution (approximate to 1 km) sensors is thus well suited in documenting the spatial and temporal distribution of fires in this zone. The purpose of this study was to investigate the utility of the SPOT VEGETATION (VGT) sensor for estimating three key parameters related to boreal forest fire: burned area, postfire regeneration age, and aboveground biomass. Based on a sample of fires across Canada, the best overall discrimination of burned forest was provided by a normalized short-wave-based vegetation index (SW-VI) that combines near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) channels from VGT. Multitemporal differencing of this index from anniversary date VGT composites was combined synergistically with active fire locations from NOAA/AVHRR to map Canadian forest that burned during 1998 and 1999. National burned area estimates for both years were within 15% of those compiled by the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, The normalized index also was correlated (R=.68) with the age of regenerating forests in Saskatchewan and Manitoba that burned between 1949 and 1998. An artificial neural network (ANN) model developed using temporal metrics computed from VGT could predict the age of these forests with an RMS error of 7 years (R=.83). By contrast, forest biomass based on Canada\'s Forest Inventory (CanFI) was estimated with relatively poor accuracy (RMS = 32 tons/ha) from VGT reflectance and terrestrial ecozone using a network model, We conclude that the VGT instrument is effective for mapping large boreal bums at the end of a fire season and approximating the age of regenerating bums less than about 30 years old. This information can be useful to supplement conventional ground-based data sets in remote areas where coverage may be incomplete.

Its ability to detect emitted radiation in the short (4 mum)- and long (12 mum)-wave infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, combined with the excellent geolocation of the image pixels (similar to 200 m), makes it an ideal source of data for automatically detecting and monitoring high-temperature volcanic thermal anomalies. This paper describes the underlying principles of, and results obtained from, just such a system, Our algorithm interrogates the MODIS Level 1B data stream for evidence of high-temperature volcanic features. Once a hotspot has been identified, its details (location, emitted spectral radiance, satellite observational parameters) are written to an ASCII text file and transferred via file transfer protocol (FTP) to the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology (HIGP), where the results are posted on the Internet (http://modis.higp.hawaii.edu), The global distribution of volcanic hotspots can be examined visually at a variety of scales using this website, which also allows easy access to the quantitative data contained in the ASCII files themselves. We outline how the algorithm has proven robust as a hotspot detection tool for a wide range of eruptive styles at both permanently and sporadically active volcanoes including Soufriere Hills (Montserrat), Popocatepetl (Mexico), Bezymianny (Russia), and Merapi (Java), amongst others. We also present case studies of how the system has allowed the onset, development,. and cessation of discrete eruptive events to be monitored at Nyamuragira (Congo), Piton de la Fournaise (Reunion Island), and Shiveluch (Russia).

Inversion performed better than a number of empirical spectral features tested, including single TM bands and the NDVI. Inversion allowed both cover and transparency variations in the TM data to be simultaneously taken into account, while the presence of variations in both factors impaired the empirical relationships. However, the method could not provide accurate information on a per-stand basis. Consideration of a number of sources of uncertainty in the inversion process highlighted some important limitations in the method; these included the adequacy of the model, noise in the TM data, and errors in the ancillary parameters. The results indicated that a lack of stand-specific ancillary information on the needle and background reflectances was a serious limitation in the utility of the approach. Improved methods for obtaining ancillary information seem necessary. In this context, using existing forest inventory information to help estimate some of the key ancillary parameters is considered a possible way forward. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The objective of this study is to compare the performance of selected VIs, including some hyperspectral VIs based on waveform, analysis of the reflectance across the vegetation red edge. The analysis is based on biophysical data measured in a winter wheat field fertilized at three nitrogen (N) levels. The measurements were acquired continuously throughout the growing season and related to canopy spectral reflectance measured with a ground-based spectroradiometer. Green crop area index (GCAI) and canopy chlorophyll density (CCD) were the major variables determined from the biophysical data set. Canopy chlorophyll was measured using nondestructive methods based on two optical instruments. The prediction power of selected VIs calculated from spectra resampled to Landsat TM configuration was compared with narrow-band indices including some VIs based on waveform analysis techniques. It was concluded that an exponential relationship exists between the two biophysical parameters and all of the selected indices except for the simple ratio index (RVI), for which a linear relationship was formed. The results indicate that VIs based on waveform analysis using narrow bands across the red edge may improve the prediction of CCD. However, none of the hyperspectral indices that were included in the study was better at estimating GCAI than the best of the traditional VIs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Individual reflectance-based indices demonstrated the relative differences between application rates and identified both nitrogen and water stresses at various times in the growing season. No single index was able to describe the status of the corn crop throughout the season. Canonical discriminant analysis provided accurate classification of samples by N rate during early, mid, and late season conditions with overall success rates of 70%. 88%. and 93%\', respectively. A shift in importance from green-based derivatives to red-based derivatives was noted from mid to late season and attributed to the natural reduction in green pigments as the crop entered senescence. Canopy-scale photochemical reflectance index (PRI) was shown to be cot-related with canopy radiation use efficiency (RUE). Mid-season water stress affected the relationship. Multiple years of data are required to demonstrate robust relationships between hyperspectral indices and corn ecophysiological status because of the interaction between environmental and nutrient stresses. Identifying areas of fields sensitive to weather-induced stresses will allow better management of N application. Timing the collection of hyperspectral image data at early and late vegetative phase could enhance precision agriculture by allowing supplemental nutrient application. identifying stress patterns and aid in yield forecasting.

Canada-wide LAI maps are now being produced using cloud-free Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery every 10 days at 1-km resolution. The archive of these products began in 1993. LAI maps at the same resolution are also being produced with images from the SPOT VEGETATION sensor, To improve the LAI algorithms and validate these products, a group of Canadian scientists acquired LAI measurements during the summer of 1998 in deciduous, conifer, and mixed forests, and in cropland. Common measurement standards using the commercial Tracing Radiation and Architecture of Canopies (TRAC) and LAI-2000 instruments were followed. Eight Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes at 30-m resolution were used to locate ground sites and to facilitate spatial scaling to 1-km pixels. In this paper, examples of Canada-wide LAI maps are presented after an assessment of their accuracy using ground measurements and the eight Landsat scenes. Methodologies for scaling from high- to coarse-resolution images that consider surface heterogeneity in terms of mixed cover types are evaluated and discussed. Using Landsat LAI images as the standard, it is shown that the accuracy of LAI values of individual AVHRR and VEGETATION pixels was in the range of 50-75%. Random and bias errors were both considerable. Bias was mostly caused by uncertainties in atmospheric correction of the Landsat images, but surface heterogeneity in terms of mixed cover types were also found to cause bias in AVHRR and SPOT VEGETATION LAI calculations. Random errors come from many sources, but pixels with mixed cover types are the main cause of random errors. As radiative signals from different vegetation types were quite different at the same LAI, accurate information about subpixel mixture of the various cover types is identified as the key to improving the accuracy of LAI estimates.

However. because land surface temperature and energy balance both depend on a complex suite of factors, precise estimation of surface energy exchanges using thermal remote sensing is difficult. In recent years, a variety of methods have been developed that overcome previous limitations and show substantial promise for robust estimation of surface fluxes from remote sensing. This paper reviews recent progress in this domain and describes a two-layer energy balance model designed for use with thermal remote sensing. An important aspect of the model is that it is specifically designed to account for the complex micrometeorology and thermal properties of land surfaces possessing a range of density in vegetation. Further, the physics underlying this model are complementary to the physics of land surface thermal remote sensing. Comparisons between field measurements and modeled fluxes show good agreement, which suggests that the model describes land surface energy balance processes with good realism. More importantly. these results reinforce the conclusions of other recent studies that have demonstrated the compatibility of two-layer energy balance models with remote sensing observations and. by extension, the viability of using thermal remote sensing to model surface energy balance.

Similar radar backscattering from vegetation and wind-roughened water surfaces can make such distinctions difficult in SAR backscatter images. In contrast, coherence is preserved over surfaces with rigid scattering elements, such as leafless woody alder, but is lost over temporally unstable surfaces such as open water. We find that willow-alder display highest coherence followed by spruce, frozen lakes and channels, and open water, respectively. This general hierarchy is preserved even when overall image coherence is decreased by increasing temporal and spatial baselines. Evaluation of spatial, thermal noise and temporal components of total observed coherence indicates that temporal decorrelation is a primary control. Short temporal baselines, such as those obtained during the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS) 1-day tandem missions, are therefore optimal for obtaining maximum differentiation of surface classes.

The proof of concept has been further tested based on data acquisition campaigns at the Newell County rangeland test site in Alberta in August and October 1998. The rangeland test site in the Newell County region of Alberta is tested for its suitability as a calibration test site for satellite sensor systems. All three campaigns included ground-based measurements, satellite imagery and airborne hyperspectral data. The airborne hyperspectral sensor data were acquired using the Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) at Railroad Valley and the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (casi) in all three campaigns. This paper describes the formulation and implementation of the new methodology, and radiometric calibration monitoring results obtained for five different sensors: NOAA-14 AVHRR, OrbView-2 SeaWiFS, SPOT-4 VGT, SPOT-1/2 HRV, and Landsat-5 TM. The results indicate that the nominal on-orbit radiometric calibrations of all the satellite sensors fit within their predicted uncertainties. The combination of both lower-reflectance and higher-reflectance test sites is shown to improve the quality of the calibration monitoring results. In particular, the combined QUASAR monitoring results obtained from the three airborne data acquisition days at the two test sites, encompassing five satellite sensors and a total of 40 spectral band cases, yield a correlation between QUASAR-based and nominal TOA radiances characterized by y = 1.026x - 1.26, and r(2)=0.990. Temporal extensions of QUASAR data sets to calibrate satellite sensors imaging the test site one or more days away from the airborne data acquisition day yield mixed results.

The method utilizes satellite data and ground reference data. It takes into consideration the fact that a pixel rarely represents any single ground cover class. This is particularly true for low-spatial-resolution data. It also takes into consideration that the spectral classes overlap. The image was first classified using an unsupervised clustering method. A (multinormal) spectral density function was estimated for each class based on the spectral vectors (reflectance values) of the cluster members. Values of the target variable - the proportion of forested area - were determined for the spectral classes using sampling from CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) Land Cover database. Each pixel was assigned class membership probabilities, which were proportional to the value of the density function of the respective class evaluated at the spectral value of the pixel. The estimate of forest area for the pixel was finally computed by multiplying the class membership probabilities by the class forest area and summing over all the classes. The method was applied over a mosaic of 49 Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) images acquired from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-14 satellite. The estimated forest areas were compared with those extracted from the full-coverage CORINE data and with official Forest statistics reported to the European Commission\'s Statistical Office (EUROSTAT). The forest percentage (proportion of forest area of the total land area) of 12 countries of the European Union was underestimated by 1.8% compared to the CORINE data. It was underestimated by 4.2% when compared with EUROSTAT\'s statistics and 6.0% when compared to United Nations Economic Commission for Europe/Food and Agricultural Organization (UN-ECE/FAO) statistics. The largest underestimation of forest percentage within a country (compared to CORINE) was in France (5.9%). The largest overestimation was found in Ireland. 15.6%. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

It includes three stages: (1) simulation of short wave infrared bidirectional reflectances of a \"reference scene\" with constant architecture and variable chemistry; (2) establishment of predictive relationships of chemicals with stepwise regressions; (3) assessment of the robustness of these relationships for scenes with variable structures. Results stressed that predictive relationships are influenced by canopy structure and view direction. Their reliability decreases with increasing heterogeneity of the understory and also if tree cover or LAI decreases. On the other hand, they tend to remain robust if tree cover and LAI increase, that is if the influence of the understory on canopy reflectance decreases. Their reliability increases when the view direction becomes more oblique, except for the hotspot and specular directions. Finally, this work stresses factors that can explain the difficulty to establish robust predictive relationships with remote sensing data. It shows also that 3D modeling approaches can be an efficient tool for studying forest chemistry from space, for instance, in order to assess the domain of validity of predictive relationships.

Reliable flux estimates over heterogeneous surfaces have been obtained using two-source models that implicitly account for differences between T-H(phi) and aerodynamic temperature, T-O, by considering separately the contributions of soil/substrate and vegetation to T-R(phi) observations and to the turbulent fluxes. A simple two-source energy balance model developed to use T-H(phi) observations has been applied successfully to a wide range of vegetation cover conditions at the field scale. However, its application with course resolution weather satellite data (i.e., pixel resolution greater than or similar to 1 km) will invariably result in errors in pixel-averaged heat flux estimation for surfaces with significant variability in vegetation cover and stress conditions. Indeed, with the highest resolution of satellite T-H(phi) data similar to 100 m, subpixel heterogeneity will still be significant for many landscapes, especially arid and semiarid areas. Uncertainty in flux estimation due to significant subpixel heterogeneity is examined using the simplified two-source model with T-R(phi) inputs from simulations using a detailed plant-environment model (Cupid) under six different \"homogeneous\" surface conditions commonly found in semiarid and arid regions and under high and low winds. These surface types are comprised of shrub and tall riparian vegetation, high and low canopy cover, wet and dry surface soil moisture state, and stressed versus unstressed vegetation condition. From six homogeneous surface conditions defined by vegetation type, cover, surface moisture and stress, four mixed-pixel cases were constructed, each containing two contrasting surface types. Significant or unacceptable errors (i.e., similar to 50 W m(-2)) in pixel-average heat fluxes are found in all four mixed-pixel cases, but the significant errors primarily occur when the fraction of the extreme surface condition (e.g., riparian wetland) comprises between similar to 20% and 80% of the mixed-pixel. Additionally, the results are influenced by the wind conditions with a higher wind speed tending to reduce errors. This preliminary analysis suggests that when there is a significant discontinuity in surface conditions, particularly under low winds, the subpixel variability in energy fluxes will likely cause unacceptable errors in two-source model predictions. However, daytime wind speeds are typically >2 m s(-1) and the resolution of T-H(phi) observations from weather satellites are relatively coarse (i.e., similar to5-19 km), which means riparian areas are likely to comprise less than 10% of a pixel. Both of these factors are likely to reduce errors in heat flux predictions at these large spatial scales caused by using pixel-average inputs. The Advanced Spaceborn Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument proposed for NASA\'s Earth Observing System (EOS) has 90 m resolution. This will be useful for evaluating the impact of subpixel variability on flux predictions with coarser resolution data more routinely available from weather satellites.

There has been a great deal of interest in estimating vegetation parameters and their spatial and temporal extent using remotely sensed imagery. There are primarily two approaches to estimating vegetation parameters such as leaf area index (LAI). The first one is associated with computation of spectral vegetation indices (SVI) from radiometric measurements. This approach uses an empirical or modeled LAI-SVI relation between remotely sensed variables such as SVI and biophysical variables such as LAI. The major limitation of this empirical approach is that there is no single LAI-SVI equation (with a set of coefficients) that can be applied to remote-sensing images of different surface types. The second approach involves using bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models. It inverts a BRDF model with radiometric measurements to estimate LAI wing an optimization procedure. Although this approach has a theoretical basis and is potentially applicable to varying surface types, its primary limitation is the lengthy computation time and difficulty of obtaining the required input parameters by the model. In this study, we present ct strategy that combines BRDF models and conventional LAI-SVI approaches to circumvent these limitations. The proposed strategy runs implemented in three sequential steps. In the first step, a BRDF model was inverted with a limited number of dam points or pixels to produce a training data set consisting of leaf area index and associated pixel values. In the second step, the training data set passed through a quality control procedure to remove outliers from the inversion procedure. In the final step, the training data set was used either to fit an LAI-SVI equation or to train a neural fuzzy system. The best fit equation or the trained fuzzy system was then applied to large-scale remote-sensing imagery to map spatial LAI distribution. This approach was applied to Landsat TM imagery acquired in the semiarid southeast Arizona and AVHRR imagery over the Hapex-Sahel experimental sites near Niamy, Niger. The results were compared with limited ground-based LAI measurements and suggested that the proposed approach produced reasonable estimates of leaf area index over large areas in semiarid regions. This study was not intended to show accuracy improvement of LAI estimation from remotely sensed data. Rather, it provides an alternative that is simple and requires little knowledge of study target and few ground measurements.

Acquisitions performed over stands of different ages, between 5 and 48 years old, also illustrate the dependence of the structure of stands on the hot spot.

One approach uses remotely sensed ecosystem properties in the scaling process. This approach combines digital maps of key ecosystem properties such as land cover type, leaf area index, and/or canopy chemistry with quantitative models of biological processes based on these ecosystem properties. Constraints on parametrizing models for global scale applications mean that relatively simple algorithms must be used which are based almost exclusively on satellite-derived inputs, for example, the planned Earth Observation System (EOS)-MODIS Land Science Team model output. Presently, there are limited ways of validating these outputs. At the landscape scale, the opportunity exists to combine remote sensing data with spatially distributed, process-based biogeochemistry models to examine variation in ecosystem processes such as NPP as a function of land cover type, canopy attributes, and/or location along environmental gradients. These process models can be validated against direct measurements made with eddy covariance flux towers and ground-based NPP sampling. Once ran and validated over local landscapes, these fine scale models may provide our best opportunity, to provide meaningful evaluation (or \"validntion\" in some sense) of simpler globally applied models. In this article, we I) provide a biological framework that links ecosystem attributes and ecosystem carbon flux processes at a variety of scales, and summarizes the state of knowledge and models in these areas, 2) describe the need for developing NPP surfaces at a local landscape scale as a means of validating global models, in particular the MODIS NPP product, 3) describe the approach of the BigFoot project to performing such a validation exercise far a series of sites in North America, and 4) present an example using one such model (PnET-II) across diverse vegetation types in a heterogeneous landscape in central North America.

In the first part of this article, we have recalled those five methods and shown mathematically that they are almost equivalent to each other. Then, using simulated data built up wit the TIMS (Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner) instrument, we have analyzed the sensitivity of those methods to different sources of error which may occur in real data such as errors due to 1) method simplification, 2) instrumental noise and systematic calibration error, 3) uncertainties on the estimation of downwelling atmospheric radiance, and 4) uncertainties of atmospheric parameters in atmospheric corrections. In terms of resulting errors in relative emissivity, the results show that: a) All methods are very sensitive to the uncertainties of atmosphere. An error of 20% of water vapor in midlatitude summer atmosphere (2.9 cm) may lead to an error of 0.03 (rms) for Channel 1 of TIMS. b) The effect of the atmospheric reflection term is very important. If this term is neglected in method development, this may lead to an error of 0.03 (rms) for Channel 1 and midlatitude summer atmosphere. This is the cae for the alpha method. c) Instrumental noise commonly expressed by noise equivalent difference temperature (NE Delta T) from 0.1 K to 0.3 K results in an error of relative emissivity ranging from 0.002 to 0.005 for all methods. d) Error in relative emissivity due to the instrument calibration error (systematic error) is negligible. The stud also shows that the relative emissivity derived wit an incorrect atmosphere is linearly related to its actual value derived with correct atmospheric parameters. Based on this property, we propose three methods to correct for the errors caused by atmospheric corrections under horizontally invariant atmospheric conditions. A practical analysis with the real TIMS data acquired for Hapex-Sahel experiment in 1992 supports the results of this simulation.

This activity has resulted in waste rock and tailings being dispersed from the mine workings down to a large tailings dump and then along a river valley eventually reaching the sea. This tailings dump material consists of a variety of ferruginous materials that often contain trace elements that are environmentally harmful and possibly toxic. These ferruginous materials have distinctive spectral features which make them amenable to detection and mapping by airborne imaging spectrometer data. The dispersion of the tailings material was studied using two semiquantitative techniques, matched filtering and linear spectral unmixing and qualitative methods using band ratios and the variation in strength of spectral features. The distinct ferruginous mineral phases resolved by these methods were then compared to laboratory reference spectrum using qualitative analysis of the spectral profiles and two quantitative techniques, spectral angle mapping and cross correlogram spectral matching. The distribution of the ferruginous materials identified from the imaging spectrometer data supports the results of laboratory experiments on the dependence of the formation of iron species on their geochemical and physical situation.

The three sites were relatively homogeneous mature stands of black spruce, jack pine, and aspen located in the southern boreal zone of central Saskatchewan. Measurements of the spectal bidirectional reflectance factors with a 15 degrees instrument field of view in three spectral bands centered at 662 nm, 826 nm, and 1658 nm were made with the PARABOLA instrument over a range of solar zenith angles typically varying from 35 degrees (near solar noon) to 70 degrees. The measured reflectance factors showed large anisotropy at all three sites and for all three wavelengths, with prominant backscatter peak reflectances, and strong retro solar view angle (hot spot) maximum reflectances in the visible (662 nm) and shortwave infrared (1658 nm) for the jack pine and black spruce sites, with a less pronounced hot spot at the aspen site. Pronounced effects of canopy and understory shadowing in the visible, as a function of solar zenith angle (SZA), were observed for the black spruce and jack pine sites, with resultant large linear increases in computed normalized difference and simple ratio vegetation indices as SZA increased for near-nadir view angles. Hemispheric spectral reflectances or spectral albedos were computed from angular integration of PARABOLA measured bidirectional reflectances. Visible (662 nm.) hemispheric reflectances for the jack pine and black spruce canopies showed very little variation with solar zenith angle, while near-infrared hemispheric reflectances increased strongly with increasing SW. Estimates were made of the total shortwave albedo for the aspen and jack pine sites from irradiance and reflectance weighting of the spectral hemispheric reflectances in the three measured wavelengths. Comparison of estimated to pyranometer measured total albedo showed all estimates to be biased high, but only by about 0.007-0.018, depending on which of two sets of pyranometer measured albedos were utilized for the comparison. The measured bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) data sets reported in this study coupled with ancillary data of biophysical parameters collected at the same sites by BOREAS researchers provide a unique data set for the de development and characterization of canopy bidirectional reflectance modeling and for the interpretation of remotely sensed data for boreal forest canopies.

The present article presents the development of a model to quantify the gross photosynthesis on the basis of remote measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence and radiance with the Laser Environmental Active Fluorosensor (LEAF-NL). Combined measurements of the laser-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and CO2 exchange have been carried out during several days. Drought and ozone stress were imposed in two separate experiments. The laser-induced fluorescence measurements show a remarkable behavior. After sunrise the fluorescence yield rises first, but at high radiation and high temperature the fluorescence yield may decline below the nighttime fluorescence. This extremely strong quenching of fluorescence is attributed to photosystem deactivation. On the basis of the available laser-induced fluorescence data, a photosystem energy partitioning model is developed and finally used to predict photosynthetic electron transport. The results of this new model are compared with those of the current theory, the results from the new model show a fairly good correspondence with the CO2 assimilation data. It is believed that the present results are a significant step forward to the development of practical applications.

Influence of acquisition parameters (spatial resolution, spectral domain and viewing, and illumination configurations) is also investigated. The work is realized with the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer model (DART) simulated images with which we quantify texture with variograms. Results point out the complex dependency of variogram characteristics (range, sill, amplitude of oscillations) on biophysical and acquisition parameters. Neglect of spatial variations of the reflectance of canopy elements, as in most geometric-optical models, can lead to important errors. This stresses the interest of accurate radiative transfer models, such as DART. Although tree crown diameter is the most influential biophysic parameter, its influence may be totally masked by acquisition parameters. Finally, theoretical results were tested against high resolution airborne data (1.67 m resolution).

The model makes it possible to formulate technical requirements to the lidar (the emergent beam angle, pulse power, etc.), which prove to be quite achievable at the present time. Three typical situations are considered when the method under discussion can be used: 1) at night, with clear skies; 2) daytime, with clear skies; 3) at night, with thin clouds.

In this study, a remote sensing-based technique for land-cover-change analysis was applied to the African continent for the last decade. Ten years of daily, continental-scale satellite remote sensing data (from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\'s advanced very-high resolution radiometer) were analyzed. Deviations in the seasonal trajectory of the land surface-characterized by its brightness temperature and a vegetation index-were interpreted in terms of land-cover change on a yearly basis, from 1982 to 1991. Land-cover-change magnitudes were measured and mapped for every year. The major categories of seasonal patterns of changes were identified. Multiyear patterns of change also were categorized, and all areas affected by a continuous decrease and gain in vegetation cover over the decade were mapped. Results were related to published high-resolution remote sensing-based studies. This study\'s results demonstrate that interannual land-cover changes in Africa mostly involve erratic variations in land-cover conditions due to interannual climatic variability and temporary modifications in seasonality. Continuous, unidirectional change processes (decrease or gain in vegetation cover) affected less than 4% of sub-Saharan Africa during the study period. Although such linear changes are just a fraction of the total land-cover changes detected, their effect on ecosystems and sustainability of livelihood might be significant. In the semiarid regions, temporary modification of the biophysical attributes of the surface driven by variations in rainfall is the dominant process. Future work will focus on finer-scale interpretation and validation of patterns of changes.

A curved arm fitted with multiband radiometers revolves on a circular track around the target, allowing rapid measurement of multispectral bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs) of the target at 10 degrees-zenith and azimuth angles.

Accurate retrieval of ice concentrations from these data is important because of the sensitivity of surface flux (e.g., heat, salt, and water) calculations to small changes in the amount of open water (leads and polynyas) within the polar ice packs. Two algorithms that have been used for deriving ice concentrations from multichannel data are compared. One is the NASA Team algorithm and the other is the Bootstrap algorithm, both of which were developed at NASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center. The two algorithms use different channel combinations, reference brightness temperatures, weather filters, and techniques. Analyses are made to evaluate the sensitivity of algorithm results to variations of emissivity and temperature with space and time. To assess the difference in the performance of the two algorithms, analyses were performed with data from both hemispheres and for all seasons. The results show only small differences in the central Arctic in winter but larger disagreements in the seasonal regions and in summer. In some areas in the Antarctic, the Bootstrap technique shows ice concentrations higher than those of the Team algorithm by as much as 25%; whereas, in other areas, it shows ice concentrations lower by as much as 30%. The differences in the results are caused by temperature effects, emissivity effects, and tie point differences. The Team and the Bootstrap results were compared with available Landsat, advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. AVHRR, Landsat, and SAR data sets all yield higher concentrations than the passive microwave algorithms. Inconsistencies among results suggest the need for further validation studies.

These plots were chosen so as to characterize homogeneous forest areas representing a range of ages of regeneration from new regrowth to mature forest. The mean backscattering coefficients of these forest areas, as measured by SAR instruments on the ERS-1 and JERS-1 satellites and by SIR-C on the Space Shuttle, was determined so that its dependence on the biomass density of regenerating forest at different radar wavelengths and polarizations could be quantified. Results confirm the findings of similar studies of different type of forest, and of radar backscatter models, that the longer wavelength (L-band) SAR imagery may be used to discriminate between different levels of forest biomass up to a certain threshold and that cross polarized backscatter is more sensitive to changes in biomass density. The shorter wavelength (C-band) SAR imagery is limited to differentiating between vegetation and bare soil when it is dry. The biomass density limit of around 60 tonnes per hectare, above which the L-band backscatter shows no further sensitivity to increased biomass density, suggests that spaceborne SAR imagery is suitable for estimating the biomass density and determining the extent of cleared and regenerating forest in tropical regions.

The presence of several synthetic-aperture radars (SARs) imaging the Earth suggests that these may be used to get an idea of the rainfall in the needed areas. An experiment was conducted using SIR-C/X-SAR that flew in 1994 to determine how well we can measure rain with such systems. The experiment reported here involved measurements over the southwestern Pacific Ocean and the Amazon rain forest. In the former case, a method was developed to measure the rain rate using the strength of the backscatter from rain. In the latter, we used estimates of the attenuation through the rain. Backscatter methods suffer from lack of knowledge of the appropriate Z-R relations. In addition, for SARs one must estimate independently the rain height and turbulent velocity. Furthermore, some method must provide information on the background \'\'clutter\'\' from the surface. Other problems arise in dealing with attenuation through the rain cell. Here we found reasonable rain rates from 10 mm/h to 200 mm/h in convective cells over the ocean. Without correction of the C-band calibration, an unreasonable peak rain rate of 375 m/s appeared, but we believe a correction is necessary. We present results in terms of two Z-R relations and both with and without correction for C-band calibration. Some discrepancies between C-band and X-band measurements remain to be explained. The attentuation method can be used where obvious rain shadows occur, as over the Amazon. Here the difference between echo in the shadow and in the unshadowed background can be used to estimate rain from the attentuation. Fewer assumptions are needed for this method than for the backscatter method, and results appear more consistent between C-band and X-band. Rates from 77 mm/h to 128 mm/h were measured in storm cells. The results show that spaceborne SARs can measure rain, but the accuracy of the measurements is unknown. Accurate absolute calibration is necessary for the backscatter method, as well as sound estimates of surface clutter, storm height, and turbulent velocities.

Using this technique, it is possible to decompose a spectral data set into a smaller number of significant factors that represent the key variables affecting vegetation spectral response. The results presented here show how spectral decomposition can be used to determine the intrinsic number and identity of the significant factors affecting the multispectral response. For the dataset investigated here, which comprises field spectra recorded over 1130 wavelengths, using a GER single field-of-view IRIS (SIRIS) spectroradiometer, it was found that a combination of just four factors was responsible for the majority of spectral variance. Interpretation of these factors was carried out by graphical analysis, stepwise regeneration of the original spectra, and correlation with biophysical data. Considering the identity of these factors, it was found that the second most significant factor (factor 2) was strongly related to the proportion of directly irradiated green leaves within the field-of-view of the spectroradiometer. In addition, it was found that the fourth most significant factor (factor 4) provided a good summary of the spectral response of the different samples in the region of strong chlorophyll absorption.

Ten spectrally defined forest cover types were created from unsupervised classification of the Landsat TM data, using a geographic information system to restrict data analysis to areas of similar slope, elevation, and surficial geology within the Central Plateau region of the park. Biotic data on forest overstory and understory conditions were collected from 69 sample sites within the 10 spectral cover classes. Field data were used to regroup the 69 sites into six biotically and spectrally distinct cover types, ranging from early postfire regeneration (LPO) to late-stage (LP3) subalpine fir succession. Increased absorption in the visible (TM 1, 2, and 3) and middle-infrared (TM 5 and 7) bands were related to the age and development of a stand. Changes in absorption were rapid during the initial stages of stand regeneration, but the rate of change slowed as stands progressed into later successional stages. Biotic factors relating to the physical structure of the forest canopy (height, basal area, biomass, and LAI) are cor-related with the visible and middle-infrared bands of the Thematic Mapper. Understory factors were poorly correlated with spectral response, except soil and fireweed, which are dominant early in succession, but rapidly decrease in Later stages. The spectral reflectance of a successional forest stand over time is a function of the combined effects of the overstory canopy, the amount of shadow within a canopy, and the condition of the forest understory As a forest develops from a disturbance to old-growth, the spectral response of a stand progresses along a vector or vectors linking the three factors. Spectral response changes are nonlinear with respect to time, as large-magnitude changes are observed in the first 20-30 years following a disturbance, and the rate of change lessens as forests develop into old-growth.RP Jakubauskas, ME (通讯作者)，UNIV OKLAHOMA,DEPT GEOG,634 ENERGY CTR,NORMAN,OK 73019, USA.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 48, 66, 69, 0, 10, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

The cloud detection integrates two distinct algorithms: one based on multiimage processing, the other on single-image analysis. The multiimage portion of the cloud detection algorithm operates on a time sequence of sea surface temperature (SST) images. It is designed to detect clouds associated with regions of apparently lower temperatures than the underlying SST field. A pixel in the current image is initially considered to be corrupted by clouds if it is significantly cooler than the corresponding pixel in a neighbor image. To refine the initial classificatlon, the algorithm checks the current image and the neighbor image for the presence of water masses, which through displacement could explain the change in temperature. The single-image cloud detection algorithm is designed to detect clouds associated with regions of the SST image where gradient vectors have a large magnitude. These regions are flagged in the map of potential clouds. Multiimage processing is integrated with the single-image algorithm by adding pixels classified as cloudy at the multiimage level to the map of potential clouds. Further analysis of the gradient vector field and of the shapes of potentially cloudy areas allows one to determine whether these regions correspond to clouds or SST fronts. A previous study has shown that the clouds identified by the single-image algorithm were in close agreement with those detected by a human expert. To validate the additional multiimage processing, the effect of the integrated cloud detection on the performance of a companion edge detection algorithm is examined. These results and a direct comparison with the cloud masks produced by a human expert indicate that, compared to the single-image algorithm, the multiimage algorithm successfully identify additional cloud-corrupted regions while keeping a Low rate for the detection of false clouds.', 'UNIV RHODE ISL,GRAD SCH OCEANOG,NARRAGANSETT,RI 02882.', 'University of Rhode IslandRP Cayula, JF (通讯作者)，PLANNING SYST INC,BLDG 9121,MSAAP,BAY ST LOUIS,MS 39529, USA.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 18, 51, 52, 1, 8, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Multiple samples were obtained from five California rice fields for analyses of nitrogen and lignin concentrations, and Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) images were obtained in August 1992. Multiple linear regression (MLR) was used to develop calibration equations for nitrogen and lignin based on AVIRIS reflectance (R) spectra transformed as the first difference of absorbance [log(1/R)]. Transformed AVIRIS absorbances were not as well correlated to lignin (r(2) = 0.44) as to nitrogen (r(2) = 0.74); the relative standard error of calibration (SEC) for nitrogen was 11%. To further test the predictive ability of this technique with respect to nitrogen concentration, four new calibration equations were derived based on each possible set of three fields. With each new subset of the data, MLR selected different wavelengths for the nitrogen calibration equation. Coefficients of multiple determination (r(2)) ranged from 0.69 to 0.85, with relative standard SECs ranging from 8.4% to 11.4%. Each of these equations was then used to predict the nitrogen concentration of samples in the omitted field, resulting in relative standard errors of prediction (SEP) ranging up to 37%. Results from this study suggest that calibration equations derived from multiple linear regression of AVIRIS spectra can be used to predict the nitrogen concentration of rice in the field.

The test area was dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) mixed with Norway spruce (Picea abies) and birch (Betula spp). Landsat TM images from eight sequential summers were relatively calibrated pairwise using regression functions. For each combination of images from different years, local relative changes in digital numbers (DNs) were obtained from the differences between measured data from the late image and a prediction of these data based on the early image. These changes were scaled into units of reflectance using the radiative transfer code 5S. Between 19% and 57% of the basal area was removed in the thinning cuttings. This caused an increase of between 0.001 and 0.004 reflectance in the visible bands and around 0.01 in the middle infrared bands. The best single bands for discrimination of thinned stands from normally developed stands were, in order, TM5, TM7, and TM3. The reflectance changes in these bands increased with thinning grade and with the proportion of pine in the stand. In TM4, the thinning cuttings caused a decrease in reflectance that, to a large degree, could be explained by the proportion of deciduous forest removed. In, detected thinning cuttings, around 50% of the variance in the thinning grade, basal area cut, or stem volume cut, could be explained by regression functions based on the TM data only. The reflectance changes caused by thinning cuttings were, in most bands, reduced to half between 4 and 5 years after cutting. The method used for calibration of local changes in DN to changes in reflectance allows data from different image acquisitions to be compared; thus it also may be suitable for creating a knowledge base containing reflectance changes caused by cuttings and local damages in forest.RP OLSSON, H (通讯作者)，SWEDISH UNIV AGR SCI,REMOTE SENSING LAB,S-90183 UMEA,SWEDEN.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 25, 46, 46, 0, 14, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE PUBL CO INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

The primary sources of in situ data for developing and validating biomass algorithms were monitoring cruises sponsored by the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) and the NSF-sponsored Land Margin Ecosystem Research (LMER) program of the University of Maryland. The general approach was to recover estimates of biomass from the relationship of surface chlorophyll to the concentration of vertically-integrated chlorophyll weighted bathymetrically. The seasonally and annually specific relations used to estimate biomass were then applied to ODAS estimates of surface chlorophyll for each of >90 flights to produce a time series of total phytoplankton biomass (in metric tons of chlorophyll) for the Chesapeake Bay. Estimates of algal biomass averaged approximately 500 metric tons, with maximum values of 1400 metric tons in spring 1990. These values are in agreement with estimates computed from the integrated vertical profiles of the CBP database using a 3D interpolator model. The total biomass of phytoplankton during the spring bloom of 1990 was significantly higher than in 1989, 1991, and 1992.

Our analyses are based upon four biophysical indices derived from the fully polarimetric SAR data: the volume scattering index (VSI), canopy structure index (CSI), biomass index (BMI), calculated from the backscatter magnitude data, and the interaction type index (ITI), calculated from the backscatter phase data. We developed a four-level landscape hierarchy based upon clustering analyses of the 12 index parameters (four indices each for P, L, and C band) from two test site images. Statistical analyses were used to examine the relative importance of the 12 parameters for discriminating ecosystem characteristics at various landscape scales. We found that ITI was the most important index (primarily C band = CITI) for level, vegetated terrain at all levels of the hierarchy. BMI was most important for differentiating between vegetated and nonvegetated areas and between sloping and level terrain. These findings indicate that upper canopy spatial characteristics and flooding in marshlands (reflected in the CITI) are more important than biomass in differentiating many tropical ecosystems with radar data. The relative importance of the indices varied with vegetation type; for example, PVSI was the most important for distinguishing between upland forests and regrowth, and PCSI was the most important for differentiating swamp forest types. Finally, we evaluated the potential of present and future spaceborne SARs for tropical ecosystem studies based on our results. Most of these SARs are single channel systems and will provide limited capability for characterizing biomass and structure of tropical vegetation. This is especially true for C band systems, which produce data similar to our CBMI parameter, which was one of the least important in our analyses.

This model treats the forest cover as a scene of discrete, three-dimensional objects (trees) that are illuminated and viewed from different positions in the hemisphere. The shapes of the objects, their count densities and patterns of placement, are the driving variables, and they condition the mixture Of sunlit and shaded objects and background that are observed from a particular viewing direction, given a direction of illumination. This mixture, in turn, controls the brightness apparent to an observer or a radiometric instrument. The Advanced Solid-State Array Spectroradiometer (ASAS) was used to validate this model. This aircraft sensor presently acquires images in 29 spectral bands in the range (465-871 nm) and is pointable fore-and-aft, allowing directional measurements of radiance as a target is approached and imaged at view angles ranging +/- 45-degrees from nadir. Through atmospheric correction, ASAS radiances were reduced to bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs). These were compared to corresponding BRF values computed from the Li-Strahler model using, wherever possible, ground measured component BRFs for calibration. The comparisons showed a good match between the modeled and measured reflectance factors for four of the five Oregon Transect Sites. Thus, the geometric-optical approach provides a realistic model for the bidirectional reflectance distribution function of such natural vegetation canopies.

Since the shape and depth of the atmospheric water bands are influenced not only by the water present but also by surface (background) reflectance, atmospheric scattering, and instrument radiance by calibration, a sensitivity analysis was performed using the radiative transfer code LOWTRAN 7 (Kneizys et al., 1988) to determine which one of these two approaches will provide a better estimate over land and water areas. The CIBR proved to be the technique less sensitive to perturbing effects, except for errors in visibility estimate. Both techniques were applied to AVIRIS radiance data acquired over Salton Sea, California. Resulting images confirmed that the use of a constant gray reflectance in the model led to a higher overestimation of the amount of water retrieved for N/W over vegetated areas.

Amounts retrieved using the N/W approach match more closely in situ measurements, even after adjusting model parameters for background reflectance, viewing geometry and type Of aerosol at the site.

Single pixels representing the top of the trees were also effective for defoliation assessment and are relatively simple, fast, and efficient to specify on the imagery. The best empirical model for predicting defoliation derived from this study had a prediction interval of +/- 17% defoliation, with an interval of +/- 16% for trees with defoliation of 26-100% and +/- 19% for trees with 0-25% defoliation (alpha = 0.05). The highest accuracy of the models for predicting defoliation class when tested on an independent sample was 51% for eight classes, 53% for seven classes, 60% for six classes, 80% for five classes, and 92% for four classes. Results demonstrated that high resolution MEIS data has good potential for single tree defoliation assessment suitable for sample plot or site-specific surveys.', 'FORESTRY CANADA,MARITIMES REG,FREDERICTON,NB,CANADA.', 'Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Forest ServiceRI MacLean, David A/G-6011-2011', NULL, 'MacLean, David A/0000-0002-0314-4435', NULL, NULL, 19, 39, 42, 0, 4, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

The SSM/I channels provide better spatial resolution and are at higher frequencies than typically used for studies of this type.  Examination of the SSM/I observations during a month and a half period in Oklahoma in 1987 indicated large spatial temperature variations due to both vegetation cover and soil moisture.  The brightness temperatures of the land background were strongly modulated by rainfall during the study period.  Areas of lowest brightness temperatures coincided with regions of bare soil which had received significant rainfall.  Examination of the time history of brightness temperatures in the bare soil regions showed that rainfall events caused significant temperature drops, which persisted for at least several days.  Time history plots of brightness temperature and the antecedent precipitation index during an extremely large rain event indicated a slow recovery period (approximately 15 days) back to the dry soil state.  On the other hand, vegetated regions showed smaller temperature drops and much weaker correlation with rain events, thus questioning the feasibility of using these SSM/I measurements for soil moisture estimation.', 'SCI SYST & APPLICAT INC,LANHAM,MD.', 'Science Systems and Applications IncRP HEYMSFIELD, GM (通讯作者)，NASA,GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CTR,ATMOSPHERES LAB,CODE 912,GREENBELT,MD 20771, USA.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 28, 16, 16, 0, 2, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

The main problem considered is to determine the reflectance of a small Lambertian target which is located on a uniform Lambertian background.  The principal differences between the three methods for solving the problem are that i) in the first method the background reflectance is used, but not the apparent background reflectance (the classical method), ii) just the opposite is done in the second method, and iii) both reflectances are used in the third method, thereby eliminating the often inaccurate path radiances.  These correction methods may not only be used for atmospheric correction itself, but also to evaluate the use of approximative radiative transfer calculations in atmospheric correction schemes.  As an example, we evaluate the Sobolev Modified Approximate Radiative Transfer (SMART) method employing numerical values obtained with the exact doubling method.  It is found that the accuracies of the derived target reflectances depend significantly on the correction method used, the actual target and background reflectances, the optical properties of the atmospheric constituents, and the viewing direction considered.  It is shown that the first method yields, generally, poorer results for the target reflectance than the second and third method.  It is tentatively concluded that replacement of SMART by a more accurate algorithm significantly improves the derived target reflectance only if the aerosol phase function is known with sufficient accuracy.', 'FREE UNIV AMSTERDAM,DEPT PHYS & ASTRON,DE BOELELAAN 1081,1081 HV AMSTERDAM,NETHERLANDS.

Video imagery has been used to detect or assess a variety of agricultural variables such as plant species, chlorosis, grass phytomass levels, cotton and alfalfa root rot infestations, wind erosion, soil moisture and irrigated crops, soil drainage and salinity, and insect pests.  The digitization and computer processing of video imagery has also been demonstrated.

Over a nine-month period, approximately 7800 coherent segments have been processed over the polar regions to compute relative height of the ice sheet above the WGS84 reference ellipsoid under grazing angle geometries. The retrieval of surface height is based on using ionosphere-free phase measurements from both the direct and reflected signals. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) were used for the relative height adjustment and the validation of the GG-R retrievals, which presented a root mean square error (RMSE) of similar to 1.7 m for both regions. Furthermore, the collocated GG-R profiles manifest good agreement among each other and reveal systematic behavior in the height residuals that might be caused by the DEMs. The results presented in this study demonstrate the potential of dual-frequency GG-R for measuring ice sheet surface heights.', '[Buendia, Raquel N.; Tabibi, Sajad] Univ Luxembourg, Fac Sci Technol & Med, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.

Twenty-nine locations in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago are used to develop and test the methodology. The daily ScatSat-1 sigma-nought backscatter composite product with a spatial resolution of 2.216 km is used. Vertical (VV) and horizontal (HH) polarizations of these data are used to derive the co-polarized ratio (VV/HH). An increase in VV/HH is associated with an increase in melt pond fraction on the sea ice. This occurs because there is a larger increase in resonant Bragg scattering for VV than for HH when melt pond surfaces exhibit wind-generated capillary waves. VV backscatter magnitude is evaluated in time series using a peak-finding methodology to initiate detection of melt ponds with VV/HH. The peak-finding is based on geophysical controls on backscatter from snow-covered sea ice during the melt season. Daily time-series data from ScatSat-1 are used in conjunction with ERA-5 reanalysis data (2-m air temperature and wind) and a semiempirical snowmelt model. Air temperature data are used to identify snow melt onset and to force the snowmelt model. Wind data are used to evaluate if the wind speed is sufficient for capillary wave formation. The NSCAT4DS geophysical model function is used to model Ku-band backscatter from water, which is then used in a sea ice mixture model to simulate the VV/HH magnitude for a range of pond fractions and wind speeds. The potential for detecting pond onset is evaluated in relation to the noise inherent in the ScatSat-1 VV/HH sea ice measurements, which is found to be approximately 0.16 dB. When the melt pond fraction is sufficiently large to cause VV/HH to exceed the noise, pond onset is detected. Cloud-free Sentinel-2 optical satellite imagery is used for validation; specifically, the near-infrared albedo. We find an overall mean bias of -0.5 days, and an absolute deviation of 1.4 days, when comparing our method to a near-infrared method for detecting pond onset. The mean biases (absolute deviations) for first-year and multiyear sea ice are -0.3 (1.5) and -0.8 (1.2) days, respectively. Results show that the temporal resolution, spatial resolution, and efficacy of this method can provide robust sea ice melt pond onset timing for landfast sea ice regions of the Arctic.', '[Geldsetzer, Torsten; Yackel, John; Tomar, Kiledar Singh; Mahmud, Mallik; Nandan, Vishnu] Univ Calgary, Dept Geog, Calgary, AB, Canada.

However, most flooded crop monitoring methods based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery were developed for rice, which is probably inappropriate for crops with complex canopy structures that strongly attenuate SAR signals. Additionally, these methods often rely on empirical thresholds and region-specific reference samples, limiting their reliability and applicability on a larger spatial scale. To address these issues, we developed a novel flooded crop mapping approach at a regional scale using Sentinel-1 time-series data and an unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Our approach leverages a Flood Separability Index (FSI) derived from the fitted prob-ability density function of flooded and non-flooded crop areas in a GMM. This allows us to overcome the limi-tations of manual input selection in previous studies. The multi-temporal GMM was constructed using the time-series images with optimal polarization to estimate the flooded crop extents on a regional scale. We also investigated the scattering mechanisms of three typical crop disaster structures within an agricultural landscape area. Our results indicate that the proposed multi-temporal GMM is robust in crop planting areas with complex canopy structures. The performance of both single-temporal and multi-temporal GMMs surpasses that of baseline methods such as Otsu and K-means. Compared with VV polarization, VH polarization exhibits greater potential for accurately mapping flooded crops in complex agricultural regions. Our approach does not require labeled samples or many predefined parameters, making it fast and feasible for mapping flooded crops with complex canopy structures in large spatial areas.', '[Guan, Haixiang; Huang, Jianxi; Li, Li; Li, Xuecao; Miao, Shuangxi; Su, Wei; Niu, Quandi; Huang, Hai] China Agr Univ, Coll Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.

The algorithm takes advantage of the high-resolution (-10 [m]) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter and coarse resolution modeled/ reanalysis soil moisture products (-9 [km]) to create a high-resolution (200 [m]) soil moisture product at a global extent. The end goal of the algorithm is to remove dependencies on any complex modeling, tedious retrieval steps, or multiple ancillary data needs, and subsequently decrease the degrees of freedom to achieve optimal accuracy in soil moisture retrievals. The use of modeled/reanalysis soil moisture products with high temporal resolution gives an added advantage in reducing the temporal mismatch between the two different inputs used in the algorithm. In this study, the proposed algorithm is tested using L-band UAVSAR backscatter (& sigma;degrees) data and Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) SAR & sigma;degrees as a substitute for the NISAR L-band SAR observations. The algorithm uses the L-band SAR & sigma;degrees to disaggregate coarse resolution (-9 [km]) reanalysis soil moisture of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) to a high-resolution of-200 [m] soil moisture product. The potential of the algorithm is demonstrated over three sites in different hydro climatic regions of the world, such as India, the USA, and Canada. The high-resolution soil moisture estimates were compared with the in-situ soil moisture measurements available for three sites (North India, Southern California, and Carman, Manitoba, Canada). In North India, in-situ measurements are from paddy crops with high vegetation water content, the unbiased root-mean-square-error (ubRMSE) for the high-resolution soil moisture retrievals was found to be 0.036 [m3/m3] with a bias of-0.051 [m3/m3]. For the southern California site, the validation statistics shows low ubRMSE of 0.027 [m3/m3] and a low bias of 0.016 [m3/m3]. At the Carman, Manitoba test site of Canada, where in-situ soil measurements were available for multiple crop types, the comparison shows that the ubRMSE for all the crop types lies below 0.05 [m3/m3] with an average bias of <0.07 [m3/m3]. The result confirms that the proposed algorithm meets the NISAR mission\'s accuracy goals, i.e., 0.06 [m3/m3] ubRMSE over areas with vegetation water content (VWC) below 5 [kg/m2]. Rigorous validation work will still need to be carried out in the future based on the availability of L-band SAR datasets and after the launch of the NISAR satellite.', '[Lal, Preet; Singh, Gurjeet; Das, Narendra N.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.

Foundational to these patterns is the subtle (1-2 K) thermal behavior, which is easily overlooked using lower spatial resolution data. In preparation for these new data, we conducted the first study using the entire twenty-two-year archive of higher spatial, lower temporal resolution TIR data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) sensor. This archive presents a unique opportunity to quantify low-magnitude temperature anomalies and small plumes over long time periods. We developed a new statistical algorithm to automatically detect the full range of thermal activity and applied it to >5000 ASTER scenes of five volcanoes with well-documented eruptions. Unique to this algorithm is its ability to use both day and night data, account for clouds, quantify accurate background temperatures, and dynamically scale depending on the anomaly size. Results improve upon those from the more commonly used lower spatial resolution data, despite the less frequent temporal coverage of ASTER, and show that high spatial resolution TIR data are equally as effective. Significantly, the smaller, subtle thermal detections served as precursory signals in -81% of eruptions, and the algorithm\'s results create a framework for classifying future eruptive styles.', '[Ramsey, Michael S.; Thompson, James O.; Leggett, Tyler N.] Dept Geol & Environm Sci Pittsburgh, 4107 OHara St, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.

Expanding the area of cashew plantations and increasing productivity are critical to improving the livelihood of many smallholder communities. As the third largest cashew producer in Africa, Benin has nearly 200,000 smallholder cashew growers contributing 15% of the country\'s national export earnings. Expansion of the cashew industry is thus an essential economic driver and a governmental priority in Benin. However, a lack of information on where and how cashew trees grow across the country hinders decision-making that could support increased cashew production and poverty alleviation. By leveraging 2.4-m Planet Basemaps and 0.5-m aerial imagery, two newly developed deep learning algorithms, and large-scale ground truth datasets, we successfully produced the first-of-its-kind national map of cashew in Benin and characterized the expansion of cashew plantations between 2015 and 2021. In particular, we developed a SpatioTemporal Classification with Attention (STCA) model to map the distribution of cashew plantations with 2.4-m multi-temporal Planet Basemaps from 2019 to 2021, which can fully capture texture information from discriminative time steps during a growing season. The U-Net model was employed to map the distribution of cashew plantation with 0.5-m mono-temporal aerial imagery in 2015, which can achieve accurate and fast predictions even with limited training data. We further developed a Clustering Augmented Self-supervised Temporal Classification (CASTC) model to distinguish high-density versus low-density cashew plantations by automatic feature extraction and optimized clustering. Results show that the STCA model has an overall accuracy over 85% based on 1400 ground truth point samples from each year. The CASTC model achieved an overall accuracy of 76% based on 348 ground truth samples of planting density. We found that the cashew area in Benin has almost doubled to 519 & PLUSMN; 20 kha from 2015 to 2021 with 60% of new plantation development coming from cropland or fallow land, while encroachment of cashew plantations into protected areas has increased by 55%. Only about half of cashew plantations were high-density in 2021, suggesting high potential for intensification. Our study illustrates the power of combining highresolution remote sensing imagery and state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to better understand tree crops in the heterogeneous smallholder landscape, which can help efficiently allocate limited training and nursery resources for sustainable agricultural development.', '[Yin, Leikun; Lin, Chenxi; Zhou, Junxiong; Till, Jessica; You, Nanshan; Jin, Zhenong] Univ Minnesota, Dept Bioprod & Biosyst Engn, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.

Surface topography influences the at-sensor radiance measurement, making precise topography modeling critical in applications like vegetation or snow studies in mountainous terrain. Currently, elevation maps are used to derive topographic variables such as the slope and sky-view factor. This process is error-prone since static global digital elevation models do not generally achieve the accuracy required, and even minor mismatches in spatial resolution can introduce significant artifacts in downstream processing. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to estimate topographic parameters directly from spectral data, ensuring perfect physical consistency, temporal coincidence, and spatial alignment. We present experiments estimating topographic slope in two scenes in Southern California, with data from NASA\'s Next Generation Airborne Visible/Near Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG). We compared our radiance-based estimates against high-resolution lidar datasets. Our initial validation result showed a correlation of R2 = 0.864 (n = 160) over the homogeneous surface of Beckman Auditorium\'s cone-shaped roof on the Caltech campus in Pasadena, California. We then validate the model over a larger study site near Santa Clarita, California, finding R2 = 0.923 (n = 40, 000) in a 350 x 350 m area.

Understand-ing how phytoplankton are responding to climate change is consequently a major question in Earth Sciences. Monitoring phytoplankton is key to answering this question. Satellite remote sensing of ocean colour is our only means of monitoring phytoplankton in the entire surface ocean at high temporal and large spatial scales, and the continuous ocean-colour data record is now approaching a length suitable for addressing questions around climate change, at least in some regions. Yet, developing ocean-colour algorithms for climate change studies requires addressing issues of ambiguity in the ocean-colour signal. For example, for the same chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) of phytoplankton, the colour of the ocean can be different depending on the type of phytoplankton present. One route to tackle the issue of ambiguity is by enriching the ocean-colour data with information on sea surface temperature (SST), a good proxy of changes in three phytoplankton size classes (PSCs) independent of changes in total Chl-a, a measure of phytoplankton biomass. Using a global surface in -situ dataset of HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) pigments, size-fractionated filtration data, and concurrent satellite SST spanning from 1991 to 2021, we re-tuned, validated and advanced an SST-dependent three-component model that quantifies the relationship between total Chl-a and Chl-a associated with the three PSCs (pico-, nano-and microplankton). Similar to previous studies, striking dependencies between model parameters and SST were captured, which were found to improve model performance significantly. These relationships were applied to 40 years of monthly composites of satellite SST, and significant trends in model parameters were observed globally, in response to climate warming. Changes in these parameters highlight issues in estimating long-term trends in phytoplankton biomass (Chl-a) from ocean colour using standard empirical algorithms, which implicitly assume a fixed relationship between total Chl-a and Chl-a of the three size classes. The proposed ecological model will be at the centre of a new ocean-colour modelling framework, designed for investigating the response of phytoplankton to climate change, described in subsequent parts of this series of papers.', '[Sun, Xuerong; Brewin, Robert J.

Therefore, developing high-resolution assessments of snow cover change is crucial for estimating the impact of changing snow cover on watershed and ecosystems processes in cold regions. Remote sensing tools provide a powerful method for mapping snowcovered area (SCA) across a landscape. The most common method for estimating SCA utilizes the normalized difference snow index (NDSI), which relies on spectral measurements in the shortwave-infrared wavelengths (SWIR). NDSI can effectively estimate catchment- to regional-scale SCA, but it cannot be used to assess fine-scale SCA because of current limitations on the spatial resolution of satellite-derived SWIR measurements. Here, we map SCA using a threshold of blue wavelengths and high-resolution satellite imagery. The thresholding method, which we call the Blue Snow Threshold algorithm (BST), has previously been used with digital camera imagery. We refine and automate the algorithm for use with cloud-free high-resolution satellite imagery and find that the BST can be used to assess fine-scale SCA. For validation, we compared BST-derived estimates of SCA to a) airborne lidar surveys, b) Landsat fractional SCA, and c) snow disappearance dates from Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations. When compared to airborne lidar surveys of SCA, the BST predicted SCA had a range of Fscores between 0.81 and 0.94 in four study areas in California and Colorado. We also found general agreement between SCA and snow disappearance at multiple SNOTEL sites across the western United States. Given the relatively recent availability of high-resolution satellite imagery with spectral measurements in the visible wavelengths but lacking in SWIR, the BST offers a reliable and easy-to-apply tool for examining fine-scale snowrelated processes.', '[Thaler, Evan A.; Crumley, Ryan L.; Bennett, Katrina E.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci Div, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.', 'United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National LaboratoryRP Thaler, EA (通讯作者)，Los Alamos Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci Div, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.', 'thaler.evan@gmail.com', NULL, 'Department of Energy Office of Science, Office of Biological and   Environmental Research through Next Generation Ecosystem Experiment   (NGEE) Arctic project', 'We thank three anonymous reviewers and the editor, Menghua Wang, whose   comments significantly improved the manuscript.

However, the relationship between GPP and SIF observed by sensors (SIFobs) is affected by the solar-target-viewing geometry. Although the effects of viewing geometry on SIFobs and its relationship with GPP have been recognized, solar geometry effects on SIFobs have been ignored and less studied in recent decades. This study used SIFobs from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) and the TROPO-spheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) to investigate solar geometry effects on GPP-SIFobs relationships at the diurnal scale. Furthermore, we derived total canopy SIF emission (SIFtotal) that should be insensitive to solar-target-viewing geometry in theory. Our results indicated that SIFtotal can effectively mitigate solar geometry effects on SIFobs (including SIF observed at nadir, SIFnadir) and its relationship with GPP from six flux towers. After mitigating the solar angle effects in OCO-3 SIFnadir, the correlation (R2) with GPP increased from 0.73 to 0.87 for SIFnadir to 0.84-0.95 for SIFtotal. The correlations between TROPOMI SIFobs and GPP at three high-latitude sites were also clearly improved by TROPOMI SIFtotal. In addition, the diurnal pattern of SIFtotal was more consistent with that of GPP compared to SIFnadir or SIFobs. This study aims to reveal solar geometry effects on SIF measurements, which should be considered when studying the SIF-GPP relationship especially at the diurnal scale with large variations in solar geometry.', '[Zhang, Zhaoying; Zhang, Yongguang] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Resou, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

However, savannas are changing rapidly due to climate change, fire, animal management, and intense fuelwood harvesting. In southern Africa, large trees (>5 m in height) are under threat while shrub cover (<3 m) is increasing. The collection of multi-date airborne LiDAR (ALS) data, initiated over a decade ago in the Lowveld of South Africa, provided a rare opportunity to quantify the ability of L-band SAR to track changes in savanna vegetation structure and this study is the first to do so, to our knowledge. The objective was to test the ability of ALOS PALSAR 1&2, dual-pol (HH, HV) data to quantify woody cover and volume change in savannas over 2-, 8-and 10-year periods through comparison to ALS. For each epoch (2008, 2010, 2018), multiple PALSAR images were processed to Gamma0 (gamma 0) at 15 m resolution with multi-temporal speckle filtering. ALS data were processed to fractional canopy cover and volume, and then compared to 5 x 5 aggregated (75 m) SAR mean gamma 0. The ALS cover change (Delta CALS) and volume change between pairs of years were highly correlated, with (R2 > 0.8), thus results for cover change applied equally to volume change. Cover change was predicted using (i) direct backscatter change or (ii) the difference between annual cover map product derived using the Bayesian Water Cloud Model (BWCM) and logarithmic models. The linear relationship between Delta gamma 0 and Delta CALS varied between year pairs but reached a maximum R2 of 0.7 for 2018-2010 and a moderate R2 of 0.4 for 2018-2008. Overall, 1 dB Delta gamma 0 corresponded to approximately 0.1 cover change. The three cover change models had very similar uncertainties with mean RMSE = 0.15, which is 13% of the observed cover change range (-0.6 to +0.6). The direct backscatter change approach had less underestimation of positive and negative cover change. The L -band backscatter had a higher sensitivity than suggested by previous studies, as it was able to reliably distinguish cover change at 0.25 increments. The SAR-derived cover change maps detected the loss of stands of big trees, and widespread increases in cover of 0.35-0.65 in communal rangelands due to shrub encroachment. In contrast, the maps suggest that cover generally decreased in conservation areas, forming distinct fence-line effects, potentially caused by significant increases in elephant numbers and frequent, intense wildfires in reserves.', '[Wessels, Konrad; Li, Xiaoxuan] George Mason Univ, Dept Geog & GeoInformat Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.

This study presents a band shape fitting (BSF) approach to retrieve both the relative optical path length (deepening) and SIF (infilling) from field measurements at the same time, using information in the measured spectral shape of the O2 feature. This approach is an alternative to using radiative transfer process models for estimating atmospheric transmittance.

However, the usability of these flags has not been sufficiently studied to date. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of atmospheric scattering, the presence of snow, canopy cover, terrain slope, beam strength, and solar angle on the accuracy of terrain and canopy height of the ATL08 product as well as on providing recommendations on how to filter data in order to minimize errors. We evaluated the vertical accuracy of ATL08 terrain and canopy height in European mountains by comparing them with the digital terrain model and canopy height model derived from airborne laser scanning data. Our results indicate that the assessment of atmospheric effects using the cloud confidence flag (cloud_-flag_atm; i.e. number of cloud layers) is better than the previously used multiple scattering warning flag (msw_flag). Day acquisitions with more than one layer of clouds yielded a terrain elevation RMSE of 3.22 m in forests while night acquisitions with no more than a single layer of clouds resulted in RMSE of 1.73 m. The increasing atmospheric scattering effects increased the photons\' path length, resulting in terrain height under-estimation. The presence of snow had a strong positive effect on the number of identified ground photons, independently of the canopy cover, but resulted in an overestimation of terrain height in higher altitudes. Accordingly, the presence of snow cover resulted in a significant underestimation of canopy height in forests. The canopy height in broadleaf/mixed as well as coniferous forests was in summer underestimated on average by 2.1 m (%ME of-15.3%) and 1.2 m (%ME of-8.2%), respectively; in winter, however, the underestimation increased to 8.5 m (%ME of-56.8%) and 5.7 m (%ME of-38.3%), respectively. Canopy height estimates had better accuracy for the strong beam (RMSE of 5.09 m; %RMSE of 35.4%) than for the weak beam (RMSE of 7.03 m; %RMSE of 51.3%). Our results show that the ATL08 terrain height accuracy decreases with uneven distribution of signal photons within individual segments and further deteriorates with increasing terrain slope. Filtering out segments with poor distribution of photons, more than one layer of clouds during the day, and snow cover in high altitudes is the best approach for minimizing the error while maximizing the number of segments left for subsequent analysis.', '[Moudry, Vitezslav; Gdulova, Katerina; Gabor, Lukas; Sarovcova, Eliska; Bartak, Vojtech; Leroy, Francois; Spatenkova, Olga; Rocchini, Duccio; Prosek, Jiri] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Spatial Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500, Suchdol, Czech Republic.

Proposed approaches often rely on the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH), linking the heterogeneity of terrestrial vegetation to the variability of the spectroradiometric signals. Yet, due to observational limitations, the SVH has been insufficiently tested, remaining unclear which metrics, methods, and sensors could provide the most reliable estimates of plant biodiversity. Here we assessed the po-tential of RS to infer plant biodiversity using radiative transfer simulations and inversion. We focused specifically on \"functional diversity,\" which represents the spatial variability in plant functional traits. First, we simulated vegetation communities and evaluated the information content of different functional diversity metrics (FDMs) derived from their optical reflectance factors (R) or the corresponding vegetation \"optical traits,\" estimated via radiative transfer model inversion. Second, we assessed the effect of the spatial resolution, the spectral char-acteristics of the sensor, and signal noise on the relationships between FDMs derived from field and remote sensing datasets. Finally, we evaluated the plausibility of the simulations using Sentinel-2 (multispectral, 10 m pixel) and DESIS (hyperspectral, 30 m pixel) imagery acquired over sites of the Functional Significance of Forest Biodiversity in Europe (FunDivEUROPE) network. We demonstrate that functional diversity can be inferred both by reflectance and optical traits. However, not all the FDMs tested were suited for assessing plant functional diversity from RS. Rao\'s Q index, functional dispersion, and functional richness were the best-performing metrics. Furthermore, we demonstrated that spatial resolution is the most limiting RS feature. In agreement with simu-lations, Sentinel-2 imagery provided better estimates of plant diversity than DESIS, despite the coarser spectral resolution. However, Sentinel-2 offered inaccurate results at DESIS spatial resolution. Overall, our results identify the strengths and weaknesses of optical RS to monitor plant functional diversity. Future missions and biodiversity products should consider and benefit from the identified potentials and limitations of the SVH.', '[Pacheco-Labrador, Javier; Migliavacca, Mirco; Carvalhais, Nuno; Weber, Ulrich; Wirth, Christian] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Hans Knoll Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany.

PSI has shown its superior capability to monitor linear features with long-distance and large-span characteristics. Nevertheless, the interpretation of estimated displacements over PS is a challenge to overcome. Here, we propose a target characterization approach for multi-epoch InSAR post-processing to efficiently correlate the target\'s possible deformation types and corresponding deformation characteristics. The PS targets were categorized into elevated (ELV) and ground (GRD) groups. The deformation signals are assigned into four types: Defo-Type I stable, Defo-Type II shallow, Defo-Type III structural, and Defo-Type IV mixed deformation based on the ELV versus GRD differential motion estimation. Our approach is demonstrated over the metro network of Shanghai city, China using High-resolution TerraSAR-X data. The seven-year displacements map along Shanghai metro lines estimated by PSI shows that 85% of the points are relatively stable, while only 0.07% exhibits a significant deformation trend. We performed the stability evaluation along the subway by incorporating velocity, cumulative and relative deformation. It was found that the lines that have been operated for a long time are relatively stable, and obvious deformations were observed on the newly built lines and the extension sections of existing lines. By interpreting deformation types, We inferred that the displacements along metro lines mainly corresponded to Defo-Type II, and the areas with obvious deformation involve the superposition of multiple deformation types.', '[Yang, Mengshi] Yunnan Univ, Scool Earth Sci, Kunming 650500, Peoples R China.

It is designed to overcome some limitations in existing Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) inversion methods, including the high dimensionality of the inverse problem, the convergence problem due to possible equifinality, and the dependence of some RTM variables on the crop-specific architecture. The PROSAIL model is first inverted in a calibration step using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm over a global dataset of ground GAI measurements (for maize, wheat, and rice) and the corresponding reflectance observations from Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Quickbird to derive crop-specific distributions of PROSAIL input variables. These distributions were then used as prior information to predict GAI over an independent set of reflectance observations. Results show that the full Bayesian approach provides close estimates of GAI to ground truth, with respective Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.01, 1.33, and 0.97 for maize, wheat, and rice (R-2=0.67, 0.76 and 0.63, respectively). The performances are better than those approaches generally reported using radiative transfer models that are non-crop-specific, like the SNAP algorithm for Sentinel-2, but are slightly behind the purely empirical models based on machine learning. However, the proposed approach provides an explicit insight of the joint distribution of PROSAIL variables that are valid for any satellite platform. This constitutes a major advantage against purely empirical models, as it enables to fully exploit large observational datasets from multiple sensors and generalize to other platforms.', '[Wang, Jingwen; Zhang, Jiahua] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Key Lab Digital Earth Sci, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.

LUI is a major driver for numerous environmental processes and indicators, such as primary production, nitrogen deposition and resil-ience to climate extremes. However, large extent, high resolution data on grassland LUI is rare. New satellite generations, such as Copernicus Sentinel-2, enable a spatially comprehensive detection of the mainly subtle changes induced by land-use intensification by their fine spatial and temporal resolution. We developed a methodology quantifying key parameters of grassland LUI such as grazing intensity, mowing frequency and fertiliser application across Germany using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on Sentinel-2 satellite data with 20 m x 20 m spatial resolution. Subsequently, these land-use components were used to calculate a continuous LUI index. Predictions of LUI and its components were validated using comprehensive in situ grassland management data. A feature contribution analysis using Shapley values substantiates the applicability of the methodology by revealing a high relevance of springtime satellite observations and spectral bands related to vegetation health and structure. We achieved an overall classification accuracy of up to 66% for grazing in-tensity, 68% for mowing, 85% for fertilisation and an r2 of 0.82 for subsequently depicting LUI. We evaluated the methodology\'s robustness with a spatial 3-fold cross-validation by training and predicting on geographically distinctly separated regions.

Since changes in the soil and ecosystem of the permafrost active layer are spatially and temporally complex depending on many environmental factors, it is not easy to grasp climate-induced changes occurring in coupled atmospheric-ecological-geocryological systems. To understand the changes in the permafrost active layer, spatially detailed monitoring methods such as multi-spectral optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing technologies have been extensively applied to the permafrost observation. Optical and SAR systems observe different permafrost features due to significant differences in electromagnetic wave frequencies and imaging mechanisms. Therefore, most studies used optical and SAR data separately according to the purpose and characteristics of each study. The objective of this study is to explore the possibility of combined interpretation of optical and SAR data for identifying and understanding spatiotemporal details of the short- and long-term changes occurring in the permafrost active layer. Multi-spectral optical images acquired during the thawing period and L-band polarimetric SAR images acquired during the freezing period are used in this study in order to examine ecological characteristics and cryogenic processes, respectively. The result of analyzing the relationship between information obtained from optical and SAR sensors revealed that there was a significant correlation between winter changes in scattering properties observed in SAR data and summer land cover changes observed in optical data. The scattering characteristics of winter soil were found to be particularly related to the ecosystem changes in areas that can be explained by the thermokarst development process. Additional data from independent sources, such as elevation data, meteorological data, and long-term optical data, consistently supported the relationship between the winter SAR observations and the thermokarst-related ecosystem changes.

SIF quantification is sensitive to the spectral resolution (SR), and its accurate retrieval requires sensors with sub-nanometer resolutions. However, for accurate SIF quantification from imaging sensors onboard airborne platforms, sub-nanometer imagers are costly and more difficult to operate than the commonly available narrow-band imagers (i.e., 4-to 6nm bandwidths), which can also be installed on drones and lightweight aircraft. Although a few theoretical and experimental studies have evaluated narrow-band spectra for SIF quantification, there is a lack of research focused on comparing the effects of the SR on SIF from airborne hyperspectral imagers in practical applications. This study investigates the effects of SR and sensor altitude on SIF accuracy, comparing SIF quantified at the 760nm O-2-A band (SIF760) from two hyperspectral imagers with different spectral configurations (full width at half maximum resolutions of 0.1-0.2 nm and 5.8 nm) flown in tandem on board an aircraft. SIF760 retrievals were compared from two different wheat and maize phenotyping trials grown under different nitrogen fertilizer application rates over the 2019-2021 growing seasons. SIF760 from the two sensors were correlated (R-2 = 0.77-0.9, p < 0.01), with the narrow-band imager producing larger SIF760 estimates than the sub-nanometer imager (root mean square error (RMSE) 3.28-4.69 mW/m(2)/nm/sr). Ground-level SIF760 showed strong relationships with both sub-nanometer (R-2 = 0.90, p < 0.001, RMSE = 0.07 mW/m(2)/nm/sr) and narrow-band (R-2 = 0.88, p < 0.001, RMSE = 3.26 mW/m(2)/nm/sr) airborne retrievals. Simulation-based assessments of SIF760 for SRs ranging from 1 to 5.8 nm using the SCOPE model were consistent with experimental results showing significant relationships among SIF760 quantified at different SRs. Predictive algorithms of leaf nitrogen concentration using SIF760 from either the narrow-band or sub-nanometer sensor yielded similar performance, supporting the use of narrow-band resolution imagery for assessing the spatial variability of SIF in plant phenotyping, vegetation stress detection and precision agriculture contexts.', '[Belwalkar, A.; Poblete, T.; Zarco-Tejada, P.

This is an improved version of MARMIT (multilayer radiative transfer model of soil reflectance) that represents a wet soil as a dry soil topped with a thin layer of liquid water. The changes brought in this article concern the mixing of the spectral reflectance of the dry and wet soil areas, the transmission of diffuse light in the water layer, and the inclusion of soil particles in the water layer. Wet soil reflectance is now expressed in terms of dry soil reflectance and three free parameters: the thickness of the water layer, the surface fraction of the wet soil, and a new parameter, the volume fraction of soil particles in the water layer. With more accurate physical modeling, MARMIT-2 simulates soil spectral reflectance with better accuracy than MARMIT. In particular, the fit of the soil reflectance spectra is much better for high water contents, both in the visible range (0.4-0.7 mu m) and in the water absorption bands around 1.45 mu m and 1.95 mu m.

Optical satellite remote sensing via both active and passive methods plays an important role in monitoring the health of benthic habitats by retrieving benthic reflectance spectra, but it remains difficult to accurately retrieve benthic reflectance spectra from only active or passive remote sensing because of the coupling between water column scattering and benthic reflectance. Here, we developed a semi-analytical model to retrieve benthic reflectance spectra in Case-I waters by combining active lidar and passive high-resolution imagery. Based on two-stream radiative transfer theory, the analytical relationship among the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and water column reflectance (R-w), benthic reflectance (R-b), diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d), and water depth was established. The lidar data at a certain wavelength were applied to derive the water depth and the chlorophyll concentration (chl) along the lidar track. Then, the values of K-d at different wavelengths were estimated from the derived chl. In addition, we established a look-up table (LUT) for the relationship between R-w and chl and water depth using Hydrolight simulation, and the R-w values at different wavelengths were then estimated by the lidar-derived chl and water depth. Finally, R-b(lambda) values at different wavelengths along the lidar track were retrieved from the R-rs(lambda) values observed by passive high-resolution imagery and the values of R-w(lambda), K-d(lambda), and water depth derived by lidar observation. The accuracy of the model was verified by using the Hydrolight simulated datasets, and the high correlation coefficient (R) revealed promising model performance for different benthic habitats, e.g., R > 0.9 for typical clean shallow water (chl = 0.5 mg/m(3), H < 4 m) for the wavelength range of 400-640 nm. The model was further applied to real satellite data from ICESat-2 lidar and passive high-resolution satellite imagery (multispectral imagery of Sentinel-2 and hyperspectral imagery of Zhuhai-1) at two different benthic habitat sites (seagrass beds in Xincun Bay and coral reefs in the Huaguang Reef) in the South China Sea, and the results revealed that the model could reproduce the benthic spectra in both magnitude and shape. Overall, the proposed model can reliably yield benthic reflectance spectra along the lidar track without any requirement on prior knowledge, which should be beneficial for further benthic habitat health monitoring.', '[Wang, Yuxin; He, Xianqiang; Bai, Yan; Wang, Difeng; Zhu, Qiankun; Gong, Fang; Li, Teng] Minist Nat Resources, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Inst Oceanog 2, Hangzhou 310012, Peoples R China.

Acquiring consistent and long time series data on the spatial extent of snow cover doubtlessly plays a key role in our understanding and modeling of the current and future environmental dynamics. Remote sensing offers a powerful tool for continuous retrieval of snow cover information by utilizing snow\'s contrasting reflectance characteristics at optical wavelengths. The pre-operational H35 covers the Northern Hemisphere, and it is the successor of the operational Pan-European H12 daily fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) product at similar to 1 km. Both products are developed through the Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF) project of EUMETSAT by exploiting AVHRR channels. This study is focused on developing an alternative fully data-driven H35 product with improved accuracy using a machine learning (ML) based approach. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) algorithm is trained by using AVHRR reflectance data as well as the well-known snow and vegetation indices (i.e., NDSI and NDVI) to generate the new version of H35 fSCA product. The reference fSCA maps required for the training of MARS models are obtained from the higher resolution Sentinel 2 multispectral imagery. The MARS-based fSCA models are validated against an initial test dataset composed of 15 Sentinel 2 scenes over European Alps, Tatra Mountain Range, and Turkey. The final MARS-H35 product is then rigorously assessed over the whole Northern Hemisphere within a temporal domain spanning from Nov 2018 to Nov 2019. The quantitative testing process involves the use of reference data in both continuous and dichotomous scales: i) Sentinel 2 derived reference fSCA maps, ii) ERA5-Land snow depth data, iii) MODIS MOD10A1 NDSI snow cover data, and finally iv) in-situ snow depth data. Additionally, qualitative assessment is also performed by visually comparing MARS-H35/MODIS false-color and MARS-H35/Sentinel 2-derived reference fSCA image pairs over various geographic regions. The overall results indicate that: i) the proposed MARS-H35 fSCA product overperforms the original H35, and ii) it has higher capability in detecting the fine variations in the extent of snow cover, especially across the fringes of the slopes in complex mountainous terrains.', '[Kuter, Semih] Cankiri Karatekin Univ, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Engn, TR-18200 Cankiri, Turkey.

Farmers use OFRs to store water during the wet season and for crop irrigation during the dry season, yet their seasonal and inter-annual variability and downstream impacts are not quantified. Therefore, OFRs\' sub-weekly surface area changes are critical to understanding their dynamics and mitigating their downstream impacts. However, prior to the recent increase in satellite imagery availability and improvement in sensors\' spatial resolution, monitoring the OFRs\' sub-weekly surface area changes across space and time was challenging because OFRs occur in high numbers (i.e. hundreds) and are small water bodies (50 ha). We propose a novel multi-sensor approach to monitor OFRs surface areas, developed based on 736 OFRs in eastern Arkansas, USA, which leverages the use of PlanetScope (PS), RapidEye (RE), Sentinel 2 (S2), and Sentinel 1 (S1). First, we estimate the uncertainties in surface area for each sensor by comparing the surface area estimates to a validation dataset, and by comparing RE, S2 and S1 to PS-the sensor with the highest spatial resolution (i.e. 3.125 m). Second, we use the uncertainties of each sensor with a data assimilation algorithm based on the Kalman filter to obtain sub-weekly surface area time series for all OFRs. Our results show the lowest uncertainties for PS, followed by RE, S2 and S1. These uncertainties varied according to the OFRs\' size and shape complexities. The surface area estimates derived from the Kalman filter including only the optical sensors resulted in high agreement (r(2) > 0.95) and small uncertainties (4-8%) when compared to the validation dataset. We found higher uncertainties (5-14%) when adding S1 to the Kalman filter-this is related to the higher uncertainties found for S1 (similar to 20%). The algorithm can assimilate optical and radar satellite data to increase the OFRs\' surface area time series cadence allowing us to investigate sub-weekly surface area changes. The algorithm is not sensor-specific, and it accounts for the uncertainties in both the sensors observations and the resulting surface areas, which are key advantages when compared to other algorithms used to combine satellite data. By improving the surface area observations cadence and providing the surface area uncertainties, the approach presented in this study has the potential to enhance water conservation plans by allowing better assessment and management of the OFRs.', '[Perin, Vinicius; Tulbure, Mirela G.; Gaines, Mollie D.] North Carolina State Univ, Ctr Geospatial Analyt, 2800 Faucette Dr, Raleigh, NC 27606 USA.

The emergence of laser scanning, such as Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle Laser Scanning (UAV-LS), has advanced accurate and detailed forest structural measurements. TLS generally provides very accurate measurements on the plot-scale (a few ha), whereas UAV-LS provides comparable measurements on the landscape-scale ( 10 ha). Despite the pivotal role dense tropical forests play in our climate, the strengths and limitations of TLS and UAV-LS to accurately measure structural metrics in these forests remain largely unexplored. Here, we propose to combine TLS and UAV-LS data from dense tropical forest plots to analyse how this fusion can further advance 3D structural mapping of structurally complex forests. We compared stand (vertical point distribution profiles) and tree level metrics from TLS, UAV-LS as well as their fused point cloud. The tree level metrics included the diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height (H), crown projection area (CPA), and crown volume (CV). Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of point density and number of returns for UAV-LS data acquisition. DBH measurements from TLS and UAV-LS were compared to census data. The TLS and UAV-LS based H, CPA and CV measurements were compared to those obtained from the fused point cloud. Our results for two tropical rainforest plots in Australia demonstrate that TLS can measure H, CPA and CV with an accuracy (RMSE) of 0.30 m (H-average =27.32 m), 3.06 m(2) (CPAaverage =66.74 m(2)), and 29.63 m(3) (CVaverage =318.81 m(3)) respectively. UAV-LS measures H, CPA and CV with an accuracy (RMSE) of <0.40 m, <5.50 m(2), and <30.33 m(3) respectively. However, in dense tropical forests single flight UAV-LS is unable to sample the tree stems sufficiently for DBH measurement due to a limited penetration of the canopy. TLS can determine DBH with an accuracy (RMSE) of 5.04 cm, (DBHaverage =45.08 cm), whereas UAV-LS can not. We show that in dense tropical forests stand-alone TLS is able to measure macroscopic structural tree metrics on plot-scale. We also show that UAV-LS can be used to quickly measure H, CPA, and CV of canopy trees on the landscape-scale with comparable accuracy to TLS. Hence, the fusion of TLS and UAV-LS, which can be time consuming and expensive, is not required for these purposes. However, TLS and UAV-LS fusion opens up new avenues to improve stand-alone UAV-LS structural measurements at the landscape scale by applying TLS as a local calibration tool.', '[Terryn, Louise; Calders, Kim; D\'hont, Barbara; Verbeeck, Hans] Univ Ghent, Dept Environm, CAVElab Computat & Appl Vegetat Ecol, Ghent, Belgium.

The variables used in Weibull distribution modeling methods were combined with stand density as response groups to be modeled with ULS metrics. Considering the hierarchical structure of ULS data and the autocorrelation among sub-models, mixed-effects seemingly unrelated regression (SURM) were applied to take into account both spatial and cross-model correlations. The experiments were conducted for 11 sites of larch plantations using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). The diameter distribution was estimated and calibrated by the observed stand density considering the correlations of submodels\' random-effects. The results demonstrated that applying a relatively small number of plots (1 to 6) and estimated best linear predictor (EBLUP) for local calibration could improve the prediction performance. The optimal results were obtained from PRMM with six calibrated plots, and the average Reynolds error index was 45.30. Furthermore, simulation applications with different pulse densities were applied and suggested that calibration could also improve the estimation performance but brought little improvement on estimation stability, far lesser than the impact of point cloud density.

Model wind speeds have limited temporal and spatial resolution, meteorological station wind data are of variable quality and are often not available near observed plumes, and the use of ultrasonic anemometers co-located with methane sources is impractical for AVIRIS-NG flight campaigns with daily coverage of thousands of square kilometers. Given these limitations, this study focused on the use of the Twin Otter Doppler Wind Lidar (TODWL) to measure near surface winds and provide coincident measurements to CH4 plumes observed with AVIRIS-NG. In a controlled release experiment, TODWL observed wind speed and direction agreed well with ultrasonic anemometer measurements and CH4 emission rates derived from TODWL observations were more accurate than those using the ultrasonic anemometer or model winds during periods of stable winds. During periods exhibiting rapid shifts in wind speed and direction, estimating emission rates proved more challenging irrespective of the use of model, ultrasonic anemometer, or TODWL wind data. Overall, TODWL was able to provide reasonably accurate wind measurements and emission rate estimates despite the variable wind conditions and excessive flight level turbulence which impacted near surface measurement density. TODWL observed winds were also used to constrain CH4 emissions at a refinery, landfill, wastewater facility, and dairy digester. At these sites, TODWL wind measurements agreed well with wind observations from nearby meteorological stations, and when combined with quantitative CH4 plume imagery, yielded emission rate estimates that were similar to those obtained using model winds. This study demonstrates the utility of combining TODWL and AVIRIS-NG CH4 measurements and emphasizes the potential benefits of integrating both instruments on a single aircraft for future deployments.', '[Thorpe, Andrew K.; Yadav, Vineet; Duren, Riley M.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.

More than 40% of QTP is covered by permafrost, yet few studies have evaluated the accuracy of SSM and RZSM products derived from microwave satellite, land surface models (LSMs) and reanalysis over that region. This study tries to address this gap by evaluating a range of satellite and reanalysis estimates of SSM and RZSM in the thawed soil overlaying permafrost in the QTP, using in-situ measurements from sixteen stations. Here, seven SSM products were evaluated: Soil Moisture Active Passive L3 (SMAP L3) and L4 (SMAP-L4), Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity in version IC (SMOS IC), Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI), Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), and the fifth generation of the land component of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts atmospheric reanalysis (ERAS-Land). We also evaluated three RZSM products from SMAP-L4, ERA5-Land, and the Noah land surface model driven by Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS-Noah). The assessment was conducted using five statistical metrics, i. e. Pearson correlation coefficient (R), bias, slope, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) between SSM or RZSM products and in-situ measurements. Our results showed that the ESA CCI, SMAP-L4 and SMOS-IC SSM products outperformed the other SSM products, indicated by higher correlation coefficients (R) (with a median R value of 0.63, 0.44 and 0.57, respectively) and lower ubRMSE (with a median ubRMSE value of 0.05, 0.04 and 0.07 m(3)/m(3), respectively). Yet, SSM overestimation was found for all SSM products. This could be partly attributed to ancillary data used in the retrieval (e.g. overestimation of land surface temperature for SMAP-L3) and to the fact that the products (e.g. LPRM) more easily overestimate the in-situ SSM when the soil is very dry. As expected, SMAP-L3 SSM performed better in areas with sparse vegetation than with dense vegetation covers. For RZSM products, SMAP-L4 and GLDAS-Noah (R = 0.66 and 0.44, ubRMSE = 0.03 and 0.02 m(3)/m(3), respectively) performed better than ERAS-Land (R = 0.46; ubRMSE = 0.03 m(3)/m(3)). It is also found that all RZSM products were unable to capture the variations of in-situ RZSM during the freezing/thawing period over the permafrost regions of QTP, due to large deviation for the ice-water phase change simulation and the lack of consideration for unfrozen-water migration during freezing processes in the LSMs.', '[Xing, Zanpin; Zhao, Lin; Hu, Guojie; Xiao, Yao; Du, Erji; Li, Ren; Qiao, Yongping; Shi, Jianzong] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Cryosphere Res Stn Qinghai Xizang Plateau, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.

The accurate quantification of r(a) plays a pivotal role in determining the performance and consistency of thermal remote sensing-based surface energy balance (SEB) models for estimating ET at local to regional scales. Atmospheric stability links r(a) with land surface temperature (LST) and the representation of their interactions in the SEB models determines the accuracy of ET estimates.   The present study investigates the influence of r(a) and its relation to LST uncertainties on the performance of three structurally different SEB models. It used data from nine Australian OzFlux eddy covariance sites of contrasting aridity in conjunction with MODIS Terra and Aqua LST and leaf area index (LAI) products. Simulations of the sensible heat flux (H) and the latent heat flux (LE, the energy equivalent of ET in W/m(2)) from the SPARSE (Soil Plant Atmosphere and Remote Sensing Evapotranspiration), SEBS (Surface Energy Balance System) and STIC (Surface Temperature Initiated Closure) models forced with MODIS LST, LAI, and in-situ meteorological datasets were evaluated against flux observations in water-limited (arid and semi-arid) and energy-limited (mesic) ecosystems from 2011 to 2019.   Our results revealed an overestimation tendency of instantaneous LE by all three models in the water-limited shrubland, woodland and grassland ecosystems by up to 50% on average, which was caused by an underestimation of H. Overestimation of LE was associated with discrepancies in r(a) retrievals under conditions of high atmospheric instability, during which uncertainties in LST (expressed as the difference between MODIS LST and in-situ LST) apparently played a minor role. On the other hand, a positive difference in LST coincided with low r(a) (high wind speeds) and caused a slight underestimation of LE at the water-limited sites. The impact of r(a) on the LE residual error was found to be of the same magnitude as the influence of LST uncertainties in the semi-arid ecosystems as indicated by variable importance in projection (VIP) coefficients from partial least squares regression above unity. In contrast, our results for the mesic forest ecosystems indicated minor dependency on r(a) for modelling LE (VIP < 0.4), which was due to a higher roughness length and lower LST resulting in the dominance of mechanically generated turbulence, thereby diminishing the importance of buoyancy production for the determination of r(a).', '[Trebs, Ivonne; Mallick, Kaniska; Sulis, Mauro] Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Res & Innovat, Belvaux, Luxembourg.

The SAR mode focusses and coherently sums all radar return echoes within the 2-s time window the target surface area is in the antenna beam. In principle the SAR processing improves along-track resolution. Land contamination has been a major concern for inland waters altimetry and SAR can reduce land interference. This paper shows that the physics of specular echoes from smooth inland waters leads to a very different approach which we call precise inland surface altimetry (PISA). PISA uses only echoes within the specular \"flash\" period, which is approximately the time the satellite nadir crosses over the water body. The processing is four orders of magnitude less than SAR. Land interference is negligible because specular water echoes are usually >50 dB greater than land. Sentinel-3 SRAL dataset on the salar de Uyuni (Bolivia) is used to evaluate PISA ranging precision. During inundation (wet months), echoes are at the theoretical maximum radar cross section (RCS), sigma = 129 dBsm, and ranging precision is -1 mm. In dry months the echoes are quasi-specular, with sigma = 70-100 dBsm, and ranging precision is -1 cm. The precision assessment is made with variate-differences, with pass-to-pass repeatability, and by comparison with GPS measurements. In addition to the salar de Uyuni analysis we gathered sigma statistics on five millions Sentinel-3 SRAL Ku-band altimeter bursts (one burst = 64 contiguous echoes) from 52 passes of Sentinel-3A track 167 over South America. We illustrate specular and quasi-specular waters on lakes, a river, and a fjord. Ranging precision is similar to Uyuni, in the 1 mm-1 cm range. Water surface slopes of 1-3 cm/km are detected. We propose a simple rule-set to distinguish specular waveforms (sigma >100 dBsm, sidelobes (with Hamming window) of -37 dB or lower) and quasi-specular (sigma >70 dBsm, sidelobes lower than -20 dB), and non-specular (sidelobes> - 20 dB).

However, most traditional methods employed by the remote sensing community estimate T-dm by averaging the - usually few - observed cloud-free land surface temperatures (LSTs). Such estimates can have large sampling bias, especially for tandem polar orbiters, due to their sparse sampling of diurnal LST dynamics and the unavailability of under-cloud LSTs. To estimate accurate T-dm based on thermal observations from tandem polar orbiters, here we propose a simple yet robust framework that combines the annual temperature cycle (ATC) and the diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) models (termed the ADTC-based framework). The ATC model is used to reconstruct daily instantaneous undercloud LSTs, based on which the DTC model is employed to establish diurnally continuous LST dynamics for estimating T-dm. The proposed framework is validated with geostationary LST observations and in-situ thermal measurements under both cloud-free and overcast conditions. The validations show that, under cloud-free conditions, the ADTC-based framework is able to reduce the positive sampling bias obtained with simple averaging (> 2.0 K) and yields a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 0.5 K. Under overcast conditions, the ADTC-based framework yields MAEs of 1.0 K and 0.5 K at the daily and monthly scales, respectively. Furthermore, a contribution analysis indicates that the ATC model reduces the MAE from around 4.2 K to 2.0 K while the DTC model reduces the MAE from around 2.0 K to 1.0 K. Based on our validation results and tests performed with MODIS data, the presented simple yet robust ADTC-based framework is able to accurately estimate large-scale spatiotemporally continuous T-dm from thermal observations of tandem polar orbiters. Therefore, the ADTC-based framework is a potentially valuable tool for many related applications.', '[Hong, Falu; Zhan, Wenfeng; Lai, Jiameng; Liu, Zihan; Huang, Fan; Li, Jiufeng] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Geog Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

This was accomplished through machine learning of historical land cover information, paired with a time-series of multi-spectral satellite imagery composites spanning the growing season, to develop rulesets, which were used for real-time prediction in the current year. Specifically, a decade\'s worth of annual 30 m resolution crop specific maps, known as the Cropland Data Layer (CDL), provided the foundation, and prior and current year\'s satellite imagery from Landsat 7 and 8 and Sentinel-2a and-2b built upon it. Four modeling scenarios, all using random forests, were performed to understand the crop mapping abilities of the datasets independently and combined. They were 1) use of CDLs only (i.e. prediction based solely on crop rotation history) 2) use of Landsat 7 and 8 bottom-of-atmosphere surface reflectance imagery only, 3) use of Sentinel-2a and-2b top-of-atmosphere imagery only, and 4) integration of the CDL, Landsat, and Sentinel-2 information together in a unified effort. Furthermore, the model runs were generated monthly, beginning in April, through the growing season to provide understanding of classification performance as a function of time. The 2020 crop year, relatively normal in terms of planting and weather, was used for the test. Accuracy statistics were generated by randomly sampling 50 counties and comparing those classification outputs to the actual 2020 CDL. Pixel-level results showed that prediction by midsummer using only the CDL information provided a crop type map with corn and soybean consumer and producer agreement above 70% and winter wheat just below 50%. The early season imagery-based classifications were markedly worse. However, as Landsat or Sentinel-2 imagery accumulated through July, those classifications became significantly better than those reliant on the use of the CDL information only. Ultimately, the very best crop maps resulted from integrating the CDLs with a full season\'s worth of Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery. At that point in late September, the corn and soybean agreements were around 85% and winter wheat near 70%. All analysis was performed within Google Earth Engine cloud-based public imagery repository and high-performance computing system.

Due to significant vertical heterogeneity of tree crowns, empirical remote sensing methods or one-dimensional (1D) radiative transfer (RT) models are not qualified enough to accurately retrieve the damage level of PSB damage. Therefore, three-dimensional (3D) RT models which have the ability to describe vertically complex heterogeneous canopies are more suitable for the damaged forests. In this study, shoot dieback ratio (SDR) was used to parameterize the Radiosity Applicable to Porous IndiviDual Objects (RAPID) model, in order to accurately estimate the PSB damage. Specifically, the vertically heterogeneous characteristics of the biophysical and optical properties within the canopy were carefully considered. First, we developed an approach to reconstruct damaged forest scenes through individual tree segmentation from UAVlidar data and in situ measurements. Second, the simulated reflectance of forest scenes was compared with the actual hyperspectral and Sentinel-2 (S2) reflectance data to evaluate the performance of the parameterized RAPID. Then, the parameterized RAPID model was used to create a look-up table (LUT) containing the leaf chlorophyll content (Cab), effective leaf area index (LAIe), SDR, and dead needles LAIe (LAIdead, LAIe x SDR) as well as the corresponding simulated canopy reflectance. Furthermore, tree allometric equations were used to regularize the LUT with the intention to improve the estimation accuracy. Good agreement (RMSE: 0.015-0.031, index of agreement: 0.97-0.99) was found between the simulated reflectance and the remote sensing observations. The retrieval accuracy of the biochemical and biophysical parameters using S2 data yielded R2 = 0.55 (normalized RMSE (NRMSE) = 19%) for Cab, R2 = 0.70 (NRMSE = 15%) for the LAIe, R2 = 0.66 (NRMSE = 25%) for SDR, and R2 = 0.82 (NRMSE = 18%) for LAIdead. Using hyperspectral data with higher spatial and spectral resolution yielded better retrieval performance.

Coarse-resolution imagery such as MODIS are widely used for crop type mapping due to their short revisit cycles, which is advantageous for detecting the seasonal dynamics of different crop types. However, the inherently low spatial resolution may restrict their utility for mapping crop types in regions with heterogeneous agricultural landscapes. Agricultural statistics, which provide crop acreage information at different spatial and temporal scales, have the potential to improve crop type mapping from remote sensing. Yet, previous studies have often used agricultural statistics as reference data to evaluate the accuracy of satellitederived crop type maps but have rarely utilized them to improve crop type distribution mapping. The utility of integrating agricultural statistics with satellite images to produce high-accuracy crop type maps is rarely explored. This study presents a methodology for mapping sub-pixel crop type distributions via the integration of MODIS time series and agricultural statistics. We tested our approach in Heilongjiang Province, which has the highest agricultural production in China. First, we used an optimized random forest regression (RF-r) model with training samples derived from high spatial resolution images (i.e. SPOT and Landsat) to predict the sub-pixel crop type distributions from MODIS time series. To optimize the RF-r model, an 8-day MODIS time series of five vegetation indices in 2011 were used as the candidate independent variables, and a backward feature elimination strategy was implemented to select the best variables for model prediction. Second, we developed an Iterative Area Gap Spatial Allocation (IAGSA) method to spatially reconcile the discrepancies between the crop acreage estimated from MODIS-based maps and the agricultural statistics. We found that the MODIS-derived crop fractions agreed with those derived from the high-resolution images, with R2 > 0.75 for all crop types, yet there was a clear discrepancy between the crop acreage estimated from MODIS and agricultural statistics. The subpixel crop type maps adjusted by IAGSA were not only consistent with the agricultural statistics for crop acreage, but also retained the spatial distribution patterns of the original MODIS-derived crop fraction. Our results suggest the advantages of integrating coarse-resolution images and agricultural statistics to map sub-pixel crop type distributions, and to provide consistent estimation of crop acreage. The presented methodology has the potential to map large-scale crop type extent across regions in a cost-effective way.', '[Hu, Qiong] Cent China Normal Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Key Lab Geog Proc Anal & Simulat Hubei Prov, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

Yet, the accurate estimation of leaf water content using multi-angular reflectance measurements across different plant species is still challenging. This study aims to propose a generic spectral index for accurately estimating equivalent water thickness (EWT) when multi-angular spectral reflection is considered. The index was selected to have the format of a difference ratio using three reflectance factors. The reflectance factor at 410 nm was used to reduce the specular reflection from the leaf surface in the 400-2500 nm range, and the ratio of the wavelengths in the 1268-1285 nm range (at non-water absorption wavelengths) to the wavelengths in the 1339-1346 nm range (at water absorption wavelengths) strengthened the relationship with EWT for all of the sampled plant species. The modified difference ratio (MDR) index, (R-1271-R-410)/(R-1342-R-410), was linearly proportional to EWT, with R-2 > 0.90, when the leaves reflection data were collected from various viewing angles. However, the relationships between some existing indices (simple difference, simple ratio, normalized difference, double difference index and difference ratio indices) and EWT at the leaf level were weak and unstable for all of the 18 plant species (including 14 broadleaf, 3 shrub, and 1 liana species) at different angles under laboratory and field conditions. Moreover, validation results from six independent datasets (n = 1800) and one modeled dataset (n = 2375) further confirmed that the algorithm derived from the proposed index (based on multi-angular reflectance factors of leaves) was not only effective for EWT estimation across a diverse set of plant species with widely variable leaf structure and water content, but also insensitive to different measurement conditions (leaf clip, integrating spheres or multi-angle measurements). The algorithm developed from this new index is generic, does not require reparameterization for each species, and can be accurately used for nondestructive EWT estimations using a simple handheld laboratory or field instrument, and thus, is convenient for agricultural and ecological studies.', '[Li, Xiao; Sun, Zhongqiu; Lu, Shan] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Geog Proc & Ecol Secur Changbai Mt, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China.

In this study, we focus on developing and testing an independent and robust methodology for assessment of different InSAR processing results. Our proposed method is adapted from the Terrafirma Process Validation project; we compare geocoded line-of-sight velocities and time series, density and coverage, as well as some qualitative metrics. We use Sentinel-1 data from an area in Glasgow (UK) processed using 4 different approaches modified RapidSAR, SqueeSAR, GAMMA-IPTA and conventional StaMPS. The main areas of ground motion are detected using all approaches, with the average standard deviation of velocity differences for all inter comparison pairs in all polygons equal to 1.1 mm/yr. Sentinel-1 InSAR therefore provides comparable results that are independent of processing approaches. However, there are considerable differences in some aspects of the results, in particular in their density and coverage.

For optimal utility in agricultural water management applications, frequent thermal imaging (<4-day revisit) at sub-field (100 m or less) spatial resolution is desired. While, the current suite of Landsat satellites (7 and 8) provides the required spatial resolution, the 8-day combined revisit can be inadequate to capture rapid changes in surface moisture status or crop phenology, particularly in areas of persistent cloud cover. The new ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission, with an average 4-day revisit interval and nominal 70-m resolution, provides a valuable research platform for augmenting Landsat TIR sampling and for investigating TIR-based ET mapping mission requirements more broadly. This study investigates the interoperability of Landsat and ECOSTRESS imaging for developing ET image timeseries with high spatial (30-m) and temporal (daily) resolution. A data fusion algorithm is used to fuse Landsat and ECOSTRESS ET retrievals at 30 m with daily 500-m retrievals using TIR data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) over target agricultural sites spanning the United States.The added value of the combined multi-source dataset is quantified in comparison with daily flux tower observations collected within these target domains. In addition, we investigate ET model performance as a function of ECOSTRESS view angle, overpass time, and time separation between TIR and Landsat visible to shortwave infrared (VSWIR) data acquisitions used to generate land surface temperature, leaf area index, and albedo inputs to the surface energy balance model. The results demonstrate the value of the higher temporal sampling provided by ECOSTRESS, especially in areas that are frequently impacted by cloud cover. Limiting usage to ECOSTRESS scenes collected between 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p. m. and nadir viewing angles <20 degrees yielded daily (24-h) ET retrievals of comparable quality to the well-tested Landsat baseline. We also discuss challenges in using land-surface temperature from a thermal free-flyer system for ET retrieval, which may have ramifications for future TIR water-use mapping missions.', '[Anderson, Martha C.; Yang, Yang; Xue, Jie; Knipper, Kyle R.; Yang, Yun; Gao, Feng; Kustas, William P.; Alfieri, Joseph G.] USDA ARS, Hydrol & Remote Sensing Lab, Beltsville, MD USA.

However, to estimate the phase speed of ISWs, 11 image pairs are found suitable, which captured 24 ISWs. Two methods, (i) Multiple Images Comparison (MIC), and (ii) Tidal Time Period (TTP) are used to estimate the phase speed of ISWs. The estimated phase speeds are well agreed with theoretical results derived from Sturm-Liouville equation using monthly climatology stratification data and local bathymetry. A maximum phase speed of 3.02 m/s was estimated at 3740 m depth in the western side of Nicobar Islands and minimum speed of 0.83 m/s at 100 min the southeastern region of the Andaman Sea. It is found that the ISW phase speed decreases as they propagate from deep to shallow water. From the analysis of monthly variation of ISW phase speed, we found higher phase speed in December and January than March in the southeastern region of the Andaman Sea, which is attributed to monthly variation of environmental parameters such as mixed layer depth (MLD), thermocline depth, etc. over the region. It is found that water depth and monthly stratification play a vital role in controlling the phase speed of the ISWs in the Andaman Sea.', '[Tensubam, Chinglen Meetei; Raju, Nadimpalli Jithendra; Dash, Mihir Kumar; Barskar, Himanshu] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Ctr Oceans Rivers Atmosphere & Land Sci, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.

As wetland depends on water availability, protecting this important ecosystem requires careful hydrological monitoring. The Sentinel-1 mission, featuring a wide swath coverage, high temporal observations and open data policy, provides unprecedented opportunity for high spatiotemporal resolution water level change mapping over regional-wide wetland areas. In this study, we assess Sentinel-1 InSAR observations for routine water level change measurements over the entire south Florida Everglades wetlands. The study utilizes 91 Sentinel-1 images acquired over a three-year period (Sep 2016 to Nov 2019) and generates routine 12-days Interferograms and correspondingly 30 m spatial resolution water level change maps over the entire Everglades. The high spatial resolution interferograms detect hydrological signals induced by both naturaland human-induced flow, including tides, gate operations, and canal overflow; all these cannot be detected by terrestrial measurements. The large number of both InSAR and ground-based gauge observations allow us to quantify the overall accuracy of the Sentinel-1 InSAR measurements, which is 3.9 cm for the entire wetland area, but better for smaller hydrological units within the Everglades. Our study reveals that the tropospheric delay for individual interferograms can be very large, as much as 30 cm (similar to 10 fringes). When applying tropospheric corrections to all three years of Sentinel-1 InSAR observations, the overall accuracy level improved by 13% to 3.4 cm. Although our study is focused on the Everglades, its implications in term of the suitability of Sentinel-1 observations for space-based hydrological monitoring of wetlands and the derived accuracy level are applicable to other wetlands with similar vegetation types, located all over the world.', '[Liao, Heming; Wdowinski, Shimon; Li, Shanshan] Florida Int Univ, Inst Environm, Dept Earth & Environm, Miami, FL 33199 USA.', 'State University System of Florida; Florida International UniversityRP Liao, HM (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Inst Environm, Dept Earth & Environm, Miami, FL 33199 USA.', 'heming.liao@outlook.comRI Li, Shanshan/HLH-7747-2023', NULL, 'NSF [DEB-1832229]', 'We thank two anonymous reviewers for the thoughtful comments, which   helped us to improve the quality of this manuscript.

In the past decades, a lot of studies were investigated to obtain bathymetric data in shallow waters using satellite remotely sensed data. Satellite multispectral imagery has been widely used to estimate shallow water depths based on empirical models and physics-based models. However, the in-situ water depth information is essential (as the priori) to use the empirical model in a specific area, which limits its application, especially for remote reefs. In this study, the bathymetric maps in shallow waters were produced based on empirical models with only satellite remotely sensed data (i.e., the new ICESat-2 bathymetric points and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery). The bathymetric points from the spaceborne ICESat-2 lidar were used in place of the in-situ auxiliary bathymetric points to train the classical empirical models (i.e., the linear model and the band ratio model). The bathymetric points were firstly extracted from noisy ICESat-2 raw data photons by an improved point cloud processing algorithm, and then were corrected for bathymetric errors (which were caused by the refraction effect in the water column, the refraction effect on the water surface, and the fluctuation effect on the water surface). With the trained empirical models and Sentinel-2 multispectral images, the bathymetric maps were produced for Yongle Atoll, in the South China Sea and the lagoon near Acklins Island and Long Cay, to the southeast of Bahama with four-date Sentinel-2 images. The bathymetry performance (including the accuracy and consistency of multi-date data) was evaluated and compared with the in-situ measurements. The results indicate that the bathymetric accuracy is well, and the RMSE is lower or close to 10% of the maximum depth for the two models with four-date images in two study areas. The consistency of multi-date data is well with the mean R-2 of 0.97. The main novelties of this study are that the accuracy bathymetric points can be obtained from the ICESat-2 raw data using the proposed signal processing and error correction method, and using the ICESat-2 bathymetric points, the satellite multispectral imagery based on empirical models is no longer limited by local priori measurements, which were essential in previous studies. Hence, In the future, with the help of free and open-access satellite data (i.e., ICESat-2 data and Sentinel-2 imagery), this approach can be extended to a larger scale to obtain bathymetric maps in the shallow water of coastal areas, surroundings of islands and reefs, and inland waters.', '[Ma, Yue; Yang, Fanlin] Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geodesy & Geomat, Qingdao 266590, Peoples R China.

To tackle this challenge, we developed a new algorithm called the Random-Forest-based cloud mask (RFmask), which can improve the accuracy of cloud identification from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM + ), and Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS) images. For the development and validation of the algorithm, we first chose the stratified sampling method to pre-select cloudy and clear-sky pixels to form a prior-pixel database according to the land use cover around the world. Next, we select typical spectral channels and calculate spectral indices based on the spectral reflection characteristics of different land cover types using the top-of-atmosphere reflectance and brightness temperature. These are then used as inputs to the RF model for training and establishing a preliminary cloud detection model. Finally, the Super-pixels Extracted via Energy-Driven Sampling (SEEDS) segmentation approach is applied to re-process the preliminary classification results in order to obtain the final cloud detection results. The RFmask detection results are evaluated against the globally distributed United States Geological Survey (USGS) cloud-cover assessment validation products. The average overall accuracy for RFmask cloud detection reaches 93.8% (Kappa coefficient = 0.77) with an omission error of 12.0% and a commission error of 7.4%. The RFmask algorithm is able to identify broken and thin clouds over both dark and bright surfaces. The new model generally outperforms other methods that are compared here, especially over these challenging scenes. The RFmask algorithm is not only accurate but also computationally efficient.

At the same time wetlands are typically biodiversity hotspots and provide a range of valuable ecosystem services, such as water supply and purification, disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and carbon sequestration.   Pressures on wetlands are likely to further intensify in the coming decades due to increased global demand for land and water, and due to climate change. Stakeholders at all levels of governance have to be involved to slow, stop and reverse these processes. However, the information they need on wetland extent, their ecological character, and their ecosystem services is often scattered, sparse and difficult to find and access.   The freely available Sentinel satellite data of the Copernicus Programme, as well as the Landsat archive, provide a comprehensive basis to map and inventory wetland areas (extent), to derive information on the ecological status, as well as long- and short-term trends in wetland characteristics. However, making use of these Earth Observation (EO) resources for robust and standardized wetland monitoring requires expert knowledge on often complex data processing techniques, which impedes practical implementation. In this respect, the Satellite-based Wetland Observation Service (SWOS), a Horizon 2020 funded project (www.swos-service.eu) has developed and made disseminated monitoring approaches based on EO data, specifically designed for less experienced satellite data users.   The SWOS monitoring tools aim at assisting countries in conducting national wetland inventories for their Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting and monitoring obligations, and additionally facilitates other monitoring obligations such as those required by the Ramsar Convention and supports decision-making in local conservation activities. The four main components of the SWOS approach are: map and indicator production; software development; capacity building; and initializing the GEO Wetlands Community Portal. Wetland managers and data analysists from more than fifty wetland sites and river basins across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa investigated the benefits and limitations of this EO-based wetland mapping and monitoring approach.   We describe research that applies the SWOS tools to test their potential for the mapping of wetlands in a case study based in Albania, and show its effectiveness to derive metrics relevant to the monitoring of SDG indicator 6.6.1.', '[Weise, Kathrin; Hoefer, Rene; Schwarz, Michael; Kunz, Ina; Thuemer, Grit] Jena Optron GmbH, Otto Eppenstein Str 3, D-07745 Jena, Germany.

An X-Bragg backscatter model is explored to calculate a theoretical look-up table for the polarization ratio as a function of incidence angle, dielectric constant, orientation angle shift and its standard deviation. Thus, ocean surface backscatter can be identified as open water or sea ice by comparing the measured PR with a theoretical model for PR. The proposed method is validated by comparison to collocated optical video images and manual visual interpretations.

These can cause large-scale vegetation damage, and are therefore among key drivers of declines in biomass and productivity (or \"browning\") observed across Arctic regions in recent years.   Extreme events which cause browning are driven by multiple interacting climatic variables, and are defined by their ecological impact - most commonly plant mortality. Quantifying the climatic causes of these multi-variate, ecologically defined events is challenging, and so existing work has typically determined the climatic causes of browning events on a case-by-case basis in a descriptive, unsystematic manner. While this has allowed development of important qualitative understanding of the mechanisms underlying extreme event driven browning, it cannot definitively link browning to specific climatic variables, or predict how changes in these variables will influence browning severity. It is therefore not yet possible to determine how extreme events will influence ecosystem responses to climate change across Arctic regions.   To address this, novel, process-based climate metrics that can be used to quantify the conditions and interactions that drive the ecological responses defining common extreme events were developed using publicly available snow depth and air temperature data (two of the main climate variables implicated in browning). These process-based metrics explained up to 63% of variation in plot-level Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at sites within areas affected by extreme events across boreal and sub-Arctic Norway. This demonstrates potential to use simple metrics to assess the contribution of extreme events to changes in Arctic biomass and productivity at regional scales. In addition, scaling up these metrics across the Norwegian Arctic region resulted in significant correlations with remotely-sensed NDVI, and provided much-needed insights into how climatic variables interact to determine the severity of browning across Arctic regions.', '[Treharne, Rachael; Phoenix, Gareth K.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.

InSAR phase changes were closely related to fluctuations in water level and flow direction. We evaluated InSAR time series observations using measurements from water level loggers based on correlation and root mean square error (RMSE). It was found that correlation between InSAR measurements and water level changes in the field varied depending on the site, type of wetland vegetation, incidence angle and polarization.

Its floodplain eco-system, which is strongly tied to seasonal flood pulse, is extremely important for food security, trade and economy of Cambodia, supporting the livelihoods of about 1.7 million people. On the other hand, flood can also be extremely devastating in the region along the TSL. In recent years, studies have pointed out that rapid growing number of water infrastructures as well as future climate changes may alter the hydrological cycle of the Mekong River Basin (MRB) and are expected to influence the flood pulse of the TSL and surrounding TSL floodplain. Therefore, it is timely to understand historical inundation extent and predict its likely future state. In this study, we proposed a Rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function (REOF) analysis-based daily inundation extent estimation framework, integrating multi-temporal stack of Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery and Jason-series satellite altimetry data. The framework can generate daily, cloud-free and gap-free inundation extents for any given time depending on the altimetry data provided. A long-term El Nino and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index-based daily TSL level forecasting method with months of lead time was also proposed to fulfill the framework\'s forecasting capacity. In this study, the framework was adopted in the TSL floodplain area for hindcast (2003 to 2015) and forecast (January to July 2019) of daily inundation extents. Estimated inundation extents were cross-compared with MODIS-derived and Sentinel-1-derived inundation maps, resulting in up to higher than 90% of Critical Success Index (CSI). The proposed framework has (1) innovative capacity of estimation of future daily areal inundation extents and is (2) a fully remote sensing-based framework which can empower local authorities tasked with water resource management decisions without relying on upstream countries. The framework has potential to be implemented in other major river basins or wetlands (e.g., Amazon River Basin, and Congo River Basin). The implementation on SAR imagery from other satellites with different bands of electromagnetic wave is also possible but requires more investigation.', '[Chang, Chi-Hung; Lee, Hyongki; Kim, Donghwan] Univ Houston, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 5000 Gulf Fwy,Bldg 4,Rm 216, Houston, TX 77204 USA.

Using data provided by different sensors can greatly improve the temporal resolution of time series, fill data gaps and thus improve the quality of land cover monitoring applications. However, multi-sensor approaches are often adversely affected by different spectral characteristics of the sensing instruments, leading to inconsistencies in downstream products. Spectral harmonization, i.e., the transformation of one sensor into the spectral domain of another sensor, may reduce these inconsistencies. It simplifies workflows, increases the reliability of subsequently derived multi-sensor products and may also enable the generation of new products that are not possible with the initial spectral definition. In this paper, we compare the effect of multivariate spectral harmonization techniques on the inter-sensor reflectance consistency and derived products such as spectral indices or land cover classifications. We simulated surface reflectance data of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A from airborne hyperspectral data to eliminate any sources of error originating from unequal acquisition geometries, illumination or atmospheric state. We evaluate different methods based on linear, quadratic and random forest regression as well as linear interpolation, and predict not only matching but also unilaterally missing bands (red edge). We additionally consider material-dependent spectral characteristics in the harmonization process by using separate transformation functions for spectral clusters of the input dataset. Our results suggest that spectral harmonization is useful to improve multi-sensor consistency of remote sensing data and subsequently derived products, especially if multiple transformation functions are incorporated. There is a strong dependency between harmonization performance and the similarity of source and target sensor\'s spectral characteristics. For spectrally transforming Landsat-8 to Sentinel-2A, we achieved the lowest radiometric inter-sensor deviations with 50 spectral clusters and linear regression. Based on simulated data, deviations are below 1.7% reflectance within the red edge spectral region and below 0.3% reflectance for the remaining bands (RMSE). Regarding spectral indices, our results show a reduction of inter-sensor deviation (vegetation pixels only) to 38% of the initial error for NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and to 43% for EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index). Furthermore, we computed the REIP (Red Edge Inflection Point) with an accuracy of 3.1 nm from Sentinel-2 adapted Landsat-8 data. An exemplary multispectral classification use case revealed an increasing inter-sensor consistency of classification results from 92.3% to 97.3% mean error. Applied to time series of real Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data, we observed similar trends, albeit intermingled with non-sensor-induced inconsistencies.', '[Scheffler, Daniel; Segl, Karl] Potsdam GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Remote Sensing, Helmholtz Ctr, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.

The system enables determination of daily radiation fluxes over the entire Baltic Sea employing data from satellites in combination with data from numerical prognostic models. Data from satellite radiometers like SEVIRI, AVHRR are used together with algorithms that take into account the specificity of this sea and are developed based on large empirical data sets collected in this region. A verification of the system has been carried out based on separate, empirical data collected in 2015 on the oil rig Plat placed on the Baltic Sea and Svenska Hogarna station. The analysis showed that daily average NET had been calculated with RMSD of 15 Wm(-2) and R-2 = 0.95 for the South Baltic. For downward radiation fluxes in the solar wavelength range (SW) and the terrestrial, thermal wavelength range (LW) RMSD is respectively 11.9 Wm(-2) and 9.6 Wm(-2) and in both cases increase with latitude. The NET components estimated using SBRB were also compared with the corresponding magnitudes OSI -303-a and OSI 304-a from OSI SAF, EBAF surface Edition 4.0 from CERES and ERA-interim data from ECMWF systems. The main reasons for the discrepancies are discussed. The analyses confirmed the advisability of using local solutions which ensure high accuracy and spatial resolution.   SBRB was developed and implemented as part of the comprehensive SatBaltyk System designed to monitor the Baltic Sea environment.

Recently, the use of spaceborne imagery has become indispensable for monitoring giant kelp, a globally distributed foundation species that displays variable seasonal and interannual dynamics. In order to develop and maintain a continuous and spatially expansive time series, we describe a fully automated protocol to classify giant kelp canopy biomass across three Landsat sensors. This required correcting kelp canopy estimates to account for changes in the spectral response functions between the three sensors by simulating data using hyperspectral imagery. Combining multiple sensors also necessitated the use of an extended (15 year) time series of diver estimated kelp biomass to validate each sensor. We also describe a novel gap filling technique using known spatial scales of kelp biomass synchrony to correct for missing data due to the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus scan line corrector failure. These developments have led to a publicly available 34-year, seasonal time series of kelp canopy biomass across similar to 1500 km of California coastline.   We then use this time series to examine the role of temporal and spatial scale on the detection of long-term biomass trends. We found that kelp canopy biomass trends are associated with trends in low frequency marine climate oscillations, like the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. Long-term (similar to 20 year) increases in the state of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation have led to a cooler, nutrient-rich environment that benefits the growth of giant kelp across a large portion of the kelp biomass time series, however recent warming events have led to weak, or nonexistent trends over the length of the time series. The cyclical nature of these low frequency marine climate oscillations complicates the detection of trends that may be associated with anthropogenic climate change. A longer and continuous time series is needed to analyze long-term canopy biomass trends outside of natural low frequency climate variability for giant kelp ecosystems along the coast of California, if we are to make accurate assessments of the impacts of climate change.', '[Bell, Tom W.; Allen, James G.; Siegel, David A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Earth Res Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93016 USA.

The large uncertainty in emissions estimates is a consequence of many factors, including differences in definitions of forests and degradation, as well as estimation methodologies. However, a primary factor driving uncertainty is an inability to properly account for forest degradation. While remote sensing offers the only practical way of monitoring forest disturbances over large areas, and despite recent improvements in data quality and quantity and processing techniques, remote sensing approaches are still limited in their ability to detect forest degradation. In this paper, a system is presented that uses time series of Landsat data and spectral mixture analysis to detect both degradation and deforestation in forested landscapes. The Landsat data are transformed into spectral endmember fractions and are used to calculate the Normalized Degradation Fraction Index (NDFI; Souza et al., 2005). The spectrally unmixed data are used for disturbance monitoring and land cover classification via time series analysis. To assess the performance of the system, maps of deforestation and degradation were used to stratify the study area for collection of sample data to which unbiased estimators were applied to produce accuracy and area estimates of degradation and deforestation from 1990 to 2013. The approach extends previous research in spectral mixture analysis for identifying forest degradation to the temporal domain. The method was applied using the Google Earth Engine and tested in the Brazilian State of Rondonia. Degradation and deforestation were mapped with 88.0% and 93.3% User\'s Accuracy, and 68.1% and 85.3% Producer\'s Accuracy. Area estimates of degradation and deforestation were produced with margins of error of 13.9% and 5.3%, respectively, over the 24 year time period.

As such, understanding change and variability in their behaviour, and the factors responsible, is a high priority in climate (change) science. One such important factor that is both poorly understood and quantified is their linkage with adjacent landfast sea ice (fast ice). Here, we present a first detailed analysis that identifies and quantifies key linkages between the dynamics/behaviour of the CDP and fast ice. By forming a barrier to the incursion of pack ice at the eastern boundary, fast ice immediately upstream of the CDP (associated with the distribution of grounded icebergs) plays a crucially-important role in the polynya formation, maintenance and variability. This satellite data-based study builds upon earlier conceptual work on polynya-fast ice feedback mechanisms in the Mertz Glacier region by showing that statistical estimation of the rates of sea ice production (and hence AABW formation) in the CDP is significantly improved through inclusion of two key fast-ice metrics, compared to use of atmospheric covariates alone. These two metrics are the meridional extent of fast ice upstream of the polynya and total fast ice area within the region of high sea ice production.

In global drylands and croplands, soil moisture is often a primary limiting factor to plant growth. Here we use the SIF retrievals from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) and soil moisture (SM) retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellites to study the soil moisture control on photosynthetic activity of global drylands and croplands. We primarily analyze the predawn SM control on daily peak photosynthetic activity using the morning SM observations from SMAP and the noon SIF observations from OCO-2. On global drylands (i.e., dry sub-humid, semi-arid, and arid zones) and majority of croplands, soil water content is typically low, moisture in the topsoil is critical for plant growth, and satellite-based SIF and SM observations are expected to have high retrieval accuracy. The SMAP SM retrievals show positive daily relationships with OCO-2 SIF for drylands and croplands of the tropics and Australia, where SM is expected to limit plant growth and concurrent data records are sufficient to make statistical inferences. Negative relationships between SIF and SM were observed in forested areas of mid-latitude dry subhumid zones with high average annual SM for which SIF showed a positive relationship with air temperature. The relationships between SM and SIF follow the expected spatial patterns, positive and stronger in drier and warmer regions whereas weaker and often negative in colder and wetter regions. We find strong evidence that the OCO-2 SIF is accurately capturing monthly SMAP SM dynamics particularly for regions with distinct seasonality of rainfall such as the Sub-Saharan North Africa, Indian subcontinent, and South African countries. These results indicate new opportunities for monitoring dryland and cropland productivity solely using satellite observed SIF and soil moisture data.', '[Gonsamo, Alemu; Chen, Jing M.; He, Liming; Rogers, Cheryl; Liu, Jane] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Planning, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.

Recently, several above ground biomass (AGB) maps have been produced using a variety of approaches to assess the carbon stock of the subtropical forest in China. However, due to the lack of reliable ground observations and the limitations of AGB mapping methods at regional scales, estimates of the spatial distribution of AGB vary greatly, leading to large uncertainties in the carbon stock estimations. In this study, we produced a new 1-km spatial resolution AGB map by synthesizing an unprecedented number of ground AGB observations from published studies, and developed an AGB mapping method using a combination of ground observations, MODIS data, forest cover/gain/loss maps based on Landsat, GLAS forest canopy height, and climatic and terrain data. In addition, we validated our estimates using independent testing data and compared our estimates with three previous AGB maps. The results indicate that the total AGB stock in the subtropical forest of China is (266 +/- 9.1) x 10(6) Mg, with an average AGB of 123.2 Mg/ha. Based on sixteen explanatory variables, our ensemble mean model explains 75% of the variance in forest AGB, with an RMSE of 45.5 Mg/ha. Comparison using all observation data shows that our map has a significantly lower RMSE and bias than previous maps, where the RMSE and bias tended to vary with forest type. This study not only improved the accuracy of AGB estimation for the subtropical forests but also highlighted the importance of forest type for regional AGB estimation.', '[Zhang, Rong; Zhou, Xuhui] East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Zhejiang Tiantong Forest Ecosyst Natl Observat &, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.

This is limiting progress in the understanding of fundamental biogeochemical processes, such as the global carbon (C) cycle and climate feedback effects on C fluxes.   In this study, we evaluated the capabilities of two new satellite datasets that enable regional scale mapping of peatland extent at high spatial resolution, including Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and the Arctic digital elevation model (ArcticDEM). Terrain indices and temporal features derived from these datasets provided input to Random Forest models for delineating four main land cover classes (forest, open upland, water and peatland) in an area in northern Sweden consisting of both lowland and mountainous terrain. The contribution of ArcticDEM to the classification accuracy was assessed by comparing the results with those derived when a high quality LiDAR based DEM (LiDEM) was used as alternative model input.   This study shows that multi-seasonal SAR alone can produce reasonable classification results in terms of overall accuracy (OA; 81.6%), but also that it has limitations. The inclusion of terrain indices improved classification performance substantially. OA increased to 87.5% and 90.9% when terrain indices derived from ArcticDEM and LiDEM were included, respectively. The largest increase in accuracy was achieved for the peatland class, which suggests that terrain indices do have the ability to capture the features in the geographic context that aid the discrimination of peatland from other land cover classes.   The relatively small difference in classification accuracy between LiDEM and ArcticDEM is encouraging since the latter provides circumpolar coverage. Thus, the combination of Sentinel-1 time series and terrain indices derived from ArcticDEM presents opportunities for substantially improving regional estimates of peatland extent at high latitudes.', '[Karlson, Martin; Galfalk, Magnus; Bastviken, David] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.

Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite images can capture such information. However, the automated delineation of fields in smallholder farms is a challenging task because of their small size, irregular shape and the use of mixed-cropping systems, which make their boundaries vaguely defined. Physical edges between smallholder fields are often indistinct in satellite imagery and contours need to be identified by considering the transition of the complex textural pattern between fields. In these circumstances, standard edge-detection algorithms fail to extract accurate boundaries. This article introduces a strategy to detect field boundaries using a fully convolutional network in combination with a globalisation and grouping algorithm. The convolutional network using an encoder-decoder structure is capable of learning complex spatial-contextual features from the image and accurately detects sparse field contours. A hierarchical segmentation is derived from the contours using the oriented watershed transform and by iteratively merging adjacent regions based on the average strength of their common boundary. Finally, field segments are obtained by adopting a combinatorial grouping algorithm exploiting the information of the segmentation hierarchy. An extensive experimental analysis is performed in two study areas in Nigeria and Mali using WorldView-2/3 images and comparing several state-of-the-art contour detection algorithms. The algorithms are compared based on the precision-recall accuracy assessment strategy which is tolerating small localisation errors in the detected contours. The proposed strategy shows promising results by automatically delineating field boundaries with F-scores higher than 0.7 and 0.6 on our two test areas, respectively, outperforming alternative techniques.', '[Persello, C.; Tolpekin, V.

Through weathering processes, oil may become emulsified in two forms of oil water mixture: water in oil (WO) and oil in water (OW). These two forms of oil emulsion are significantly different in their volume concentration (oil/water ratio), physical properties (viscosity, density, thickness), and optical properties (spectral reflectance (R-u(lambda), sr(-1)), and spectral absorption (a(lambda), m(-1))). In this study, the optical properties of both types of oil emulsion, with different volumetric concentrations, are determined from carefully prepared oil emulsion samples, with the aim of helping to interpret optical remote sensing imagery. The concentrations of stable WO and OW emulsions range from 45% to 95% and from 0.025% to 3%, respectively. They exhibit different R-u spectral shapes in the near-infrared and shortwave-infrared wavelengths, with five \"-CH\" molecular bonds evident in the WO emulsion spectra. R-u (600-1400 nm) of OW emulsions increases with volume concentrations from 0% to 3.0%, but R-u (600-2400 nm) of the WO emulsions decreases with volume concentrations from 45% to 100%. On the other hand, for a fixed concentration (80%), R-u (600-2400 nm) of WO emulsions increases monotonically with thicknesses of up to similar to 0.4 mm, beyond which R-u (600-2400 nm) no longer increases with oil thickness. The difference between the R-u spectral shapes of OW and WO emulsions, as well as the statistical relationships between volume concentrations and R-u (NIR-SWIR) and between oil thickness and Ru (NIR-SWIR), provide the basis for developing optical models to classify oil emulsion types and for quantifying oil volume from remote sensing imagery. The potential of such an application is demonstrated using hyperspectral AVIRIS imagery collected over the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM).', '[Lu, Yingcheng; Shi, Jing; Wen, Yansha; Zhou, Yang; Liu, Yongxue] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

The influence of the angular variation of LSE on the surface upwelling longwave radiation (SULR) estimation is still unexplored at the satellite scale. We performed statistical analyses of MYD21 emissivity retrievals over different land surface types for three longwave bands centred around 8.55 pm (Band 29), 11 mu m (Band 31) and 12 pm (Band 32), respectively. A look-up table was generated to describe the angular variations for both single-band and broadband emissivities. The results showed that the angular variation of directional emissivity in Band 29 could reach up to 0.03, but was < 0.01 for Bands 31 and 32. The angular variation in broadband emissivity was intermediate to that for individual bands. In all cases, the directional emissivity was greatest and symmetric around nadir. By integrating the directional broadband emissivity, the influence of angular variation of the LSE on estimated SULR was quantified using simulation and measurements at seven stations from the US surface radiation budget network (SURFRAD). The difference between the directional and integrated hemispheric broadband emissivity was within 0.01. As a result, the influence of angular variation of LSE on the SULR estimation was modest. For the SURFRAD stations, the differences of root-mean-square error (RMSE) before and after considering the angular variation of LSE were generally < 1 W m(-2). We conclude that the angular variation of broadband emissivity is not pronounced because of the small linear weight for Band 29 in the calculation of broadband emissivity. Ignoring the anisotropy of emissivity does not introduce large errors in SULR estimation generally.', '[Hu, Tian; Xu, Zhihong; Zhou, Jun] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Environm Futures Res Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.

It couples boundary layer aerosol composition, size and concentration with cloud reflectivity. It affects cloud evolution, precipitation, radiative forcing, global climate and, through observation, can be used to partially monitor the first indirect effect.   With its unique combination of multi-wavelength, multi-angle, total and polarized reflectance measurements, the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) retrieves N-d with relatively few assumptions. The approach involves measuring cloud optical thickness, mean droplet extinction cross-section and cloud physical thickness. Polarimetric observations are capable of measuring the effective variance, or width, of the droplet size distribution. Estimating cloud geometrical thickness is also an important component of the polarimetric N-d retrieval, which is accomplished using polarimetric measurements in a water vapor absorption band to retrieve the amount of in-cloud water vapor and relating this to physical thickness. We highlight the unique abilities and quantify uncertainties of the polarimetric approach.   We validate the approach using observational data from the North Atlantic and Marine Ecosystems Study (NAAMES). NAAMES targets specific phases in the seasonal phytoplankton lifecycle and ocean-atmosphere linkages. This study provides an excellent opportunity for the RSP to evaluate its approach of sensing N-d over a range of concentrations and cloud types with in situ measurements from a Cloud Droplet Probe (CDP). The RSP and CDP, along with an array of other instruments, are flown on the NASA C-130 aircraft, which flies in situ and remote sensing legs in sequence.   Cloud base heights retrieved by the RSP compare well with those derived in situ (R = 0.83) and by a cellometer aboard the R.V. Atlantis (R = 0.79). Comparing geometric mean values from 12 science flights throughout the NAAMES-1 and NAAMES-2 campaigns, we find a strong correlation between N-d retrieved by the RSP and CDP (R = 0.96). A linear least squares fit has a slope of 0.92 and an intercept of 0.3 cm(-3). Uncertainty in this comparison can be attributed to cloud 3D effects, nonlinear liquid water profiles, multilayered clouds, measurement uncertainty, variation in spatial and temporal sampling, and assumptions used within the method. Radiometric uncertainties of the RSP measurements lead to biases on derived optical thickness and cloud physical thickness, but these biases largely cancel out when deriving N-d for most conditions and geometries. We find that a polarimetric approach to sensing N-d is viable and the RSP is capable of accurately retrieving N-d for a variety of cloud types and meteorological conditions.', '[Sinclair, Kenneth] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Engn, 2880 Broadway, New York, NY 10025 USA.

The DSF uses multiple dark targets in the subscene to construct a \"dark spectrum\" which is used to estimate the atmospheric path reflectance (rho(pa)(th)) according to the best fitting aerosol model. This method is fully automated and can be used for full mission archive processing, as demonstrated here for a study region in the North Sea. The new approach overcomes common issues with the SWIR based exponential extrapolation approach (EXP). An evaluation of both methods is presented using L-w measurements from 19 sites in the AERONET-OC network over a 15 year period and 5 satellite sensors. Overall, the DSF performs better than the EXP, with a notable improvement in the blue spectral region. The tiled processing allows for a smooth rho(pa)(th) estimation for full and merged L/S2 scenes, over clear and turbid coastal waters, inland waters, and land. The DSF selects the most appropriate band automatically, i.e. the one giving the lowest atmospheric path reflectance, and hence largely avoids amplification of glint and adjacency effects in the atmospheric correction. After application of the DSF, sun glint reflectance can be estimated from the SWIR bands, and the application of a sun glint correction significantly improves data availability for these nadir viewing sensors. A consistent processing across sensors allows for the exploitation of the > 30 year L/S2 archive, including Landsat 5 imagery dating back to 1984.

At the upper elevational limit of forest distribution, patterns of forest advance and stasis can be highly spatially variable. Reliable estimations of forest distribution shifts require assessments of forest change to account for variation in treeline advance across entire mountain ranges. Multispectral satellite remote sensing is well suited to this purpose and is particularly valuable in regions where the scope of field campaigns is restricted. However, there is little understanding of how much information about forest structure at the mountain treeline can be derived from multispectral remote sensing data. Here we combine field data from a structurally diverse treeline ecotone in the Central Mountain Range, Taiwan, with data from four multispectral satellite sensors (GeoEye, SPOT-7, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8) to identify spectral features that best explain variation in vegetation structure at the mountain treeline and the effect of sensor spatial resolution on the characterisation of structural variation. The green, red and short-wave infrared spectral bands and vegetation indices based on green and short-wave infrared bands offer the best characterisation of forest structure with R-2 values reported up to 0.723. There is very little quantitative difference in the ability of the sensors tested here to discriminate between discrete descriptors of vegetation structure (difference of R-MF(2) within 0.09). While Landsat-8 is less well suited to defining above-ground woody biomass (R-2 0.12-0.29 lower than the alternative sensors), there is little difference between the relationships defined for GeoEye, SPOT-7 and Sentinel-2 data (difference in R-2 < 0.03). Discrete classifications are best suited to the identification of forest structures indicative of treeline advance or stasis, using a simplified class designation to separate areas of old growth forest, forest advance and grassland habitats. Consequently, our results present a major opportunity to improve quantification of forest range shifts across mountain systems and to estimate the impacts of forest advance on biodiversity and ecosystem function.', '[Morley, Peter J.; Jump, Alistair S.] Univ Stirling, Biol & Environm Sci, Fac Nat Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.

This map represents a 15-year frequency at which each pixel remains in one of the surface suspended sediments concentration classes: high, moderate, and low, with an overall accuracy of 71%. Our findings allowed to observe the variation of sediment concentration along the Solimoes-Amazonas River, such as, for instance, its increase from the confluence with the Tapajos River to the mouth. Some hydrological processes were also observed in lakes of the middle reach, such as overbank flow and resuspension of sediments in depression lakes. In some ria lakes, the main water source comes from local basin with the backwater promoting sediment input in these lakes during the low-water period.

Although this model was not developed explicitly for snow surfaces, it can capture the geometric-optical effect caused by the shadowing of rugged or undulating snow surfaces. However, in this study, this model has been further developed to better characterize the scattering properties of snow surface, which can also exhibit strongly forward-scattering behavior. This study proposes a new snow kernel to characterize the reflectance anisotropy of pure snow based on the asymptotic radiative transfer (ART) model that assumes snow can be modeled as a semi-infinite, plane-parallel, weakly absorbing light scattering layer. This new snow kernel adopts a correction term with a free parameter a to correct the analytic form of the ART model that has been reported to underestimate observed snow reflectance in the forward scattering direction in the principal plane (PP), particularly in cases of a large viewing zenith angle (> 60 degrees). This snow kernel has now been implemented in the kernel-driven RTLSR BRDF model framework in conjunction with two additional kernels (i.e., the volumetric scattering kernel and geometric-optical scattering kernel) and is validated using observed and simulated multiangle data from three data sources. Pure snow targets were selected from the extensive archive of the Polarization and Directionality of the Earth\'s Reflectance (POLDER) BRDF data. Antarctic snow field measurements, which were taken from the top of a 32-m-tall tower at Dome C Station and include 6336 spectral bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs), were also utilized. Finally, a set of simulated BRFs, generated by a hybrid scattering snow model that combines the geometric optics with vector radiative transfer theory, were used to further assess the proposed method. We first retrieve the value of the free parameter a for a comprehensive analysis using single multiangle snow data with a sufficient BRDF sampling. Then, we determine the optimally fixed value of the a parameter as prior information for potential users. The new snow kernel method is shown to be quite accurate, presenting a high correlation coefficient (R-2 = similar to 0.9) and a negligible bias between the modeled BRFs and the various snow BRDF validation data. The finding demonstrates that this snow kernel provides an improved potential compared to that of the original kernel-driven model framework for a pure snow surface in many applications, particularly those involving the global water cycle and radiation budget, where snow cover plays an important role.', '[Jiao, Ziti] Beijing Normal Univ & Inst Remote Sensing & Digit, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

Initially, each is compared to benchmark elevation data in London (UK). A moving window is used to extract ground heights from the GDEMs, generating terrain models with root mean -square accuracy of up to 3 m. Subtraction of the ground heights extracted from each GDEM provides roughness-element heights only, allowing for calculation of morphology parameters. The parameters are calculated for eight directional sectors of 1 km grid-squares. Apparent merging of roughness elements in all GDEMs causes height-based parameter underestimation, whilst plan and frontal areas are over- and under-estimated, respectively. Combined, these lead to an underestimation of morphometrically-derived aerodynamic roughness parameters. Parameter errors are least for the TanDEM-X data. Further comparison in five cities (Auckland, Greater London, New York, Sao Paulo, Tokyo) provides basis for empirical corrections to TanDEM-X-derived geometric parameters. These reduce the error in parameters across the cities and for a separate location. Meteorological observations in central London give insight to wind-speed estimation accuracy using roughness parameters from the different elevation databases. The proposed corrections to TanDEM-X parameters lead to improved wind-speed estimates, which combined with the improved spatial representation of parameters across cities demonstrates their potential for use in future studies.', '[Kent, Christoph W.; Grimmond, Sue] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England.

Still, efficient and accurate mapping approaches are needed that provide shrub cover fraction estimates over space and time. The spectral signal of shrubs is composed of green vegetation and non-photosynthetic vegetation as well as varying fractions of soil, grass, and shadow, which makes a direct mapping of fraction cover challenging. In this study, we mapped 32 years of shrub cover fractions from annual Landsat best observation composites covering a rockrose (genus Cistus) ecosystem in the Baixo Alentejo region of southern Portugal. Fraction mapping was based on a multi-year support vector regression model trained with synthetically mixed data from a multi-annual image spectral library. Resulting fractions maps were validated using reference information derived from high-resolution satellite imagery available for 10 out of 32 years. Fraction maps reproduced the spatial-temporal patterns of shrub cover in the study region very well, with an average mean absolute error over all validation years of 13.7%. For individual validation years, mean absolute errors ranged from 7.7% to 17.1%. Our consistent modeling framework led to a reliable annual shrub cover fraction time-series, which allowed identifying areas of stable shrub cover and areas with different types and intensities of change. Such long-term shrub cover fraction monitoring is of great value for land use assessments and contributes to a thorough understanding and management of Earth\'s arid and semi-arid ecosystems.', '[Suess, Stefan; van der Linden, Sebastian; Okujeni, Akpona; Griffiths, Patrick; Leitao, Pedro J.; Schwieder, Marcel; Hostert, Patrick] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.

All the statistical parameters of slope PDF have previously been derived by using optical methods in specular conditions, and values and relationships with surface parameters have been presented in the literature. However they may not be relevant at microwave wavelengths due to diffraction effects. Up to now, sea surface slope PDF consistent with ocean microwave remote sensing is not known yet. So it is important to establish the parameter models of quasi-Gaussian slope PDF compatible with radar application. In this paper, based on the backscattering coefficients from the Ku-band space-borne radar Precipitation Radar (PR) data, all the parameters of the quasi-Gaussian slope PDF are inverted using a so-called \"GO4\" (Boisot et al., 2015) model with a two-dimensional (2-D) non-linear least square fit on the backscattering coefficients. We also establish the empirical formulae relating the statistical parameters of the quasi-Gaussian sea slope PDF with wind speed, which may be used for ocean Ku-band radar application.   The proposed empirical formulae are compared to the Cox and Munk (1954) - CM slope parameter model: the results confirm that the slope variance in upwind and crosswind directions as well as the skewness coefficients exhibit intermediate values between the CM slope parameters of clean surface and slick surface cases. The coefficients of peakedness are just in the range of the CM slope peakedness parameter values.   The impacts of wave conditions (swell or wind sea) on slope PDF parameters are also studied. The results show that in most wind speed conditions, the presence of swell increases the skewness coefficients, while it decreases the peakedness coefficients.', '[Chen, Ping; Xu, Fei] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Elect Informat & Commun, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.

Large-scale satellite based monitoring systems, such as the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI), are necessary to improve our understanding of how these ecosystems respond to climate change by providing verifiable land products. For instance, satellite-based land product validation approaches can benefit from airborne hyperspectral imagery and in-situ data, which provide higher spatial and spectral resolution baselines, ideal for measuring vegetation changes (e.g. phenology, LAI) at local scales. Here, we assessed the short-term phenospectral dynamics (spectral changes indicated by specific spectral features as a function of phenology) of five ombrotrophic peatland vegetation physiognomies over four dates at the Mer Bleue bog in Canada. We took advantage of a unique remote sensing data acquisition campaign aiming to validate Sentinel-2A land products, and analyzed three spatially and spectrally distinctive datasets (i.e. field spectra, VISNIR airborne hyperspectral imagery (HSI) and Sentinel-2A imagery) over the first half of the 2016 growing season. By implementing a bottom-up approach, first we assessed the airborne HSI\'s capability to detect phenological changes as compared to in-situ acquired field spectroscopy measurements in a 10 ha area at Mer Bleue and evaluated the spectral features characteristic of these phenological changes. Second, over the entire Mer Bleue area (28,000 ha), we compared a series of four Sentinel-2A images to four airborne HSI mosaics (spatially and spectrally resampled to Sentinel-2A) to assess the utility of Sentinel-2A for detecting small spectral variations due to phenological changes (i.e. greening). In addition, for this second comparison, three spectral vegetation indices were derived from the Sentinel-2A images and the airborne HSI mosaics. The spectral comparisons between the airborne HSI and the field spectroscopy data revealed clear phenological changes from the airborne HSI. For instance, a closer agreement between reflectance measured by the field spectrometer and the airborne HSI spectral response was found in the visible region (450-680 nm). A greater difference however, was consistently seen in the near-infrared region (681-866 nm) across the four dates. Narrow spectral features in three regions of the visible range (global minima, red absorption, green peak), indicating changes in vegetation colour, were consistent for both datasets and with expected phenological patterns at Mer Bleue. At the landscape level, Sentinel-2A mirrored the spectral changes depicted by the resampled HSI data. However, band level, pair-wise comparisons showed significant differences (p < 0.001) in reflectance for each band, with Sentinel-2A exhibiting higher reflectance values than the HSI for the first three dates. Only for the last date (June 23rd) did the airborne HSI have higher reflectance values or no significant difference with the Sentinel-2A data. Overall, our three datasets captured the short-term phenological changes at Mer Bleue and have provided promising results in terms of using the Sentinel-2A MSI sensor to monitor these changes at the landscape level.', '[Arroyo-Mora, J.

The extraction of urban land use from very fine spatial resolution (VFSR) remotely sensed imagery has, therefore, drawn much attention in the remote sensing community. Nevertheless, classifying urban land use from VFSR images remains a challenging task, due to the extreme difficulties in differentiating complex spatial patterns to derive high-level semantic labels. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer great potential to extract high-level spatial features, thanks to its hierarchical nature with multiple levels of abstraction. However, blurred object boundaries and geometric distortion, as well as huge computational redundancy, severely restrict the potential application of CNN for the classification of urban land use. In this paper, a novel object-based convolutional neural network (OCNN) is proposed for urban land use classification using VFSR images. Rather than Pixel-wise convolutional processes, the OCNN relies on segmented objects as its functional units, and CNN networks are used to analyse and label objects such as to partition within-object and between-object variation. Two CNN networks with different model structures and window sizes are developed to predict linearly shaped objects (e.g. Highway, Canal) and general (other non-linearly shaped) objects. Then a rule-based decision fusion is performed to integrate the class-specific classification results. The effectiveness of the proposed OCNN method was tested on aerial photography of two large urban scenes in Southampton and Manchester in Great Britain. The OCNN combined with large and small window sizes achieved excellent classification accuracy and computational efficiency, consistently outperforming its sub-modules, as well as other benchmark comparators, including the Pixel-wise CNN, contextual-based MRF and object-based OBIA-SVM methods. The proposed method provides the first object-based CNN framework to effectively and efficiently address the complicated problem of urban land use classification from VFSR images.', '[Zhang, Ce; Atitinson, Peter M.] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.

However, the coarse spatial resolutions (e.g., 3 km, 6 km, or 10 km) of the primary satellite AOD products have weakness to capture the characteristics of urban-scale PM2.5 patterns. Moreover, high-resolution (e.g., 1 km) PM2.5 estimations are still unable to be related to the urban landscape or to small geographical units, which is crucial for analyzing the urban pollution structure. In this study, the daily PM2.5 concentrations were estimated using the new AOD data with a 160 m spatial resolution retrieved by the Gaofen-1 (GF) wide field of view (WFV) along with the nested linear mixed effects model and ancillary variables from the Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) meteorological simulation data. The experiment was conducted in Wuhan, Beijing, and Shanghai, which suffers from severe atmospheric fine particle pollution in recent years. The proposed model performed well for both GF and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with slight over-fitting and little spatial autocorrelation. Regarding to the GF PM2.5 estimation, model fitting yielded R-2 values of 0.96, 0.91 and 0.95 and mean prediction error (MPE) of 10.13, 11.89 and 7.34 mu g/m(3) for Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai, respectively. The site-based cross validation achieved R-2 values of 0.92, 0.88 and 0.89, and MPE of 13.69, 16.76 and 12.59 mu g/m(3) for Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai, respectively. The day-of-years based cross validation resulted in R-2 of 0.54, 0.58 and 0.50, and MPE of 30.46, 27.12 and 31.58 mu g/m(3) for Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai, respectively, indicating that it was practicable to estimate the GF PM2.5 in the days without enough AOD-PM2.5 matchups. The ultrahigh resolution PM2.5 estimations offer substantial advantages for providing finer spatially resolved PM2.5 trends. Additionally, it offers new approaches to locate main PM2.5 emission sources, evaluate the local PM2.5 contribution proportion, and quantify the daily PM2.5 emission level via remote sensing techniques. Along with the joint observations via other high-resolution satellites, the temporal resolution of GF PM(2.5)will be further improved. In all, this study not only provides possibilities for further applications in the precise analysis of urban inner PM2.5 pollution patterns but also establishes a foundation for constructing a high-resolution satellite air monitoring network in China.', '[Zhang, Tianhao; Zhu, Zhongmin; Gong, Wei; Zhu, Zerun; Huang, Yusi; Mao, Feiyue; Shen, Huanfeng; Xu, Kai] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.

The combined retrieval of vegetation biochemical and biophysical parameters and Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F) was investigated exploiting high resolution spectral measurements in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. First, the retrieval scheme was evaluated against a synthetic dataset. Then, it was applied to very high resolution (sub-nanometer) canopy level spectral measurements collected over a lawn treated with different doses of a herbicide (Chlorotoluron) known to instantaneously inhibit both Photochemical and Non-Photochemical Quenching (PQ and NPQ, respectively). For the first time the full spectrum of canopy F, the fluorescence quantum yield (Phi(F)), as well as the main vegetation parameters that control light absorption and reabsorption, were retrieved concurrently using canopy-level high resolution apparent reflectance (rho*) spectra. The effects of pigment content, leaf/canopy structural properties and physiology were effectively discriminated. Their combined observation over time led to the recognition of dynamic patterns of stress adaptation and stress recovery. As a reference, F values obtained with the model inversion were compared to those retrieved with state of the art Spectral Fitting Methods (SFM) and SpecFit retrieval algorithms applied on field data. Phi(F) retrieved from rho* was eventually compared with an independent biophysical model of photosynthesis and fluorescence.

We developed a model to assess microphytobenthic (MPB) primary production using (1) remotely sensed information on MPB biomass and remotely sensed information on sediment mud content, (2) surface irradiance and ambient temperature (both from local meteorological observations), (3) directly-measured photosynthetic parameters and (4) a tidal model. MPB biomass was estimated using the normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) and mud content was predicted using surface reflectance in the blue and near-infrared, both from Landsat 8 satellite imagery. The photosynthetic capacity (maximum photosynthesis rate normalized to MPB chl-a) was estimated from ambient temperature, while photosynthetic efficiency and the light saturation parameter were derived from in situ fluorometry-based production measurements (PAM). The influence of tides (submergence by turbid water) on MPB production was accounted for in the model. The method was validated on several locations in two temperate tidal basins in the Netherlands (Oosterschelde and Westerschelde). Model based production rates (mg C m(-2) h(-1)) matched well with an independent set of in situ (PAM) measurement based production rates (Oosterschelde: RMSE = 9.7, mean error = 1.5, chi = 0.57; Westerschelde: RMSE = 46.7, mean error = -17.6, chi = 0.9). The relationship between photosynthetic capacity and temperature shows considerable variation and may be improved by using sediment surface temperature instead of ambient temperature. A sensitivity analysis revealed that emersion duration and mud content determine most of the variability in MPB production. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to derive a satellite remote sensing based overview of average hourly and daily MPB primary production rates at the macro scale. As the proposed model is generic, the model can be applied to other tidal systems to assess spatial variability in MPB primary production at the macro scale after calibration at the site of interest.

Since station SAT data are irregularly distributed, land surface temperature (LST) values derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are used to estimate regional SAT by using linear regression methods. The deviations between SAT and LST are largely dependent on space and time, which hampers the estimation of linear regression, especially for the maximum SAT. To obtain accurate regional SAT estimates, a three-stage hierarchical Bayesian (HB) model is proposed that incorporates the MODIS LSTs as model covariates and specifies the deviations with structured dependence of MODIS LST fields. Sampling of model parameters and estimation of SAT values are implemented under the Bayesian paradigm using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Sensitivity analyses involving various model configurations and running processes are discussed to help build a robust HB model. The model\'s performance is evaluated using station measurements that are not used in the modeling process, with RMSEs of 2.15 K (0.75%) and 1.97 K (0.73%) for monthly maximum and minimum SATs, respectively. The evaluation indicates that HB modeling is an effective method to estimate SAT from MODIS LST. The verified HB model with the covariate inputs of both MODIS daytime and nighttime LSTs is used to reproduce monthly maximum and minimum SATs that are spatially continuous over the Qinghai province in Northwestern China for 2003-2011. From the comparison between MODIS LST and HB-estimated SAT, it is found that the spatial structure and warming patterns of LST and SAT show significant distinctions, implying that they cannot be substituted for one another when assessing the regional warming trends. The spatial heterogeneity of HB model estimation is able to provide thorough insights into regional SAT status changes that could otherwise be biased by station deployment.', '[Lu, Ning; Yao, Ling] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

Large uncertainties remain on their variability and response to climate change.   This study uses atmospheric methane observations from the GOSAT satellite to evaluate methane wetland emission estimates. We assess how well simulations reproduce the observed methane inter-annual variability by evaluating the detrended seasonal cycle. The latitudinal means agree well but maximum differences in the tropics of 28.1-34.8 ppb suggest that all simulations fail to capture the extent of the tropical wetland seasonal cycle.   We focus further analysis on the major natural wetlands in South America: the seasonally flooded savannah of the Pantanal (Brazil) and Llanos de Moxos (Bolivia) regions; and the riverine wetlands formed by the Parana River (Argentina). We see large discrepancies between simulation and observation over the Pantanal and Llanos de Moxos region in 2010, 2011 and 2014 and over the Parana River region in 2010 and 2014. We find highly consistent behaviour between the time and location of these methane anomalies and the change in wetland extent, driven by precipitation related to El Nino Southern Oscillation activity.   We conclude that the inability of land surface models to increase wetland extent through overbank inundation is the primary cause of these observed discrepancies and can lead to under-estimation of methane fluxes by as much as 50% (5.3-11.8 Tg yr(-1)) of the observed emissions for the combined Pantanal and Parana regions. As the hydrology of these regions is heavily linked to ENSO variability, being able to reproduce changes in wetland behaviour is important for successfully predicting their methane emissions.', '[Parker, Robert J.; Boesch, Hartmut] Univ Leicester, Dept Phys & Astron, Earth Observat Sci, Leicester, Leics, England.

Our observations show that Sabche Glacier surged four times over the last 50 years. The three most recent surges occurred at 10 to 11-year cycles, which is one of the shortest surge cycles ever recorded. Detailed analysis of the most recent surge (2012 onwards), indicates that the glacier advanced 2.2 km and experienced maximum velocities of 1.6 +/- 0.10 m day(-1). During this surge, there was a surface elevation gain at the terminus of up to 90 +/- 6.19 m a(-1), with a corresponding surface lowering of between 10 +/- 6.19 and 60 +/- 6.19 m a(-1), 3 km up-glacier of the terminus. This transfer of mass amounted to a volume of similar to 2.7 x 10(7) +/- 0.1 x 10(7) m(3)a(-1). Sabche Glacier is the first surge-type glacier to be observed in the central Himalayas, but this is consistent with a previous global analysis which indicates that surge-type glaciers should exist in the region. We hypothesise that the surge is at least partially controlled by subglacial topography, whereby a major subglacial overdeepening and constriction 3 km up-glacier of the terminus provides resistance to glacier flow from the accumulation area to the ablation area. This overdeepening appears to store mass until a threshold is crossed, after which the glacier flows out of the subglacial depression and rapidly surges over a bedrock lip and down the valley. Thus, whilst the surges are likely to be facilitated by subglacial processes (e.g. changes in subglacial hydrology and/or basal thermal regime), the topographic setting of the glacier appears to be modulating both the timing and duration of each surge.', '[Lovell, Arminel M.; Carr, J.

Accordingly, huge attention is deserved towards development of miniaturized sensing technologies compliant with UAV payload constrains and capable of providing high-resolution images of the region under test. As a contribution to this topic, the paper presents a prototype UAV system for radar imaging made by a commercial micro-UAV equipped with a miniaturized low power radar, whose imaging capabilities are enhanced by a properly designed data processing strategy. Such a strategy involves a processing step performed in time domain, which accounts for a procedure devoted to compensate flight altitude variation and a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based noise filtering approach. After, the focused images of the surveyed scenario are obtained by using a microwave tomographic approach, which integrates data about UAV position and faces the imaging as a linear inverse scattering problem. A feasibility experiment, carried out to test the operational mode of the assembled system, is presented.

A similar approach was not met with similar success in the river-influenced shelf waters in the northern South China Sea Shelf-sea (NoSoCS) where riverine inputs, in which the relationship between the concentration of [N + N] and SST was not straight forward, are significant. By considering river-influenced shelf waters as a mixture of open ocean water and riverine inputs and then combining SST with the absorption coefficient of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) at 412 nm, ag(412), which serves as an indicator of the riverine influence, an algorithm has been developed for remotely sensing the surface concentration of [N + N] in the NoSoCS. This satellite-derived concentration of [N + N] was validated by direct observations. In 16 match-up comparisons within a time window of +/- 24 h and concentrations of [N + N] ranging between 0.2 and 74 mu M, the uncertainty was +/- 40%. The climatological distributions of the derived concentration of [N + N] in the NoSoCS and surrounding waters between 2002 and 2014 are consistent with the reported distributions based on ship-board observations. Thus, as a result of riverine inputs, the concentration of [N + N] generally increases towards the coasts, varying by more than two orders of magnitude from about 0.5 mu M and near zero in the open northern South China Sea (NSCS) in January and July respectively to about 50 and 100 mu M at the mouth of the Pearl River. In the open NSCS where nutrient availability is controlled primarily by the enhanced winter convective overturn, the intraannual variations in the concentration of [N + N] follow a distinct seasonal cycle, reaching a minimum close to zero in the summer and a maximum, 0.7 mu M, in the winter. In the NoSoCS, as a result of the high riverine input of nutrients in the summer, in addition to the maximum in the winter, there is a secondary summer maximum, which becomes increasingly prominent towards the coast. This work represents a first attempt to characterize the distributions of the surface concentration of [N + N] in river-influenced shelf-seas from space. With appropriate regional tuning, a similar approach may be applicable to other river-influenced shelf-seas such as the Texas-Louisiana Shelf.', '[Pan, Xiaoju; Liu, Juanjuan] Ocean Univ China, Minist Educ, Key Lab Marine Chem Theory & Technol, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.

We investigated the relationship between Landsat (TM5 and ETM7) optical/thermal data and canopy daily functioning of annual C3 grasses at a Fluxnet site (US-Var) during a prolonged drought episode. By using the \'Soil-Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes\' (SCOPE) model, reference GPP and ET were simulated via locally measured weather data, and then actual GPP and ET were simulated twice: first using the vegetation properties retrieved only from the optical bands, and second using information from both the optical and thermal bands. The outputs of last two simulations were compared to flux tower measurements. For the first simulation, we used the MODTRAN atmospheric model and the optical radiative transfer (RT) routine in SCOPE, RTMo, to perform atmospheric correction and retrieve vegetation properties [notably Leaf Area Index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content (C-ab), leaf water content (C-w), leaf dry matter content (C-dm,), the leaf inclination distribution function (LIDF) and the senescent material content (C-s] by model inversion through optimization. We used the optical bands of 20 Landsat images covering the period from January to August 2004. The model inversion performance was assessed by R-2 (0.86) and RMSE (0.13) between the retrieved and ground-measured LAI. All the retrieved vegetation properties were linearly interpolated over time and were used, together with locally measured weather variables, to simulate GPP and ET at half-hourly time steps with SCOPE. For the second simulation, we additionally used TIR information to retrieve the maximum carboxylation capacity (V-cmax), the Ball-Berry stomatal conductance parameter (m) and soil surface and boundary resistances (r(ss) and r(bs),) by inversion of the energy balance and thermal radiative transfer routines of SCOPE, RTMt, through separate look-up tables. The comparison between simulations and measurements shows that most drought effects on ET, GPP and transpiration are \"visible\" in the Landsat optical bands. However, the accurate simulation of soil evaporation requires TIR information. The results from this study indicate that the integration of optical and TIR information has a great potential to capture the drought effects on the grass canopy in terms of reductions in daily GPP and ET.', '[Bayat, Bagher; van der Tol, Christiaan; Verhoef, Wouter] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.', 'University of TwenteRP Bayat, B (通讯作者)，Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.', 'b.bayat@utwente.nl; c.vandertol@utwente.nl; w.verhoef@utwente.nlRI Bayat, Bagher/AAP-2573-2020; van der Tol, Christiaan/A-2403-2010', 'van der Tol, Christiaan/0000-0002-2484-8191; Bayat,   Bagher/0000-0002-7761-9544; Verhoef, Wouter/0000-0003-4696-2144', 'ITC Faculty of the University of Twente IFP program [IFP17.1.2]; IMSRT   scholarship [4.81681]', 'We are very grateful to Dr. Siyan Ma as the associate research   specialist of the Vaira Ranch (US-Var) Fluxnet site.

Airborne small-footprint waveform lidar data are increasingly used for vegetation classification and above-ground carbon estimates at a range of spatial scales in woody or homogeneous grass and savanna ecosystems. However, a gap remains in understanding how waveform features represent and ultimately can be used to constrain the PFTs in heterogeneous semi-arid ecosystems. This study evaluates lidar waveform features and classification performance of six major PFTs, including shrubs and trees, along with bare ground in the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, Idaho, USA. Waveform lidar data were obtained with the NASA Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO). From these data we derived waveform features at two spatial scales (1 m and 10 m rasters) by applying a Gaussian decomposition and a frequency-domain deconvolution. An ensemble random forest algorithm was used to assess classification performance and to select the most important waveform features. Classification models developed with the 10 m waveform features outperformed those at 1 m (Kappa (kappa) = 0.81-0.86 vs. 0.60-0.70, respectively). At 1 m resolution, lidar height features improved the PFT classification accuracy by 10% compared to the analysis without these features. However, at 10 m resolution, the inclusion of lidar derived heights with other waveform features decreased the PFT classification performance by 4%. Pulse width, rise time, percent energy, differential target cross section, and radiometrically calibrated backscatter coefficient were the most important waveform features at both spatial scales. A significant finding is that bare ground was clearly differentiated from shrubs using pulse width. Though the overall accuracy ranges between 0.72 and 0.89 across spatial scales, the two shrub PFTs showed 0.45-0.87 individual classification success at 1 m, while bare ground and tree PFTs showed high (0.72-1.0) classification accuracy at 10 m. We conclude that small-footprint waveform features can be used to characterize the heterogeneous vegetation in this and similar semi-arid ecosystems at high spatial resolution. Furthermore, waveform features such as pulse width can be used to constrain the uncertainty of terrain modeling in environments where vegetation and bare ground lidar returns are close in time and space. The dependency on spatial resolution plays a critical role in classification performance in tree-shrub co-dominant ecosystems.', '[Ilangakoon, Nayani T.; Glenn, Nancy F.; Dashti, Hamid; Spaete, Lucas P.] Boise State Univ, Dept Geosci, 1910 Univ Dr, Boise, ID 83725 USA.

Comparisons between satellite and in situ R-rs, indicated good agreement for the shorter wavelengths, but weak relationships for both satellites for the 555 nm channel, and showed that radiometers deployed on multipurpose, off-the-shelf BGC-Argo floats can provide validation-quality measurements. About 300 chlorophyll a concentration match-ups were achieved within 18 months, which increased the number of validation data points available for the Indian Ocean as a whole by a factor of similar to 4 from the previous historical record.

Although SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) is still the leading technology for maritime monitoring, the number of studies based on optical satellite data is quickly growing. Altogether we analysed 119 papers on optical vessel detection and classification for the period from 1978 to March 2017. We start by introducing all the existing sensor systems for vessel detection, but subsequently focus only on optical imaging satellites. The article demonstrates the temporal development of optical satellite characteristics and connects this to the number and frequency of publications on vessel detection. After presenting the methods used for optical imagery-based vessel detection and classification in detail, along with the achieved detection accuracies, we also report possibilities for fusing optical data with other data sources. The studied papers show that the most common factors greatly influencing the vessel detection accuracy are the following: different weather conditions affecting sea surface characteristics, the quantity of clouds and haze, solar angle, and imaging sensor characteristics. All these factors bring great variations in the selection of the most suitable method; some still continue to pose unsolved challenges. For higher relevance and wider usage, we suggest that the algorithms for detection and classification should support a variety of targets and meteorological conditions, and ideally also a variety of optical satellite sensors. At least, they should be tested on many images under different conditions. This is not usually the case in the existent literature. We also observed that many authors omit an appropriate performance quantification, which is critical for a practical assessment and a numerical comparison of the presented algorithms. Overall it can be seen that vessel monitoring from spaceborne optical images is a popular research topic and has a great operational potential in the near future due to the large amount of satellite data, much of it free and open.', '[Kanjir, Urska; Ostir, Kristof] ZRC SAZU, Dept Remote Sensing, Novi Trg 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.

Despite their importance and their fragility, they are much less studied than other ecosystems like rainforests. In particular, the distribution and amount of the above-ground woody biomass (AGB) is largely unknown. In this paper, we produce the first continental map of the AGB of African savannahs and woodlands at a resolution of 25 m. The map is built from the 2010 L-band PALSAR mosaic produced by JAXA, along the following steps: a) stratification into wet/dry season areas in order to account for seasonal effects, b) development of a direct model relating the PALSAR backscatter to AGB, with the help of in situ and ancillary data, c) Bayesian inversion of the direct model. A value of AGB and its uncertainty has been assigned to each pixel. This approach allows estimating AGB until 85 Mg.ha(-1) approximately, while dense forests and non-vegetated areas are masked out using the ESA CCI Land Cover dataset. The resulting map is visually compared with existing AGB maps and is validated using a cross-validation approach and a comparison with AGB estimates obtained from LiDAR datasets, leading to an RMSD of 8 to 17 Mg.ha(-1). Finally, carbon stocks for savannahs in Africa and in 50 countries are estimated and compared with estimates by FAO and from AGB maps available over Africa.', '[Bouvet, Alexandre; Mermoz, Stephane; Thuy Le Toan; Villard, Ludovic] Univ Toulouse, CESBIO, CNES, CNRS,IRD,UPS, Toulouse, France.

Quantifying land subsidence of these high-valued transitional environments is therefore crucial to investigate their long-term possible survival, also in view of the expected climate changes. However, monitoring with a certain accuracy their movements has been challenging until now due to the peculiar features of these morphological forms: they are difficult to access, made of largely unconsolidated deposits, without anthropogenic structures, relatively far from anthropogenic facilities, and become submerged by the sea water twice a day. For these reasons, they have never be linked to traditional levelling and GPS networks, and also standard Interferometric SAR applications returned very poor results in terms of spatial and temporal coverage. An advanced Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique on a 5-year long stack of X-bandwidth SAR acquisitions of the Venice Lagoon is here presented. The regularity of the acquisitions, the short satellite revisiting time (11 days), the high image resolution (similar to 3 x 3 m), and the strategies used in the PSI application have allowed us to detect thousands of measurable persistent targets (PTs) in the Venice Lagoon salt marshes. The measured displacements range from small uplifts to subsidence rates of more than 20 mm/yr. The analyses of the observed displacements point out that land subsidence is much larger on man-made than natural salt marshes, with a significant negative correlation with the marsh age. In addition, land subsidence with the presence of halophytic vegetation species is generally smaller than on unvegetated marshes. Finally, at a few selected sites, the integration of the PSI outcome with local ground-based measurements, such as multi-depth benchmarks, feldspar marker horizons and surface elevation tables, has allowed quantifying the displacement variability versus depth and therefore developing a first conceptual model of the salt marsh consolidation and accretion processes.', '[Da Lio, Cristina; Teatini, Pietro; Tosi, Luigi] CNR, Inst Marine Sci, Arsenate Tesa 104,Castello 2737-F, I-30122 Venice, Italy.

The study makes use of newly available WorldView-2 satellite stereo imagery to exploit the previously untapped value of archival stereo aerial photography. High resolution photogrammetric digital elevation models (DEMs) are derived to determine three-dimensional glacier change over an unprecedented time span of six decades with an unparalleled mean areal coverage of 82% per glacier. The use of an in-house robust surface matching algorithm ensured rigorous alignment of the DEMs to overcome inherent problems associated with processing archival photography, most notably the identification and correction of scale error in some datasets. The analysis provides insight into one of the most challenging and data-scarce areas on the planet by expanding the spatial extent north of the AP to include previously un-studied glaciers located in the South Shetland Islands. 81% of glaciers studied showed considerable loss of volume over the period of record. The mean annual mass loss for all glaciers yielded 0.24 +/- 0.08 m.w.e. per year, with a maximum mass loss of up to 62 m.w.e. and frontal retreat exceeding 2.2 km for Stadium Glacier, located furthest north on Elephant Island. Observed volumetric loss was broadly, though not always, correlated with frontal retreat. The combined mass balance of all 16 glaciers yielded- 1.862 +/- 0.006 Gt, which corresponds to- 0.005 mm sea level equivalent (SLE) over the 57 year observation period.', '[Fieber, Karolina D.; Mills, Jon P.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.

This paper aims to provide new insight into the quality and error characteristics of turbulent heat flux estimates at various spatial and temporal scales (from daily upwards). The study is performed within the European Space Agency (ESA) Ocean Heat Flux (OHF) project. One of the main objectives of the OHF project is to meet the recommendations and requirements expressed by various international programs such as the World Research Climate Program (WCRP) and Climate and Ocean Variability, Predictability, and Change (CLIVAR), recognizing the need for better characterization of existing flux errors with respect to the input bulk variables (e.g. surface wind, air and sea surface temperatures, air and surface specific humidities), and to the atmospheric and oceanic conditions (e.g. wind conditions and sea state). The analysis is based on the use of daily averaged LHF and SHF and the associated bulk variables derived from major satellite-based and atmospheric reanalysis products. Inter-comparisons of heat flux products indicate that all of them exhibit similar space and time patterns. However, they also reveal significant differences in magnitude in some specific regions such as the western ocean boundaries during the Northern Hemisphere winter season, and the high southern latitudes. The differences tend to be closely related to large differences in surface wind speed and/or specific air humidity (for LHF) and to air and sea temperature differences (for SHF). Further quality investigations are performed through comprehensive comparisons with daily-averaged LHF and SHF estimated from moorings. The resulting statistics are used to assess the error of each OHF product. Consideration of error correlation between products and observations (e.g., by their assimilation) is also given. This reveals generally high noise variance in all products and a weak signal in common with in situ observations, with some products only slightly better than others. The OHF LHF and SHF products, and their associated error characteristics, are used to compute daily OHF multiproduct-ensemble (OHF/MPE) estimates of LHF and SHF over the ice-free global ocean on a 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees grid. The accuracy of this heat multiproduct, determined from comparisons with mooring data, is greater than for any individual product. It is used as a reference for the anomaly characterization of each individual OHF product.', '[Bentamy, A.; Piolle, J.

Here we revisit the semi-analytical pathway of deriving [Chl-a] based on the light absorption coefficient of phytoplankton by introducing the generalized stacked-constraints model (GSCM) to partition satellite-derived total light absorption coefficient of water (with pure-water contribution subtracted), a(nw)(lambda), into phytoplankton, a(ph)(lambda), and non-phytoplankton components, where a(nw)(lambda) is derived from satellite remote -sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda), using the Quasi-Analytical Algorithm. The GSCM-derived a(ph)(lambda) was compared with field matchups of [Chl-a]. We show that semi-analytical approaches can provide superior [Chl-a] product compared with reflectance-band-ratio algorithms when the accuracy of satellite-derived a(ph)(lambda) is sufficiently improved, in this case with the GSCM. However, the improvement is at the cost of significantly reduced data availability because the GSCM may provide no feasible solutions when input a(nw) (lambda) data are subject to large errors.

Water level and storage vary greatly under the impacts of climate change and human activities. Due to sparse in-situ monitoring networks, a comprehensive national-scale monitoring dataset of surface water bodies in China is not available. Over the last two decades, satellite altimetry has been used successfully for inland water monitoring. Here, we use CryoSat-2 radar altimetry to monitor water level variations of large lakes, reservoirs and rivers across China and demonstrate its potential to complement available in-situ monitoring datasets for the country.   In this study, over 1000 lakes and reservoirs, and 6 large rivers are investigated. The results show that surface water varied greatly over the past 6 years, e.g. in the Tibetan Plateau, the Junggar Basin, the Northeast China Plain, and the central Yangtze River basin. Estimated changes in volume indicate that surface water variation contributes significantly to terrestrial storage variation, especially in the Qaidam Basin and the Tibetan Plateau. CryoSat-2 is capable of measuring regional-scale river level at high spatial resolution and competitive accuracy as demonstrated by comparison with available in-situ gauging data. The results are encouraging with RMSE values ranging from 0.24 to 0.35 m for the Heilongjiang-Amur River, 0.22 to 0.6 m for the Yellow River and 0.22 to 0.5 m for the Songhua River. Comparatively, accuracy is much lower over the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers (RMSE similar to 2.6 m and similar to 3.3 m), probably due to intensive inland waterway navigation. CryoSat-2 shows great potential for monitoring surface water at national scale in China.', '[Jiang, Liguang; Bauer-Gottwein, Peter] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, Bygningstorvet 115, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.

Variability on such a fine scale is not captured in digital elevation models prepared from conventionally acquired LiDAR data products that generally have a spatial resolution of 0.5-1.0 m and vertical uncertainties up to 15 cm. Until recently, capturing critical fine scale features required laborious, hands-on field surveys that took days to collect data and time limitations usually required surveys to be restricted to selected areas of a wetland. Using Structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry and a small unmanned aerial vehicle, precise three-dimensional point clouds, digital surface models (DSM) and color orthomosaics were produced for three salt marshes in Eastern Canada. Vertical and horizontal measurements from the SfM photogrammetry compared favorably to those taken with a Differential Global Positioning System DGPS). Average horizontal displacements of 1.0-2.9 cm were found across the three salt marshes with an average elevation difference of 2.7 cm (+/- 1.7 cm) in comparison to DGPS. Analysis of the relationship of elevation between points taken with the DGPS and extracted from the SfM DSM gave an R-2 of 0.99. With a ground sampling distance of 23 cm our SfM photogrammetry generated models captured variations in topography associated with geomorphic features such as creeks, ponds, channel edges, and logs not visible in the DSM prepared from LiDAR of the same sites. SfM photogrammetry enables mapping of important hydrological features, such as creeks carrying drainage from upland watersheds or connectivity of ponds on the wetland surface. The former are important for transport of contaminants or diadromous fish, and the latter is important for resident fish, water birds, and mosquito larvae. Using SfM to distinguish vegetation structure that may indicate vegetation composition will enable more informed analyses of elevational controls on plant distribution and better prediction of their fate with sea level rise.

However, most current drought indices are based on the visible/near infrared/thermal remote sensing, which might be influenced greatly by cloud, atmospheric water content and rain-fall. Microwave sensors can overcome the shortages of visible/near infrared/thermal remote sensing and show to be another important approach for drought monitoring due to its all-weather working advantages. But to date, the application of microwave vegetation drought indices in drought monitoring has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, for the first time we constructed a microwave derived Temperature Vegetation Drought Index (TVDI) - MTVDI based on the theory of optical TVDI using the brightness temperatures (Tb) from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) onboard Aqua satellite. Firstly, we built a new land surface temperature (Ts) inversion model based on the AMSR-E 18.7 GHz horizontal, 23.8 GHz and 89.0 GHz vertical polarized Tb, and then developed the Microwave Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (MNDVI) from the AMSR-E 23.8 GHz Microwave Polarization Difference Index (MPDI). After that, we constructed three versions of MTVDI: original MTVDI using Ts and MNDVI; Imp-MTVDI (Improved MTVDI) using the Ts-T-air (the difference between land surface temperature and air temperature) to replace the Ts; and NonL-MTVDI (Nonlinear MTVDI) using non-linear equation to fit the dry and wet edges, respectively. Finally, we used precipitation, soil moisture (SM) and P/PET (the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration) to validate the performances of MTVDI, Imp-MTVDI, NonL-MTVDI, MODIS derived TVDI and MIDI (improved TVDI). The time-series drought assessments across China from 2003 to 2010 indicated that the trends of the proposed MTVDI showed the most negative correlations with the variations of precipitation, P/PET and SM, and showed best performances of significance test in most regions of China. Moreover, the MTVDI could better separate the drought levels in different degrees than MODIS-derived TVDI. However, the proposed MTVDI still has some uncertainties in regions widely covered by desert, Gobi and large water surfaces. In addition, this paper mainly focuses on large spatial scale and long term drought monitoring and only uses satellite data for model validation. Further studies are needed to develop a higher spatial- and temporal-resolution MTVDI for short-term and small spatial-scale drought monitoring. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The peatland functions as a main sink for a large amount of soil derived organic carbon. The disturbance of this wetland has negatively impacted the ecosystem and contributed to climate change through the release of the stored greenhouse gases. Surface water level and soil moisture conditions are critical information about peatlands, but monitoring these hydrologic changes has been a challenging task. With a lack of in situ soil moisture measurements, we first explored yearlong Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data to find the close relationship (R-squared value: 0.80) between soil moisture and groundwater table from March 2015 to March 2016. Based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscattering returns and interferometric SAR (InSAR) phase measurements from C-band Radarsat-1 and L-band ALOS PALSAR datasets, we then analyzed the hydrologic changes in the peatlands. We compared averaged C/L-band SAR backscattering intensity (mid 1998-early 2008 for Radarsat-1, late 2006-early 2011 for ALOS PALSAR) with groundwater level changes and found that the SAR backscattering is significantly responsive (R-squared value: 0.76 and 0.67 for Radarsat-1 and ALOS PALSAR, respectively) to soil moisture changes through a three-way correlated relationship of soil moisture, groundwater level, and SAR intensity. Using InSAR coherence observations, we delineated the inundated area (western and northern regions of GDS) during the wet season, subject to double-bounce backscattering. We measured the relative water level changes in the inundated areas through the InSAR phase measurements, and estimated the groundwater level changes corresponding to soil moisture changes using time-series InSAR analysis: Our comprehensive study has demonstrated that time-series SAR backscattering retums and InSAR analysis can be used to gauge soil moisture conditions and to monitor the hydrologic and vegetation changes in the GDS.

We developed two novel and automated decision tree classification approaches to map crop types across the conterminous United States (U.S.) using MODIS 250 m resolution data: 1) generalized, and 2) year-specific classification. The classification approaches use similarities and dissimilarities in crop type phenology derived from NDVI time-series data for the two approaches. The year-specific approach uses the training samples from one year and classifies crop types for that year only, whereas the generalized classification approach uses above-average, average, and below-average precipitation years for training to produce crop type maps for one or multiple years more robustly. We produced annual crop type maps using the generalized classification approach for 2001-2014 and the year-specific approach for 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The year-specific classification had overall accuracies >78%, while the generalized classifier had accuracies >75% for the conterminous U.S. for 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2012. The generalized classifier enables automated and routine crop type mapping without repeated and expensive ground sample collection year after year. The resulting crop type maps for years prior to 2007 are new and especially important for long-term cropland monitoring and food security analysis because no other map products are currently available for 2001-2007.

These DSMs may represent elevations that range from the ground to the vegetation canopy surface, are produced from stereoscopic image pairs (stereopairs) that have a variety of acquisition characteristics, and have been coupled with lidar data of forest structure and ground surface elevation to examine forest height. This work explores surface elevations from HRSI DSMs derived from two types of acquisitions in open canopy forests. We(1) apply an automated mass-production stereogrammetry workflow to along-track HRSI stereopairs, (2) identify multiple spatially coincident DSMs whose stereopairs were acquired under different solar geometry, (3) vertically co-register these DSMs using coincident spaceborne lidar footprints (from ICESat-GLAS) as reference, and (4) examine differences in surface elevations between the reference lidar and the co-registered HRSI DSMs associated with two general types of acquisitions (DSM types) from different sun elevation angles. We find that these DSM types, distinguished by sun elevation angle at the time of stereopair acquisition, are associated with different surface elevations estimated from automated stereogrammetry in open canopy forests. For DSM values with corresponding reference ground surface elevation from spaceborne lidar footprints in open canopy northern Siberian Larix forests with slopes <10 degrees, our results show that HRSI DSMs acquired with sun elevation angles >35 degrees and <25 degrees (during snow-free conditions) produced characteristic and consistently distinct distributions of elevation differences from reference lidar. The former include DSMs of near-ground surfaces with root mean square errors <0.68 m relative to lidar. The latter, particularly those with angles <10 degrees, show distributions with larger differences from lidar that are associated with open canopy forests whose vegetation surface elevations are captured. Terrain aspect did not have a strong effect on the distribution of vegetation surfaces. Using the two DSM types together, the distribution of DSM-differenced heights in forests (mu=6.0m, s=1.4 m) was consistent with the distribution of plotlevel mean tree heights (mu=6.5 m, s=1.2 m). We conclude that the variation in sun elevation angle at time of stereopair acquisition can create illumination conditions conducive for capturing elevations of surfaces either near the ground or associated with vegetation canopy. Knowledge of HRSI acquisition solar geometry and snow cover can be used to understand and combine stereogrammetric surface elevation estimates to co-register and difference overlapping DSMs, providing a means to map forest height at fine scales, resolving the vertical structure of groups of trees from spaceborne platforms in open canopy forests.

Here we examine synergies between emerging forest disease and wildfire to determine whether disease outbreak changes environmental drivers of burn severity using sudden oak death and the basin complex fire in California as a case study of novel disturbance interaction. We mapped the spatial distribution of sudden oak death tree mortality using a new object-based filter with 1.0 m resolution KOMPSAT-2 images. We integrated these data with a physical simulation model of burn severity informed by post-fire Landsat data. Model performance varied across stages of disease establishment (early, middle and late) with stronger relationships occurring during later stages of disease progression. Multiscale statistical analysis of environmental drivers of burn severity in diseased compared to healthy forests showed that sudden oak death tree mortality altered relationships between burn severity and the biophysical environment. Specifically, compared to the healthy forests, those affected by disease exhibited higher landscape heterogeneity at smaller spatial scales (e.g., 25 and 50 m), which has been associated with decreased burn severity in the literature. Our results showed the opposite pattern. That is, a disease-affected landscape comprising less connected patches and higher patch shape complexity was more likely to experience greater burn severity. This suggests that disease-caused increases in surface fuels may have reduced the landscape\'s resistance to fire and in turn increased burn severity in forest patches neighboring disease-impacted forests.

In presenting results from such surveys, it is important to provide not only estimates of the target parameters, but also their confidence intervals, which provide the range of values wherein the true value is located with a certain level of confidence. If such an interval is narrow the point estimates from the survey can be considered very reliable. In estimating the confidence interval the variance of an estimator must first be estimated. Unbiasedness, i.e. that an estimator on average coincides with the true value, is an important property also for variance estimators. Another important property is that the variance estimator itself has low variance, not least in cases when the variance estimates obtained with the estimator may not be strictly positive. One such important case is when two-stage designs are used to first allocate sample clusters in the form of strips from which auxiliary data, such as metrics derived from airborne laser scanning, are obtained; field data are then derived from sample plots beneath each sample strip in a second stage. In this article we compare two variance estimators for such surveys. The first estimator is a standard estimator suggested in reference textbooks on model-assisted sampling. The second estimator is proposed by the authors, and utilizes the auxiliary data to a larger extent. Through Monte Carlo simulation we show that both variance estimators are approximately unbiased, but that the new estimator is more stable (i.e., has lower empirical variance) and provides empirical confidence interval coverage rates that coincide more closely with the nominal coverage rates.

Here we revisit the linear and quasilinear theories of Synthetic Aperture Radar imaging of waves in the particular case of waves in sea ice. Instead of only working with spectra, we have developed an iterative nonlinear algorithm to estimate phase-resolved deterministic maps of wave-induced orbital velocities, from which elevation spectra can be derived. Application of this algorithm to Sentinel lA wave mode images in the Southern Ocean shows that it produces reasonable results for swells in all directions except when they propagate at a few degrees off the range direction. The estimate of wave parameters is expected to work best when the shortest wave components, those which cause a pixel displacement of the order of the dominant wavelength in azimuth, can be neglected. Otherwise short waves produce a blurring of the image, increasing exponentially with the azimuthal wavenumber and reducing the estimated wave amplitude. Given the expected spatial attenuation of waves in ice-covered regions, our deterministic method should apply beyond a few tens of kilometers in the ice, without any correction for short wave effects. In situ data collected around the ice edge as part of the 2015 SeaState DRI cruise in the Beaufort confirm the progressive image blurring caused by such short waves, and the apparent reduction in the wave modulation. When short waves propagate from the open ocean towards the ice, this blurring can produce an unrealistic apparent increase of wave height, from the open ocean up to a few tens of kilometers inside the ice.

Dimensionless spectral vegetation index values derived from satellite imagery are commonly used to derive crop biomass. However, the highly empirical nature of spectrally derived biomass estimates requires frequent and costly calibration with manually collected ground data. Recently, low cost, autonomously operating terrestrial laser scanners (ATLSs) have become available for near-surface applications. In contrast to the dimensionless nature of spectral index values, autonomous light detection and ranging (lidar) technology measures physical vegetation structure by recording the x, y, z coordinates of canopy components at very high spatial (<10 cm), and temporal (<2 days) resolution. The objective of this study was to assess the suitability of an ATLS to i) monitor crop growth dynamics and ii) calibrate satellite imagery for estimating crop biomass. Wheat (Triticum aestivum spp.) growth was monitored by acquiring hypertemporal (every 28 h for a full growing season) ATLS data at three different field sites across a range of experimentally manipulated crop growth conditions. The ATLS-derived crop height explained nearly three-quarters of the variability in destructively sampled wheat biomass (r(2) = 0.74, RMSE = 514.20 kg ha(-1)), showing a slightly stronger correlation to crop biomass than did leaf area index (LAI) measurements collected in the field using a LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer (r(2) = 0.71, RMSE = 546 kg ha(-1)). Satellite-based crop biomass estimates calibrated with ATLS data captured the variability in wheat biomass throughout a farm field with a biomass error of 730.96 and 727.60 kg ha(-1) (RMSE) during the jointing (Development stage: Zadoks 37) and heading (Development stage: Zadoks 50) growth stages, respectively. These findings suggest that the hypertemporal lidar information provided via ATLS technology could constitute a major step forward in operational monitoring and mapping of crop biomass.

This study describes the deployment of one of these systems in a Mediterranean savanna ecosystem (AMSPEC-MED), and proposes new approaches for modeling of directional effects. In this study, a Hemispherical-Directional Reflectance Distribution Function (HDRDF) was introduced in order to quantify the effect of diffuse radiation on the estimation of BRDF. The HDRDFs of the two covers of the ecosystem- trees and grasses were un-mixed using a 3-Dimensional (3-D) model of the observed scene. Up-scaling HDRDF estimates to MODIS BRDF product (r(2) is an element of [0.74, 0.86]) and down-scaling to hand held spectral measurements (r(2) = 0.88) achieved a reasonable accuracy (RMSE is an element of [1.81, 3.14]). Despite the uncertainties in the estimation of diffuse irradiance and the 3-D representation of the scene, HDRDF un-mixing demonstrates the potential of automated multi-angular proximal sensing to study vegetation properties in heterogeneous ecosystems and the correction of directional effects of different sources.

The optimal threshold for an urban object was determined by comparing the reference threshold with that of a target year through object-based normalization. Threshold normalization assumed the stability or limited change of NTL intensity over time for pseudo invariant pixels. An experiment was conducted in China to detect its urban areas in 2005 and 2010 from DMSP/OLS F152005 and F182010 NTL images by using the estimated object-based thresholds predicted from DMSP/OLS F152000 NTL data and reference urban data. Results showed that the proposed method can successfully relate thresholds among years. The estimated thresholds were highly correlated with the reference, with R-2 of 0.96 and 0.92 and RMSE of 2.9 and 4.1 pixels for 2005 and 2010, respectively. At the object level, R-2 and RMSE of the estimated vs. the reference urban areas yielded 0.94 and 12.5 pixels and 0.88 and 21.2 pixels for 2005 and 2010, respectively. At the provincial level, R-2 reached 0.94 and 0.91 with RMSE of 230.7 and 336.7 pixels for 2005 and 2010, respectively. The assessment of derived urban maps for 141 sample cities yielded an overall accuracy of 95.19% and 94.09% and Kappa of 0.56 and 0.53 in 2005 and 2010, respectively. The proposed method shows great potentials to update urban extents in a timely and cost-effective manner and to detect global urban dynamics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The developed method uses globally archived satellite remote sensing data for a retrospective systematic assessment of past multi-temporal landslide activity. Landslides are automatically identified as spatially explicit objects based on landslide-specific vegetation cover changes using temporal NDVI-trajectories and complementary relief-oriented parameters. To enable the long-term analysis of large areas with highest possible temporal resolution, the developed method facilitates the use of a large amount of optical multi-sensor time series data. The database of this study consists of 212 datasets that comprise freely available Landsat TM & ETM + data and SPOT 1 & 5, IRS1-C LISSIII, ASTER, and RapidEye data. These data were acquired between 1986 and 2013 and cover a landslide-prone area of 2500 km(2) in southern Kyrgyzstan. We identified 1583 landslide objects ranging in size between 50 m(2) and 2.8 km(2). Spatiotemporal analysis of the landslides that were detected during these 27 years reveals continuous landslide activity of varying intensity. The highest overall landslide rates occurred in 2003 and 2004, exceeding the long-term annual average rate of 57 landslides per year by more than a factor of five. The areas of highest landslide activity are also determined, whereas most of these areas were persistent over time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In view of the intensive discussions on climate change and its effect on living organisms on earth, it has become necessary to develop new methods and strategies to monitor and follow the changes in global plant distribution. In this research, we focused on a vegetation analysis using spectral reflectance profiles linked to biochemical concentrations. We performed the spectroscopic measurements of Pistacia species at canopy and leaf levels. Concomitant chemical analyses of leaf and bark materials enabled the development of remote sensing (RS) indices of structure-related biochemicals and pigments. We developed RS indices for cellulose, lignin, chlorophyll, carotenoid, anthocyanin and wax. Since the wax was the least studied in this context and due to the fact that it is the first layer of the plant surface that interacts with the incident light, it deserved special attention and was assumed to affect the spectral reflectance and, in combination with the other biochemicals, to contribute to better species identification.   In the modeling process, we showed that apart from the major energy absorption spectral bands related to a given biochemical, there were supplementary bands that had a significant effect on the accuracy of the biochemical content estimation. Another factor affecting the accuracy of the biochemical estimation was the season. Thus, we divided the biochemical content estimation models into seasonal groups of spring, summer and fall. The RS indices developed in this work, together with literature-reported RS indices, were used for Pistacia classification. The accuracy (69%) of species classification was significantly higher in spring at an early vegetation stage than in summer (50%), and fall (37%). As a proof of concept, the same sets of RS indices were also used for classifying the genera and families of various plants in the Mediterranean forest using EO1 Hyperion images. The accuracy of the classification maps was 79%, when the full set of RS indices developed in this work was used. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, adequate training sample collection and mapping accuracy are two hindering factors over large regions. Here we propose a new framework for efficient human settlement extraction from Landsat images over large areas. First, an inventory-based training set is adopted to obtain some statistical parameters required to build a non-settlement mask. The mask can not only reduce unnecessary computation but also reduce the impact of background noise. Thereafter, for the un-masked areas we calculate the similarity of each image pixel to pre-collected sample points, and only those within certain threshold are treated as the settlement class. This approach is very fast and has been applied to three rapidly developing regions in China. Accuracy assessment indicates that the mean overall accuracies are 87%, 89% and 89% for Jing-Jin-Ji region, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta, respectively. This work may be applied to human settlement extraction at even broader spatial scales. (C)2016 Elsevier Inc.

There clearly is a pressing need to understand temporal and spatial variations of lakes at global and continental scales. The recent operation of Landsat 8 extends the unprecedented Landsat record to over 40 years, allowing long-term, large-scale lake dynamics mapping at high resolutions. Using our circa 2000 lake product derived from Landsat 7 images as a reference, this research produces a circa-2015 map of representative lake extents and distributions, and addresses seasonal and inter-annual lake area variability using Landsat 8 images acquired in lake stable seasons at a continental scale. Oceania is chosen here as a case study as it contains a large group of salt lakes that exhibit high area variability and has the most intensive image coverage during the first 2.5-year operation of Landsat 8. Accordingly, this paper describes an adaptive algorithm to automate lake mapping for various surface conditions using images acquired during lake stable seasons and a compositing scheme in the vector domain to generate a representative continental mosaic of lake extents from multi-temporal mapping. Our results demonstrate that these strategies and methods produce a highly reliable and representative composite of highly-variable lake extents across Oceania, and are potentially applicable to other large-scale lake mapping projects using multi-temporal data.

To date, the majority of GIS and automated analyses of planview changes in rivers from remotely sensed data has been developed for single-threaded meandering river systems. These methods have limited applicability to many of the earth\'s rivers with complex multi-channel planforms.

These algorithms quantify both the erosion and accretion rates of riverbanks from binary masks of channels generated from imagery acquired at two time periods. Additionally, the program quantifies the area of change between river channels and the surrounding floodplain and area of islands lost or formed between these two time periods. To examine variations in erosion rates in relation to local channel attributes and make rate comparisons between river systems of varying sizes, the program determines channel widths and bank curvature at every bank pixel. SCREAM was developed and tested on rivers with diverse and complex planform morphologies in imagery acquired from a range of observational platforms with varying spatial resolutions. Validation and verification of SCREAM-generated metrics against manual measurements show no significant measurement errors in determination of channel width, erosion, and bank aspects. SCREAM has the potential to provide data for both the quantitative examination of the controls on erosion rates and for the comparison of these rates across river systems ranging broadly in size and planform morphology.

For global comparisons, these in situ match-ups should be ideally representative of the distribution of total chlorophyll-a concentration in the global ocean. The oligotrophic gyres constitute the majority of oceanic water, yet are under-sampled due to their inaccessibility and under-represented in global in situ databases. The Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) is one of only a few programmes that consistently sample oligotrophic waters. In this paper, we used a spectrophotometer on two AMT cruises (AMT19 and AMT22) to continuously measure absorption by particles in the water of the ship\'s flow-through system. From these optical data continuous total chlorophyll-a concentrations were estimated with high precision and accuracy along each cruise and used to evaluate the performance of ocean-colour algorithms. We conducted the evaluation using level 3 binned ocean-colour products, and used the high spatial and temporal resolution of the underway system to maximise the number of match-ups on each cruise. Statistical comparisons show a significant improvement in the performance of satellite chlorophyll algorithms over previous studies, with root mean square errors on average less than half (similar to 0.16 in logio space) that reported previously using global datasets (similar to 0.34 in logio space). This improved performance is likely due to the use of continuous absorption based chlorophyll estimates, that are highly accurate, sample spatial scales more comparable with satellite pixels, and minimise human errors. Previous comparisons might have reported higher errors due to regional biases in datasets and methodological inconsistencies between investigators. Furthermore, our comparison showed an underestimate in satellite chlorophyll at low concentrations in 2012 (AMT22), likely due to a small bias in satellite remote-sensing reflectance data. Our results highlight the benefits of using underway spectrophotometric systems for evaluating satellite ocean-colour data and underline the importance of maintaining in situ observatories that sample the oligotrophic gyres.

The theory states that the amount of radiation absorbed by a canopy should to a great accuracy depend only on the wavelength and a wavelength-independent parameter describing canopy structure. The revolutionary idea behind this theory was that it would be possible to approximate vegetation canopy absorptance, transmittance and reflectance based on only the optical properties of foliage elements and the spectrally invariant parameter(s). This paper explains how this so-called spectral invariant is related to photon recollision probability and to canopy structural variables. Other spectral invariants were later introduced to quantify the directionality of canopy scattering. Moreover, the paper reviews the advances in the theoretical development of the photon recollision probability (p) concept and demonstrates some of its applications in global and local monitoring of vegetation using remote sensing data.

Although preliminary results of Sargassum distributions in the nearby oceans have been obtained using measurements from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), MERIS stopped functioning in 2012, and detecting and quantifying Sargassum distributions still face technical challenges due to ambiguous pixels from clouds, cloud shadows, cloud adjacency effect, and large-scale image gradient. In this paper, a novel approach is developed to detect Sargassum presence and to quantify Sargassum coverage using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) alternative floating algae index (AFAI), which examines the red-edge reflectance of floating vegetation. This approach includes three basic steps: 1) classification of Sargassum-containing pixels through correction of large-scale gradient, masking clouds and cloud shadows, and removal of ambiguous pixels; 2) linear unmixing of Sargassum-containing pixels; and, 3) statistics of Sargassum area coverage in pre-defined grids at monthly, seasonal, and annual intervals. In the absence of direct field measurements to validate the results, limited observations from the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) measurements and numerous local reports support the conclusion that the elevated AFA1 signals are due to the presence of Sargassum instead of other floating materials, and various sensitivity analyses are used to quantify the uncertainties in the derived Sargassum area coverage. The approach was applied to MODIS observations between 2000 and 2015 over the Central West Atlantic (CWA) region (0-22 degrees N, 63-38 degrees W) to derive the spatial and temporal distribution patterns as well as the total area coverage of Sargassum. Results indicate that the first widespread Sargassum distribution event occurred in 2011, consistent with previous MERIS findings. Since 2011, only 2013 showed a minimal Sargassum coverage similar to the period of 2000 to 2010; all other years showed significantly more coverage. More alarmingly, the summer months of 2015 showed mean coverage of >2000 km(2), or about 4 times of the summer 2011 coverage and 20 times of the summer 2000 to 2010 coverage. Analysis of several environmental variables provided some hints on the reasons causing the inter-annual changes after 2010, yet further multi-disciplinary research (including in situ measurements) is required to understand such changes and long-term trends in Sargassum coverage.

The WVS model improves the accuracy of the atmospheric correction parameters in TES on a band-by-band and pixel-by-pixel basis. We used global atmospheric radiosondes profiles to generate view angle and day-night-dependent WVS coefficients that are valid for all MODIS scan angles up to 65. We demonstrate the effects of applying the improved WVS model on the retrieval accuracy of MODIS-TES (MODTES) LST&E using a case study for a granule over the southwest USA during very warm and moist monsoonal atmospheric conditions. Furthermore, a comprehensive validation of the MODTES LST&E retrieval was performed over two sites at the quartz-rich Algodones Dunes in California and a grassland site in Texas, USA using three full years of MODIS Aqua data. Results from the case study showed that absolute errors in the emissivity retrieval for the three MODIS TIR bands were reduced on average from 1.4% to 0.4% when applying the WVS method. A Radiance-based method was used to validate the MODTES LST retrievals for and the results showed that application of the WVS method with the MODTES algorithm led to significant reduction in both bias and root mean square error (RMSE) of the LST retrievals at both sites. When the WVS model was applied, LST RMSE\'s were reduced on average from 1.3 K to 1.0 K at the Algodones Dunes site, and from 1.2 K to 0.7 K at the Texas Grassland site. This study demonstrated that the WVS atmospheric correction model is critical for retrieving MODTES LST with <1 K accuracy and emissivity with <1% consistently for a wide range of challenging atmospheric conditions and land surface types.

A seasonal cycle is clearly observed in SSS, with an SSS maximum during December April and an SSS minimum in July August. The averaged magnitude of the seasonal variation is about 4 pss. Interannual changes are also observed, with the lowest SSS in summer 2011 and the highest SSS in summer 2012 and a difference of 4.2 pss. Therefore, the magnitude of interannual changes can be comparable to that of the seasonal cycle. Our analysis suggests that the seasonal variations of SSS near the Mississippi River mouth are consistent with variations in Mississippi River discharge. Evaporation minus precipitation and ocean dynamics play a minor role. River discharge also contributes to the interannual variation of SSS, especially during summer 2011 and to some extent the highest summer minimum in 2012 in terms of timing, but not magnitude. For the latter, ocean dynamics and E-P also contribute. The implications of the findings to ocean modeling and hypoxic zone monitoring are also discussed.

A nodal sampling technique, focused on the reduction of this kind of contamination by sampling at the points where the perturbation cancels, was introduced by Gonzalez-Gambau et al. (2015). In this work we show that the quality of nodal sampling can be largely improved by refining the determination of the nodal grid. In addition, we have carried out an extensive validation of the resulting data over the ocean. Nodal sampling reduces sidelobe levels and ripples in the reconstructed images leading to brightness temperatures in better agreement with the theoretically modeled ones. Validation of the salinity retrievals against close-to-surface Argo salinity observations shows that nodal sampling leads to improved salinity retrievals in open ocean, while close to the coast land sea contamination seems to deteriorate the quality. Besides, spectral analysis shows that nodal sampled salinities become closer to what is geophysically expected without loss of effective spatial resolution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The phenological metrics were calibrated over an ensemble of ground observations of the timing of leaf unfolding and autumnal colouring of leaves. The start and end of season were best identified using respectively 30% and 40% threshold of LAI amplitude values. The accuracy of the derived phenological metrics, evaluated using available ground observations for birch forests over Europe (and lilac shrubs over North America), improved as compared to those derived from MODIS-EVI and produced an overall root mean square error of 7 days (19 days) for the timing of the start of season, 15 for the end of season, and 16 for the length of season. The spatial patterns of the derived LAI phenology agreed well with those from MODIS-EVI and -NDVI, although the timing of the start, end, and length of season differed by about one month at the global scale, with higher uncertainties in areas of limited seasonality of the satellite signal and systematic biases due to the differences in the methodologies and datasets.

Specifically, several studies have inferred that widespread browning trends detected in time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) reflect the response of boreal forests to longer growing seasons, increased summer drought stress, and higher frequency of fires. Data from the Thematic Mapper (TM5) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors onboard Landsat 5 and 7, respectively, span essentially the same time period as the AVHRR record, but provide data with substantially higher radiometric and spatial fidelity, and by extension, a much improved basis for evaluating decadal-scale trends in spectral vegetation indices such as the NDVI. However, detection of trends, which are often subtle, requires careful attention to ensure that artifacts associated with the quality and stability of inter and intra-sensor calibration do not lead to spurious conclusions in results from time series analyses. In this paper, we use time series of TM5 and ETM+ images for fifteen sites distributed across the Canadian boreal forest zone to explore if and how sensor geometry and inter- and intra-sensor calibration affect trends in spectral vegetation indices derived from multi-decadal Landsat time series. To do this, we created annual cloud-free composites for each Landsat spectral band based on peak summer NDVI at each site from 1984 to 2011 using all available TM5 and ETM+ data. To distinguish trends arising from long term climate change from those related to disturbance, we isolated areas within each site that were undisturbed during the Landsat record, and used these locations to analyze sources of variance in time series of red reflectance, near-infrared (NIR) reflectance, the NDVI, and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Our results highlight the challenges involved in distinguishing trends in surface properties from data artifacts caused by undetected atmospheric effects, changes in sensor view angles, and subtle radiometric differences between the TM5 and ETM+ sensors. In particular, differences in sensor view geometry across adjacent overlapping Landsat scenes cause vegetated pixels in the eastern portion of Landsat scenes to have higher reflectances in the red and NIR bands (by 5 and 6 percent, respectively) than pixels in the western portion of scenes. While this effect does not significantly change NDVI values, it does affect EVI values. We also found modest, but potentially significant, differences between the red band reflectance of each sensor, with TM5 data having 14 percent higher red reflectance on average for vegetated pixels, which can introduce spurious trends in time series that combine TM5 and ETM+ data. More generally, the results from this work demonstrate that while the 30 + year Landsat archive provides unprecedented opportunities for studying changes to the Earth\'s terrestrial biosphere over the last three decades, care must be taken when inferring trends in these data without considering how sources of variance unrelated to surface processes affect the integrity of Landsat time series.

It has also been proposed to use ALS for estimating biomass and carbon stocks under the United Nations Collaborative Program on Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (UN-REDD). The benefits of REDD depend among other facts on the cost-efficiency of the carbon accounting systems, which should be economically feasible and highly accurate. Acquiring full-coverage ALS data would provide highly accurate estimates but might be too expensive for limited inventory budgets. As an alternative, the ALS data might be collected as a sample by acquiring data from a portion of the area of interest. However, in surveys involving complex multi-phase and multi-stage systematic sampling designs, the efficiency of ALS-based estimates is hampered by the ability of estimating the sampling variability correctly. It has been demonstrated recently that the precision of such complex analytical estimators may be largely underestimated. In order to make an informed decision, simulated sampling from artificial populations generated from empirical data may provide a means for assessing the cost-efficiency of various sampling strategies when analytical approaches fail. This study presents a simulation based assessment of sampling strategies employing ALS with focus on large-area (27,400 km(2)) biomass estimation. Simulated sampling mimicking the two contrasting cases \"wall-to-wall\" and two-phase ALS-aided surveys is exemplified using Norwegian National Forest Inventory data for creating an artificial population. The main results indicated that (1) the gain in precision (10%) when using \"wall-to-wall\" ALS data may not be worth the very high inventory costs, (2) using variance estimators based on higher-order successive differences produced correct confidence intervals for two-phase systematic sampling, and (3) two-phase ALS-aided systematic surveys are cost-efficient solutions for large-area biomass estimation.

More than 5 million matchups, where the surface and top of atmosphere measurements are available, have been carefully analyzed to understand clouds related errors and to develop the advanced cloud detection scheme for improvement of satellite SST quality. The effectiveness of a Bayesian cloud detection (BCD) scheme, operationally implemented at the NOAA Office of Satellite Product Operations (OSPO) for the GOES-Imager, has been examined using an experimental filter and it is found that this scheme is not optimal. Thus, a new algorithm for cloud and error masking (CEM) scheme is proposed for physical SST retrievals. This is based on a quasi-deterministic approach combined with an approximated radiative transfer model and the functional spectral differences at pixel level. Although, traditionally the validation of cloud detection algorithms have often been reported qualitatively using visual inspection of imagery, we have made a quantitative validation of the cloud algorithm for its intended purpose by determining the quality of satellite SST retrievals against in situ data. Results show that CEM can reduce the root mean square error in SST by an average of 22% while increasing the data coverage by an average of 38% compared to the operationally implemented BCD at OSPO, as assessed over a period of fifty months.

It will allow consistent measurements around the O-2-B (687 nm) and O-2-A (760 nm) bands, related to the red and far-red fluorescence emission peaks respectively, the photochemical reflectance index, and the structural-chemical state variables of the canopy. The sun-induced fluorescence signal, overlapped to the surface reflected radiance, can be accurately retrieved by employing the powerful spectral fitting technique. In this framework, a set of fluorescence retrieval algorithms optimized for FLEX are proposed in this study. Two main retrieval approaches were investigated: i) the optimization of the spectral fitting for retrieving fluorescence at the oxygen absorption bands; ii) the extension of the spectral fitting to a broader spectral window to retrieve the full fluorescence spectrum in the range from 670 to 780 nm. The accuracy of the retrieval algorithms is assessed by employing atmosphere-surface radiative transfer simulations obtained by coupling SCOPE and MODTRAN5 codes. The simulated dataset considers more realistic conditions because it includes directional effects, and the top-of-atmosphere radiance spectra are resampled to the current specifications of the FLuORescence Imaging Spectrometer (FLORIS) planned to serve as the primary instrument aboard FLEX. The retrieval accuracy obtained at the O-2-A band is strongly affected by directional effects, and better performance is found in cases where directional effects are lower. However, the best performing algorithms tested provided similar performance, the RMSE (RRMSE) is 0.044 mW m(-2) sr(-1) nm(-1) (6.2%) at the O-2-A band, 0.018 mW m(-2) sr(-1) nm(-1) (2.9%) at the O-2-B band, and 6225 mW m(-2) sr(-1) (6.4%) for the spectrally integrated fluorescence emission. The promising results achieved open new perspectives extending fluorescence studies not only in limited absorption bands, but its spectral behavior in relation to different plant species, photosynthetic rates and stress occurrences.

Four consecutive pairs of Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 7 ETM + data over China and Korea were examined, and NDVIs derived from TOA reflectance and surface reflectance by three atmospheric correction methods were evaluated. Both simulations and comparisons showed that NDVIs derived from atmospherically-corrected surface reflectance had good consistency, while the simulation showed that the agreement varied with atmospheric characteristics. The four pairs of Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 7 ETM + NDVI had a mean bias error within +/- 0.05, and R-2 from 0.84 to 0.98. Vegetated land cover types were found to have better NDVI agreement than non-vegetated land cover types. Especially, Landsat 8 OLI consistently generated lower NDVI values in water area than Landsat 7 ETM +, which resulted from higher aerosol optical thickness in atmosphere. Landsat 8 OLI-derived NDVI showed better agreement with MODIS and GOCI NDVI than Landsat 7 ETM +, mainly on vegetated surfaces. Both Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 7 ETM + surface reflectance-derived NDVI agreed well with in-situ light emitting diode (LED) NDVI measurements at a homogeneous deciduous forest site. Landsat 8 OLI was also found to produce higher spatial variability of NDVIs than Landsat 7 ETM + at vegetated and urban areas, but lower variability on water area. The overall good agreement between Landsat 8 OLI NDVI and Landsat 7 ETM +, MODIS and GOCI NDVIs as well as in-situ measurements ensures that it is reliable to integrate the new sensor observations with those from the multiple satellite sensors, given that the same atmospheric correction methods are applied. Furthermore, the greater NDVI contrast between vegetated areas and water areas, and the higher spatial variability of Landsat 8 OLI NDVI indicated that the new sensor has better capability in land surface process monitoring, such as land cover mapping, spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation growth, and drought assessment.

The accuracy of satellite FAPAR products directly influences estimates of ecosystem productivity and carbon stocks. The targeted accuracy of FAPAR products is 10%, or 0.05, for many applications. It is important to evaluate satellite FAPAR products and understand differences between the products to effectively use them in carbon cycling models. In this study, five global FAPAR products, namely MODIS, MISR, MERIS, SeaWiFS, and GEOV1 are intercompared over different land covers and directly validated with ground-based measurements at VAlidation of Land European Remote sensing Instruments (VALERO and AmeriFlux sites. Intercomparison results show that MODIS, MISR, and GEOV1 agree well with each other and so do MERIS and SeaWiFS, but the difference between these two groups can be as large as 0.1. The temporal trends of these products agree better with each other in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere. The trends in the Northern Hemisphere are similar to those globally. However, the conclusions from the northern hemispheric scale could not be extended to the global scale for land covers such as savannahs and broadleaf evergreen forests. The differences between the products are consistent throughout the year over most of the land cover types, except over the forests, because of the different assumptions in the retrieval algorithms and the differences between green and total FAPAR products over forests. Direct validation results show that MERIS, MODIS, MISR, and GEOV1 FAPAR products have an uncertainty of 0.14 when validating with total FAPAR measurements, and 0:09 when validating with green FAPAR measurements. Overall, current FAPAR products are close to, but have not fulfilled, the accuracy requirement, and further improvements are still needed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The Aerosol-cci project, part of the European Space Agency\'s Climate Change Initiative (Ca), was designed to provide essential climate variables for aerosols from satellite data. Eight algorithms, developed for the retrieval of aerosol properties using data from AATSR (4), MERIS (3) and POLDER, were evaluated to determine their suitability for climate studies. The primary result from each of these algorithms is the aerosol optical depth (ADD) at several wavelengths, together with the Angstrom exponent (AE) which describes the spectral variation of the ADD for a given wavelength pair. Other aerosol parameters which are possibly retrieved from satellite observations are not considered in this paper. The AOD and AE (AE only for Level 2) were evaluated against independent collocated observations from the ground-based AERONET sun photometer network and against \"reference\" satellite data provided by MODIS and MISR Tools used for the evaluation were developed for daily products as produced by the retrieval with a spatial resolution of 10 x 10 km(2) (Level 2) and daily or monthly aggregates (Level 3). These tools include statistics for 12 and 12 products compared with AERONET, as well as scoring based on spatial and temporal correlations. In this paper we describe their use in a round robin (RR) evaluation of four months of data, one month for each season in 2008. The amount of data was restricted to only four months because of the large effort made to improve the algorithms, and to evaluate the improvement and current status, before larger data sets will be processed. Evaluation criteria are discussed. Results presented show the current status of the European aerosol algorithms in comparison to both AERONET and MODIS and MISR data. The comparison leads to a preliminary conclusion that the scores are similar, including those for the references, but the coverage of AATSR needs to be enhanced and further improvements are possible for most algorithms. None of the algorithms, including the references, outperforms all others everywhere. AATSR data can be used for the retrieval of AOD and AE over land and ocean. PARASOL and one of the MERIS algorithms have been evaluated over ocean only and both algorithms provide good results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

There is however a demand for moderate (30 m) spatial resolution burned area data sets, systematically generated at regional to global scale, that to date has been only partially met. This paper presents a methodology to fuse multi-temporal Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM +) data with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) active fire detections to map systematically burned areas at 30 m resolution. A multistage mapping approach is used with an initial per-pixel change detection based on spectral-rule based pre-classification of Landsat 30 m time series to identify candidate burned areas. The candidate burned area objects are then either retained or discarded by comparison with contemporaneous MODIS active fire detections. The methodology is demonstrated for 1.9 million km(2) over the Western United States using all the Landsat 7 ETM+ data and Terra MODIS active fire detections acquired in 2002. Systematic evaluation conducted by per-pixel and per-burned area object comparison with the burned area perimeters provided by the USGS Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) project is presented, and shows a good agreement in the identification of burning patterns but a likely underestimation of the total area burned. Future research to refine and further test the methodology is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this study we examine if additional information can be obtained on intra-seasonal short term scale by using the Shortwave Infrared Water Stress Index (SIWSI) as compared to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We perform a spatio-temporal evaluation of NDVI and SIWSI using geostationary remote sensing imagery from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI). The indices and their seasonally detrended anomalies are evaluated using a gridded rainfall product (RFE2) and modeled actual evapotranspiration (ETa) for the Senegal River basin in 2008. Daily NDVI and SIWSI were found spatially highly correlated to ETa with r = 0.73 for both indices, showing the importance of the north/south vegetation gradient in the river catchment. The hypothesis that short term evolution of index anomalies are related to canopy water status was tested by comparing 10-day averages of ETa with short term changes in daily NDVI and SIWSI anomalies, and moderate to strong coefficients of determination where found when anomaly variations where aggregated by Land Cover Classes (LCCs) with R-2 values of 0.65 for savanna, 0.60 for grassland, 0.72 for shrubland, and 0.58 for barren or sparsely vegetated areas. This is higher than for the same method applied to NDVI anomalies, with R-2 values of 0.57 for savanna, 0.50 for grassland, 032 for shrubland, and 0.57 for barren or sparsely vegetated areas. The approach of detrending NIR/SWIR based indices and spatially aggregating the anomalies do offer improved detection of intra-seasonal stress. However, quite coarse spatial aggregation is found necessary for a significant analysis outcome.

In order to evaluate changes in the environment an effective water quality monitoring system for the coastal zones must be in place. The chlorophyll-a concentration is commonly used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass and as indicator for eutrophication and it can be retrieved from ocean colour remote sensing data. Several operational monitoring systems based on remote sensing are in place to monitor the open sea and, to some extent, the coastal zones. However, evaluations of coastal monitoring systems based on satellite data are scarce. This paper compares the chlorophyll-a concentrations retrieved from an operational satellite system based on MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrophotometer) data with ship-based monitoring for the productive seasons in 2008 and 2010, in a coastal area in the Baltic Sea. The comparisons showed that the satellite-based monitoring system is reliable and that the estimations of chlorophyll-a concentration are comparable to in situ measurements in terms of accuracy and quantitative retrieval. A very strong correlation was found between measurements from satellite-derived chlorophyll-a compared to in situ measurements taken close in time (0-3 days), with RMSE of 64% and a MNB of 17%. The comparison of the monthly means showed improved RMSE and a MNB of only 8%. Furthermore, this study shows that MERIS is better at capturing spatial dynamics and the extent of phytoplankton blooms than ship-based monitoring, since it has a synoptic view and higher temporal resolution. Satellite-based monitoring also increases the frequency of chlorophyll-a observations considerably, where the degree of improvement is dependent on the sampling frequency of the respective monitoring programme. Our results show that ocean colour remote sensing can, when combined with field sampling, provide an improved basis for more effective monitoring and management of the coastal zone. These results are important for eutrophication assessment and status classifications of water basins and can be applied to a larger extent within national and international agreements considering the coastal zones, e.g. the European Commission\'s Water Framework Directive.

This study therefore evaluated the benefits of integrating the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) L-band HH and HV polarisation response from the woody components of vegetation with Landsat-derived foliage projective cover (FPC). Focus was on 12 regional ecosystems (REs) distributed across the Brigalow Belt Bioregion (BRB) of Queensland, Australia, where different stages of growth dominated by brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) were widespread. From remnant areas of brigalow-dominated forests mapped previously for each RE by the Queensland Herbarium through field visits and interpretations of aerial imagery, frequency distributions of all three channels were extracted and compared to those of image segments generated using FPC and PALSAR data. For woody vegetation (with an FPC threshold of >= 9%) outside of the remnant areas, mature (non-remnant) forests were associated with segments where the HH and HV backscatter thresholds were within one standard deviation of the mean extracted for remnant forest. Early-stage regrowth was differentiated using an L-band HH threshold of < - 14 dB, common for all REs because of similarities in structure at this stage. The early-stage included forests regrowing over several decades and often occurred in areas recovering from recent clearing events. Objects falling between the early and mature stages were considered to be intermediate regrowth and/or degraded forest. All areas with an FPC <9% were mapped as non-forest.   Within the BRB, the Queensland Herbarium established that forests with brigalow as a dominant or subdominant component originally occupied over 73 million ha but were reduced to 586,364 ha by 2009, with 460,499 ha (78.5%) having brigalow as the dominant component Using the Landsat FPC and ALOS PALSAR data, an additional 722,686 ha of brigalow-dominated regrowth forest were identified giving a total forested area (brigalow-dominated remnant and secondary forest) of 1,183,185 ha or 17.2% of the area of the 12 REs. Within this area, the greater proportion of regrowth (368,473 ha or 31.1%) was mapped as early stage primarily because of recovery following recent clearance events. 230,551 (19.5%) ha and 123,662 ha (10.5%) were mapped as intermediate and mature (non-remnant) stages respectively and the remainder (38.9%) was remnant forest. Users\' and producers\' accuracies were, respectively, 81% and 69% for early regrowth and 71% and 89% for mature and intermediate stage forests combined. The mapping, which used Queensland Herbarium\'s RE data to delineate brigalow extent, provided a structural, rather than age-based classification of growth stage, as is typically retrieved using time-series comparison of optical imagery. The regional estimates of growth/degradation stage generated for the BRB provide a basis for optimising the use and recovery of these threatened brigalow ecosystems with benefits for biodiversity and carbon sequestration.

Owing to persistent clouds and other atmospheric effects in the region, forest managers are facing difficulties in mapping and monitoring the forest cover changes consistently. This article presents an automated mapping method and examines the potentials of ALOS PALSAR data for characterizing natural forest cover in the tropics. Several scenes of high-resolution PALSAR data with HH and HV polarizations were processed to cover Sumatra Island. The mapping method applied image segmentation and threshold techniques to discriminate land covers. Non-forest land covers were separated using HH backscatter thresholds, while forest cover was based on HV thresholds. Twenty-two thematic maps derived at different HV backscatter thresholds were evaluated by comparing the land cover classes of the reference data. Sampling theory was used to determine the required sample size and geographic locations of the reference data. Among the resulting maps, a map with a threshold of 115 dB HV backscatter was found to be more sensitive for portraying the spatial patterns of land covers in the study area. The overall mapping accuracy at this threshold was 79.34%. Regardless of the data size, this automated mapping approach yielded decent spatial patterns of land covers and proved to be applicable for high-resolution wall-to-wall mapping and monitoring of natural forest cover in wider tropical areas.

The conifer-dominant structure gradient was compiled from ground data amassed from multiple field expeditions in central Maine (USA), Aurskog (Norway), and across central Siberia (Russia). Single variable empirical models were built to model AGB from remote sensing metrics. Using these models, we calculated a root mean square error (RMSE) and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of the RMSE from the difference between the remote sensing AGB predictions and the ground reference AGB estimates within AGB intervals across a 0-100 Mg ha(-1) boreal forest structure gradient. The results show that the error in AGB predictions (RMSE) and the error uncertainty (the CI) from LiDAR and SAR change across a forest gradient. The errors of airborne LiDAR and SAR metrics and spaceborne LiDAR platforms show a general trend of reduced relative errors as AGB magnitudes increase, particularly from 0 to 60 Mg ha(-1). Empirical models relating spaceborne metrics to AGB and estimates of spaceborne LiDAR error uncertainty demonstrate the difficulty of characterizing differences in AGB at the site-level with current spaceborne sensors, particularly below 80 Mg ha(-1) with less than 50-100% error.

The study was conducted in the Southeast region of Turkey using an atypically dense network of hourly T-a, daily snow depth, snow water equivalent (SWE), and rainfall datasets for the period: October 2002-September 2010. A comparison between the T-a and the corresponding LST grid-cell data indicated close associations that are different in nature for periods with and without snow on the ground. The LST-derived T-a was compared with that obtained from on-site gauge-based interpolation procedures and climatological time series. The LST-derived T-a was found inferior only to the T-a derived from the interpolation of the dense gauge network (31-gauges). Snow-pack simulations using estimated T-a time series were compared to simulations that were forced by the observed T-a at each site of 18 sites. The 1ST-derived T-a performed well in simulating snow mass and maximum SWE magnitude, while it did not represent well the timing of the annual peak of SWE and the duration of spring melt. Our study concluded that the MODIS/LST product can be a valuable additional source of real time forcing data for regional operational snow models, especially in remote mountainous areas with sparse telemetric data.

Statistically robust and transparent approaches for assessing accuracy and estimating area of change are critical to ensure the integrity of land change information. We provide practitioners with a set of \"good practice\" recommendations for designing and implementing an accuracy assessment of a change map and estimating area based on the reference sample data. The good practice recommendations address the three major components: sampling design, response design and analysis. The primary good practice recommendations for assessing accuracy and estimating area are: (i) implement a probability sampling design that is chosen to achieve the priority objectives of accuracy and area estimation while also satisfying practical constraints such as cost and available sources of reference data; (ii) implement a response design protocol that is based on reference data sources that provide sufficient spatial and temporal representation to accurately label each unit in the sample (i.e., the \"reference classification\" will be considerably more accurate than the map classification being evaluated); (iii) implement an analysis that is consistent with the sampling design and response design protocols; (iv) summarize the accuracy assessment by reporting the estimated error matrix in terms of proportion of area and estimates of overall accuracy, user\'s accuracy (or commission error), and producer\'s accuracy (or omission error); (v) estimate area of classes (e.g., types of change such as wetland loss or types of persistence such as stable forest) based on the reference classification of the sample units; (vi) quantify uncertainty by reporting confidence intervals for accuracy and area parameters; (vii) evaluate variability and potential error in the reference classification; and (viii) document deviations from good practice that may substantially affect the results.

This time series product has become an essential data source for the generation of many other land surface products and for a variety of regional and global studies. However, classification errors are inherent in the land cover product, which can misrepresent land cover transitions. In particular, land cover transitions are illogical if they contradict ecological rules and are unlikely to be observed. In this study, we evaluated the MODIS land cover product by analyzing the nature and magnitude of its illogical land cover transitions using annual MCD12Q1 land cover maps from 2001 to 2010. Our analysis revealed that illogical transitions exist in the product for all consecutive years, and are distributed most commonly in several regions over the world. To enhance the MODIS land cover product, we applied a spatial-temporal modeling algorithm that incorporates expert knowledge to reduce illogical transitions on five such \"hotspot\" tiles. The results showed substantial improvements in both accuracy and consistency of the land cover product using the spatial-temporal modeling algorithm. The percentage of illogical transitions in each of the five tiles was significantly reduced among consecutive years and across the entire time series. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the spatial-temporal modeling algorithm for producing high quality time series of land cover maps, and also highlights the importance of temporal consistency in land cover mapping.

L-band is the optimal choice of frequency for the monitoring of soil freezing, due to the inherent high contrast of the microwave signature between the frozen and thawed states of the soil medium. Dual-polarized observations of L-band brightness temperature at a range of observation angles were collected from a tower-based instrument, and evaluated against ancillary information on soil and snow properties over four winter seasons. During the first three winter periods the measurement site was located over mineral soil on a forest clearing, for the fourth winter the instrument was moved to a wetland site. Both sites are located in Sodankyla, Northern Finland. The test sites represent two environments typical for the northern boreal forest zone. The data were applied to derive an empirical relation between the onset and progress of soil freezing and the observed passive L-band signature. A retrieval algorithm was developed using the observations at the forest opening site. The algorithm exploits the perceived change in brightness temperature and the change in the relative difference between the signatures at horizontal and vertical polarization. With the collected experimental dataset, these features were linked optimally to the progress of soil freezing by choice of observation angle, polarization and temporal averaging. The wetland site observations provided the first opportunity for demonstrating the developed algorithm over a different soil type, giving a first estimate of the algorithm performance over larger heterogeneous targets. The future objective is to adapt the algorithm to L-band satellite observations. The present study is highly relevant for the development of freeze-thaw algorithms from current and future L-band satellite missions such as SMOS and SMAP. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This process compensates for the lack of onboard instrument providing a measure of ocean surface WS independent of the L-band radiometer measurements. The SMOS-retrieved WS in the center of the swath (+/- 300 km) is adjusted regarding to its a priori estimate. The quality of the SMOS-retrieved SSS (SSSsmos) is better at the center of the swath than at the edge of the swatch because the larger number of brightness temperature measurements available at the center of the swath reduces the effects of noise and because the greater variety of incidence angles provides more scope for adjusting the WS. This highlights the advantage of using a multi-parameter retrieval with respect to a SSS-only retrieval in which the WS would be entirely prescribed. Systematic inconsistencies between the atmospheric WS modeled using ECMWF and the WS sensed by radiometers are observed. These inconsistencies in the WS are reduced by the retrieval scheme but they still lead to residual biases in the SSSsmos, especially in the eastern equatorial Pacific ocean if the ECMWF WS is used as an a priori estimate.(c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The utility of the DINEOF SST and Chl-a is demonstrated through direct comparisons with buoy- and ship-based observations. EOF analyses of cloud-free products are further used to quantify the SST and Chl-a variability on seasonal to inter-annual timescales. The first mode of SST is dominated by an annual cycle in response to net surface heat flux, with SST lagging surface flux by similar to 57 days. The second mode of SST underscores interactions between GOM, the Scotian Shelf, and the slope sea in response to the basin scale atmospheric forcing represented by the North Atlantic Oscillation. The third mode correlates well with the evolution of Scotian Shelf-slope frontal displacement. The first EOF mode of Chl-a is dominated by a winter-spring bloom and a fall bloom, with a spatial distribution modified by the tidal mixing that facilitates nutrient delivery from the deep ocean. The second EOF mode is likely associated with a winter bloom in the warm slope sea, where the low-frequency variations of second modes of SST and Chl-a are in phase, suggesting a possible coupling between physical and biological responses to atmospheric forcing. The third mode of the Chl-a is likely associated with freshening events associated with advection of the Scotian Shelf Water, which enhance stratifications in the eastern GOM.

Soil water deficit (SWD) estimation has significant relevance to local crop growth monitoring, crop yield assessment and disaster monitoring. It also has great theoretical importance for understanding the local energy and water balance status. In this paper, AVHRR and MODIS data on 14 April 2003, 16 October 2003 under nearly clear weather conditions are selected as the spring and autumn cases. Land surface parameters, such as land surface temperature, surface albedo, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and emissivity, have been derived from different algorithms for AVHRR and MODIS data. In combination with meteorological data, the soil water deficit index is determined by applying Surface Energy Balance System. The R square values between SWDI and AMSR-E soil moisture are ranging from 0.457 to 0.607, with spring SWD being much more severe than that in autumn. The limited river runoff (less than 5% of the annual total) is the dominant factor for spring SWD. This study also reveals that the derived spring SWD from AVHRR and MODIS data is quite different on the same day. This phenomenon is caused by different satellite overpass times which influence the melting frozen soil. This also confirms that the soil moisture may have diurnal variations. The spatial variations of SWD conditions in the middle reaches of YZR and its two tributaries have been clearly identified.

These two factors were analyzed on the ITC level classification accuracy of boreal tree species (Pine, Spruce and Broad-leaves), considering two remote sensing data types: hyperspectral and airborne laser scanning (ALS). ITCs were delineated automatically on ALS and on hyperspectral data. A manual ITC delineation was used as reference in the analysis. The pixel level classification was performed on the hyperspectral bands using a non-linear support vector machine. The classification at ITC level was obtained by applying a majority voting rule to the classified pixels confined by each ITC. The results showed that ITCs automatically delineated from hyperspectral data were usually smaller than those from ALS, and the tree detection rate for hyperspectral data was much lower compared to ALS data (28.4 versus 48.5%). Regarding the classification results, using only manually delineated ITCs a kappa accuracy of 0.89 was obtained, while using only automatically delineated ITCs from hyperspectral or ALS data reduced the kappa values to 0.79 and 0.76, respectively. Slightly different results were achieved using semi-automatic approaches based on both manual and automatically delineated ITC (0.81 and 0.74, respectively). A selection of only certain pixels inside each ITC improved the classification accuracy from 1 to 7 percentage points. A selection based on the spectral values of the pixels was found more influential than the one based on the ALS-derived canopy height model. The best results were obtained after a selection based on the spectral values in the bands in the blue region of the spectrum using either the Otsu method or an ad-hoc percentile-based thresholding method.

Because emissivity is an intrinsic property of the surface, multispectral thermal infrared emissivity data have the potential for enhancing our ability to monitor landscape changes in environmentally sensitive zones beyond what is currently possible from standard practices used today. The most common of these practices is the use of visible to short-wave infrared data, in particular the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Two algorithms are currently used to generate the LST&E products from MODIS data, but studies have identified several issues with both these algorithms that limit their usefulness for land cover change detection. These issues have been recently addressed by applying the ASTER Temperature Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm to MODIS thermal infrared data to generate LST and a dynamically varying multispectral emissivity product for bands 29, 31, and 32 at 1-km resolution. The new product (MOD21) will be released with MODIS Collection 6 during fall 2013. This study demonstrates the utility of the dynamic MOD21 multispectral emissivity product to detect land cover changes over a broad range of different Earth surface domains including land degradation in dryland regions, snow melt characteristics on glaciers and ice sheets, extreme ecosystem disturbances, and agricultural activities. The MOD21 spectral emissivity provided increased sensitivity to land cover change in a more consistent manner than is currently possible with other emissivity products and, depending on the application, standard visible to near infrared (VNIR) data. The results suggest that synergistic use of thermal and VNIR data will help us to better identify and understand changes in the Earth surface system, and reduce uncertainties in estimating their magnitudes and trends.

The existing retrieval scheme utilizes only the horizontal (H) polarization measurement from a single channel (10.65 GHz). This physically-based approach requires a relatively large number of parameters, and it generally suffers from large biases/errors due to the difficulty in determining the correct parameters. This study characterizes these errors in order to improve the retrieval performance. Through model sensitivity analysis, this study finds that a dual polarization approach (using both horizontal and vertical polarizations) is needed to infer the correct vegetation opacity and correct polarization mixing measured by the space-borne sensor. Revisions are then made to the LSMEM formulations and soil moisture retrieval algorithm by 1) combining two vegetation parameters and one roughness parameter into one effective vegetation optical depth (VOD) value; and 2) providing an additional model equation that estimates the effective VOD from both polarizations and an initial guess of soil moisture value. The new retrieval algorithm is implemented to produce a daily 0.25 degrees gridded soil moisture dataset based on observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E). Validations are performed globally against land surface model simulations and at local/point scale against in-situ data within the continental United States. The new retrievals are shown to have good and robust performance over most parts of the world in terms of reproducing the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture.

We found excellent agreement between peak fire radiant heat flux data (<1% error) derived from near-coincident ground radiometers and AMS. Both MODIS and GOES imager active fire products were negatively influenced by the presence of thick smoke, which was misclassified as cloud by their algorithms, leading to the omission of fire pixels beneath the smoke, and resulting in the underestimation of their retrieved fire radiative power (FRP) values for the burn plot, compared to the reference airborne data. Agreement between airborne and spaceborne FRP data improved significantly after correction for omission errors and atmospheric attenuation, resulting in as low as 5% difference between Aqua/MODIS and AMS. Use of in situ fuel and fire energy estimates in combination with a collection of AMS, MODIS, and GOES FRP retrievals provided a fuel consumption factor of 0.261 kg MJ(-1), total energy release of 14.5e + 06 MJ, and total fuel consumption of 3.8e + 06 kg.

The specific goal here was to evaluate (and understand) the strengths and limits of these algorithms in predicting CDOM dynamics along a gradient of varying water quality in a large, freshwater ecosystem. The data were collected in May and October of 2012 from the estuarine areas of the Kawkawlin and Saginaw Rivers, and Lake Huron. Algorithms were evaluated through comparisons to in-situ CDOM measurements, such that the analysis of these field measurements showed that CDOM levels in these areas displayed a range of CDOM absorption coefficients a(CDOM)(440) (0.1-8.5 m(-1)). In general, the majority of the algorithms underestimated high CDOM waters(a(CDOM)(440)>2 m(-1)) and overestimated low CDOM scenarios (<0.5 m(-1)). Six algorithms that performed consistently better compared with the other models (overall RMSE of <0.45) in estimating in-situ CDOM levels were three empirical, two semi-analytical, and one MIM algorithms. Our analysis identified a set of parameters for the matrix inversion methods (MIM) that allow them to work effectively across a broad range of CDOM levels. Analysis of our results indicated that the most effective wavelengths/band locations for estimating CDOM could vary depending on the levels of spectral interference from high concentrations of particulate matter in the water column. In addition, our results suggest that including wavelengths > 600 nm in the algorithms improves CDOM estimation accuracy significantly, particularly for complex freshwater environments.

Although light detection and ranging (LIDAR) is effective at measuring surface elevations, laser penetration is limited in dense salt marsh vegetation. In a previous study, we found that LIDAR-derived digital elevation model (DEM) error varied with vegetation cover. We derived cover-class-specific correction factors to reduce these errors, including separate corrections for three different height classes of Spartina alterniflora, the dominant macrophyte in southeastern U.S. salt marshes. In order to apply these cover class-specific corrections, it is necessary to have information on the distribution of cover classes in a LIDAR-derived DEM. Hyperspectral imagery has been shown to be suitable for the separation of salt marsh vegetation species by spectral signatures, and can be used to determine cover classes; however, there is persistent confusion both among the different height classes of S. alterniflora and between plants and mud (the Spartina problem). This paper presents a method to overcome the respective limitations of MAR and hyperspectral imagery through the use of multisensor data. An initial classification of hyperspectral imagery based on the maximum likelihood classification algorithm was used in a decision tree in combination with elevation and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from the hyperspectral imagery to map nine salt marsh cover classes. The derision tree appreciably reduced the Spartina problem by reassigning classes using these ancillary data and resulted in a final overall classification accuracy of 90%, with a quantity disagreement of 1% and an allocation disagreement of 9%. The resulting hyperspectral image classification was then used as the basis for applying cover class-specific elevation correction factors to the LIDAR-derived DEM. Applying these correction factors greatly improved the accuracy of the DEM: overall mean error decreased from 0.10 +/- 0.12 (SD) to -0.003 +/- 0.10 m, and root mean squared error from 0.15 to 0.10 m. Our results suggest that the use of decision trees to combine elevation and spectral information can aid both hyperspectral image classification and DEM elevation mapping. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We conducted trials at 5 plots within a conifer stand at Sierra National Forest in August, 2008. Foliage profiles retrieved from these two lidar systems are closely correlated (e.g., r = 0.987 at 100 m horizontal distances) at large spatial coverage while they differ significantly at small spatial coverage, indicating the apparent scanning perspective effect on foliage profile retrievals. Also we noted the obvious effects of local topography on foliage profile retrievals, particularly on the topmost height retrievals. With a fine spatial resolution and a small beam size, terrestrial lidar systems complement the strengths of the airborne lidars by making a detailed characterization of the crowns from a small field site, and thereby serving as a validation tool and providing localized tuning information for future airborne and spaceborne lidar missions.

An algorithm for the remote sensing of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), as an indicator of cyanobacterial biomass, has been developed using a time series of Landsat images and in situ measurements. In situ measured reflectance spectra were resampled to Landsat bands, and the near infrared (NIR) band, R-535, was found to be well represented by a linear relationship to Chl-a (R-2 = 0.847; Standard error, SE = 55 mu g l(-1); Samples, N = 14) for concentrations up to 800 lig l(-1). The band ratio R-835/R-660 also showed a strong linear relationship with Chl-a (R-2 = 0.811; SE = 61 mu g l(-1), N = 14). Similar relationships were derived using Landsat satellite imagery and monthly in situ Chl-a data for the period Nov 2003-Feb 2905. The NIR:Red ratio gave a better fit to Chl-a than a single NIR band algorithm when applied to satellite imagery, and the ratio performed best when based on TOA reflectance rather than atmospherically corrected data. Hence an algorithm for Chl-a was derived based on the TOA Landsat reflectance ratio, R-835/R-660, which showed a strong fit against Chl-a (R-2 = 0.801; SE = 69 mu g l(-1), N = 33) despite the limitations of time coincidence for the available satellite-in situ matches (less than 8 days). Lesser Flamingos feed on cyanobacteria in saline-alkaline lakes, therefore the algorithm can be used to monitor changes in their food supply, providing valuable information for their future conservation. The study also allowed characterisation of the optical properties in Lake Bogoria and provides insight into the changes occurring during cyanobacterial bloom and die-off events.

While remote sensing has increasingly been used for vegetation mapping, this spatially explicit approach can be challenging due to the spectral similarity between various vegetation types and the presence of complex features in the urban environment. The objective of this study is to develop a method that can help improve vegetation mapping in urban areas from medium-resolution remote sensor imagery. Central to our method is the combined use of stratified classification and multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) techniques. Specifically, we firstly partition the entire landscape into rural and urban subsets using road network density so that each subset can be processed independently to minimize the spectral confusion between some urban features and agricultural land covers. Secondly, we carefully extract all vegetation covers at the sub-pixel level for the urban subset by using the MESMA technique in order to account for small, fragmented vegetation patches that would be classified as non-vegetated classes otherwise. Thirdly, we adopt a separate supervised classification protocol to the rural subset and the vegetation covers extracted from the urban subset. Finally, we combine the classified outcomes from the two subsets to produce a complete map. We have implemented this method to produce a land cover map including various vegetation types from a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image covering a large metropolitan area. It is found that this method has substantially outperformed two related ones that use the same supervised protocol to the entire area directly or to the rural subset and the urban subset without being MESMA processed. The advantage of our method is that it has extended the capability of sub-pixel analysis beyond vegetation abundance estimation and into the area of mapping thematic vegetation types in urban areas.

This can be performed by extrapolating the aerosol optical properties to the visible from the near-infra-red (NIR) spectral region assuming that seawater is totally absorbent in this latter part of the spectrum, the so-called black pixel assumption. While this assumption is verified for most phytoplankton dominated waters, it is invalid in turbid waters. Consequently, for the past ten years, several algorithms have been developed on alternative assumptions. Studies comparing these algorithms are of great interest for further improvement in water leaving radiance (L-w(lambda)) retrievals from satellite images explaining the focus of the present research. Four published atmospheric correction algorithms for MODIS-Aqua are compared: (1) the standard NIR algorithm of NASA, (2) the NIR similarity spectrum algorithm, (3) the NIR-SWIR algorithm and (4) an Artificial Neural Network algorithm. The MODIS-Aqua estimated normalized L-w(lambda) are validated with AERONET-Ocean Color data and cruise measurements presenting moderately to highly turbid waters. Based on a match-up exercise, the former three algorithms show the best results in the green region of the spectrum (relative error, RE, between 11 and 20%) and the largest errors in the blue and red region of the spectrum (RE exceeding 30%). In contrast, the Artificial Neural Network algorithm performs better in the red band (RE of 22%). The latter tends to overestimate the normalized L-w(lambda) at all wavelengths while the NIR similarity spectrum algorithm tends to underestimate it. Retrievals of aerosol products, such as the Angstrom coefficient, alpha(531,869), and the optical thickness, iota(869), present RE above 44% and 72%, respectively.   The performance of the algorithms is also investigated as a function of water types. For water masses mainly dominated by phytoplankton, the standard NIR algorithm performs better. In contrast, for water masses mainly dominated by detrital and mineral material, the neural network-based algorithm shows the best results. The largest errors are encountered above water masses dominated by high phytoplankton and CDOM concentrations. This work conducted to a number of perspectives for improving the atmospheric correction algorithms. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data can be used to map flooded area in these wetlands, given its ability to provide continuous information without being heavily affected by cloud cover. As part of JAXA\'s Kyoto & Carbon Initiative, extensive wide-swath, multi-temporal SAR coverage of the Amazon basin has been obtained using the ScanSAR mode of ALOS PALSAR This study presents a method for monitoring flood extent variation using ALOS ScanSAR images, tested at the Curuai Lake floodplain, in the lower Amazon River, Brazil. Twelve ScanSAR scenes were acquired between 2006 and 2010, including seven during the 2007 hydrological year. Water level records, field photographs, optical images (Landsat-5/TM and MODIS/Ferra and Aqua) and topographic data were used as auxiliary information. A data mining algorithm allowed the implementation of a hierarchical, object-based classification algorithm, able to map land cover types and flooding status in the study area for all available dates. land cover based on the entire time series (classification levels 1 and 2) had overall accuracies of 90% and 83%, respectively. Level 3 classifications (one map per image date) were validated only for the lowest and highest water stages, with overall accuracies of 76% and 78%, respectively. Total flood extent (Level 4) was mapped with 84% and 94% accuracies, for the low and high water stages, respectively. Regression models were fitted between mapped flooded area and water levels at the Curuai gauge to predict flood extent. A polynomial model had R-2=0.95 (p<0.05) and an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 241 km(2), while a logistic model had R-2=0.98 (p<0.05) and RMSE = 127 km(2). (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

DISPATCH (DISaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale CHange) distributes high-resolution soil moisture around the low-resolution observed mean value using the instantaneous spatial link between optical-derived soil evaporative efficiency (ratio of actual to potential evaporation) and near-surface soil moisture. The objective is three-fold: (i) evaluating DISPATCH at a range of spatial resolutions using readily available multi-sensor thermal data, (ii) deriving a robust calibration procedure solely based on remotely sensed data, and (iii) testing the linear or nonlinear behavior of soil evaporative efficiency. Disaggregated soil moisture is compared with the 0-5 cm in situ measurements collected each month from April to October 2011 in a 20 km square spanning an irrigated and dry land area in Catalunya, Spain. The target downscaling resolution is set to 3 km using MODIS data and to 100 m using ASTER and Landsat data. When comparing 40 km SMOS, 3 km disaggregated and 100 m disaggregated data with the in situ measurements aggregated at corresponding resolution, results indicate that DISPATCH improves the spatio-temporal correlation with in situ measurements at both 3 km and 100 m resolutions. A yearly calibration of DISPATCH is more efficient than a daily calibration. Assuming a linear soil evaporative efficiency model is adequate at kilometric resolution. At 100 m resolution, the very high spatial variability in the irrigated area makes the linear approximation poorer. By accounting for non-linearity effects, the slope of the linear regression between disaggregated and in situ measurements is increased from 0.2 to 0.5. Such a multi-sensor remote sensing approach has potential for operational multi-resolution monitoring of surface soil moisture and is likely to help parameterize soil evaporation at integrated spatial scales.

Semi-analytical models can be used to retrieve the absorption and backscattering properties of dissolved and suspended materials unique to these environments, and subsequently biogeochemical parameters such as total suspended material (TSM) and chlorophyll (Chl). In this study, optical data collected over several years are used to select and optimize a semi-analytical ocean color algorithm for the dynamic and optically complex Long Island Sound estuary. The most successful algorithm requires a red reflectance channel between 600 and 650 nm, which is not included in many current ocean color sensors, but is essential in highly scattering waters. Regional optimization including the use of a dynamic, spectrally variable f/Q a value related to the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), results in an approximately five-fold decrease in retrieval bias in highly backscattering, sediment-laden waters near river outflows. Retrievals of dissolved and particulate spectral absorption, backscattering, dissolved and detrital absorption coefficients and total suspended matter obtained from the optimized algorithm agree well with field observations (r(2) >= 0.90). These parameters are useful for assessing riverine discharge, mixing and residence times of surface waters, as well as assessing the turbidity and light penetration in this estuary. Estimation of Chl remains challenging (r(2) = 0.59) due to the stepwise nature of the algorithm and the relatively high proportion of dissolved and non-algal constituents masking phytoplankton absorption (generally <20% of total absorption at 440 nm). Moreover, diverse phytoplankton assemblages throughout the region create variability between spectral absorption and chlorophyll and highlight the benefits of increased spectral resolution of ocean color satellites going forward.

The study area consisted of three management units, two of which were unlogged, while the third unit was selectively logged at a low intensity (approximately 10-15 m(3) ha(-1) or 5-8% of total volume). A systematic random sample of fifty 0.25-ha ground plots were measured and used to construct lidar-based regression models for above ground biomass (AGB). A lidar model-assisted approach was used to estimate AGB for the logged and unlogged units (using both synthetic and model-assisted estimators). Two lidar explanatory variables, computed at a spatial resolution of 50 m x 50 m, were used in these predictions: 1) the first quartile height of all above ground returns (P25); and, 2) variance of the height above ground of all returns (VAR). The model-assisted AGB estimator (total 231,589 Mg +/- 5,477 SE; mean 231.6 Mg ha(-1) +/- 5.5 SE; +/- 2.4%) was more precise than plot-only simple random sample estimator (total 230,872 Mg +/- 10,477 SE; mean 230.9 Mg ha(-1) +/- 10.5 SE; +/- 4.5%). The total and mean AGB estimates obtained using the synthetic estimator (total 231,694 Mg; mean 231.7 Mg ha(-1)) were nearly equal those obtained using the modelassisted estimator. In a second component of the analysis lidar metrics were also computed at 1 m x 1 m resolution to identify areas impacted by logging activities within the selectively harvested management unit. A high-resolution canopy relative density model (RDM) was used in GIS to identify and delineate roads, skidtrails, landings and harvested tree gaps. The area impacted by selective logging determined from the RDM was 58.4 ha or 15.4% of the total management unit. Using these two spatial resolutions of lidar analyses it was possible to identify differences in AGB in selectively logged areas that had relatively high levels of residual overstory canopy cover. The mean AGB obtained from the synthetic estimator was significantly lower in impacted areas than in undisturbed areas of the selectively logged management unit (p = 0.01).

Climate and its variability drive vegetation fractional cover over time and space. For savanna ecosystems, precipitation plays the main role in shaping vegetation composition. In this study, we estimate land cover fraction at a satellite pixel scale by employing an existing \'Mean-Sensitivity Unmixing Algorithm\' (MSUA), which is based on a state space defined by two key variables: (1) mean pixel values (referring to mean vegetation states), and (2) inter-annual sensitivity of pixel values to precipitation (referring to vegetation sensitivity to precipitation). We define these two variables through a multi-sensor assessment of three vegetation remote sensing datasets, namely (i) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), based on the visible and near-infrared bands from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR); (ii) backscatter coefficients (dB) from the NASA QuikSCAT active-microwave scatterometer; and (iii) Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) based on NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on EOS (AMSR-E) passive-microwave radiometry measurements. A merged satellite-gauge precipitation dataset from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) version 3B42V6 is used. The three remote sensing datasets show generally similar but distinctive performances in characterizing the two key variables over various land cover types. NDVI and VOD perform better than dB in characterizing land cover variation based on mean pixel values; while dB represents more reliable and robust vegetation sensitivity to precipitation. By using NDVI for mean vegetation states and dB for inter-annual variability of vegetation to precipitation, we develop an improved fractional cover product. We find that our product agrees well with the tree fraction derived from high-resolution images for natural vegetation regions, and can reproduce the distinctive land cover pattern of grass and bare soil in the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover product. For cropland-mixed regions, our tree fraction is overestimated since human impacts (e.g. irrigation) have not been accounted for in the MSUA. The improved performance from our approach is achieved by the synergistic use of the three vegetation remote sensing datasets, and their physical interpretations have been discussed to support the validity of this approach.

In recent years, many studies have explored this topic using hyperspectral, multispectral, and LiDAR data. In this study we analyzed two multi-sensor set-ups: 1) airborne high spatial resolution hyperspectral images combined with LiDAR data; and 2) high spatial resolution satellite multispectral images combined with LiDAR data. Two LiDAR acquisitions were considered: low point density (approx. 0.48 points per m(2)) and high point density (approx. 8.6 points per m(2)). The aims of this work were: i) to understand what level of classification accuracy can be achieved using a high spectral and spatial resolution multi-sensor data set-up (very high spatial and spectral resolution airborne hyperspectral images integrated with high point density LiDAR data), over a mountain area characterized by many species, both broadleaf and coniferous; ii) to understand the implications of a downgrading of the data characteristics (in terms of spectral resolution of spectral data and point density of LiDAR data), on species separability, with respect to the previous set-up; and iii) to understand the differences between high- and low-point density LiDAR acquisitions on tree species classification. The study region was a mountain area in the Southern Alps characterized by many tree species (7 species and a \"non-forest\" class), either coniferous or broadleaf. For each set-up a specific processing chain was adopted, from the pre-processing of the raw data to the classification (two classifiers were used: support vector machine and random forest). Different class definitions were tested, including general macro-classes, forest types, and finally single tree species. Experimental results showed that the set-up based on hyperspectral data was effective with general macro-classes, forest types, and single species, reaching high kappa accuracies (93.2%, 82.1% and 76.5%, respectively). The use of multispectral data produced a reduction in the classification accuracy, which was sharp for single tree species, and still high for forest types. Considering general macro-classes, the multispectral set-up was still very accurate (85.8%). Regarding LiDAR data, the experimental analysis showed that high density LiDAR data provided more information for tree species classification with respect to low density data, when combined with either hyperspectral or multispectral data.

In areas of ungauged or poorly gauged water bodies, satellite altimetry acts as a powerful tool to measure changes in surface water level. Remote sensing provides images of temporal coastline variations, and a combination of both measurement techniques can indicate a change in water volume. In this study variations of the water level of the Aral Sea were computed for the period 2002-2011 from the combination of radar and laser satellite altimetry data sets over the lake. The estimated water levels were analyzed in combination with coastline changes from Landsat images in order to obtain a comprehensive picture of the lake water changes. In addition to these geometrical observations temporal changes of water storage in the lake and its surrounding were computed from GRACE satellite gravimetry. With respect to its temporal evolution the GRACE results agree very well with the geometrical changes determined from altimetry and Landsat. The advancing desiccation until the beginning of 2009 and a subsequent abrupt gain of water in 2009-2010 due to exceptional discharge from Amu Darya can clearly be identified in all data sets.

This is because a combined use is supposed to improve the results of e.g. forest modeling tasks compared to single-data use. To explore the ability of combined airborne 2D and 3D information to describe the forest structure in local level, we employed various height/intensity metrics from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data and original reflectance, indices, and linear transformations of airborne hyperspectral HyMap data to build spatial models of stem density, above ground total biomass, and biomass of coniferous species in a temperate forest site in Germany. The study area was stratified into coniferous, deciduous and mixed strata using the plot information from forest inventory data. Combinations of data sources were tested, and an evolutionary Genetic Algorithm (GA) was used to tailor the numerous predictor variables to final parsimonious sets. Most Similar Neighbor (MSN) approach based on variance-weighted canonical correlations were used to make simultaneous single-Nearest Neighbor (NN) models of the attributes, where NN was searched either within the whole geographical domain or within the restricted forest strata. Results were evaluated by leave-one-out cross validations on 1000 bootstrap resample data. They showed that the LiDAR height metrics (descriptive statistics and percentiles) provided the most effective information amongst the entire data source combinations, while the HyMap metrics contributed only slightly to describe the variation beyond those explained by ALS data. Furthermore, restricted NN search improved the performance and returned approximately unbiased models of all the responses. The GA-screened HyMap predictors corresponded well to the atmospheric windows in visual and NIR domains, as well as to the mean reflectance curve of Scots Pine across the study area. It is concluded that GA-screened models featuring 9-12 predictors containing LiDAR height metrics and few HyMap original channels can be suggested for timely-efficient, unbiased modeling of area-based forest structural attributes.

Information about them would benefit silviculture, wood procurement, and biodiversity management. Cost-efficient inventory methods are needed and airborne LiDAR is a promising addition to fieldwork. The overstory, however, obstructs wall-to-wall sampling of the understory using LiDAR, because transmission losses affect echo-triggering probabilities and intensity (peak amplitude) observations. We examined the potential of LiDAR in mapping of understory trees in pine (Pinus sylvestris L) stands (62 degrees N, 24 degrees E), using careful experimentation. We formulated a conceptual model for the transmission losses and illustrated that loss normalization is highly ill-posed, especially for vegetation. The losses skew the population of targets that produce a subsequent echo. Losses up to 10-15% can occur even if an overstory echo is not triggered. In LiDAR sensors, quantized intensity values start from binary zero, but actually should include an offset, the noise level. We estimated these empirically. Constraining to low-loss pulses and ground data, we estimated parameters for compensation models that were based on the radar equation and employed the geometry of the pulse, as well as the overstory intensity observations as predictors. Intensity variation of second-return data was reduced, but, the intensity data were deemed of low value in species discrimination. Our results highlight differences between sensors in near-ground echo-triggering and height data. Area-based LiDAR height metrics from the understory had reasonable correlation with the density and mean height of the understory trees, whereas tree species seemed out of reach even if the transmission losses were compensated for. We conclude that transmission losses are a general impediment for radiometric analysis of multi-echo pulses in discrete-return and waveform LiDAR data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We have developed a high resolution (250 m) ocean color satellite tool to monitor sediment concentrations in the Bay. In situ optical and sediment sampling is used to develop a total suspended matter (TSM) algorithm for the Chesapeake Bay. The Coastal Optical Characterization Experiment (COCE) is part of an ongoing effort to optically characterize processes and to develop regional remote sensing ocean color algorithms in the coastal waters. The goal is to characterize sediment concentrations and to develop a tool to track plumes cascading down the Bay following heavy rainfall events. Background TSM concentrations in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed can also be characterized. The plumes can have potentially devastating effects on the Chesapeake Bay\'s fragile ecosystem by increasing nutrient loads, depositing sediments, and decreasing salinity and light levels. Sampling took place throughout 2006 to 2008 in the upper and mid portions of the Chesapeake Bay. Measurements of TSM, chlorophyll a (Chl), and hyperspectral optics were collected. The optical measurements included above water surface irradiance (E-s(lambda)), in-water downwelling irradiance (E-d(lambda)) and in-water upwelling radiance (L-u(lambda)). These optical data were used to analyze the performance and utility of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua Band 1 (645 nm) for use as a TSM monitoring tool. From the optical measurements we have derived a 3rd order polynomial regression of TSM to normalized water-leaving radiance (r(2) = 0.79) to form an algorithm that quantitatively relates TSM to the MODIS 250 m resolution band 1 (645 nm). The algorithm performance was validated (a mean percent difference of -4.2%) against 270 total suspended solids samples collected by the Chesapeake Bay Program during routine water quality monitoring of the Chesapeake Bay environment. The TSM algorithm tool is then used to demonstrate monitoring of significant runoff events that occurred in June, 2006 and March, 2008. In addition, the utility of the Chesapeake Bay TSM product is demonstrated by describing regional and seasonal variations in sediment concentrations throughout the Chesapeake Bay for 2009. Mean concentrations ranged from 11.55 mg/l in the upper Chesapeake Bay winter season to 6.37 mg/l in the middle Chesapeake Bay spring season. These remote sensing tools can be valuable instruments in the detection and tracking of runoff events and background concentration for monitoring the health and recovery of the Chesapeake Bay.

For Terra MODIS, the impact of blue band (Band 3.470 nm) degradation on simulated surface reflectance was most pronounced at near-nadir view angles, leading to a 0.001-0.004 yr(-1) decline in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) under a range of simulated aerosol conditions and surface types. Observed trends in MODIS NDVI over North America were consistent with simulated results, with nearly a threefold difference in negative NDVI trends derived from Terra (17.4%) and Aqua (6.7%) MODIS sensors during 2002-2010. Planned adjustments to Terra MODIS calibration for Collection 6 data reprocessing will largely eliminate this negative bias in detection of NDVI trends. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The brightness and spectrum of this light depends on the biomass content of the ocean, such that variations in the color of the ocean can be observed even from space. Rayleigh scattering by pure sea water, and Rayleigh-Gans type scattering by plankton, causes this light to be polarized with a distinctive angular distribution. To study the contribution of this underwater light polarization to multiangle, multispectral observations of polarized reflectance over ocean, we previously developed a hydrosol model for use in underwater light scattering computations that produces realistic variations of the ocean color and the underwater light polarization signature of pure sea water. In this work we review this hydrosol model, include a correction for the spectrum of the particulate scattering coefficient and backscattering efficiency, and discuss its sensitivity to variations in colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and in the scattering function of marine particulates. We then apply this model to measurements of total and polarized reflectance that were acquired over open ocean during the MILAGRO field campaign by the airborne Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP). Analyses show that our hydrosol model faithfully reproduces the water-leaving contributions to RSP reflectance, and that the sensitivity of these contributions to Chlorophyll a concentration [Chl] in the ocean varies with the azimuth, height, and wavelength of observations. We also show that the impact of variations in CDOM on the polarized reflectance observed by the RSP at low altitude is comparable to or much less than the standard error of this reflectance whereas their effects in total reflectance may be substantial (i.e. up to >30%). Finally, we extend our study of polarized reflectance variations with [Chl] and CDOM to include results for simulated spaceborne observations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We test the theoretical performance of the Chang algorithm for estimating snow mass from passive microwave measurements using the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) snow microwave emission model. The algorithm\'s dependence upon assumptions of fixed and uniform snow density and grainsize is determined, and measurements of these properties made at the Cold Land Processes Experiment (CLPX) Colorado field site in 2002-2003 used to quantify the retrieval errors caused by differences between the algorithm assumptions and measurements. Deviation from the Chang algorithm snow density and grainsize assumptions gives rise to an error of a factor of between two and three in calculating snow mass. The possibility that the algorithm performs more accurately over large areas than at points is tested by simulating emission from a 25 km diameter area of snow with a distribution of properties derived from the snow pit measurements, using the Chang algorithm to calculate mean snow-mass from the simulated emission. The snow mass estimation from a site exhibiting the heterogeneity of the CLPX Colorado site proves only marginally different than that from a similarly-simulated homogeneous site. The estimation accuracy predictions are tested using the CLPX field measurements of snow mass, and simultaneous SSM/I and AMSR-E measurements. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The Imatong Central Forest Reserve (ICFR) in South Sudan together with the nearby Dongotana Hills and the Agoro-Agu Forest Reserve (AFR) in Northern Uganda share a boundary and encompass a biologically diverse montane ecosystem. This study used satellite data combined with general human population trends to examine the impact of armed conflict and its outcome on similar forest ecosystems both during and after hostilities have occurred. A Disturbance Index (DI) was used to investigate the location and extent of forest cover loss and gain in three areas for two key time periods from mid-1980s to 2001 and 2003 to 2010. Results indicate that the rate of forest recovery was significantly higher than the rate of disturbance both during and after wartime in and around the ICFR and the net rate of forest cover change remained largely unchanged for the two time periods. In contrast, the nearby Dongotana Hills experienced relatively high rates of disturbance during both periods; however, post war period losses were largely offset by some gains in forest cover. For the AFR in Uganda, the rate of forest recovery was much higher during the second period, coinciding with the time people began leaving overcrowded camps. The diversity and merging of floristic regions in a very narrow band around the lmatong Mountains makes this area biologically distinct and of outstanding conservation importance; therefore, any future loss in forest cover is important to monitor - particularly in South Sudan where large numbers of people continue to return following the 2005 peace agreement and the 2011 Referendum on Independence.

Focusing on Romania, we asked how the drastic institutional and socio-economic transformation after the collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe affected forestry. We used an annual time series of Landsat images to investigate how three phases of forest restitution affected forest disturbances (due to both, natural events and forest management). We employed the LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery) set of change detection algorithms to perform temporal segmentation and fitting of the Landsat time series, and derived annual disturbance maps (95.72% overall accuracy) along with recovery dynamics. Our change map suggested that forest disturbances increased substantially since the collapse of socialism in 1989, with 75,000 ha of disturbed forest land (4.5% of the total studied forest area). Whereas the late socialist years were characterized by relatively low disturbance levels (12% of all detected disturbances), disturbances increased especially after each of the restitution laws were passed in 1991, 2000, and 2005 (34%, 21% and 32% respectively). Non-state ownership regimes (i.e. private owners vs. public property of local communities) and species composition of restituted forests were two important factors determining disturbance levels. The widespread disturbances we found also raise concerns about timber overexploitation in many areas of the Romanian Carpathians. Our study demonstrates the value of the temporal depth of the Landsat archive and highlights that trajectory-based change detection approaches can be highly beneficial for gaining insights on the effect of institutional shocks on land use patterns.

Based on an in situ coccolithophore data set from the North Atlantic, the detection levels with the new scheme were between 1,500 and 1,800 coccolithophore cells/mL and 43,000 and 78,000 liths/mL The detected bloom area using the OWT method was an average of 1.75 times greater than the default bloom detector based on a collection of SeaWiFS 1 km imagery. The versatility of the scheme is shown with SeaWiFS, MODIS Aqua, CZCS and MERIS imagery at the 1 km scale. The OWT scheme was applied to the daily global SeaWiFS imagery mission data set (years 1997-2010). Based on our results, average annual coccolithophore bloom area was more than two times greater in the southern hemisphere compared to the northern hemisphere with values of 2.00 x 10(6) km(2) and 0.75 x 10(6) km(2), respectively. The new algorithm detects larger bloom areas in the Southern Ocean compared to the default algorithm, and our revised global annual average of 2.75 x 10(6) km(2) is dominated by contributions from the Southern Ocean.

Until 1975 there were just three mega cities in the world: New York, Tokyo and Mexico City - today there are 27 cities having more than the defined 10 million inhabitants. This paper presents a straight forward, application-oriented approach using multi-temporal remotely sensed data to systematically monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics of the world\'s urban giants. Object-oriented and pixel-based classification image analysis techniques are applied to Landsat as well as to TerraSAR-X data in order to define urbanized areas of the mega cities at different points of time. Subsequently post-classification change detection is performed on urban footprint level. With time intervals of about 10 years almost 40 years of urbanization are monitored, showing different dimensions, dynamics and patterns across the analyzed cities. The generated urban footprint products show accuracies consistently higher than 80%, allowing for further applications in fields such as urban planning, risk management, or population assessment.

However the literature reports a consistent underestimate of tree height when using physically based methods, necessitating empirical corrections. This bias is a result of overestimating the range to the canopy top due to background noise and failing to correctly identify the ground.   This paper introduces a method, referred to as \"noise tracking\", to avoid biases when determining the range to the canopy top. Simulated waveforms, created with Monte-Carlo ray tracing over geometrically explicit forest models, are used to test noise tracking against simple thresholding over a range of forest and system characteristics. It was found that noise tracking almost completely removed the bias in all situations except for very high noise levels and very low (<10%) canopy covers. In all cases noise tracking gave lower errors than simple thresholding and had a lower sensitivity to the initial noise threshold.   Finite laser pulses spread out the measured signal, potentially overriding the benefit of noise tracking. In the past laser pulse length has been corrected by adding half that length to the signal start range. This investigation suggests that this is not always appropriate for simple thresholding and that the results for noise tracking were more directly related to pulse length than for simple thresholding. That this effect has not been commented on before may be due to the possible confounding impacts of instrument and survey characteristics inherent in field data. This method should help improve the accuracy of waveform lidar measurements of forests, whether using airborne or spaceborne instruments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we assess the influence of freshwater lakes on the observed brightness temperature of AMSR-E in winter conditions. The study focuses on the geographic region of Finland, where lakes account for 10% of the total terrestrial area. We present a method to mitigate for the influence of lakes through forward modeling of snow covered lakes, as a part of a microwave emission simulation scheme of space-borne observations. We apply a forward model to predict brightness temperatures of snow covered sceneries over several winter seasons, using available data on snow cover, vegetation and lake ice cover to set the forward model input parameters. Comparison of model estimates with space-borne observations shows that the modeling accuracy improves in the majority of examined cases when lakes are accounted for, with respect to the case where lakes are not included in the simulation. Moreover, we present a method for applying the correction to the retrieval of Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) in lake-rich areas, using a numerical inversion method of the forward model. In a comparison to available independent validation data on SWE, also the retrieval accuracy is seen to improve when applying the influence of snow covered lakes in the emission model.

The variation caused by directional reflectance anisotropy hampers image-based solutions. In addition, trees show considerable within-species variation in reflectance properties. We examined these phenomena at the single-tree level, using the Leica ADS40 line sensor and XPro software, which constitute the first photogrammetric large-format multispectral system to provide target reflectance images. To analyze the influence of illumination conditions in the canopy, we developed a method in which the crown shape as well as between-tree occlusions and shading were modeled, using dense LiDAR data. The precision of the ADS40 reflectance images in well-defined surfaces was 5% as coefficient of variation when 1-4-km image data were fused. The range of reflectance anisotropy was +/- 30% for trees near the solar principal plane, with differences between bands and species. Because of the anisotropy differences observed, the spectral separability of the tree species in different bands is dependent on the view-illumination geometry. The within-species variation was high; the coefficient of variation was 13-31%. The contribution of tree and stand variables to anisotropy-normalized reflectance variation was examined. The effects of the species composition of adjacent trees were substantial in NIR and this variation hampers spectral classification in mixed stands. We also studied species- and band-specific intracrown brightness patterns, and we suggest their use as high-order image features in species classification. A species classification accuracy of up to 80% was obtained using 4-km data, which showed the high potential of the ADS40. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Physical characteristics and chemical compositions of soils controlled by pedogenetic processes, climatic changes and land use imply different types of environmental transformations. Reflectance spectroscopy is an alternative soil mapping technique that uses spectral absorption features between visible (VIS) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths (0.3-2.5 mu m) for determining soil mineralogy. Soil analysis by means of reflectance spectroscopy and orbital optical sensors have provided favorable results in mapping transformation processes in environmental systems, particularly in arid and semiarid climates in extra-tropical terrains. In the case of inter-tropical environments, these methods cannot be readily applied due to local factors such as lack of exposed regolith, high amounts of soil moisture and the presence of dense vegetation. This study uses Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and reflectance spectroscopy data to map mineral components of soils covering a part of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, which could be linked to key aspects of environmental transformations in this tropical area (e.g., climate change, shifts in agriculture fronts, ph, and soil characteristics). We collected forty-two (42) soil samples at a depth of 0-20 cm, considering that this superficial layer corresponds to the highest correlation with soil properties detected by the ASTER sensor. These samples were measured using a FieldSpec FR spectrometer, and the derived spectra were interpreted for mineral composition. Interpretation was supported by X-ray diffraction analysis on the same samples. The spectral signatures were re-sampled to ASTER VNIR (AST1 -4: 0.52-0.86 mu m) and SWIR (AST5-9: 1.60-2.43 mu m) spectral bandwidths and validated by comparing reflectance spectra of field samples with those extracted from atmospherically corrected and calibrated ASTER pixels. The agreement between spectral signatures measured from soil samples and those derived from ASTER imagery pixels proved plausible, with R-2 correlation values ranging from 0.6493 to 0.7886. This signifies that diagnostic spectral features of key minerals in tropical soils can be mapped at the spectral resolution of 9-band ASTER VNIR through SWIR reflectance. We used these spectral signatures as end-members in hyperspectral routine classifications adapted for use with ASTER data. Results proved possible the identification and remote mapping of minerals such as kaolinite, montmorillonite and gibbsite, as well as the distinction between iron-rich and iron-poor soils.

The parameter optimization approach relied on goodness of fit between model simulations and tower estimates of gross primary production and net ecosystem production (NEP). Parameters such as light use efficiency CLUE) and base rate of heterotrophic respiration varied widely between sites representing different plant functional types (PFTs), thus supporting the value of stratification by PFT when parameterizing the model. Where multiple EC sites were available within a PFT, overall prediction error and bias in mean NEP was reduced by cross-site optimization as opposed to reliance on a single site. Optimization with the MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) instead of MODIS FPAR resulted in a similar goodness of fit, however, LUE values were pushed to levels that were not physiologically realistic when using EVI. The increasing availability of gap-filled EC tower data is rapidly improving the opportunities for direct coupling of satellite and ground observational data for parameterizing of diagnostic carbon flux models.

The transformation is based on the difference between MIR and NIR in conjunction with the distance from a convergence point in the MIR/NIR space, representative of a totally burnt surface. One of the derived coordinates presents a small scatter for pixels associated to vegetated surfaces (strict scale) whereas the other one covers a wide range of values (large scale) that suggest its use as a proxy of water content of vegetation. The strict scale character of the first coordinate together with the large scale character of the second one make the coordinate system especially adequate to discriminate vegetated surfaces and rank them according to the water content, from green and dry to burned vegetation. The performance of the new coordinate system is then assessed against than traditional ratio or modified ratio indices (namely the Vegetation Index, the Burned Area Index and the Global Environmental Monitoring Index, modified to the MIR/NIR space) and it is shown that the new coordinate system provides better information than traditional indices, opening interesting perspectives for burned area discrimination and other applications like drought monitoring.

Semi-analytical algorithms for estimating constituent concentrations are effective and easy to implement, but two challenges remain. First, a dataset without a sampling bias is needed to calibrate estimation models; and second, the semi-analytical indices were developed based on several specific assumptions that may not be universally applicable. In this study, a semi-analytical model-optimizing and look-up-table (SAMO-LUT) method was proposed to address these two challenges. The SAMO-LUT method is based on three previous semi-analytical models to estimate chlorophyll a, tripton and CDOM. Look-up tables and an iterative searching strategy were used to obtain the most appropriate parameters in the models. Three datasets (i.e., noise-free simulation data, in situ data and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) satellite data) were collected to validate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that the SAMO-LUT method yields error-free results for the ideal simulation dataset; and is able also to accurately estimate the water constituent concentrations with an average bias (mean normalized bias, MNB) lower than 9% and relative random uncertainty (normalized root mean square error, NRMS) lower than 34% even for in situ and MERIS data.

The monitoring of land surface processes will greatly benefit from this type of data if biophysical variables such as Leaf Area Index (LAI) can be retrieved from it. However, the large amounts of data that will become available call for methods satisfying constraint of (i) portability across different landscapes, (ii) independence from field measurements and (iii) computational efficiency. Currently, the most suitable technique to approach this objective is neural network inversion of radiative transfer. This paper quantifies the performance of such approach for a specific crop (winter wheat) all along the growing season. By re-defining the retrieved biophysical variable as Green Area Index (GAI) and correcting the typical saturation effect that affects the estimation of higher values, this study shows that physically-based retrieval can yield similar results to those obtained by empirical methods such as stepwise linear regression (with an relative RMSE of 24.7% and 22.8% respectively). The research further shows how a trained neural network for a specific sensor can produce a GAI map from imagery acquired from different viewing conditions without a significant loss in accuracy.

Using dense (similar to annual) Landsat time series (LTS), we can now characterize vegetation change over large areas at an annual time step and at the spatial grain of anthropogenic disturbance. Additionally, we expect more accurate detection of subtle disturbances and improved characterization in terms of both timing and intensity. For Landsat change detection in this new era of dense LTS, new detection algorithms are required, and new approaches are needed to calibrate those algorithms and to examine the veracity of their output. This paper addresses that need by presenting a new tool called TimeSync for syncing algorithm and human interpretations of LTS. The tool consists of four components: (1) a chip window within which an area of user-defined size around an area of interest (i.e., plot) is displayed as a time series of image chips which are viewed simultaneously, (2) a trajectory window within which the plot spectral properties are displayed as a trajectory of Landsat band reflectance or index through time in any band or index desired, (3) a Google Earth window where a recent high-resolution image of the plot and its neighborhood can be viewed for context, and (4) an Access database where observations about the LTS for the plot of interest are entered. In this paper, we describe how to use TimeSync to collect data over forested plots in Oregon and Washington. USA, examine the data collected with it, and then compare those data with the output from a new LTS algorithm, LandTrendr, described in a companion paper (Kennedy et al., 2010). For any given plot, both TimeSync and LandTrendr partitioned its spectral trajectory into linear sequential segments. Depending on the direction of spectral change associated with any given segment in a trajectory, the segment was assigned a label of disturbance, recovery, or stable. Each segment was associated with a start and end vertex which describe its duration. We explore a variety of ways to summarize the trajectory data and compare those summaries derived from both TimeSync and LandTrendr. One comparison, involving start vertex date and segment label, provides a direct linkage to existing change detection validation approaches that rely on contingency (error) matrices and kappa statistics. All other comparisons are unique to this study, and provide a rich set of means by which to examine algorithm veracity. One of the strengths of TimeSync is its flexibility with respect to sample design, particularly the ability to sample an area of interest with statistical validity through space and time. This is in comparison to the use of existing reference data (e.g., field or airphoto data), which, at best, exist for only parts of the area of interest, for only specific time periods, or are restricted thematically. The extant data, even though biased in their representation, can be used to ascertain the veracity of TimeSync interpretation of change. We demonstrate that process here, learning that what we cannot see with TimeSync are those changes that are not expressed in the forest canopy (e.g., pre-commercial harvest or understory burning) and that these extant reference datasets have numerous omissions that render them less than desirable for representing truth.

During the hydrological year 2006-2007, 43 ASAR/Envisat images of Donana, mostly in HH and VV polarizations, were acquired with the aim to monitor the flood extent evolution during an entire flooding cycle. The images were ordered in the seven ASAR incidence angles, also referred to as swaths, to achieve high observation frequency.   In this study, backscattering temporal signatures of the main land cover types in Donana were obtained for the different incidence angles and polarizations. Plots showing the sigma degrees HH/sigma degrees VV ratio behavior were also produced. The signatures were analyzed with the aid of miscellaneous site data in order to identify the effect of the flooding on the backscattering. Conclusions on the feasibility to discriminate emerged versus flooded land are derived for the different incidence angles, land cover types and phenological stages: intermediate incidence angles (ASAR IS3 and IS4) came up as the most appropriate single swaths to discriminate open water surface from smooth bare soil in the marshland deepest areas. Flood mapping in pasture lands, the most elevated regions, is feasible at steep to mid incidence angles (ASAR IS1 to IS4). In the medium elevation zones, colonized by large helophytes, shallow incidence angles (ASAR IS6 and IS7) enable more accurate flood delineation during the vegetation growing phase.   Since Donana land covers require different observation swaths for flood detection, the composition of different incidence angle images close in time provides the optimum flood mapping. Such composition is possible four times per ASAR 35-day orbit cycle, using pairs of 12-h apart IS1/IS6 and IS2/IS5 Donana images. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

A new methodology for the separation of different vegetation strata was implemented using supervised classification of a two-dimensional feature space spanned by ALS return height (terrain corrected) and intensity. The classification was carried out using Gaussian mixture models tuned on a control plot. The approach was validated using extensive field measurements from treated plots, ranging from single vegetation strata to a more complex multi-layered ecosystem. Plot-level canopy profiles derived from ALS and from a geometric reconstruction based on field measurements were in very good agreement, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.73 (for complex, 3-layered) to 0.96 (simple, single-layered). In addition, it was possible to derive plot-level information on layer height, vertical extent and coverage with absolute accuracies of some decimetres (simple plots) to a meter (complex plots) for both height and vertical extent and about 10 to 15% for layer coverage. The approach was then used to derive maps of the layer height, vertical extent and percentage of ground cover for a larger area, and classification accuracy was evaluated on a per-pixel basis. The method performed best for single-layered plots or dominant layers on multi-layered plots, obtaining an overall accuracy of 80 to 90%. For subdominant layers in the more complex plots, accuracies obtained were as low as 48%.   Our results demonstrate the possibility of deriving qualitative (presence and absence of specific vegetation layers) and quantitative, physical data ( height, vertical extent and ground cover) describing the vertical structure of complex multi-layered forest ecosystems using ALS-based height and intensity information.

Bubonic plague occurs most often in humans through a flea bite, when a questing flea fails to find a rodent host. For many of the plague foci in Kazakhstan the great gerbil is the major host of plague, a social rodent well-adapted to desert environments. Intensive monitoring and prevention of plague in gerbils started in 1947, reducing the number of human cases and mortalities drastically. However, the monitoring is labour-intensive and hence expensive and is now under threat due to financial constraints. Previous research showed that the occupancy rate of the burrow systems of the great gerbil is a strong indicator for the probability of a plague outbreak. The burrow systems are around 30 m in diameter with a bare surface. This paper aims to demonstrate the automatic classification of burrow systems in satellite images using object-oriented analysis. We performed field campaigns in September 2007 and May and September 2008 and acquired corresponding QuickBird images of the first two periods. User\'s and producer\'s accuracy values of the classification reached 60 and 86%, respectively, providing proof of concept that automatic mapping of burrow systems using high-resolution satellite images is possible. Such maps, by better defining great gerbil foci, locating new or expanding foci and measuring the density of great gerbil burrow systems could play a major role in a renewed monitoring system by better directing surveillance and control efforts. Furthermore, if similar analyses can separate occupied burrow systems from empty ones, then very-high-resolution images stand to play a crucial role in plague surveillance throughout central Asia.

It is shown that remote sensing estimates can provide an adequate supplementary data source to in situ data series of the top 5 m water layer, provided that a sufficient number of matchups for a site specific maximum temporal offset are available.

It is an extension of PROSPECT, a widely used leaf optical properties model that regards the leaf as a pile of N absorbing and diffusing elementary plates. In FluorMODleaf, fluorescence emission of an infinitesimal layer of thickness dx is integrated over the entire elementary plate. The fluorescence source function is based on the excitation spectrum of diluted isolated thylakoids and on the emission spectra of isolated photosystems, PSI and PSII, which are the main pigment-protein complexes involved in the initial stages of photosynthesis. Scattering within the leaf is produced by multiple reflections within and between elementary plates. The input variables of FluorMODleaf are: the number of elementary plates N, also called leaf structure parameter, the total chlorophyll content C-ab, the total carotenoid content C-cx, the equivalent water thickness C-w, and the dry matter content C-m (or leaf mass per area), as in the new PROSPECT-5, plus the sigma(II)/sigma(I), ratio referring to the relative absorption cross section of PSI and PSII, and the fluorescence quantum efficiency of PSI and PSII, tau(I) and tau(II), that are introduced here as mean fluorescence lifetimes. The model, which considers the reabsorption of emitted light within the leaf, allows good quantitative estimation of both upward and downward apparent spectral fluorescence yield (ASFY) at different excitation wavelengths from 400 nm to 700 nm. It also emphasizes the role of scattering in fluorescence emission by leaves having high chlorophyll content. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

DLM was conceived as a plate model with a stochastic distribution of different groups of layers. Leaf asymmetry was modeled by assigning non-uniform distributions of pigments, water and dry matter to palisade and mesophyll layers and by simulating different amounts of light diffusion for adaxially and abaxially incident light. Surface reflections are based on micro-facets theory enabling the simulation of directional-hemispherical reflectance and a range of bidirectional reflectance factors. Adaxial and abaxial optical properties could be accurately simulated for a variety of leaf types with an overall error in reflectance and transmittance below 1.3%. Sensitivity analysis focused on optimizing model inversion schemes improves parameter estimation accuracy. Different inversion schemes were compared for two independent datasets. Results underpin most of the propositions of the sensitivity analysis: (i) masking the near-infrared wavelengths (band weighting) to account for variability in the dry matter composition consistently increased predicted accuracies for dry matter content, (ii) white reflectance measurements (reflectance with a 100% diffusely reflecting background) provided results superior to other optical measurements, making it a valuable and fast alternative and (iii) combining reflectance and transmittance into absorptance however did not result in improvements. Comparisons of DLM with the PROSPECT 5 model indicate an almost equal performance in content estimations. Improvements were thus not related to differences in model structure but to techniques that reduce the impact of leaf structure and compensate for sampling errors and variations in specific absorption spectra. DLM has important potential in the study of leaf radiative transfer and in the integration with canopy radiative transfer models. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The onset of lake growth varies by up to one month inter-annually, and lakes form and drain at progressively higher altitudes during the melt season.

Co-registration issues are problematic and need to be addressed if there are few/no suitable stationary tie points at or near sea level within the images. Methods are presented that use Radarsat ScanSAR images to reliably measure sub-pixel displacements with errors of less than or similar to +/- 0.25 pixels but this estimate is target dependent. The techniques and issues are illustrated using examples from a long-term study of the Mertz Glacier Tongue in East Antarctica. For image pairs only a few days apart, this extensive structure forms an excellent grid-like test pattern which provides up to 5000 valid correlation matches.

It is well understood that epiphylls inhibit light interception by host plants, but their effect on remote sensing of colonized forests has not been examined. Incorporating leaf-level spectra from Terra Firme (primary forest) and Amazonian Caatinga (woodlands/forest growing on nutrient-deficient sandy soils), we used the GeoSAIL model to propagate leaf-level measurements to the canopy level and determine their effect on commonly used vegetation indices. In Caatinga, moderate infestations (50% leaf area epiphyll cover), lowered simulated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) values by 6.1% and 20.4%, respectively, largely due to near infrared dampening. Heavy infestation (100% cover) simulations exhibited decreases 1.5-2 times greater than those of moderate infestations. For Terra Firme, which are generally less affected by epiphylls, moderate (20% leaf area) and heavy infestations (40%) lowered EVI by 4.4% (S.D. 0.8%) and 8.1% (S.D. 1.5%), respectively. Near infrared and green reflectance were most affected at the canopy level, showing mean decreases of 10.6% (S.D. 2.25%) and 9.5% (S.D. 3.49%), respectively, in heavy Terra Firme infestations. Time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data corroborated the modeling results, suggesting a degree of coupling between epiphyll cover and the EVI and NDVI. These results suggest that, without explicit consideration of the presence of epiphylls, remote sensing-based methodologies may underestimate leaf area index, biomass and productivity in humid forests.

An important part of the delta ecosystem is the riparian corridor, which is supported by agricultural return flows and waste spills of water originating in the U.S. and Mexico. These flows may be curtailed in the future due to climate change and changing land use practices (out-of-basin water transfers, increased agricultural efficiency, and more optimal management of dams) in the U.S. and Mexico, and resource managers need to monitor the effects of their water management practices on these ecosystems. We developed ground-validated, remote sensing methods to monitor the vegetation status, habitat value, and water use of wetland and riparian ecosystems using multi-temporal, multi-resolution images. The integrated methodology allowed us to project species composition, leaf area index, fractional cover, habitat value, and evapotranspiration over seasons and years throughout the delta, in response to variable water flows from the U.S. to Mexico. Waste spills of water from the U.S. have regenerated native cottonwood and willow trees in the riparian corridor and created backwater and marsh areas that support birds and other wildlife. However, the main source of water supporting the riparian vegetation is the regional aquifer recharged by underflow from U.S. and Mexico irrigation districts. Native trees have a short half-life in the riparian zone due to human-set fires and harvesting for timber. Active management, monitoring, and restoration programs are needed to maintain the habitat value of this ecosystem for the future.

This study presents a new method for monitoring vegetation by using NDVI and LST data, based on an orbital drift corrected dataset derived from data provided by the GIMMS (Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies) group. This method, named Yearly Land Cover Dynamics (YLCD), characterizes NDVI and LST behavior on a yearly basis, through the retrieval of 3 parameters obtained by linear regression between NDVI and normalized LST data. These 3 parameters are the angle between regression line and abscissa axis, the extent of the data projected on the regression line, and the regression coefficient. Such parameters characterize respectively the vegetation type, the annual vegetation cycle length and the difference between real vegetation and ideal cases. Worldwide repartition of these three parameters is shown, and a map integrating these 3 parameters is presented. This map differentiates vegetation in function of climatic constraints, and shows that the presented method has good potential for vegetation monitoring, under the condition of a good filtering of the outliers in the data.

Remote sensing methods can efficiently assess crop residue cover and related tillage intensity over many fields in a region. Although the reflectance spectra of soils and crop residues are often similar in the visible, near infrared, and the lower part of the shortwave infrared (4001900 nm) wavelength region, specific diagnostic chemical absorption features are evident in the upper shortwave infrared (1900-2500 nm) region. Two reflectance band height indices used for estimating residue cover are the Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI) and the Lignin-Cellulose Absorption (LCA) index, both of which use reflectances in the upper shortwave infrared (SWIR). Soil mineralogy and composition will affect soil spectral properties and may limit the usefulness of these spectral indices in certain areas. Our objectives were to (1) identify minerals and soil components with absorption features in the 2000 nm to 2400 nm wavelength region that would affect CAI and LCA and (2) assess their potential impact on remote sensing estimates of crop residue cover. Most common soil minerals had CAI values <= 0.5, whereas crop residues were always >0.5, allowing for good contrast between soils and residues. However, a number of common soil minerals had LCA values>0.5, and, in some cases, the mineral LCA values were greater than those of the crop residues, which could limit the effectiveness of LCA for residue cover estimation. The LCA of some dry residues and live corn canopies were similar in value, unlike CAI. Thus, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or similar method should be used to separate out green vegetation pixels. Mineral groups, such as garnets and chlorites, often have wide ranges of CAI and LCA values, and thus, mineralogical analyses often do not identify individual mineral species required for precise CAI estimation. However, these methods are still useful for identifying mineral soils requiring additional scrutiny. Future advanced multi- and hyperspectral remote sensing platforms should include CAI bands to allow for crop residue cover estimation. Published by Elsevier Inc.', '[Serbin, Guy; Daughtry, Craig S.

Plot-level biomass was calculated using allometric relationships between tree attributes and biomass. A small footprint portable laser profiler then flew over these inventory plots to develop a generic airborne LiDAR-based biomass equation (R-2=0.65, n=207). The same airborne LiDAR system flew along four portions of orbits of the ICESat Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS). A square-root transformed equation was developed to predict airborne profiling LiDAR estimates of aboveground dry biomass from GLAS waveform parameters combined with an SRTM slope index (R-2=0.59, n = 1325). Using the 104,044 quality-filtered GLAS pulses obtained during autumn 2003 from 97 orbits over the study area, we then predicted aboveground dry biomass for the main vegetation areas of Quebec as well as for the entire Province south of the treeline. Including cover type covariances both within and between GLAS orbits increased standard errors of the estimates by two to five times at the vegetation zone level and as much as threefold at the provincial level. Aboveground biomass for the whole study area averaged 39.0 +/- 2.2 (standard error) Mg ha(-1) and totalled 4.9 +/- 0.3 Pg. Biomass distributions were 12.6% northern hardwoods, 12.6% northern mixedwood, 38.4% commercial boreal, 13% non-commercial boreal, 14.2% taiga, and 9.2% treed tundra. Non-commercial forests represented 36% of the estimated aboveground biomass, thus highlighting the importance of remote northern forests to C sequestration. This study has shown that space-based forest inventories of northern forests could be an efficient way of estimating the amount, distribution, and uncertainty of aboveground biomass and carbon stocks at large spatial scales.

The approach employed here involved time-series TIR data acquired from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and a linear spectral mixture analysis. An automated algorithm was applied to derive emissivity image endmembers. Evaluation of the chosen endmembers revealed that they can be categorized into five major spectra classes based on diagnostic absorption features. Each spectrum has been identified in relation to mineral abundance and soil arrangement that are common in playa settings: A, \"clayey silt-rich crust\"; B, \"intermediate-salt crust\"; C, \"quartz-rich deposit\"; D, \"salt-rich rough crust\"; E, \"sulfate-rich crust\". Spectral classes A-B-C-D yielded the lowest RMS errors (0-0.025) over time in the iterative deconvolution algorithm between the measured and modeled spectra. The produced fractional abundance images show high areal concentrations for clayey silt-rich crust, salt-rich rough crust, and quartz-rich deposit, as the first surficial mapping of Soda Lake. Significant changes in the spatial relationships of the major surface sediments in Soda Lake were observed after a flooding event (2005) and a relatively dry period (2006). The approach utilized in this study can be advantageous for continuous monitoring of environments characterized by a small area and a complex surface, which may enable a better understanding of their responses to climate changes and potential for dust emissions.

Regression analysis identified moderate strength, yet statistically significant relationships between SWE and T-B differences (36.5-18.7; 36.5-10.7; 18.7-10.7) for individual seasons. When multiple seasons were considered collectively, however, the 36.5-18.7 and 36.5-10.7 differences were insignificant because the seasonal linear relationships shifted from year to year over the same T-B range regardless of SWE. This inter-seasonal consistency in T-B was explained through significant correlations with vegetation density as characterized by a MODIS-derived forest transmissivity dataset. More encouraging results were found for the 18.7-10.7 difference: the relationship with SWE remained statistically significant when multiple years were considered together, and the 18.7-10.7 difference was not significantly associated with vegetation density. Additional snow survey data from the Northwest Territories (2005-2007) were used to verify the 18.7-10.7 relationship with SWE across the northern boreal forest. These results suggest use of the 18.7-10.7 T-B difference, rather than the traditional 36.5-18.7 T-B difference, is necessary to capture inter-seasonal SWE variability across forested regions.

First, it is checked that the coupled models allow for a realistic simulation of the seasonal and interannual variability of NDVI over three sampling sites from 1999 to 2004. The data assimilation scheme relies on a parameter identification technique based on an Evolution Strategies algorithm. The simulated above-ground herbage mass resulting from NDVI assimilation is then compared to ground measurements performed over 13 study sites during the period 1999-2004. The assimilation scheme performs well with 404 kg DM/ha of average error (n=126 points) and a correlation coefficient of r=0.80 (to be compared to the 463 kg DM/ha and r=0.60 of the model performance without data assimilation). Finally, the sensitivity of the herbage mass model estimates to the quality of the meteorological forcing (rainfall and net radiation) is analyzed thanks to a stochastic approach.

They consist in hindcast experiments assimilating an operational dataset (Sea Surface Temperature (SST), in-situ profiles of temperature and salinity and Sea Level Anomalies (SLA)) and various simulated SMOS and Aquarius Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) data.

A linear optimization scheme was used to derive SCA estimates that preserve the statistical moments of the higher spatial resolution (i.e. 30 m) ETM+ data and resolve the superior temporal signal (i.e. similar to daily) of the MODIS data. It was found that merging the two SCA products led to an 8% decrease and an 18% increase in the basinwide SWE in 2001 and 2002, respectively, compared to the SWE estimated from ETM+ only. Relative to SWE simulations using only ETM+ data, the hybrid SCA estimates reduced the mean absolute SWE error by 17 and 84% in 2001 and 2002, respectively; errors were determined using intensive snow survey data and two separate methods of scaling snow survey field measurements of SWE to the 1-km model pixel resolution. SWE bias for both years was reduced by 49% and skewness was reduced from -0.78 to 0.49. These results indicate that the hybrid SWE was closer to being an unbiased estimate of the measured SWE and errors were distributed more normally. The accuracy of the SCA estimates is likely dependent on the vegetation fraction.

Estimation of incident photosynthetically active radiation from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer data. Journal of Geophysical Research, I 11, D15208. doi:10.1029/2005fDO06730]. However, the operational system for PAR retrieval described here contains several improvements. The algorithm utilizes MODIS 113 data combining MODIS land surface products and BRDF model parameters products to directly estimate diffuse PAR, direct PAR and total PAR. Times-series data interpolation removes the noise and cloud contamination of land surface reflectance. PAR is retrieved by searching look-up tables calculated using a radiative transfer model. The system can automatically process MODIS 113 data to generate instantaneous and daily PAR. The instantaneous PAR products are compared with observational data from seven ChinaFLUX stations, and daily total PAR estimates are compared with those estimates of global radiation from 98 meteorological stations over China. The results indicate that this approach can produce reasonable PAR estimates, although this method overestimates PAR for low values of PAR. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The assemblage of Landsat spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, over a reasonably sized image extent, results in imagery that can be processed to represent land cover over large areas with an amount of spatial detail that is absolutely unique and indispensable for monitoring, management, and scientific activities. Recent technical problems with the two existing Landsat satellites, and delays in the development and launch of a successor, increase the likelihood that a gap in Landsat continuity may occur. In this communication, we identify the key features of the Landsat program that have resulted in the extensive use of Landsat data for large area land cover mapping and monitoring. We then augment this list of key features by examining the data needs of existing large area land cover monitoring programs. Subsequently, we use this list as a basis for reviewing the current constellation of earth observation satellites to identify potential alternative data sources for large area land cover applications. Notions of a virtual constellation of satellites to meet large area land cover mapping and monitoring needs are also presented. Finally, research priorities that would facilitate the integration of these alternative data sources into existing large area land cover monitoring programs are identified. Continuity of the Landsat program and the measurements provided are critical for scientific, environmental, economic, and social purposes. It is difficult to overstate the importance of Landsat; there are no other systems in orbit, or planned for launch in the short-term, that can duplicate or approach replication, of the measurements and information conferred by Landsat. While technical and political options are being pursued, there is no satellite image data stream poised to enter the National Satellite Land Remote Sensing Data Archive should system failures occur to Landsat-5 and -7.

The corrected measurements show much less high frequency variability than their original counterparts, which makes them suitable to study vegetation dynamics. The time series are used here to estimate the start and ending dates of the growing season for 18 years from 1982 to 1999. We focus on the interannual variations of these phenological parameters.   A database of in situ phenology observations is used to quantify the accuracy of the satellite-based estimates. Although based on a limited sampling of the Northern mid and high latitudes, the comparison indicates that i) the satellite phenological product contains meaningful information on interannual onset anomalies; ii) there is a higher degree of consistency over regions covered by Broadleaf Forests, Grasses and cereal Crops than over those covered by Needleleaf Forests or Savannas; and iii) the satellite phenological product is of lower quality in regions with mountainous terrain. In favorable conditions, interannual variations of the onset are captured with an accuracy of a few days.   As this satellite-derived product captures the interannual onset variability at ground-truth sites, we confidently use it to larger scales studies. Mapped at a continental scale, the onset anomalies show coherent patterns at the regional (approximate to 1000 km) scale for the mid and high latitudes of the Northern hemisphere, which is consistent with a meteorological forcing. In the tropics, there is larger spatial heterogeneity, which suggests more complex controls of the phenology. The relation between vegetation phenology and climate is further investigated over Europe by comparing the variability of the satellite-derived vegetation onset and that of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation index, at a fine spatial scale. The strong correlations observed confirm that this climate forcing parameter explains most of the onset variability over a large fraction of Northern Europe (earlier onsets for positive winter NAO), with lower impact towards the south and opposite effects around the Mediterranean basin. The NAO has a predictive character as the January-February NAO index is strongly correlated with the vegetation onset that occurs around April in Northern Europe. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

These refinements significantly improved the spatial coverage of LSTs, especially in highland regions, and the accuracy and stability of the MODIS LST products. Comparisons between V5 LSTs and in-situ values in 47 clear-sky cases (in the LST range from - 10 degrees C to 58 degrees C and atmospheric column water vapor range from 0.4 to 3.5 cm) indicate that the accuracy of the MODIS LST product is better than 1 K in most cases (39 out of 47) and the root of mean squares of differences is less than 0.7 K for all 47 cases or 0.5 K for all but the 8 cases apparently with heavy aerosol loadings.

The time series of V5 MODIS LST product over two sites (Lake Tahoe in California and Namco lake in Tibet) in 2003 are evaluated, showing that the quantity and quality of MODIS LST products depend on clear-sky conditions because of the inherent limitation of the thermal infrared remote sensing.

The bio-optical properties of the sampled waters span a wide range of variability, due to the various biogeochemical and physical processes occurring in this area. In-water hyperspectral remote sensing reflectances (R-rs) were acquired simultaneously with measurements of optically significant parameters at 93 stations. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis indicates that 74% of the total variance of R-rs is partly explained by particulate backscattering (b(bp)), while particulate and dissolved absorption only explain 15% of the ocean color variability. These results confirm, for the first time from in situ backscattering measurements, previous studies performed in other coastal environments. Whereas the amplitude factors of the first EOF mode are well correlated (r=0.75) with the particulate backscattering coefficient (bbP), the highest correlation (r=0.83) is found with the particulate backscattering ratio (b(bp)/b(p)). This result highlights the fundamental role of the nature of the bulk particulate assemblage in the ocean color variability. An unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis applied to our data set of normalized Rrs spectra, leads to five spectrally distinct classes. We show that the class-specific mean Rrs spectra significantly differ from one another by their bio-optical properties. Three classes particularly stand out: one class corresponds to a Phaeocystis globosa bloom situation, whereas the two others are associated with water masses dominated by mineral and non-living particles, respectively. Among the different bio-optical parameters, the particulate backscattering ratio, the chlorophyll concentration, and the particulate organic carbon to chlorophyll ratio, are the most class-specific ones. These different results are very encouraging for the inversion of bio-optical parameters from class-specific algorithms. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Suitable MIVIS spectral regions were used in a spectral classification procedure to map asbestos-cement roofs. The detected roofs were further analyzed using the obtained linear regression lines to estimate surfacing asbestos fiber abundance, using the MIVIS TIR range at 9.44 mu m, selected by means of the asbestos-cement detection limit analysis.   The results showed that a hyperspectral scanner with suitable operational characteristics allows for good clustering of AC roofs as a function of their deterioration status. Therefore, this technique can furnish government authorities with an efficient, rapid and. repeatable environmental mapping procedure that can provide information about the location of hazardous AC roofing sheets.

The rationale for this effort was to define the most suitable ocean colour algorithm for the reprocessing of the entire SeaWiFS archive over the Mediterranean region where standard algorithms were demonstrated to be inappropriate. Using a large dataset of coincident in situ chlorophyll and optical measurements, covering most of the trophic regimes of the basin, we validated two existing regional algorithms [Bricaud, A., E.

The results of our analysis confirmed that the OC4v4 performs worse than the two existing regional algorithms. Nonetheless, these two regional algorithms do show uncertainties dependent on chlorophyll values. Then, we introduced a better tuned algorithm, the MedOC4. Using an independent set of in situ chlorophyll data, we quantified the uncertainties in SeaWiFS chlorophyll estimates using the existing and new regional algorithms. The results confirmed that MedOC4 is the best algorithm matching the requirement of unbiased satellite chlorophyll estimates and improving the percentage of the satellite uncertainty, and that the NASA standard chlorophyll products are affected by an uncertainty of the order of 100%. Moreover, the analysis suggests that the poor quality of the SeaWiFS chlorophyll in the Mediterranean is not due to the atmospheric correction term but to peculiarities in the optical properties of the water column. Finally the observed discrepancy between the global and the regional bio-optical algorithms has been discussed analysing the differences between the two in situ datasets used for tuning the algorithms (SeaBASS versus ours). The main results are that methodological differences in the two datasets cannot play a major role and the inherent bio-optical properties of the basin can explain the observed discrepancy. In particular the oligotrophic water of the Mediterranean Sea is less blue (30%) and greener (15%) than the global ocean. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We show that a combination of down and up-looking observations provides sufficient measurement constraints for characterizing both aerosol and surface properties with minimal assumptions. In order to employ this concept in AERONET processing, the standard inverse algorithm [Dubovik, O. & King, M. D. (2000), A flexible inversion algorithm for retrieval of aerosol optical properties from sun and sky radiance measurements. Journal of Geophysical Research, 105, 20673-20696] has been modified to retrieve surface reflectance in addition to aerosol parameters when co-incident satellite measurements are available.   The method was applied to observations of smoke and desert dust over the Mongu (Zambia) and Solar Village (Saudi Arabia) AERONET sites respectively. The AERONET data were complemented by available observations from the MISR, MODIS, and POLDER-2 satellite sensors. The retrieved bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) and surface albedo comparison shows good agreement between results obtained using observations from different satellites.   The robustness of the method is tested by analyzing surface albedo time series retrieved during periods of high aerosol optical depth variability and low seasonal changes in surface reflectance. The analysis shows that the performance of retrieval algorithm is stable under different aerosol loadings. It is shown that much of the observed surface albedo temporal variability could be attributed mostly to the combined uncertainty in satellite radiometric calibration and aerosol vertical distribution for Mongu and to differences in satellite angular sampling on different days for Solar Village.   The sensitivity of surface retrievals to assumptions on aerosol vertical distribution and aerosol particle shape are analyzed. It is found that the maximum error in retrieved surface albedo at 0.44 mu m is 0.035 for aerosol optical depth 0.85 at 0.44 mu m. For aerosol optical depths lower than -0.7 the error in retrieved surface albedo is less than 0.02. Analysis of particle shape assumptions on surface retrievals showed that aerosol particle non-sphericity significantly affects the angular shape of BRF, but not the surface albedo.   Finally, the sensitivity of AERONET aerosol retrievals to uncertainty in assumed surface reflectance is analyzed by comparing aerosol retrievals obtained with different surface assumptions. It is found that the uncertainty in surface reflectance model employed in the version I AERONET operational algorithm is larger than was previously assumed in [Dubovik, O., Smimov, A., Holbert, B. N., King, M. D., Kaufman, Y. J., Eck, T. F., & Slutsker, 1. (2600), Accuracy assessment of aerosol optical properties retrieved from AERONET sun and sky radiance measurements. Journal of Geophysical Research, 105, 9791-9806] and may have more significant effect on the retrieved aerosol properties than was documented in that work. In particular, larger errors were encountered for the real part of the refractive index (-0.05-0.07 increase) and maximum of the particle size distribution (similar to 20% decrease) retrievals for the Mongu case, when the aerosol optical depth was relatively small (similar to 0.4 at 0.44 mu m). The retrieved single scattering albedo uncertainties were within the error bars (0.03) estimated in [Dubovik, O., Smimov, A., Holbert, B. N., King, M. D., Kaufman, Y. J., Eck, T. F., & Slutsker, I. (2000), Accuracy assessment of aerosol optical properties retrieved from AERONET sun and sky radiance measurements. Journal of Geophysical Research, 105, 9791-9806], with the exception of the 0.44 mu m retrievals for the desert dust case when they increased by - 0.09 and 0.07 for low and high aerosol loadings respectively.

The results revealed that as of 1973, 73.4% of the PAFE region was covered by forest. Since then, the proportion of forested area was quickly reduced to 40.7% by 1989 and further down to 24.9% by 2000. Two competing deforestation processes contributed to this rapid forest loss, with the first being driven by settlers and the second by large private land owners. During the 1989-2000 period, 80% of deforested areas were cleared by private land owners and 20% by the settlers. Protected areas slowed down forest loss within their boundaries, but not in their surrounding areas. The average percent forest loss in the area within 5 km from the boundary of Paraguay\'s major forested protected areas was 39% during the 1989-2000 period, which was essentially the same as that for the entire PAFE region during the same period. The high rates of forest loss in the areas surrounding the protected areas not only left the protected areas highly isolated as ecological \"islands\", they may also be precursors to rapid forest loss within the protected areas. These protected areas are critical to the conservation of many species endemic or limited to the PAFE region and surrounding areas, and should be continuously monitored using recent and future satellite observations.

Multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) is a technique that potentially addresses both challenges. MESMA models spectra as the linear sum of spectrally pure endmembers that vary on a per-pixel basis. Spatial variability is addressed by mapping sub-pixel components of land cover as a combination of endmembers. Spectral variability is addressed by allowing the number and type of endmembers to vary from pixel to pixel. This paper presents an application of MESMA to map the physical components of urban land cover for the city of Manaus, Brazil, using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) imagery.   We present a methodology to build a regionally specific spectral library of urban materials based on generalized categories of urban land-cover components: vegetation, impervious surfaces, soil, and water. Using this library, we applied MESMA to generate a total of H 37 two-, three-, and four-endmember models for each pixel; the model with the lowest root-mean-squared (RMS) error and lowest complexity was selected on a per-pixel basis. Almost 97% of the pixels within the image were modeled within the 2.5% RMS error constraint. The modeled fractions were used to generate Continuous maps of the per-pixel abundance of each generalized land-cover component. We provide an example to demonstrate that land-cover components have the potential to characterize trajectories of physical landscape change as urban neighborhoods develop through time. Accuracy of land-cover fractions was assessed using high-resolution, geocoded images mosaicked from digital aerial videography. Modeled vegetation and impervious fractions corresponded well with the reference fractions. Modeled soil fractions did not correspond as closely with the reference fractions, in part due to limitations of the reference data. This work demonstrates the potential of moderate-resolution, multispectral imagery to map and monitor the evolution of the physical urban environment. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The clear seasonal trends and the high accuracy of the retrieval are therefore valid for specific types of forest and question is if these findings extend to large areas with different forest types in a similar manner. Using multi-temporal ERS-1/2 coherence data and extensive sets of inventory data at stand level at seven forest compartments in Central Siberia we confirm that the trend of coherence as a function of stem volume is mainly driven by the environmental conditions at acquisition. In addition, we have now found that the variability of the coherence for a given stem volume are due to spatial variations of the environmental conditions, strong topography (slope > 10 degrees), small stand size (< 3-4 ha) and low relative stocking (< 50%). Further deviations can be related to errors in the ground data. Stein volume retrieval behaves consistently under stable winter frozen conditions. For stands larger than 3-4 ha and relative stocking of at least 50%, a. relative RMSE of 20-25% can be considered the effective retrieval error achievable in Siberian boreal forest. Combined with previous experience from managed test forests in Sweden and Finland, C-band ERS-1/2 tandem coherence observations acquired under stable winter conditions with a snow cover and an at least moderate breeze can be considered so far the most suitable spacebome remote sensing observable for the estimation of forest stem volume in homogeneous forest stands throughout the boreal zone.

Spectral unmixing procedures only determine the fractions of such classes within a coarse pixel without locating them in space. Super-resolution or sub-pixel mapping aims at providing a fine resolution map of class labels, one that displays realistic spatial structure (without artifact discontinuities) and reproduces the coarse resolution fractions. In this paper, existing approaches for super-resolution mapping are placed within an inverse problem framework, and a geostatistical method is proposed for generating alternative synthetic land cover maps at the fine (target) spatial resolution; these super-resolution realizations are consistent with all the information available.   More precisely, indicator coKriging is used to approximate the probability that a pixel at the fine spatial resolution belongs to a particular class, given the coarse resolution fractions and (if available) a sparse set of class labels at some informed fine pixels. Such Kriging-derived probabilities are used in sequential indicator simulation to generate synthetic maps of class labels at the fine resolution pixels. This non-iterative and fast simulation procedure yields alternative super-resolution land cover maps that reproduce: (i) the observed coarse fractions, (ii) the fine resolution class labels that might be available, and (iii) the prior structural information encapsulated in a set of indicator variogram models at the fine resolution.

NDVI also decreased at higher elevations and with higher substrate pH. In the coldest bioclimate subzone, increased elevation was not correlated with decreased NDVI. In the warmest tundra bioclimate subzone, especially in Alaska, NDVI did not decrease with the first several hundred meters of elevation. NDVI in this subzone varied more by region than by elevation or substrate chemistry, and was lowest in recently glaciated areas such as the Canadian Shield. Phytomass (above-ground plant biomass) was calculated from NDVI using a relationship derived from ground clip-harvest data.

The current methods of estimating the ET (or EF) from the gradient between land surface temperature (T-s) and near surface air temperature are very sensitive to the retrieval errors of T-s and the interpolation errors of air temperature from the ground-based point measurements. Two types of methods have been proposed to reduce this sensitivity: the thermal inertia method and the T-s-nonnalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (T-s-NDVI) spatial variation method. The former is based on the temporal difference between T-s retrievals, and the latter uses the spatial information of Ts. Another approach is proposed here that combines the advantages of the two types of methods and uses day-night T-s difference-NDVI (A T-s-NDVI). Ground-based measurements collected by Energy Balance Bowen Ratio systems at the 11 enhanced facilities located at the Southern Great Plains of the United States from April 2001 to May 2005 were analyzed to identify parameterization of EF. Delta T-s-NDVI spatial variations from the Aqua and Terra MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) global daily products, at 1 km resolution were used to estimate EF. Ground-based measurements taken during 16days in 2004 were used to validate the MODIS EF retrievals. The EFs retrieved from the spatial variations of Delta T-s-NDVI show a distinct improvement over that retrieved from the Delta T-s-NDVI. The EF can be retrieved with a mean relative accuracy of about 17% with the proposed AT,-NDVI spatial variations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

To achieve this goal, an accurate estimate of soil evaporation at the macro-scale level is necessary. By including the surface temperature of dry soil, the three temperatures model (3T model) was proposed as an estimate of E, and its temperature term was defined as the soil evaporation transfer coefficient (h(a)). Although it has been primarily shown that h(a) determines the boundaries of E, further studies of its properties are necessary because h(a) has the application potential for remote sensing. The objectives of this study are to (1) investigate the relationships between h(a) and those parameters that are important for E estimation but are not able to be remotely measured (aerodynamic resistance, soil surface resistance (r(s)), and cumulative evaporation (E-c)); and (2) discuss the possibility for remote sensing application. Two experiments were carried out for these purposes: one in an open field and the other one in a closed growth chamber at constant temperature, humidity, and radiation. The following results were obtained: (1) Given the boundaries of 0 <= h(a) <= 1, E was determined between its maximum value (potential evaporation rate) and minimum value (zero); (2) During the period when evaporation is controlled by r a linear relation between h(a) and log (r(s)) is observed with a coefficient of determination r(2)=0.76. Because h(a) and r(s) are independent variables with significant differences in properties and magnitudes, these results indicate that h(a) and r(s) are well related to each other; (3) During stage 1 of evaporation, cumulative evaporation (E-c) increased with time while h(a) remained constant. Afterwards, ha linearly increased with E-c. The relationships among h(a), E-c, r(a), and r(s) would be useful for estimation of evapotranspiration by remote sensing. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we report on a new technique for extracting the REP from hyperspectral data that aims to mitigate the discontinuity in the relationship between the REP and the nitrogen content caused by the existence of a double-peak feature on the derivative spectrum. It is based on a linear extrapolation of straight lines on the far-red (680 to 700 nm) and NIR (725 to 760 nm) flanks of the first derivative reflectance spectrum. The REP is then defined by the wavelength value at the intersection of the two lines. The output is a REP equation, REP=-(c(1)-c(2))/(m(1) - m(2)), where c(1) and c(2), and m(1) and m(2) represent the intercepts and slopes of the far-red and NIR lines, respectively. Far-red wavebands at 679.65 and 694.30 nm in combination with NIR wavebands at 732.46 and 760.41 nm or at 723.64 and 760.41 mn were identified as the optimal combinations for calculating nitrogen-sensitive REPs for three spectral data sets (rye canopy, and maize leaf and mixed grass/herb leaf stack spectra). REPs extracted using this new technique (linear extrapolation method) showed high correlations with a wide range of foliar nitrogen concentrations for both narrow and wider bandwidth spectra, being comparable with results obtained using the traditional linear interpolation, polynomial and inverted Gaussian fitting techniques. In addition, the new technique is simple as is the case with the linear interpolation method, but performed better than the latter method in the case of maize leaves at different developmental stages and mixed grass/herb leaves with a low nitrogen concentration.

Following this premise, the Moran\'s I spatial autocorrelation metric was proven to return values which differed significantly for areas characterised by dense interlocking thickets of the coral Acropora cervicornis versus areas populated by a sparse mixed coral assemblage dominated by Montastrea annularis. The different behaviour of the metric was sufficient to facilitate spatial discrimination of the two assemblages using a supervised classifier with accuracies that surpass the level of prediction offered by standard spectral-based methods. Discrimination was optimum when autocorrelation was evaluated within a moving window with side-lengths ranging between circa. 30-70 in. The discrimination ability is postulated to be linked to intrinsic differences in the spatial-patterning of the two assemblages at scales of tens of metres. The observed patterning can be further related to the growth form and architecture of the differing coral assemblages. The study demonstrates the potential of using kemel-based autocorrelation metrics in unison with satellite data and offers a pertinent tool for monitoring ecologically important coral assemblages that are statistically indistinct using traditional spectral methods.

Ultimately, the goal is to quantify the role of floodplains for partitioning water and sediment fluxes over the great fluvial basins of the world. SAR images are used to identify the type of surface (open water, inundated areas, forest) and, hence, the areas covered with water. Both radar altimetry data and in-situ hydrographic measurements yield water level time series. The basin of the Negro River, the tributary which carries the largest discharge to the Amazon River, was selected as a test site. By combining area estimates derived from radar images classification with changes in water level, variations of water volume (focusing on a seasonal cycle) have been obtained. The absence of relationship between water volume and inundated area, reflecting the diverse and widely dispersed floodplains of the basin, is one of the main result of this study.

A total of 24 vineyards were identified for field and airborne data collection with the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI), the Reflective Optics System Imaging Spectrometer (ROSIS) and the Digital Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (DAIS-7915) hyperspectral sensors in 2002 and 2003 in northern Spain, comprising 103 study areas of 10 x 10 m in size, with a total of 1467 leaves collected for determination of pigment concentration. A subsample of 605 leaves was used for measuring the optical properties of reflectance and transmittance with a Li-Cor 1800-12 Integrating Sphere coupled by a 200 gm diameter single mode fiber to an Ocean Optics model USB2000 spectrometer. Several narrow-band vegetation indices were calculated from leaf reflectance spectra, and the PROSPECT leaf optical model was used for inversion using the extensive database of leaf optical properties. Results showed that the best indicators for chlorophyll content estimation in V vinifera L. leaves were narrow-band hyperspectral indices calculated in the 700-750 nm spectral region (r(2) ranging between 0.8 and 0.9), with poor performance of traditional indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Results for other biochemicals indicated that the Structure Insensitive Pigment Index (SIPI) and the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) were more sensitive to carotenoids Cx+c and chlorophyll-carotenoid ratios C-ab/Cx+c than to chlorophyll content Cab. Chlorophyll a and b estimation by inversion of the PROSPECT leaf model on V vinifera L. spectra was successful, yielding a determination coefficient of r(2)=0.95, with an RMSE=5.3 mu g/cm(2). The validity of leaf-level indices for chlorophyll content estimation at the canopy level in V vinifera L. was studied using the scaling-up approach that links PROSPECT and rowMCRM canopy reflectance simulation to account for the effects of vineyard structure, vine dimensions, row orientation and soil and shadow effects on the canopy reflectance. The index calculated as a combination of the Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index (TCARI), and the Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) in the form TCARI/OSAVI was the most consistent index for estimating Cab on aggregated and pure vine pixels extracted from 1 m CASI and ROSIS hyperspectral imagery. Predictive relationships were developed with PROSPECT-rowMCRM model between Cab and TCARI/OSAVI as function of LAI, using field-measured vine dimensions and image-extracted soil background, row-orientation and viewing geometry values. Prediction relationships for C-ab content with TCARI/OSAVI were successfully applied to the 103 study sites imaged on 24 fields by ROSIS and CASI airborne sensors, yielding r(2)=0.67 and RMSE=11.5 mu g/cm(2).

The satellite instruments that provide these data include ASTER, Landsat ETM+, and MODIS, and this study demonstrates bow data from them can be used to map upwelling and circulation associated with the transport of heat, solutes, and particles in lakes. Upwelling in a density-stratified water body such as a lake or reservoir results from a surface wind stress being balanced by a horizontal pressure gradient, causing denser water to rise at the upwind lake boundary. Upwellings are considered partial when intermediate-depth water reaches the surface and total when bottom water surfaces. Upwellings are an important part of ecosystem functioning, since they transport nutrients from deeper in the lake, where they accumulate, to the surface layer, where they facilitate phytoplankton growth. Thermal infrared images acquired by ASTER, ETM+, and MODIS can be used to observe partial upwelling events in lakes and provide insight into their spatial variability and horizontal distribution, information totally lacking from conventional in situ measurements. At Lake Tahoe, partial upwellings were found to occur every few days throughout the spring and summer, transporting water from 10-30 in below the surface to the surface layer. They commonly display a jet-like appearance, traveling from the upwind to the downwind side of the lake, with current speeds of 12-17 cm/s. Partial upwellings were found to generally decrease lake clarity, although deeper upwelling events can increase clarity. Sinking zones, other convergence areas, and divergence areas were also observed. The temperature variability associated with upwelling, which could be clearly mapped in the thermal infrared satellite images, illustrates the advantage of synoptic thermal infrared satellite measurements over in situ point measurements alone for detecting upwelling events, since, depending on location, an in situ instrument might not capture an upwelling event. The spatial information conveyed by the synoptic satellite measurements can be used to help improve monitoring of the clarity and general water quality of Lake Tahoe. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The SIMS has been used over the past decade to provide a new image of the land displacements in the Venice region. The result exhibits a resolution never obtained before. The central lagoon, including the city of Venice, shows a general stability while the northern and southern lagoon extremities and their related catchment sectors sink with serious rates averaging 3 to 5 mm/year. The sinking rates increase up to 10 - 15 mm/year in the coastland south of the lagoon. Relatively small uplifts (less than 1 mm/year) are observed at the Alpine foothills and in a wide area comprised between the Euganean Hills and the lagoon. The observed land displacements have been associated to the geological features of the study region, i.e. tectonics, seismicity, differential consolidation of the middle-upper Pleistocene and Holocene deposits, and to anthropogenic activities, such as land reclamation and groundwater withdrawal.

The clumping index quantified the level of foliage grouping within distinct canopy structures, such as tree crowns, shrubs, and row crops, relative to a random distribution. Vegetation foliage clumping significantly alters its radiation environment and therefore affects vegetation growth as well as water and carbon cycles. The clumping index is useful in ecological and meteorological models because it provides new structural information in addition to the effective LAI retrieved from mono-angle remote sensing and allows accurate separation of sunlit and shaded leaves in the canopy. The relationship between an angular index (normalized difference between hotspot and darkspot) and the clumping index is explored using a geometrical optical model named \"4-Scale\". A simplified version of the mechanistic hotspot model used in 4-Scale is developed to derive the hotspot reflectance from multi-angle measurements for mapping purposes. An accurate clumping map for areas with significant tree (shrub) covers has been achieved, although further research is required to reduce topographic effects. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The study area known as Elkhorn Stough is an important natural reserve park located in the central California coast, USA. Satellite imagery such as IKONOS panchromatic and multispectral data provides a convenient way for supporting the monitoring process around this area. Within the proposed classification mechanism, the panchromatic image, benefited from its high resolution, mainly serves for extracting multiscale line features by means of wavelet transform techniques. The resulting multiscale line features are merged through a fuzzy fusion process and then incorporated into the MRF model accompanied with multispectral imagery to perform contextual classification so as to restrict the over-smooth classification patterns and reduce the bias commonly contributed by those boundary pixels. The MRF model parameter is estimated based on the probability histogram analysis to those boundary pixels, and the algorithm called maximum a posterior margin (MPM) is applied to search the solution. The results show that the proposed method, based on the MRF model with the multiscale fuzzy line process, successfully generates the patch-wise classification patterns, and simultaneously improved the accuracy and visual interpretation.

We note that in discussing categorical scale, the concept of spatial scale naturally arises, and in discussing spatial scale, the issue of aggregation of measurements must be considered. Therefore, and working towards an ultimate goal of producing multiscale, multigranular characterizations of land cover, we address here successively and in a cumulative fashion the topics of (1) aggregation of measurements across multiple scales, (2) adaptive choice of spatial scale, and (3) adaptive choice of categorical scale jointly with spatial scale. We show that the use of statistical finite mixture models with groups of original pixel-scale measurements, at successive spatial scales, offers improved pixel-wise classification accuracy as compared to the commonly used technique of label aggregation. We then show how a statistical model selection strategy may be used with the finite mixture models to provide a data,adaptive choice of spatial scale, varying by location (i.e., multiscale), from which classifications at least as accurate as those any single spatial scale may be achieved. Finally, we extend this paradigm to allow for jointly adaptive selection of spatial and categorical scale. Our emphasis throughout is on the empirical quantification of the role of the various elements above, and it comparison of their performance with standard methods, using various artificial landscapes. The methods proposed in this paper should be useful for I variety of scale-related land cover classification tasks. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The study demonstrates that for hyperspectral image data, linear regression models can be applied to quantify LAI and VOL with good accuracy. For broadband multispectral data, the accuracy was generally lower. It can be stated that the hyperspectral data set contains more information relevant to the estimation of the forest stand variables LAI and VOL than multispectral data. When the pooled data set was analysed, soil-line-related VI performed better than ratio-based VI. When age classes were analysed separately, hyperspectral VI performed considerably better than broadband VI. Best hyperspectral VI in relation with LAI were typically based on wavebands related to prominent water absorption features. Such VI are related to the total amount of canopy water; as the leaf water content is considered to be relatively constant in the study area, variations of LAI are retrieved. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

One obvious way is to merge these data streams together to provide robust merged climate data records with measurable uncertainty bounds. Here, we present and implement a formalism for merging global satellite ocean color data streams to produce uniform data products. Normalized water-leaving radiances (L-wN(lambda)) from SeaWiFS and MODIS are used together in a semianalytical ocean color merging model to produce global retrievals of 3 biogeochemically relevant variables (chlorophyll, combined dissolved and detrital absorption coefficient, particulate backscattering coefficient). The model-based merging approach has various benefits over techniques that blend end products, such as chlorophyll concentrations; (1) merging at the level of water-leaving radiance ensures simultaneity and consistency of the retrievals, (2) it works with single or multiple data sources regardless of their specific bands, (3) it exploits band redundancies and band differences, (4) it can account for the uncertainties of the incoming L-wN(lambda) data streams and, (5) it provides confidence intervals for the derived products. These features are illustrated through several examples of ocean color data merging using SeaWiFS and MODIS Terra and Aqua L-wN(lambda) imagery. Compared to each of the original data source, the products derived from the merging procedure show enhanced global daily coverage and lower uncertainties in the retrieved variables.

An automated spatial segmentation procedure was developed to identify and measure individual population objects or blobs within the forest population. To ensure the comparability of multiyear segmentation maps, an automated blob reconciliation procedure was also developed to make certain that no hemlock pixels were assigned to different blobs in different years. The automated segmentation and reconciliation procedures were applied to a population of naturally occurring hemlock. Following spatial segmentation, a large majority of hemlock blobs (similar to66-71%) were found to be closely associated with ground referenced, manually delineated individual hemlock crowns. The remaining blobs consisted of spatially distinct parts of a crown or closely clumped multiple crowns. Similar overall classification accuracies (similar to63-72%) were found following the reconciliation of multitemporal image pairs. The development of these spatially explicit multitemporal population data sets should prove useful to further investigations of the dynamics of and environmental influence on plant populations.

Two popular spectral matching algorithms use different error metrics and constraints to determine the existence of a spectral match. Multiple endmember spectral Mixture analysis (MESMA) is a linear mixing model that uses a root mean square error (RMSE) error metric. Spectral angle mapper (SAM) compares two spectra using a spectral angle error metric. This paper compares two endmember MESMA and SAM using a spectral library containing six land cover classes. RMSE and spectral angle for models within each land cover class were directly compared. The dependence of RMSE on the albedo of the modeled spectrum was also explored. RMSE and spectral angle A were found to be closely related, although not equivalent, due to variations in the albedo of the modeled spectra. Error constraints applied to both models resulted in large differences in the number of spectral matches. Using MESMA, the number of spectra modeled within the error constraint increased as the albedo of the modeled spectra decreased. The value of the error constraint used was shown to make a much larger difference in the number of spectra modeled than the choice of spectral matching algorithm.

Surface parameters derived at different resolutions can be considerably different even though they are derived using the same algorithms. This article addresses issues related to spatial scaling of net primary productivity (NPP). The main objective is to develop algorithms for spatial scaling of NPP using subpixel information. NPP calculations were performed using the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS). The area of interest is near Fraserdale, Ontario, Canada. It is found from this investigation that lumped (coarse resolution) calculations can be considerably biased (by +14.9% on average) from the distributed (fine resolution) case. Based on these results, algorithms for removing these biases in lumped NPP are developed using subpixel land cover type information. The correlation between the distributed NPP and lumped NPP is improved from r(2)=0. 16 to r(2)=0.59 after the correction. In addition, subpixel leaf area index (LAI) information is used to reduce the remaining biases. After the LAI correction, the correlation is further improved to r(2)=0.90. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.
