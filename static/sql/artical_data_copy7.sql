The processors, named Case II Regional (C2R), boreal (BOR), and eutrophic (EUT), for the associated lake types, have been developed for different types of coastal or inland (Case II) waters. Chlorophyll-a (chl-a), total suspended matter (TSM), absorption of colored dissolved organic matter (alpha(CDOM)(443)), and signal depth (Z(90)) products of the BEAM processors were compared with in situ data. In addition, total absorption (alpha(TOT)) and scattering of TSM (b(TSM)) from different BEAM processors were compared against the results of coastal field campaign measurements. The in situ water quality data consisted of monitoring station data gathered by the Finnish environmental administration during 2006-2009 and data from coastal field campaigns with a flow-through system. AERONET-OC (SeaPRISM) data from the Helsinki Lighthouse station were used to validate the BEAM reflectance products. The comparison with the BEAM processor results and in situ data showed that the bias of the original BEAM algorithms can be decreased through adjustment of the coefficients that relate IOPs such as the absorption of pigments and the scattering of TSM to water quality constituents such as chl-a and turbidity. The TSM products of the BEAM processors can be used to estimate the turbidity measured at monitoring stations with an r(2) of 0.76-0.84 and an RMSE of 0.7-0.85 FNUs (Formazin Nephelometric Units) on the coast of Finland. The best functionality for turbidity estimation was observed with the EUT processor, but the C2R processor also gave a sound performance. The BOR and C2R processors proved to be the best for deriving chl-a concentration. However, the accuracy of chl-a estimations was low with both processors (r(2) ranged from 0.45 to 0.47 and RMSE was between 44 and 45%). Chl-a products, particularly during the phytoplankton bloom seasons of spring and summer, require further development. The Z(90) product from the BOR processor was used to derive an algorithm for Secchi disk depth estimation with r(2) 0.48 and RMSE 0.97 m. The BOR processor was the most successful at CDOM estimation (r(2) 0.6 and RMSE 0.49 1/m), but a simple reflectance ratio was actually able to perform better (r(2) 0.75 and RMSE 0.39 1/m). In many cases, the differences between the outcomes of processors were small and related only to a part of the in situ dataset. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Recent advances in object-based image analysis (OBIA) and machine-learning algorithms offer new image classification tools; however, few comparisons of different approaches have been discussed to date. We applied OBIA to delineate wetland plant functional types (PFTs) for Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China and Ramsar wetland conservation site, from a spring 2008 Landsat TM image. We targeted major PFTs that represent dominant vegetation groups along wetland inundation gradients and affect ecosystem biogeochemical cycles and ecological habitats. Classification results were compared among: a) several \"small\" object segmentation scales (with average object sizes 1350-9000 m(2)); b) algorithms from six families of statistical machine-learning classifiers (Bayesian, Logistic, Neural Network, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines) and c) two hierarchical levels of vegetation classification, a generalized 3-class set and a more specific 6-class set. We also examined the response of classification accuracy to four basic object-level texture metrics. The highest accuracies (> 85-90%) and best agreement among algorithms occurred at coarser object scales rather than close-to-pixel scales. No single machine-learning algorithm was consistently superior at all scales, although support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor and artificial neural network most frequently provided the highest overall and PFT-specific accuracies. Including texture metrics had both positive and negative low-magnitude effects on classification accuracy that were not consistent among scale values, algorithms or PFT classes. Individual PFTs differed in scales at which they were best discriminated from others, reflecting their unique landscape positions, ecology of dominant species and disturbance agents. There was a 29-35% disagreement between mapped areas of generalized PFTs and their respective subclasses, suggesting potential mismatches between the ecological classification scheme and PFT landscape patch structure, and raising concern on error propagation in multi-scale classifications. We conclude that OBIA with machine-learning classifiers is useful for landscape vegetation analyses, however, considerations of spatial scale and image segmentation outcomes are critical in mapping PFTs and should be more thoroughly investigated in future work.

Satellite snow products can be one of these data, since snow is a water reservoir with a high impact on the quality of discharge simulation. The satellite Snow Cover Area products are known to be of good quality and are regularly used for studies in the meteorological and hydrological fields. However, these products are reprocessed and thus are not representative of the quality of a real-time product that would be needed for operational applications. The assessment of a real-time Snow Cover Area daily product at 250 m-resolution (the EURAC MODIS SCA product, which is based on the MODIS sensor) by comparing it directly or indirectly to the classical NASA MODIS SCA daily product and to the simulated Snow Cover Area of the distributed hydrological model, LISFLOOD, is realized in this article at the pan-European scale. This real-time product showed an overall good performance compared with the classical product, and a good agreement with the LISFLOOD simulated snow over Europe. The study showed the impact of forest cover on the scores of the compared products, whereas altitude did not have an impact. Using quality flags that are provided with the EURAC product improved its performance by reducing the misclassification of clouds as snow. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

As in-situ soil moisture observations are scarce, satellite-based estimates are a suitable alternative. The validation of remotely sensed soil moisture products is generally hampered by the difference in spatial support of in-situ observations and satellite footprints. Unsaturated zone modeling may serve as a valuable validation tool because it could bridge the gap of different spatial supports. A stochastic, distributed unsaturated zone model (SWAP) was used in which the spatial support was matched to these of the satellite soil moisture retrievals. A comparison between point observations and the SWAP model was performed to enhance understanding of the model and to assure that the SWAP model could be used with confidence for other locations in Spain. A timeseries analysis was performed to compare surface soil moisture from the SWAP model to surface soil moisture retrievals from three different microwave sensors, including AMSR-E, SMOS and ASCAT. Results suggest that temporal dynamics are best captured by AMSR-E and ASCAT resulting in an averaged correlation coefficient of 0.68 and 0.71, respectively. SMOS shows the capability of capturing the long-term trends, however on short timescales the soil moisture signal was not captured as well as by the other sensors, resulting in an averaged correlation coefficient of 0.42. Root mean square errors for the three sensors were found to be very similar (+/- 0.05 m(3)m(-3)). The satellite uncertainty is spatially correlated and distinct spatial patterns are found over Spain.

The AMSR-E Fw (25-km resolution) maps reflect strong microwave sensitivity to sub-grid scale open water variability and compare favorably (0.71 <= R-2 <= 0.84) with alternative, static Fw maps derived from finer scale (30-m to 250-m resolution) Landsat, MODIS and SRTM radar (MOD44W) data. The AMSR-E retrievals show dynamic seasonal and annual variability in surface inundation that is unresolved in the static Fw maps. The AMSR-E Fw record also corresponds strongly (0.71 <= R <= 0.87) with regional wet/dry cycles inferred from basin discharge records. An AMSR-E algorithm sensitivity analysis shows a conservative estimate of Fw retrieval uncertainty (RMSE) within +/- 4.1% for effective resolution of regional inundation patterns and seasonal to annual variability. A regional trend analysis of the 8-year AMSR-E record shows no significant Arctic-Boreal region wide Fw trend for the period, and instead reveals contrasting inundation changes within different PF zones. Widespread Fw wetting is detected within continuous (92% of grid cells with significant trend; p<0.1) and discontinuous (82%) PF zones, while sporadic/isolated PF areas show widespread (71%) Fw drying trends. These results are consistent with previous studies showing evidence of contrasting regional inundation patterns linked to PF degradation and associated changes to surface hydrology under recent climate warming.

This study uses airborne hyperspectral data to investigate changes in modeled fire temperature and area as spatial resolution is varied from 5 m to coarser than 60 m. Four images containing active fires were acquired by the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), with spatial resolutions ranging from similar to 5 to similar to 20 m. Gaussian and aggregation resampling methods were compared for one scene containing fire, and both resampling methods were found to produce similar radiance values. As spatial resolution coarsened, the area flagged as having fire by the hyperspectral fire detection index (HFDI) increased. Fire temperature modeled using a multiple endmember spectral mixing model decreased at coarser spatial resolutions, while the modeled fire fractional area increased. Coarser spatial resolution hyperspectral data, including data collected by HyspIRI, are likely to provide increased fire area and lower temperatures when compared against simultaneously acquired higher spatial resolution data. Saturation in shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands was found in all four images, and increasing SWIR saturation thresholds could lead to improvements in fire characterization. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

It also covers a vast and often inaccessible area frequently obscured by clouds, making accurate, timely monitoring of its forests difficult. Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are unhindered by clouds and can provide clear images whenever there is a satellite pass, hence provide a potentially important tool for monitoring forest changes. Over Sumatra, the JAM Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) PALSAR L-band radar provided both ScanSAR HH polarisation with repeat images every 46 days, thus providing much more frequent clear imagery than other available rapid deforestation monitoring tools, and approximately annual Fine-Beam Dual (FBD) image pairs with HH and HV polarisations. Temporal analysis of ScanSAR images shows that deforestation in the Sumatran province of Riau can be identified by large values of the temporal standard deviation, but high detection rates are associated with high false alarm rates, particularly in swamp forest. There does not appear to be a reliable signature of the onset of forest disturbance in the ScanSAR time-series. Deforestation can also be detected in annual FBD data by combining increases and decreases in both the HH and HV channels, since the four types of change are complementary; these different polarisation responses indicate a variety of physical processes that may be involved in the radar signature of deforestation. Significant improvements in performance are possible by combining FBD and ScanSAR data, giving 72% detection of deforestation for a false alarm rate (detection of deforestation in undisturbed forest) of 20%. Error analysis based on (a) likely errors in the Landsat data used to provide a reference for deforestation and (b) differences between the times of acquisition of the Landsat data and the FBD data suggest that the true detection rate for the FBD data is underestimated. All the analysis in the paper uses fully automatic methods, but it is likely that false alarms in the ScanSAR data due to periodic flooding could be reduced by human inspection. The performance figures reported here could also be improved if knowledge about the locations of dry and swamp forest was included in the methodology. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

LiDAR remote sensing is a rapidly evolving technology for quantifying aboveground biomass and thereby carbon pools: however, little work has evaluated the efficacy of repeat LiDAR measures for spatially monitoring aboveground carbon pools through time. Our study objective was therefore to evaluate the use of discrete return airborne LiDAR for quantifying biomass change and carbon flux from repeat field and LiDAR surveys. We collected LiDAR data in 2003 and 2009 across similar to 20,000 ha of an actively managed, mixed conifer forest landscape in northern Idaho. The Random Forest machine learning algorithm was used to impute aboveground biomass pools of trees, saplings, shrubs, herbaceous plants, coarse and fine woody debris, litter, and duff using field-based forest inventory data and metrics derived from the LiDAR collections. Separate predictive tree aboveground biomass models were developed from the 2003 and 2009 field and LiDAR data, and biomass change was estimated at the plot, pixel, and landscape levels by subtracting 2003 predictions from 2009 predictions. Traditional stand exam data were used to independently validate 2003 and 2009 tree aboveground biomass predictions and tree aboveground biomass change estimates at the stand level. Over this 6-year period, we found a mean increase in tree aboveground biomass due to forest growth across the non-harvested portions of 4.1 Mg/ha/yr. We found that 26.3% of the landscape had been harvested during this time period which outweighed growth at the landscape level, resulting in a net tree aboveground biomass change of -5.7 Mg/ha/yr. and -2.3 Mg/ha/yr in total aboveground carbon, summed across all the aboveground biomass pools. Change in aboveground biomass was related to forest successional status: younger stands gained two- to three-fold less biomass than did more mature stands. This result suggests that even the most mature forest stands are valuable carbon sinks, and implies that forest management decisions that include longer harvest rotation cycles are likely to favor higher levels of aboveground carbon storage in this system. A 30-fold difference in LiDAR sampling density between the 2003 and 2009 collections did not affect plot-scale biomass estimation. These results suggest that repeat LiDAR surveys are useful for accurately quantifying high resolution, spatially explicit biomass and carbon dynamics in conifer forests.

In this study, we develop a robust algorithm, which automatically detects and tracks individual supraglacial lakes using visible satellite imagery, to document the evolution of a population of West Greenland supraglacial lakes over ten consecutive melt seasons. Validation tests indicate that the algorithm is highly accurate: 99.0% of supraglacial lakes can be detected and tracked and 96.3% of reported lakes are true supraglacial lakes with accurate lake properties, such as lake area, and timing of formation and drainage. Investigation of the interannual evolution of supraglacial lakes in the context of annual melt intensity reveals that during more intense melt years, supraglacial lakes drain more frequently and earlier in the melt season. Additionally, the lake population extends to higher elevations during more intense melt years, exposing an increased inland area of the ice sheet to sudden lake drainage events. These observations suggest that increased surface meltwater production due to climate change will enhance the spatial extent and temporal frequency of lake drainage events. It is unclear whether this will ultimately increase or decrease the basal sliding sensitivity of interior regions of the Greenland Ice Sheet. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Here, two methods for dust source identification are compared, (1) a \"back-tracking\" method applied to 15-minute MSG IR dust index, and (2) a \"frequency\" method applied to daily OMI AI and daily MODIS DeepBlue Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) data.   Using the \"back-tracking\" method, dust source areas are inferred by tracking individual dust plumes back to their place of origin, allowed by the high temporal resolution of the MSG images. OMI AI and MODIS Deep Blue AOT products are available on daily resolution only, which does not allow for back-tracking of individual dust plumes. Thus, dust source areas are identified by relating the frequencies of occurrence of high dust loadings to source areas.   The spatial distribution of inferred dust source areas not only from the two methods, but also from the two satellite products, shows significant differences. The MSG back-tracking method highlights frequent dust emission from sources within complex terrain, while frequencies of high OMI AI values emphasise topographic basins as important dust source areas. Dust source areas retrieved from DeepBlue AOTs are generally further south towards the Sahel region. This study shows that the temporal resolution of satellite dust products is a key issue in identifying dust source areas. Both, the spatial distribution of dust sources and their annual cycle strongly depend on the acquisition time related to the start of dust emission. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We used an extensive set of MERIS imagery and in situ data collected over a period of three years in the Azov Sea and the Taganrog Bay for this validation task. We found that the two-band and three-band NIR-red algorithms gave consistently highly accurate estimates of chl-a concentration, with a mean absolute error of 4.32 mg m(-3) and 4.71 mg m(-3), respectively, and a root mean square error as low as 5.92 mg m(-3), for data with chl-a concentrations ranging from 1.09 mg m(-3) to 107.82 mg m(-3). This obviates the need for case-specific reparameterization of the algorithms, as long as the specific absorption coefficient of phytoplankton in the water does not change drastically, and presents a strong case for the use of NIR-red algorithms as standard algorithms that can be routinely applied for near-real-time quantitative monitoring of chl-a concentration in the Azov Sea and the Taganrog Bay, and potentially elsewhere, which will be a real boon to ecologists, natural resource managers and environmental decision-makers.

BA is the sum of cross-sectional area of trees measured at 1.37 m above ground surface, per unit area, and is most commonly measured in-situ. The objective of this study was to supply estimates of BA for oak woodlands and savannas on the 12,828.5 ha Sherburne National Wildlife Refuge in Central Minnesota to guide management efforts. We used winter and summer Landsat imagery, combined with field measurements, to assess the potential for improving forest BA estimates by taking advantage of the high spectral contrast between sunlit snow, forest canopy elements, and shadows projected onto snow ground cover. We explained up to 90% of measured variation in BA using partial least squares regression models calibrated using single- and multiple-date winter Landsat data (R-2 = 0.898, RMSE = 2.79 m(2)ha(-1)), which performed better than models calibrated using summer imagery (R-2 = 0.762, RMSE = 3.85 m(2)ha(-1)). Success of the winter-based BA models may be driven, in part, by potential geometric/allometric relationships between cast shadow and forest BA, but definitive proof of this is a topic for future research. This method of BA estimation is not refuge-specific and may be extended for regional use to manage oak forest wherever winter snow coverage is consistent. Additional research is needed to determine the degree of robustness to variations in the empirical relationship between BA and tree shading patterns across different forest functional types.

In Norway, as in many other nations, low productivity or non-merchantable forests, like the subalpine zone, are not routinely subject to inventory programs. Awareness of expected changes in the sub-alpine zone as a result of a warmer climate, and the interest in full carbon accounting at the national level, has dictated a need for data capture in these mountainous areas. We propose an approach for integrating strip samples of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data with Landsat imagery to delineate the subalpine zone. In the current study the subalpine zone was defined according to international definitions based on tree heights and canopy cover. The three-dimensional measurements of forest structure obtained from LiDAR enable a delineation of the subalpine zone. The approach was implemented using 53 LiDAR sample strips in Hedmark County, Norway, and validated with field measurements at 26 locations. The subalpine zone boundaries were found to be within one Landsat pixel, on average, when validated using an image gradient technique. Furthermore, binomial logistic regression was used to upscale the LiDAR classes to the entire county (27400 km(2)) using satellite images and information derived from a digital terrain model. The result from the binomial logistic regression was a probability map suitable for monitoring changes in the extent and location of the subalpine zone. The probability surface was separated into hard classes by calibrated alpha-cuts derived using density estimation to support the information needs of inventory stratification and area estimation.

We use a combination of wavelet transform and statistical techniques that allow us to quantify both intensity and duration of the seasonal oscillation of chlorophyll-a concentration and PFTs relative occurrence, and to map these relationships. Next, the seasonal oscillations detected are related to four PFTs revealing six major global phytoplanktonic associations. Our results elucidate the intensity and duration of the seasonal dynamic of the chlorophyll-a concentration and of the relative occurrence of four PFTs at a global scale. Thus, the typology of the different types of seasonality is investigated. Finally, an overall agreement between the results and the biogeochemical provinces partition proposed by Longhurst is found, revealing a strong environmental control on the seasonal oscillation of primary producers and a clear latitudinal organization in the succession of the phytoplankton types.

Several aerosol products have been generated in a systematic way, and are available for further studies. In this paper, we evaluate the accuracy of such aerosol products derived from the measurements of POLDER, MODIS, MERIS, SEVIRI and CALIOP, through a statistical comparison with Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) measurements from the AERONET sunphotometer network Although this method is commonly used, this study is, to our knowledge, among the most extensive of its type since it compares the performance of the products from 5 different sensors using up to five years of data for each of them at global scale. The choice of these satellite aerosol datasets was based on their availability at the ICARE Data and Service Centre (www.icare.univ-lille1.fr).   We distinguish between retrievals over land and ocean and between estimates of total and fine mode AOD. Over the oceans, POLDER and MODIS retrievals are of similar quality, with RMS difference lower than 0.1 and a correlation with AERONET of around 0.9. The POLDER estimates suffer from a small positive bias for clean atmospheres, which weakens its statistics. The other aerosol products are of lesser quality, although the SEVIRI products may be of interest for some applications that require a high temporal resolution. The MERIS product shows a very high bias. Over land, only the MODES product offers a reliable estimate of the total ADD. On the other hand, the polarization-based retrieval using POLDER data allows a better fine mode estimate than that from MODIS. These results suggest the need for a product combining POLDER and MODES products over land.   The paper also analyses how the statistics change with the spatial and temporal thresholds that are used. Spatio-temporal averaging improves the statistics only slightly, which indicates that random errors are not dominant in the error budget.

The Matrix Inversion Method (MIM) with a semi-analytic model of the anisotropy of the in-water light field was applied to MERIS images of Burdekin Falls Dam, Australia, a tropical freshwater impoundment. Specific attention was required to improve the atmospheric correction of the MERIS data. The performance of the conventional three band exact solution of the MIM was compared to that of over-determined solutions that used constant and differential weighting for each sensor band.   The results of the application of the MIM algorithm showed that the best weighting scheme had a mean chlorophyll a retrieval difference of 1.0 mu gl(-1), the three band direct matrix inversion scheme had a mean difference of 4.2 mu gl(-1) and the constant weight scheme had a mean difference of 5.5 mu gl(-1). For tripton, the best performed weighting scheme had a mean difference of 12 mgl(-1), the three band scheme had a mean difference of 3.4 mgl(-1) and the constant weight scheme had a mean difference of 1.8 mgl(-1). For the CDOM retrieval, the mean difference was found to be 0.12 m(-1) for the best performed weighting scheme, 025 m(-1) for the three band scheme and 0.52 m(-1) for the constant weight scheme. It was found that significant improvements in the accuracy and precision of retrieved water quality parameter values can be obtained by using differentially weighted, over-determined systems of equations, rather than exact solutions. These more reliable estimates of water quality parameters will allow water resource managers to improve their monitoring regimes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This study investigates the utility of integrating remotely sensed estimates of C-ab into a thermal-based Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model that estimates land-surface CO2 and energy fluxes using an analytical, light-use-efficiency (LUE) approach to estimating bulk canopy resistance. The LUE model component computes canopy-scale carbon assimilation and transpiration fluxes, internally estimating fluctuations in effective LUE from a nominal (species-dependent) value (LUEn) in response to short-term variations in environmental conditions. LUEn, however, may vary on a daily timescale, responding to changes in plant phenology, physiological condition and nutrient status. Therefore, remote sensing methodologies for improving daily estimates of LUEn have been investigated. Day-to-day variations in LUEn were assessed for a heterogeneous corn crop field in Maryland, U.S.A. through model optimization with eddy covariance CO2 flux tower observations. The optimized daily LUEn values were then compared to gridded estimates of C-ab over the tower flux footprint, retrieved from a canopy reflectance model driven by green, red and near-infrared imagery acquired with an aircraft imaging system. The tower-calibrated LUEn data were generally well correlated with airborne retrievals of C-ab, and hourly water, energy and carbon flux estimation accuracies from TSEB were significantly improved when using C-ab for delineating spatio-temporal variations in LUEn. The study highlights the potential synergy between thermal infrared and shortwave reflective wavebands in producing valuable remote sensing data for estimating carbon, water and heat fluxes within a two-source energy balance framework.

In order to accurately understand terrestrial carbon cycle mechanisms, it is necessary to estimate spatial and temporal variations in carbon flux and storage using process-based models with the highest possible resolution. We estimated terrestrial carbon fluxes using a biosphere model integrating eco-physiological and mechanistic approaches based on satellite data (BEAMS) and observations with 1-km grid resolution. The study area is the central Far East Asia region, which lies between 30 degrees and 50 degrees north latitude and 125 and 150 east longitude. Aiming to simulate terrestrial carbon exchanges under realistic land surface conditions, we used as many satellite-observation datasets as possible, such as the standard MODIS, TRMM, and SRTM high-level land products. Validated using gross primary productivity (GPP), net ecosystem production (NEP), net radiation and latent heat with ground measurements at six flux sites, the model estimations showed reasonable seasonal and annual patterns. In extensive analysis, the total GPP and NPP were determined to be 2.1 and 0.9 PgC/year, respectively. The total NEP estimation was + 5.6 TgC/year, meaning that the land area played a role as a carbon sink from 2001 to 2006. In analyses of areas with complicated topography, the 1-km grid estimation could prove to be effective in evaluating the effect of landscape on the terrestrial carbon cycle. The method presented here is an appropriate approach for gaining a better understanding of terrestrial carbon exchange, both spatially and temporally. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Method-oriented approaches are often only effective for specific land cover class/data source combinations, and cannot be applied when different classification systems or data sources are required or available. Here we present a method, based on Endorsement Theory, of pooling evidence from multiple expert systems and spatial datasets to produce land cover maps. Individual \'experts\' are trained to produce evidence for or against a class, with this evidence being categorised according to strength. An evidence integration rule set is applied to evidence lists to produce conclusions of different strength regarding individual classes, and the most likely class identified. The only expert system design implemented currently within the methodology is a neural network model, although the system has been designed to accept information from decision trees, fuzzy k-means and Bayesian statistics as well. We have used the technique to produce land cover maps of Scotland using three classification systems of varying complexity. Mapping accuracy varied between 52.6% for a map with 96 classes to 88.8% for a map with eight classes. The accuracy of the maps generated is higher than when individual datasets are used, showing that the evidence integration method applied is suitable for improving land cover mapping accuracy. We showed that imagery was not necessarily the most important data source for mapping where a large number of classes are used, and also showed that even data sources that produce low accuracy scores when used for mapping by themselves do improve the accuracy of maps produced using this integrative approach. Future work in developing the method is identified, including the inclusion of additional expert systems and improvement of the evidence integration, and evaluation carried out of the overall effectiveness of the approach.

The research started with raw image data pre-processing and continued with a comparison of satellite. field and laboratory data. The masking technique adopted to isolate rocky pixels was of fundamental importance to perform further analysis. An integration of density-sliced images and false colour composite images of Band Ratio, Relative Absorption Band Depth and Principal Component Analysis allowed us to generate a geological map that highlights a new granitoid body (Buraburi Granite) and the surrounding host rocks in the Dolpo region (western Nepal). The Buraburi Granite was mapped and sampled integrating remotely sensed ASTER data with analysis of rocks and minerals spectral signatures.   The innovative approach that we have adopted considers the absorption features of particular lichen species (acidophilic). The results highlight the importance of considering acidophilic lichen means of detecting granitoid rocks. Furthermore, since peraluminous granitoids (i.e. Buraburi granite) have a considerable Al2O3 bulk rock content, the Muscovite Al-OH absorption peaks centred in the 6th ASTER band were also considered an important parameter for their detection.   Field observations confirm the results of remote sensing analysis showing the intrusive relationship between the newly discovered 110 km(2) granitoid body and the wall rocks of the Higher Himalayan Crystalline and the Tibetan Sedimentary Sequence.   In conclusion, the proposed methods have great potential for granitoid mapping in vegetated and rough terrains, particularly those with climatic and geological conditions similar to the ones of the Southern Himalayan belt.

High spatiotemporal resolution and long-time record data are more in demand nowadays and will continue to be in the future. MODIS LAI products meet these requirements to some degree. However, due to the presence of cloud and seasonal snow cover, the instrument problems and the uncertainties of retrieval algorithm, the current MODIS LAI products are spatially and temporally discontinuous and inconsistent, which limits their application in land surface and climate modelling. To improve the MODIS LAI products on a global scale, we considered the characteristics of the MODIS LAI data and made the best use of quality control (QC) information, and developed an integrated two-step method to derive the improved MODIS LAI products effectively and efficiently on a global scale. First, we used the modified temporal spatial filter (mTSF) method taking advantage of background values and QC information at each pixel to do a simple data assimilation for relatively low quality data. Then we applied the post processing-TIMESAT (A software package to analyze time-series of satellite sensor data) Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter to get the final result We implemented the method to 10 years of the MODIS Collection 5 LAI data. In comparison with the LAI reference maps and the MODIS LAI data, our results showed that the improved MODIS LAI data are closer to the LAI reference maps in magnitude and also more continuous and consistent in both time-series and spatial domains.

However, only little attention was paid to the training process which has a major impact on retrieval performances. This study focused on the several modalities of the training process within neural network estimation of LAI, FCOVER and FAPAR biophysical variables. Performances were evaluated over both actual experimental observations and model simulations. The SAIL and PROSPECT radiative transfer models were used here to simulate the training and the synthetic test datasets. Measurements of LAI. FCOVER and FAPAR were achieved over the Barrax (Spain) agricultural site for a range of crop types concurrently to CHRIS/PROBA satellite image acquisition. Results showed that the spectral band selection was specific to LAI, FCOVER and FAPAR variables. The optimal band set provided significantly improved performances for LAI, while only small differences were observed for the other variables. Gaussian distributions of the radiative transfer model input variables performed better than uniform distributions for which no prior information was exploited. Including moderate uncertainties in the reflectance simulations used in the training process improved the flexibility of the neural network in cases where simulations departed slightly from observations. Simple neural network architecture with a single hidden layer of five tangent sigmoid transfer functions was performing as good as more complex architectures if the training dataset was larger than ten times the number of coefficients to tune. Small sensitivity of performances was observed depending on the way the solution was selected when several networks were trained in parallel. Finally, comparison with a NDVI based approach showed the generally better retrieval accuracy of neural networks. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The method brings together two themes in time-series analysis of LTS: capture of short-duration events and smoothing of long-term trends. Our strategy is founded on the recognition that change is not simply a contrast between conditions at two points in time, but rather a continual process operating at both fast and slow rates on landscapes. This concept requires both new algorithms to extract change and new interpretation tools to validate those algorithms. The challenge is to resolve salient features of the time series while eliminating noise introduced by ephemeral changes in illumination, phenology, atmospheric condition, and geometric registration. In the LandTrendr approach, we use relative radiometric normalization and simple cloud screening rules to create on-the-fly mosaics of multiple images per year, and extract temporal trajectories of spectral data on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We then apply temporal segmentation strategies with both regression-based and point-to-point fitting of spectral indices as a function of time, allowing capture of both slowly-evolving processes, such as regrowth, and abrupt events, such as forest harvest. Because any temporal trajectory pattern is allowable, we use control parameters and threshold-based filtering to reduce the role of false positive detections. No suitable reference data are available to assess the role of these control parameters or to test overall algorithm performance. Therefore, we also developed a companion interpretation approach founded on the same conceptual framework of capturing both long and short-duration processes, and developed a software tool to apply this concept to expert interpretation and segmentation of spectral trajectories (TimeSync, described in a companion paper by Cohen et al., 2010). These data were used as a truth set against which to evaluate the behavior of the LandTrendr algorithms applied to three spectral indices. We applied the LandTrendr algorithms to several hundred points across western Oregon and Washington (USA). Because of the diversity of potential outputs from the LTS data, we evaluated algorithm performance against summary metrics for disturbance, recovery, and stability, both for capture of events and longer-duration processes. Despite the apparent complexity of parameters, our results suggest a simple grouping of parameters along a single axis that balances the detection of abrupt events with capture of long-duration trends. Overall algorithm performance was good, capturing a wide range of disturbance and recovery phenomena, even when evaluated against a truth set that contained new targets (recovery and stability) with much subtler thresholds of change than available from prior validation datasets. Temporal segmentation of the archive appears to be a feasible and robust means of increasing information extraction from the Luldsat archive. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Many methods have been developed to determine summer surface temperature, but the determination in presence of snow is an ill-conditioned problem for microwave techniques because snow changes the emissivity of the surface. This project aims to improve the estimation of soil temperature, within the top 5 cm of the ground, under the snowpack using passive microwave remote sensing. Results show the potential of the passive microwave brightness temperature inversion at 10 GHz (derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Earth Observing System, AMSR-E) for the estimation of soil temperature using a physical multilayer snow-soil model (SNTHERM) coupled with a snow emission model (HUT). The snow model is driven with meteorological measurements from ground-based stations as well as data generated from reanalysis. The proposed iterative retrieval method minimizes the difference between the simulated and measured brightness temperature using the soil temperature as a free parameter given by SNTHERM. Results are validated against ground-based measurements at several sites across Canada through several winter seasons. The overall root mean square error and bias in the retrieved soil temperature is respectively 3.29 K and 0.56 K, lower than the error derived from the snow-soil model without the use of remote sensing. The accuracy in detection of frozen/unfrozen soil under the snowpack is 78%, which is improved up to 81% if the spring melting period is not considered. This original procedure constitutes a very promising tool to characterize the soil (frozen or not) under snow cover, as well as its evolution in northern remote locations where measurements are unavailable.

This paper proposes a method that links individual tree crowns (classified to species) using graph data structures and minimum spanning trees. The method was applied to tree crowns delineated and mapped to species using hyperspectral CASI data acquired over Injune, central Queensland, Australia. The resulting clusters were attributed with tree level statistics relating to crown area and diversity and were shown to produce mapping comparable to that of manual interpretation of stereo aerial photography. The study concludes that provided reliable tree level mapping of species can be achieved, automated classification of forest communities can be undertaken. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

As a result not one sensor provides both high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. However, the ability to monitor seasonal landscape changes at fine resolution is urgently needed for global change science. One approach is to \"blend\" the radiometry from daily, global data (e.g. MODIS, MERIS, SPOT-Vegetation) with data from high-resolution sensors with less frequent coverage (e.g. Landsat, CBERS, ResourceSat). Unfortunately, existing algorithms for blending multi-source data have some shortcomings, particularly in accurately predicting the surface reflectance of heterogeneous landscapes. This study has developed an enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) based on the existing STARFM algorithm, and has tested it with both simulated and actual satellite data. Results show that ESTARFM improves the accuracy of predicted fine-resolution reflectance, especially for heterogeneous landscapes, and preserves spatial details. Taking the NIR band as an example, for homogeneous regions the prediction of the ESTARFM is slightly better than the STARFM (average absolute difference [AAD] 0.0106 vs. 0.0129 reflectance units). But for a complex, heterogeneous landscape, the prediction accuracy of ESTARFM is improved even more compared with STARFM (AAD 0.0135 vs. 0.0194). This improved fusion algorithm will support new investigations into how global landscapes are changing across both seasonal and interannual timescales. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In detail, the Soil Wetness Variation Index, derived from the AMSU data modified in order to take account of the difference between the soil layer investigated by the satellite sensor and that used as a benchmark, was found to be correlated both with the in-situ and modeled soil moisture variations showing correlation coefficients in the range of 0.42-0.49 and 0.33-0.48, respectively. As far as the soil moisture temporal pattern is concerned, higher correlations were obtained (0.59-0.84 for the in-situ data and 0.82-0.87 for the modeled data set) partly due to the soil moisture seasonal pattem that enhances the correlation. Overall, the root mean square error was found to be less than 0.05 m(3)/m(3) for both the comparisons, thus assessing the potential of the AMSU sensor to quantitatively retrieve soil moisture temporal patterns. Moreover. the AMSU sensor can be considered as a useful tool to provide a reliable and frequently updated global soil moisture data set, considering its higher temporal resolution now available (about 4 passes per day) thanks to the presence of the sensor aboard different satellites.

Quantifying long-term change in fire regimes is important to understand the driving forces of changes in fire dynamics, and the implications of fire regime changes for ecosystem ecology. However, assessing fire regime changes is challenging, especially in grasslands because of high intra- and inter-annual variation of the vegetation and temporally sparse satellite data in many regions of the world. The breakdown of the Soviet Union in 1991 caused substantial socioeconomic changes and a decrease in grazing pressure in Russia\'s arid grasslands, but how this affected grassland fires is unknown. Our research goal was to assess annual burned area in the grasslands of southern Russia before and after the breakdown. Our study area covers 19,000 km(2) in the Republic of Kalmykia in southern Russia in the arid grasslands of the Caspian plains. We estimated annual burned area from 1985 to 2007 by classifying AVHRR data using decision tree algorithm, and validated the results with RESURS, Landsat and MODIS data. Our results showed a substantial increase in burned area, from almost none in the 1980s to more than 20% of the total study area burned in both 2006 and 2007. Burned area started to increase around 1998 and has continued to increase. albeit with high fluctuations among years. We suggest that it took several years after livestock numbers decreased in the beginning of the 1990s for vegetation to recover, to build up enough fuel, and to reach a threshold of connectivity that could sustain large fires. Our burned area detection algorithm was effective, and captured burned areas even with incomplete annual AVHRR data. Validation results showed 68% producer\'s and 56% user\'s accuracy. Lack of frequent AVHRR data is a common problem and our burned area detection approach may also be suitable in other parts of the world with comparable ecosystems and similar AVHRR data limitations. In our case, AVHRR data were the only satellite imagery available far enough back in time to reveal marked increases in fire regimes in southern Russia before and after the breakdown of the Soviet Union.

As such, material and energy consumption, air pollution, and expanding impervious surface are all concentrated in urban areas, with important environmental implications at local, regional and potentially global scales. New ways to measure and monitor the built environment over large areas are thus critical to answering a wide range of environmental research questions related to the role of urbanization in climate, biogeochemistry and hydrological cycles. This paper presents a new dataset depicting global urban land at 500-m spatial resolution based on MODIS data (available at http://sage.wisc.edu/urbanenvironment.html). The methodological approach exploits temporal and spectral information in one year of MODIS observations, classified using a global training database and an ensemble decision-tree classification algorithm. To overcome confusion between urban and built-up lands and other land cover types, a stratification based on climate, vegetation, and urban topology was developed that allowed region-specific processing. Using reference data from a sample of 140 cities stratified by region, population size, and level of economic development, results show a mean overall accuracy of 93% (k = 0.65) at the pixel level and a high level of agreement at the city scale (R-2 = 0.90).

Tree crown size is a critical aspect of canopy structure that significantly influences these biophysical processes in the canopy. Tree crown size is also strongly related to other canopy structural parameters, such as tree height, diameter at breast height and biomass. But information about tree crown sizes is difficult to obtain and rarely available from traditional forest inventory. The study objective was to test the hypothesis that a model previously developed for estimation of tree crown size can be generalized across sensors and sites. Our study sites include the Racoon Ecological Management Area in southeast Ohio, USA and the Duke Forest in North Carolina Piedmont, USA. We sampled a series of circular plots in the summers of 2005 and 2007. We derived average tree crown diameter (CD) for trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than 6.4 cm (2.5 in) for each sampling plot. We developed statistical models using image spatial information from Ikonos and QuickBird images as the independent variable and CD for stands in Ohio as the dependent variable. The models provide an explanation of tree crown size for the hardwood stands comparable to other approaches (R-2 = similar to 0.5 and RMSE = 0.83 m). Moreover, the models that estimate tree crown size using the ratio of image variances at two spatial resolutions can be applied across sensors and sites, i.e. the statistical models developed with Ikonos images can be applied directly to estimate tree crown size with QuickBird image, and the statistical models developed in Ohio can be applied directly to estimate tree crown size with images in North Carolina. These results indicate that the model developed based on image variance ratio at two spatial resolutions can be used to take advantage of existing sampling plot data and images to estimate CD with more recent images, enhancing the efficiency of forest resources inventory and monitoring.

Canopy fuel metrics such as canopy height (CH), canopy base height (CBH), canopy bulk density (CBD) and available canopy fuel (ACF) are specific inputs for wildfire behavior models such as FARSITE and emission models such as FOFEM. With finer spatial resolution data, accurate quantification of these metrics with detailed spatial heterogeneity can be accomplished. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and color near-infrared imagery are active and passive systems, respectively, that have been utilized for measuring a range of forest structure characteristics at high resolution. The objective of this research was to determine which remote sensing dataset can estimate canopy fuels more accurately and whether a fusion of these datasets produces more accurate estimates. Regression models were developed for ponderosa pine (Pines ponderosa) stand representative of eastern Washington State using field data collected in the Ahtanum State Forest and metrics derived from LiDAR and imagery. Strong relationships were found with LiDAR alone and LiDAR was found to increase canopy fuel accuracy compared to imagery. Fusing LiDAR with imagery and/or LiDAR intensity led to small increases in estimation accuracy over LiDAR alone. By improving the ability to estimate canopy fuels at higher spatial resolutions, spatially explicit fuel layers can be created and used in wildfire behavior and smoke emission models leading to more accurate estimations of crown fire risk and smoke related emissions.

Due to CH4\'s strong absorptions in the shortwave infrared (SWIR), the potential exists to use imaging spectrometers, such as the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), to map CH4 emissions. Here, we present research evaluating the ability of AVIRIS to map CH4 emitted by one of the largest marine geologic CH4 sources in the world, the Coal Oil Point seep field in the Santa Barbara Channel, California. To develop algorithms for detecting CH4 and to establish detection limits, initial analysis focused on simulated radiance spectra. calculated using Modtran 5.2 radiative transfer code that was parameterized to match scene conditions for a 6 August 2007 AVIRIS flight over the area. Model simulations included a range of surface albedos, variable column water vapor, and CH4 concentrations ranging from 1.7 ppm (background) up to the equivalent of 2500 ppm in the lower 20 m of the boundary layer. A multistep CH4 detection algorithm was developed using Modtran simulations. First, surface albedo was estimated from the radiance at 2139 nm. Next, albedo-specific radiance for background CH4 was used to calculate spectral residuals for CH4 above background. A CH4 index, C, calculated as the average residual between 2248 and 2298 nm, showed high sensitivity to CH4, with minimal sensitivity to water vapor or surface albedo. Detection limits in simulations depended on CH4 concentrations and albedo, ranging from 990 pprn for a 0.5% albedo surface, to as low as 18 pprn for albedos higher than 22%. Application of this approach to the AVIRIS data demonstrated considerable potential for mapping CH4. Due to specular reflectance off of the ocean surface, albedo in the scene varied significantly, from less than 0.5% to over 30%. Strong CH4 anomalies were observed in the data acquired over the seep field, which produced large C values with spectral residuals consistent with CH4 and estimated radiance spectra that matched measurements. All strong anomalies were located in close vicinity to and downwind from known CH4 sources. However, contrary to simulated data, C was overly sensitive to albedo, restricting high confidence anomalies only to the brightest surfaces, and showing high frequency spatial variation throughout the AVIRIS image. CH4 concentration was overestimated by C, potentially due to a spectral trend in sea surface reflectance and/or the impact of diffuse light on dark surfaces (<1%) leading to the over-expression of CH4 absorptions.

Analysis of the in-situ backscattering coefficients of the suspended particles (b(bp)) indicates that the accuracy becomes worse when the concentration of TSM (C-TSM) is higher than 20 mg/l. The accuracy of the b(bp) is improved by using a bio-optical model in which b(bp) is optimized with a non-linear least-square Levenberg-Marquardt method. The remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) is obtained by means of the optimization. The optimized R-rs for waters with C-TSM higher than 20 mg/l, together with the measured R-rs for waters with C-TSM lower than 20 mg/l, are used to establish the relationships between R-rs (748), R-rs (869) and R-rs (645), which are used in the iterative method for atmospheric correction. Two atmospheric correction algorithms are switched according to the water turbidity. The shortwave infrared wavelengths (SWIR) method is used for waters with high-turbidity, and the iterative method is used otherwise. Results of the atmospheric correction were then applied to the Tassan model modified in this paper to compute the C-TSM. Comparison between the retrieval results from MODIS imagery and the in-situ measurements indicates that the algorithms described in this paper can provide a reliable estimation of the C-TSM distributions in the YS and ECS.

In the past decade, data sources and methodologies for creating global land cover maps from remote sensing have evolved rapidly. Here we describe the datasets and algorithms used to create the Collection 5 MODIS Global Land Cover Type product, which is substantially changed relative to Collection 4. In addition to using updated input data, the algorithm and ancillary datasets used to produce the product have been refined. Most importantly, the Collection 5 product is generated at 500-m spatial resolution, providing a four-fold increase in spatial resolution relative to the previous version. In addition, many components of the classification algorithm have been changed. The training site database has been revised, land surface temperature is now included as an input feature. and ancillary datasets used in post-processing of ensemble decision tree results have been updated. Further, methods used to correct classifier results for bias imposed by training data properties have been refined, techniques used to fuse ancillary data based on spatially varying prior probabilities have been revised, and a variety of methods have been developed to address limitations of the algorithm for the urban, wetland, and deciduous needleleaf classes. Finally, techniques used to stabilize classification results across years have been developed and implemented to reduce year-to-year variation in land cover labels not associated with land cover change. Results from a cross-validation analysis indicate that the overall accuracy of the product is about 75% correctly classified, but that the range in class-specific accuracies is large. Comparison of Collection 5 maps with Collection 4 results show substantial differences arising from increased spatial resolution and changes in the input data and classification algorithm.

Data processing of these measurements leads to a large and representative dataset of Bidirectional Polarization Distribution Functions (BPDF) for a wide range of surface cover. All surfaces show a similar pattern of the polarized reflectances, with very little polarization at backscattering and a general increase with the phase angle. The largest polarized reflectances are observed facing the sun, with large sun and view angles and amount to 0.02-0.04 depending on the surface type. Simple BPDF models available in the literature predict the correct order of magnitude as well as the main features of its directional signatures. However, these models also show significant biases for some viewing geometries. We propose a new model for the BPDF of natural surfaces, based on theoretical development as well as empirical fit to the PARASOL measurements. This linear model with only one free parameter allows a similar fit to the measurements as a previously published one (Nadal and Breon, 1999), non-linear with two parameters. Because the BPDF of natural surfaces appears to vary very little, a fixed model (i.e. with a priori biome-specific values for the parameter) is defined and may be sufficient for most applications.

While Landsat images have advantageous spatial and spectral characteristics for describing vegetation properties, the Landsat sensor\'s revisit rate, or the temporal resolution of the data, is 16 days. When considering that cloud cover may impact any given acquisition, this lengthy revisit rate often results in a dearth of imagery for a desired time interval (e.g., month, growing season, or year) especially for areas at higher latitudes with shorter growing seasons. In contrast, MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) has a high temporal resolution, covering the Earth up to multiple times per day, and depending on the spectral characteristics of interest, MODIS data have spatial resolutions of 250 m, 500 m, and 1000 m. By combining Landsat and MODIS data, we are able to capitalize on the spatial detail of Landsat and the temporal regularity of MODIS acquisitions. In this research, we apply and demonstrate a data fusion approach (Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model, STARFM) at a mainly coniferous study area in central British Columbia, Canada. Reflectance data for selected MODIS channels, all of which were resampled to 500 m, and Undsat (at 30 m) were combined to produce 18 synthetic Landsat images encompassing the 2001 growing season (May to October). We compared, on a channel-by-channel basis, the surface reflectance values (stratified by broad land cover types) of four real Landsat images with the corresponding closest date of synthetic Landsat imagery, and found no significant difference between real (observed) and synthetic (predicted) reflectance values (mean difference in reflectance: mixed forest (chi) over bar = 0.086, rho = 0.088, broadleaf (chi) over bar = 0.019, sigma = 0.079, coniferous (chi) over bar = 0.039, sigma = 0.093). Similarly, a pixel based analysis shows that predicted and observed reflectance values for the four Landsat dates were closely related (mean r(2) = 0.76 for the NIR band: r(2) = 0.54 for the red band; p<0.01). Investigating the trend in NDVI values in synthetic Landsat values over a growing season revealed that phenological patterns were well captured; however, when seasonal differences lead to a change in land cover (i.e., disturbance, snow cover), the algorithm used to generate the synthetic Landsat images was, as expected, less effective at predicting reflectance.

A test dataset for the V4.1 product was produced by MODAPS for a 3-month period from July through September 2004, and after an initial evaluation period, it was decided to generate the V4.1 product from mission period 2007001 onwards as a continuation of previous years of V4 data. This paper compares MODIS retrieved surface emissivities between V4, V4.1 and V5 using the level-3 MODIS daily LST&E product, MOD11B1.Comparisons of MOD11B1 retrieved surface emissivity during the Jul-Sep 2004 test period with lab measurements of sand samples collected at the Namib desert, Namibia result in a combined mean absolute emissivity difference for bands 29 (8.55 mu m), 31 (11 mu m) and 32 (12 mu m) of 1.06%, 0.65% and 1.93% for V4, V4.1 and V5 respectively.

Multi-temporal C-band SAR data were shown to be capable of mapping forested wetlands and monitoring hydroperiod (i.e., temporal fluctuations in inundation and soil moisture) at the study site, and the discrimination of wetland from upland was improved with 10 m digital elevation data. Principal component analysis was used to summarize the multi-temporal SAR data sets and to isolate the dominant temporal trend in inundation and soil moisture (i.e., relative hydroperiod). Significant positive, linear correlations were found between the first principal component and Percent area flooded and soil moisture. The correlation (r(2)) between the first principal component (PC1) of multi-temporal C-HH SAR data and average soil moisture was 0.88 (p=<.0001) during the leaf-off season and 0.87 (p=<.0001) during the leaf-on season, while the correlation between PC1 and average percent area inundated was 0.82 (p=<.0001) and 0.47 (p=.0016) during the leaf-off and leaf-on seasons, respectively. When compared to field data, the SAR forested wetland maps identified areas that were flooded for 25% of the time with 63-96% agreement and areas flooded for 25% of the time with 44-89% agreement, depending on polarization and time of year. The results are encouraging and justify further studies to attempt to quantify the relative SAR-derived hydroperiod classes in terms of physical variables and also to test the application of SAR data to more diverse landscapes at a broader scale. The present evidence suggests that the SAR data will significantly improve routine wooded wetland mapping.

The Florida Everglades is one of the largest wetlands in the US, and is subject to substantial development and pressures that require intensive hydrological modeling and monitoring. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) is a global sensor with high frequency repeat coverage and significant potential for mapping wetland extent and dynamics at moderate spatial resolutions. In this study, empirical models to predict surface inundation in the Everglades were estimated using MODIS data calibrated to water stage data from the South Florida Water Management District for the calendar year 2004. The results show that hydropatterns in the Florida Everglades are strongly correlated to a Tasseled Cap wetness index derived from MODIS Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Function Adjusted Reflectance data. Several indices were tested, including the Normalized Difference Wetness Index and the diurnal land surface temperature difference, but the Tasseled Cap wetness index showed the strongest correlation to water stage data across a range of surface vegetation types. Other variables included in the analysis were elevation and percent tree cover present within a pixel. Using logistic regression and ensemble regression trees, maps of water depth and flooding likelihood were produced for each 16-day MODIS data period in 2004. The results suggest that MODIS is useful for dynamic monitoring of flooding, particularly in wetlands with sparse tree cover. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Early efforts to characterize this association used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to represent ecosystem energy. While this spectral vegetation index covaries with measures of ecosystem energy such as net primary production, the covariation is known to degrade in areas of very low vegetation or in areas of dense forest. Two of the new vegetation products from the MODIS sensor, derived by integrating spectral reflectance, climate data, and land cover, are thought to better approximate primary productivity than NDVI. In this study, we determine if the new MODIS derived measures of primary production, gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP) better explain variation in bird richness than historically used NDVI. Moreover, we evaluate if the two productivity measures covary more strongly with bird diversity in those vegetation conditions where limitations of NDVI are well recognized.   Biodiversity was represented as native landbird species richness derived from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Analyses included correlation analyses among predictor variables, and univariate regression analyses between each predictor variable and bird species richness. Analyses were done at two levels: for all BBS routes across natural landscapes in North America: and for routes in 10 vegetation classes stratified by vegetated cover along a gradient from bare ground to herbaceous cover to tree cover. We found that NDVI, GPP and NPP were highly correlated and explained similar variation in bird species richness when analyzed for all samples across North America. However, when samples were stratified by vegetated cover, strength of correlation between NDVI and both productivity measures was low for samples with bare ground and for dense forest. The NDVI also explained substantially less variation in bird species richness than the primary production in areas with more bare ground and in areas of dense forest. We conclude that MODIS productivity measures have higher utility in Studies of the relationship of species richness and productivity and that MODIS GPP and NPP improve on NDVI, especially for studies with large variation in vegetated cover and density.

Remote-sensing using field-based sensors enable ecologists to capture Variability that must be measured to test hypotheses about small-scale processes.   We present two case studies where remote-sensing from field-based platforms has been used to acquire data for manipulative ecological experiments in intertidal areas. The first study, from a rock platform, investigates the spatial scales of variability in chlorophyll (as an index of algal biomass) in experimental plots prior to and after the removal of encrusting macro-algae. Digital colour-infrared (CIR) imagery of the rock platform was obtained before the removal of the encrusting macro-algae and on 1, 44, 75,117 and 160 days after removal. Amount of chlorophyll was derived from the CIR data using a simple ratio of reflectances at near-infrared (NIR) and red wavelengths. Block Mean Square (BMS) analysis showed that there was little variability in amounts of chlorophyll at very small (<= 2.26 cm(2)) scales, prior to and after removal of encrusting macro-algae. The greatest variability occurred at the largest block-size analysed (36.19 cm(2)). This identifies the spatial scale at which micro-algal food resources are variably scattered on the shore. Results discriminate variability at about 60-80 mm distances. Distributions of micro-algae are caused by a complicated interplay of scale-dependent ecological processes, including grazing. These findings provide a basis for the design of manipulative experiments at appropriate scales to unravel these processes.   The second study used field reflectance spectra (350-1050 nm) to: i) determine whether the amount of algae in soft sediments could be changed by manipulating the amounts of light reaching the sediment surface and ii) test the hypothesis that the strength of in vivo absorption features, as indices of the amount of chlorophyll and other pigments, was correlated with measures of sediment-stability (erosion threshold and erosion rate). Several different measures of the strength of absorption features were investigated to determine the best predictor of stability of the sediment. Reflectance spectra showed that amounts of algae had been successfully manipulated. Derivative reflectance at individual wavelengths, indicative of absorption by chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-c, were the best predictors of sediment-stability.   These case studies demonstrate some novel uses of field-based remote-sensing to provide information at the spatial scales relevant to many intertidal ecologists. Such techniques should have an increasingly important role in ecological field experimentation where non-destructive sampling of photosynthetic pigments is desired. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Subsequently the pairs of bidirectional reflectance factors (BRF) and model parameters estimated from the sample set of pixels are used to train the neural network. Since the mathematical formulation of the RPV model is embedded in these training data variables, the neural network can efficiently retrieve the model parameters for the whole satellite scene. This scheme has been tested for a MISR L2 BRF scene, MISR L1B2-deFived BRF data corresponding to two different dates and a mosaic of MISR L2 BRF scenes acquired over Southern Africa covering a large extent of Miombo woodland. The results show this strategy retrieves the RPV model parameters and uncertainties with high accuracy and considerable speed over large areas. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We segment a QuickBird image covering a beech forest in an initial stage of old-growthness - showing, accordingly, a good degree of structural complexity - into three segmentation levels. We apply field-based diversity indices of tree size, spacing, species assemblage to quantify structural heterogeneity amongst forest regions delineated by segmentation. The aim of the study is to evaluate, on a statistical basis, the relationships between spectrally delineated image segments and observed spatial heterogeneity in forest structure, including gaps in the outer canopy. Results show that: some 45% of the segments generated at the coarser segmentation scale (level 1) are surrounded by structurally different neighbours; level 2 segments distinguish spatial heterogeneity in forest structure in about 63% of level 1 segments; level 3 image segments detect better canopy gaps, rather than differences in the spatial pattern of the investigated structural indices.   Results support also the idea of a mixture of macro and micro structural heterogeneity within the beech forest: large size populations of trees homogeneous for the examined structural indices at the coarser segmentation level, when analysed at a finer scale, are internally heterogeneous; and vice versa.   Findings from this study demonstrate that multiresolution segmentation is able to delineate scale-dependent patterns of forest structural heterogeneity, even in an initial stage of old-growth structural differentiation. This tool has therefore a potential to improve the sampling design of field surveys aimed at characterizing forest structural complexity across multiple spatio-temporal scales. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Traditionally, rangelands provided resources for livestock grazing in transhumantic rotation schemes. In recent times, there has been a trend towards semi-intensive grazing systems, which is partly connected to the European system of agricultural and infrastructural subsidies, and which effectuates both intensification and extensification. This study employed trend analysis of a remote sensing data time series for a retrospective assessment of rangeland processes, and interpreted these in the light of land-use practices and previous management interventions.   We have selected a test area in Northern Greece that is representative of typical land-use transitions of the European Mediterranean. A time series of Landsat TM and ETM+ data covering the years 1984-2000 with one image per year was acquired, and for all images a geometric correction including digital elevation information and full radiative transfer modelling were carried out to attain surface reflectance data. For further analyses, proportional vegetation cover was selected as the target indicator, which was derived using Spectral Mixture Analysis. The resulting data set was used in a linear trend analysis to characterize spatio-temporal patterns of vegetation cover development. These could be interpreted based on knowledge of the local grazing regime and factors driving it, as well as using auxiliary spatial data sets. Results showed that temporal trends in the test area reflect the underlying pattern of potential livestock distribution at the per-pixel level, with a spatially differentiated pattern of both positive and negative trends in close proximity. On the other hand, no direct relation could be established between the development of vegetation cover and animal stocking rates at the community level. This suggests that this aggregation level is too coarse given the combination of highly heterogeneous landscapes with semi-intensive to intensive land tenure systems. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we examine the application of recently developed global data products from satellite observations in modeling the potential distribution of tree species and diversity in the Amazon basin. We use data from satellite sensors, including MODIS, QSCAT, SRTM, and TRMM, to develop different environmental variables related to vegetation, landscape, and climate. These variables are used in a maximum entropy method (Maxent) to model the geographical distribution of five commercial trees and to classify the patterns of tree alpha-diversity in the Amazon basin. Maxent simulations are analyzed using binomial tests of omission rates and the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves to examine the model performance, the accuracy of geographic distributions, and the significance of environmental variables for discriminating suitable habitats. To evaluate the importance of satellite data, we used the Maxent jackknife test to quantify the training gains from data layers and to compare the results with model simulations using climate-only data. For all species and tree alpha-diversity, modeled distributions are in agreement with historical data and field observations. The results compare with climate-derived patterns, but provide better spatial resolution and detailed information on the habitat characteristics. Among satellite data products, QSCAT backscatter, representing canopy moisture and roughness, and MODIS leaf area index (LAI) are the most important variables in almost all cases. Model simulations suggest that climate and remote sensing results are complementary and that the best distribution patterns can be achieved when the two data sets are combined. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Four orthogonal dimensions of ocean color defined from the original R-rs(lambda) spectra are used as predictors in multiple linear regressions of K-d(lambda) to develop the algorithms. In the case of SeaUV(C), an optical classification permits the development of water-type specific parameterizations. Validation against an independent synthetic Hydrolight (R) data set and an in sitar data set showed that the algorithms can be used with confidence over the range of water types for which they have been developed. SeaUV and SeaUV(C) will find applicability in the fields of marine photochemistry and photobiology where their performance and inherent simplicity make them suitable for batch implementation on large data sets and at global scales.

Since some ocean basins are biologically active, it is necessary fir an OGCM to take water turbidity into account, even if it is not coupled with a biological model. Sensitivity experiments carried out with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) OGCM with spatially and temporally-varying pigment concentration from Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) data during 1998-2003 reveal the effect of ocean turbidity on tropical Indian Ocean circulation. Variations of light-absorbing phytoplankton pigments change the vertical distribution of solar heating in the mixed layer, thereby affecting upper-ocean circulation. A simulation was performed from 1948 to 2003 with a constant minimum pigment concentration of 0.02 mg m(-3) while another simulation was performed from September 1997 to December 2003 with variable pigment concentration, and the differences between these two simulations allow us to quantify the effects of phytoplankton on solar radiation penetration in the ocean model. Model results from a period of 6 years (1998-2003) show large seasonal variability in the strength of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC), meridional heat transports (MHT), and equatorial under current (EUC). The MOC mass transport changes by 2 to 5 Sv (1 Sv=10(6) m(3) s(-1)) between boreal winter (January) and boreal summer (July), with a corresponding change in the MHT of similar to 0.05 PW (1 PW=10(15) W) in boreal winter, which is close to the expected change associated with a significant climate change [Shell, K., Frouin, R., Nakamoto, S., & Somerville, R.C.J.

In addition, changes in phytoplankton pigments concentration are associated with a reduction in the EUC by similar to 3 cm s(-1). We discuss the possible physical mechanisms behind this variability, and the necessity of including phytoplankton forcing in the OGCM. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Although our study is limited to south Florida it has implication for other large-scale wetlands, because south Florida wetlands have diverse vegetation types and both managed and natural flow environments. Our analysis reveals that interferometric coherence level is sensitive to wetland vegetation type and to the interferogram time span. Interferograms with time spans less than six months maintain phase observations for all wetland types, allowing characterization of water level changes in different wetland environments. The most noticeable changes occur between the managed and the natural flow wetlands. In the managed wetlands, fringes are organized, follow patterns related to some of the managed water control structures and have high fringe-rate. In the natural flow areas, fringes are irregular and have a low fringe-rate. The high fringe rate in managed areas reflects dynamic water topography caused by high flow rate due to gate operation. Although this organized fringe pattern is not characteristic of most large-scale wetlands, the high level of water level change enables accurate estimation of the wetland InSAR technique, which lies in the range of 5-10 cm. The irregular and low rate fringe pattern in the natural flow area reflects uninterrupted flow that diffuses water efficiently and evenly. Most of the interferograms in the natural flow area show an elongated fringe located along the transitional zone between salt- and fresh-water wetlands, reflecting water level changes due to ocean tides.

These models simulate the interactions of solar radiation within a given medium (e.g., clouds, plant canopies) and are used to generate look-up-tables that are embedded into quantitative retrieval algorithms, such as those delivering the operational surface products for MODIS, MISR and MERIS. An assessment of the quality of canopy RT models thus appears essential if accurate and reliable information is to be derived from them. Until recently such an undertaking was a time consuming and labour intensive process that was made even more challenging by the general lack of absolute reference standards. Several years of benchmarking activities in the frame of the RAdiation transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI) exercise have now led to the development of the RAMI On-line Model Checker (ROMC). The ROMC is a web-based tool allowing model developers and users to autonomously assess the performance of canopy RT models (http://romcjrc.ec.europa.eo. Access to the ROMC is free and enables users to obtain both statistical and graphical indications as to the performance of their canopy RT model. In addition to providing an overall indication of the skill of a given model to correctly match the reference data, the ROMC allows also for interactive comparison/evaluations of different model versions/submissions of a given user. All ROMC graphs can be downloaded in PostScript format and come with a reference number for easy usage in presentations and publications. It is hoped that the ROMC will prove useful for the RT modeling community as a whole, not only by providing a convenient means to evaluate models outside the triennial phases of RAMI but also to attract participation in future RAMI activities.

This study describes a model for 3-D canopy radiative transfer that is directly coupled with an atmospheric radiative transfer model (Forest Light Environmental Simulator, FLiES). The model was developed based on the Monte Carlo ray-tracing method using some existing modeling frameworks. To integrate the canopy radiative transfer model with atmosphere, the same numerical method, sampling technique, and variance reduction technique were employed in both the atmospheric and the canopy modules. Farquhar\'s leaf photosynthesis model was combined to calculate the canopy level photosynthesis from the light environmental parameters obtained by the radiative transfer calculation. In order to document the quality of the coupled model, we first compared the atmospheric radiative transfer module to well known 1-D atmospheric radiative transfer models, and then evaluated the 3-D canopy radiative transfer module against a series of test cases provided by the RAMI On-line Model Checker (ROMC). We used the model to show the impact of atmospheric properties and 3-D canopy structure on the directionality of downward photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at the top of canopy, the 3-D distribution of absorbed PAR (APAR), and overall canopy photosynthesis. The results indicate the importance to consider angular geometry of incident light at TOC and 3-D canopy structure. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The initial ice thickness was determined by radar altimetry, the iceberg shape from radar imaging and optical instruments. The freeboard change at different stages of the drift was derived from ICESat Laser altimeter profiles. The analysis of the satellite data confirms that the decay of A-38B is governed mainly by basal erosion. We then used a numerical model for simulating iceberg melting and fitted the melt rate by varying the turbulent exchange parameters for temperature (gamma(T)) and salt (gamma(s)) to match the results obtained by ICESat data. Our results show that the iceberg passed through three melting regimes characterized by iceberg drift velocity: (1) In the Weddell Sea melting conditions are similar to the situation under an ice shelf with strong tidal currents which corresponds to a gamma(T) Of 1.0 * 10(-4) m s(-1). (2) In the Scotia Sea, where the iceberg drifts unhindered with the ocean current and is surrounded by its own melt water, gamma(T,) is 0.4 * 10(-4) m s(-1). (3) At the grounding position friction velocity is again high due to tidal currents and gamma(T) is 1.8 * 10(-4) m s(-1). gamma(s) is set to 0.00505 gamma(T) in all cases. The analysis shows that ICESat GLAS data together with satellite imagery can provide better estimates of turbulent exchange parameters, which is a step forward in improving the knowledge of fresh water input from melting icebergs into the Southern Ocean.

Differently from visible wavelengths, where the sensitivity to grain size is very low, in the near-infrared band there is a strong sensitivity of the reflectance to the grain size. This sensitivity provides the basis for the retrieval of grain size. In this paper we introduce a new snow retrieval algorithm that makes use of near-infrared measurements in which snow is modeled as a semi-infinite, weakly absorbing medium. It is assumed that the dense packing effects can be neglected and the radiative transport in snow can be studied using the standard radiative transfer equation extensively used, e.g., in cloud optics. The shape of grains is accounted for in the framework of fractal snow grain model. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using ground-based measurements of snow albedo and results from a different retrieval algorithm. The technique is applied to study the changes of snow properties before and just after snow fall as seen by two MODIS sensors on TERRA and AQUA satellites. These satellites fly approximately 3 h and half apart (10:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. equator crossing time). The values of grain size retrieved from MODIS are also compared with values of grain size collected on ground. However, the area observed by MODIS including the locations of ground measurements was completely covered by clouds on the date of the measurements and the comparison could be performed only for the two previous days. A sensitivity analysis of the retrieval error due to atmospheric correction is also performed. Results show that the error on grain size retrieval induced by atmospheric correction ranges between +/- 5% and +/- 40%, depending on the grain size. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The cloud screening algorithm was then fine tuned using a global network of cloudiness observations. Atmospheric correction is then achieved using the SMAC code with inputs coming from meteorological values of pressure, ozone and water vapour. Aerosol optical thickness is derived from MODIS climatology assuming continental aerosol type. The Roujean BRDF model is then adjusted for red, near infrared and short wave infrared bands used to the remaining cloud free observations collected over a time window of 15 days. Outliers due to possible cloud contamination or residual atmospheric correction are iteratively eliminated and prior information is used to get more robust estimates of the three BRDF kernel coefficients. Nadir viewing top of canopy reflectance in the three bands is input to the biophysical algorithm to compute the products at 10 days sampling interval.

Here, we describe and test a new conceptual approach to change detection of forests using a dense temporal stack of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. The central premise of the method is the recognition that many phenomena associated with changes in land cover have distinctive temporal progressions both before and after the change event, and that these lead to characteristic temporal signatures in spectral space. Rather than search for single change events between two dates of imagery, we instead search for these idealized signatures in the entire temporal trajectory of spectral values. This trajectory-based change detection is automated, requires no screening of non-forest area, and requires no metric-specific threshold development. Moreover, the method simultaneously provides estimates of discontinuous phenomena (disturbance date and intensity) as well as continuous phenomena (post-disturbance regeneration). We applied the method to a stack of 18 Landsat TM images for the 20-year period from 1984 to 2004. When compared with direct interpreter delineation of disturbance events, the automated method accurately labeled year of disturbance with 90% overall accuracy in clear-cuts and with 77% accuracy in partial-cuts (thinnings). The primary source of error in the method was misregistration of images in the stack, suggesting that higher accuracies are possible with better registration. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

However, the three records are different in some cases. First, minor differences among the monthly records of intensity index are observed in the period July to September. Secondly, the interannual records of SCSWP intensity derived from AVHRR and O1.v2 are different in autumn during the period 1990-1996. The reason is not yet clear and nor is it clear which record best represents fluctuations in SCSWP intensity. These suggest that various drawbacks of the three datasets, such as low resolution of O1.v2, and cloud and rain contamination on AVHRR and TMI data, would be serious enough to allow deviation from each other to appear. Merging AVHRR and TMI SST data might be the way leading to a more convincing time series of SCSWP. In addition, changes of areal and intensity indices are not always consistent with each other, for example, they have different monthly patterns. Although the three interannual records of intensity index in three seasons all capture the main Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) signals at a half-year lag, only those which are in the summer significantly correlated with MEI.

The occurrence of a 4000-ha wildfire in the Linville Gorge Wilderness area in western North Carolina has provided a rare opportunity to study a large fire with a range of severities. The objectives of this study were to 1) assess the potential for using multi-temporal Landsat imagery to map fire severity in the southern Appalachians, 2) examine the influences of topography and forest community type on the spatial pattern of fire severity; and 3) examine the relationship between predicted fire severity and changes in species richness. A non-linear regression equation predicted a field-based composite burn index (CBI) as a function of change in the Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) with an R(2) of 0.71. Fire severity was highest on drier landforms located on upper hillslopes, ridges, and on southwest aspects, and was higher in pine communities than in other forest types. Predicted CBI was positively correlated with changes in species richness and with the post-fire cover of pine seedlings (Pinus virginiana, R rigida, and P pungens), suggesting that burn severity maps can be used to predict community-level fire effects across large landscapes. Despite the relatively large size of this fire for the southern Appalachians, severity was strongly linked to topographic variability and pre-fire vegetation, and spatial variation in fire severity was correlated with changes in species richness. Thus, the Linville Gorge fire appears to have generally reinforced the ecological constraints imposed by underlying environmental gradients. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The SMOS baseline payload is an L-band (1.4 GHz) two dimensional interferometric microwave radiometer which will provide multi-angular and dual-polarization observations. In the framework of the ground segment activities for the SMOS mission an operational SMOS Level 2 Soil Moisture algorithm was developed. The principle of the algorithm is to exploit multi-angular data in order to retrieve simultaneously several surface parameters including soil moisture and vegetation characteristics. The algorithm uses an iterative approach, minimizing a cost function computed from the differences between measured and modelled brightness temperature (TB) data, for all available incidence angles.   In the algorithm, the selected forward model is the so-called L-MEB (L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere) model which was the result of an extensive review of the current knowledge of the microwave emission of various land covers. This model is a key element in the SMOS L2 algorithm and could be used in future assimilation studies. There is thus a strong need for a reference study, describing the model and its implementation. In order to address these needs a detailed description of soil and vegetation modelling in L-MEB is given in this study. In a second step, the use of L-MEB in soil moisture retrievals is evaluated for several experimental data sets over agricultural crops. Calibrations of the soil and vegetation L-MEB parameters are investigated for corn, soybean and wheat. Over the different experiments, very consistent results are obtained for each vegetation type in terms of calibration and soil moisture retrievals. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

However the assessment of differences in measured and modeled C accumulation is a challenging task due to the significant fine scale variation occurring in terrestrial productivity due to soil, climate and vegetation characteristics as well as difficultie,s in measuring carbon accumulation over large spatial areas. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) offers a means of monitoring gross primary production (GPP), both spatially and temporally, routinely from space. However it is critical to compare and contrast the temporal dynamics of the C and water fluxes with those measured from ground-based networks, or estimated using physiological models. In this paper, using a number of approaches, our objective is to determine if any systematic biases exists in either the MODIS, or the modeled estimates of fluxes, relative to the measurements made over an evergreen, needleleaf temperate rainforest on Vancouver Island, Canada. Results indicate that 8-day GPP as predicted with a simple physiological model (3PGS), forced using local meteorology and canopy characteristics, matched measured fluxes very well (r(2)-0.86, p < 0.001) with no significant difference between eddy covariance (EC) and modeled GPP (p < 0.001). In addition, modeled water supply closely matched measured relative available soil water content at the site. Using canopy characteristics from the MODIS fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (WAR) algorithm, slightly reduced the correspondence of the predictions due to a large number of unsuccessful retrievals (83%) due to sun angle, snow and cloud. Predictions of GPP based on the MODIS GPP algorithm, forced using local meteorology and canopy characteristics, were also highly correlated with EC measurements (r(2) = 0.88, p < 0.001) however these estimates were biased under predicting GPP. Estimates of GPP based on the most recent MODIS reprocessing (collection 4.5) remained highly correlated (r(2)=0.88, p < 0.001) yet were also the most biased with the estimates being 30% less than the EC-measured GPP. Most of the variance in GPP at the site was explained by the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation. We also compared the nighttime respiration as measured over 2 years at the site with the minimum 8-day MODIS land surface temperature and found a significant relationship (r(2)=0.57), similar to other studies.

The distributions of these materials affect post-fire processes of erosion, nutrient cycling, and vegetation regrowth. We analyzed high spatial resolution (2.4 in pixel size) Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data collected over the Cerro Grande fire, to map post-fire surface cover into 10 classes, including ash, soil minerals, scorched conifer trees, and green vegetation. The Cerro Grande fire occurred near Los Alamos, New Mexico, in May 2000. The AVIRIS data were collected September 3, 2000. The surface cover map revealed complex patterns of ash, iron oxide minerals, and clay minerals in areas of complete combustion. Scorched conifer trees, which retained dry needles heated by the fire but not fully combusted by the flames, were found to cover much of the post-fire landscape. These scorched trees were found in narrow zones at the edges of completely burned areas. A surface cover map was also made using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) data, collected September 5, 2000, and a maximum likelihood, supervised classification. When compared to AVIRIS, the Landsat classification grossly overestimated cover by dry conifer and ash classes and severely underestimated soil and green vegetation cover. In a comparison of AVIRIS surface cover to the Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) map of burn severity, the BAER high burn severity areas did not capture the variable patterns of post-fire surface cover by ash, soil, and scorched conifer trees seen in the AVIRIS map. The BAER map, derived from air photos, also did not capture the distribution of scorched trees that were observed in the AVIRIS map. Similarly, the moderate severity class of Landsat-derived burn severity maps generated from the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) calculation had low agreement with the AVIRIS classes of scorched conifer trees. Burn severity and surface cover images were found to contain complementary information, with the dNBR map presenting an image of degree of change caused by fire and the AVIRIS-derived map showing specific surface cover resulting from fire.

Irrespective of new instrumental developments like the laser altimeter on ICESat (Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite) the well-established radar altimeter (RA) missions ERS-1,2 (European Remote Sensing satellites) and ENVISAT (ENVIronment SATellite) are unique in their temporal coverage over more than a decade and in their temporal and spatial sampling. Therefore, the full exploitation of these RA data by improved methods is imperative. Here we develop improved techniques to correct for topographically induced errors by a refined consideration of the relevant topographic conditions. Furthermore we improve the gridding procedure by adapting it to local conditions and thus preserving smaller-scale features. We apply our methods to the region of the subglacial Lake Vostok/Antarctica and derive digital elevation models (DEMs) for this region with the aim of improving/resolving smaller scales. The effect of our improvements is demonstrated in detail by comparing our DEMs and previously published DEMs to the ICESat laser measurements which are taken as a reference here. Due to our improvements, the standard deviation of the difference between RA-based DEMs of the Lake Vostok region and ICESat data decreases from more than 1.1 m to 0.5 m. This remaining error is chiefly the error inherent in the RA observations.

An empirical piecewise regression (PWR) GPP model was developed from flux tower measurements to map carbon flux across the region. The Moderate Resolution Imaging spectrometer (MODIS) GPP model is a process-based model that uses flux tower data to calibrate its parameters. Verification and comparison of the regional PWR GPP and the global MODIS GPP are important for the modeling of grassland carbon flux. This study compared GPP estimates from PWR and MODIS models with five towers in the grasslands. Among them, PWR GPP and MODIS GPP showed a good agreement with tower-based GPP at three towers. The global MODIS GPP, however, did not agree well with tower-based GPP at two other towers, probably because of the insensitivity of MODIS model to regional ecosystem and climate change and extreme soil moisture conditions. Cross-validation indicated that the PWR model is relatively robust for predicting regional grassland GPP. However, the MYR model should include a wide variety of flux tower data as the training data sets to obtain more accurate results.   In addition, GPP maps based on the PWR and MODIS models were compared for the entire region. In the northwest and south, PWR GPP was much higher than MODIS GPP. These areas were characterized by the higher water holding capacity with a lower proportion of C-4 grasses in the northwest and a higher proportion Of C4 grasses in the south. In the central and southeastern regions, PWR GPP was much lower than MODIS GPP under complicated conditions with generally mixed C-3/C-4 grasses. The analysis indicated that the global MODIS GPP model has some limitations on detecting moisture stress, which may have been caused by the facts that C-3 and C-4 grasses are not distinguished, water stress is driven by vapor pressure deficit (VPD) from coarse meteorological data, and MODIS land cover data are unable to differentiate the sub-pixel cropland components.

This study considers the factors that affect the amplitude of the bottom return and examines the use of the amplitude of the bottom return to distinguishing between different bottom types. The amplitude of the bottom return was corrected for pulse stretching and retro-reflectance due to the bottom slope based on a simple lidar radiative transfer model before the examination. Within-flightline and between-flightline variations of the bottom return were considered, both of which are related to the attenuation of water, surface wave condition, and bottom reflectivity. The major concern of within-flightline variation is the effect of surface waves on the reliability of bottom return. Between-flightline variation concerns the effect of change in viewing orientation on the bottom return from the same bottom type. A data set of Egmont Key, Florida, assuming homogeneous water clarity, was chosen to investigate the latter two effects on the bottom return signals. The result shows that the presence of surface waves is the most impeding factor that complicates the use of bottom return signal, as it can exaggerate the value (not prominent in our data) and variance of the amplitude of bottom return. A map of sand, continuous seagrass, and discontinuous seagrass ranging from the depth of 0.8 to 4.3 m was produced correctly from a single lidar flightline with limited in-situ information, in this case, a nadir viewing videotape concurrent with lidar survey mission.

Surface heterogeneity induces uncertainty in pixel-wise LST. Spatial scaling may account for the uncertainty, however, different approaches lead to differences in scaled values. Satellite-retrieved LST may be representative of the pixel-wise LST and useful for scaling analysis, but the limited accuracy of retrieved values adds uncertainty into the scaled values. Based on the Stefan-Boltzmann (S-B) law, this study proposed scaling approaches for LST over flat and relief areas to explore the combined uncertainties in scaling using satellite-retrieved data. To take advantage of simultaneous, multi-resolution observations at coincident nadirs by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), LST products from these two sensors were examined for part of the Loess Plateau in China. 90-m ASTER LST data were scaled up to 1 km using the proposed approaches, and variation in the LST was generally reduced after scaling. Amongst the sources of uncertainties, surface heterogeneity (emissivity) and different scaling approaches resulted in very minor differences, with a maximum difference of 0.2 K for the upscaled LST. Terrain features, taken as an areal weighting factor, had negligible effects on the upscaled value. Limited accuracy of the retrieved LST was the major uncertainty. The overall LST increased 0.6 K on average with correction for terrain-induced angular effect and 0.4 K for both angular and adjacency effects over the study area. Accounting for terrain correction in scaling is necessary for rugged areas. With terrain correction, the upscaled ASTER LST achieved an agreement of -0.1 +/- 1.87 K and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.87 K overall with the 1-km MODIS LST rectified by Wan et al.\'s approach [Wan, Z., Zhang, Y., Zhang Q., Li, Z.-L.

Such patterns arise through the elaboration of a network structure driven by the tidal forcing and through the interaction between hydrodynamical, geophysical and ecological components (chiefly vegetation). Intertidal morphological and ecological structures possess characteristic extent (order of kilometers) and small-scale features (down to tens of centimeters) which are not simultaneously accessible through field observations, thus making remote sensing a necessary observation tool. This paper describes a set of remote sensing observations from several satellite and airborne platforms, the collection of concurrent ground reference data and the vegetation distributions that may be inferred from them, with specific application to the Lagoon of Venice (Italy). The data set comprises ROSIS, CASI, MIVIS, IKONOS and QuickBird acquisitions, which cover a wide range of spatial and spectral resolutions. We show that spatially-detailed and quantitatively reliable vegetation maps may be derived from remote sensing in tidal environments through unsupervised (K-means) and supervised algorithms (Maximum Likelihood and Spectral Angle Mapper). We find that, for the objective of intertidal vegetation classification, hyperspectral data contain largely redundant information. This in particular implies that a reduction of the spectral features is required for the application of the Maximum Likelihood classifier. A large number of experiments with different feature extraction/selection algorithms show that the use of four bands derived from Maximum Noise Fraction transforms and four RGBI broad bands obtained by spectral averaging yield very similar classification performances. The classifications from hyperspectral data are somewhat superior to those from multispectral data, but the close performance and the results of the features reduction experiments show that spatial resolution affects classification accuracy much more importantly than spectral resolution. Monitoring schemes of tidal environment vegetation may thus be based on high-resolution satellite acquisitions accompanied by systematic ancillary field observations at a relatively limited number of reference sites, with practical consequences of some relevance.

However, at present no specific aerosol treatment is performed in the GERB processing chain, severely limiting the use of the data for aerosol studies. A particular problem relates to the misidentification of Saharan dust outbreaks as cloud which can bias the shortwave and longwave fluxes. In this paper an algorithm is developed which employs multiple-linear regression, using information from selected thermal infrared SEVIRI channels, to detect dust aerosol over ocean and provide an estimate of the optical depth at 0.55 mu m (tau(055)). To test the performance of the algorithm, it has been applied to a number of dust events observed by SEVIRI during March and June 2004. The results are compared to co-located MODIS observations taken from the Terra and Aqua platforms, and ground based observations from the Cape Verde AERONET site. In terms of detection capability, employing the algorithm results in a notable improvement in the routine GERB scene identification. Locations identified by MODIS as being likely to be dust contaminated were originally classified as cloud in over 99.5% of the cases studied. With the application of the detection algorithm approximately 60-70% of these points are identified as dusty depending on the dust model employed. The algorithm is also capable of detecting dust in regions and at times which would be excluded when using shortwave observations, due for example to the presence of sun-glint, or through the night. We further investigate whether the algorithm is capable of generating useful information concerning the aerosol loading. Comparisons with co-located retrievals from the SEVIRI 0.6 mu m solar reflectance band observations show a level of agreement consistent with that expected from the simulations, with rms differences of between 0.5 and 0.8, and a mean bias ranging from -0.5 to 0.3 dependent on the dust representation employed in the algorithm. Temporally resolved comparisons with observations from the Capo Verde AERONET site through the months of March and June reinforce these findings, but also indicate that the algorithm is capable of discerning the diurnal pattern in aerosol loading. The algorithm has now been incorporated within the routine GERB processing in detection mode, and will be used to provide an experimental aerosol product for assessment by the scientific community.

Previous studies have found that correct identification of these blooms remains a great challenge with the standard bio-optical algorithms applied to satellite ocean color data in optically complex coastal waters containing high concentrations of the interfered dissolved organic and particulate inorganic materials. Here a new method called the red tide index (RI) is presented which is capable of identifying potential areas of harmful algal blooms (HABs) from SeaWiFS ocean color measurements representing the typical Case-2 water environments off the Korean and Chinese coasts. The RI method employs the water-leaving radiances (L-w), collected from in-situ radiometric measurements of three SeaWiFS bands centered at 443 nm, 5 10 nm and 555 nm, to achieve derivation of indices that are then related to absorbing characteristics of harmful algae (i.e., Lw at 443 nm) from which a best fit with a cubic polynomial function with correlation coefficient of R-2 = 0.91 is obtained providing indices of higher ranges for HABs and lower and slightly reduced ranges for turbid and non-bloom waters. Similar indices derived from the use of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), normalized water-leaving radiance (nL(w)) and combination of both are found rather inadequate to characterize the variability of the encountered bloom. In order to quantify the HABs in terms of chlorophyll (Chl), an empirical relationship is established between the RI and in-situ Chl in surface waters from about 0.4-71 mg m(-3), which yields a Red tide index Chlorophyll Algorithm (RCA) based on an exponential function with correlation coefficient R-2 = 0.92. The established methods were extensively tested and compared with the performances of standard Ocean Chlorophyll 4 (OC4) algorithm and Local Chlorophyll Algorithm (LCA) using SeaWiFS images collected from typical red tide waters of Korean South Sea (KSS), East China Sea (ECS), Yellow Sea (YS) and Bohai Sea (BS) during 1999-2002. The standard spectral ratio algorithms, the OC4 and LCA, yielded large errors in Chl retrievals for coastal areas, besides providing false information about the encountered HABs in KSS, ECS, YS and BS waters. On the contrary, the RI coupled with the standard spectral ratios yielded comprehensive information about various ranges of algal blooms, while RCA Chl showing a good agreement with in-situ data led to enhanced understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of the recent HAB occurrences in high scattering and absorbing waters off the Korean and Chinese coasts.

In this study, the Short Wave Aerostat-Mounted Imager (SWAMI) tethered balloon-mounted platform was utilized to evaluate linear and nonlinear spectral mixture analysis (SMA) for a grassland-conifer forest ecotone during the summer of 2003. Hyperspectral measurement of a 74-m diameter ground instantaneous field of view (GIFOV) attained by the SWAMI was studied. Hyperspectral spectra of four common endmembers, bare soil, grass, tree, and shadow, were collected in situ, and images captured via video camera were interpreted into accurate areal ground cover fractions for evaluating the mixture models. The comparison between the SWAMI spectrum and the spectrum derived by combining in situ spectral data with video-derived areal fractions indicated that nonlinear effects occurred in the near infrared (NIR) region, while nonlinear influences were minimal in the visible region. The evaluation of hyperspectral and multispectral mixture models indicated that nonlinear mixture model-derived areal fractions were sensitive to the model input data, while the linear mixture model performed more stably. Areal fractions of bare soil were overestimated in all models due to the increased radiance of bare soil resulting from side scattering of NIR radiation by adjacent grass and trees. Unmixing errors occurred mainly due to multiple scattering as well as close endmember spectral correlation. In addition, though an apparent endmember assemblage could be derived using linear approaches to yield low residual error, the tree and shade endmember fractions calculated using this technique were erroneous and therefore separate treatment of endmembers subject to high amounts of multiple scattering (i.e. shadows and trees) must be done with caution. Including the short wave infrared (SWIR) region in the hyperspectral and multispectral endmember data significantly reduced the Pearson correlation coefficient values among endmember spectra. Therefore, combination of visible, NIR, and SWIR information is likely to further improve the utility of SMA in understanding ecosystem structure and function and may help narrow uncertainties when utilizing remotely sensed data to extrapolate trace glas flux measurements from the canopy scale to the landscape scale.

The area and intensity of these fires is strongly dependent upon the spatial variability and type of fuels as they are arrayed across the landscape. Considering the size of the patches and the mosaic of fuel materials, high spectral and spatial resolution estimates of vegetation components and fuel types are needed to improve fire risk assessment, especially around the wildland/urban interface. Here we used highly resolved remotely sensed imagery, in combination with several spectral techniques to map major forest components and fuel types in montane coniferous forests in the Colorado Front Range by discriminating the fractional covers of photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) and bare soil at a sub-pixel level. An accuracy assessment based on a dataset including 34 field transects indicated that we could explain fractional cover of 73.5%, 40.3%, and 77.6% for PV, NPV, and soil respectively through the use of hyperspectral indicators. Based on the fractional cover of these components, we were able to assess the spatial patterns of vegetation and fuel characteristics at a landscape scale. Throughout the study areas, PV fractions were dominant (48.7%), followed by NPV (28.8%) and soil (22.5%). However, due to microclimate and disturbances such as fire, insect infestations and forest management practices, the spatial distribution of fractions was highly heterogeneous. There was a high fraction of PV in mature forest and on north-facing slopes, and a high fraction of NPV and bare soil in areas with recent disturbance such as fire or insect infestation. In severely burned areas, bare soil was dominant. Fuel treatments reduced the fraction of PV by 11.7%, and increased fractions of NPV by 7.4% and bare soil by 4.5%. These results suggest that hyperspectral remote sensing can be an excellent indicator of not only fuel fractional cover, but of fuel condition after fire, thereby greatly improving regional fire risk assessment.

In this study, we assess the potential use of IKONOS, ETM+, and SPOT HRVIR sensors for leaf area index (LAI) estimation in forest stands. In situ measurements of LAI in 28 coniferous and deciduous stands are compared to reflectance in the visible, near-infrared, and shortwave bands, and also to five spectral vegetation indices (SVIs): Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Simple Ratio (SR), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI). The three sensor types show the same predictive ability for stand LAI, with an uncertainty of about 1.0m(2)/m(2) for LAI between 0.5 and 6.9 m(2)/m(2). For each sensor type, the strength of the empirical relationship between LAI and NDVI remains the same, regardless of the image processing level considered [digital counts, radiances using calibration coefficients for each sensor, top of atmosphere (TOA), and top of canopy (TOC) reflectances]. On the other hand, NDVIs based on radiance, TOA reflectance, and TOC reflectance, determined from IKONOS radiometric data, are systematically lower than from SPOT and ETM+ data. The offset is approximately 0.11 NDVI units for radiance and TOA reflectance-based NDVI, and approximately 0.20 NDVI units after atmospheric corrections. The same conclusions were observed using the other indices. SVIs using IKONOS data are always lower than those computed using ETM+ and SPOT data. Factors that may explain this behavior were investigated. Based on simulations using the SAIL bidirectional canopy reflectance model coupled with the PROSPECT leaf optical properties model (i.e., PROSAIL), we show that the spectral response in radiance of IKONOS sensor in the red band is the main factor explaining the differences in SVIs between IKONOS and the other two sensors. Finally, we conclude that, for bare soils or very sparse vegetation, radiometric data acquired by IKONOS, SPOT, and ETM+ are similar and may be used without any correction. For surfaces covered with dense vegetation, a negative offset of 10% of IKONOS NDVI should be considered. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Mapping of deforestation by the Brazil\'s National Space Research Institute (INPE) in areas of primary tropical forest using satellite data indicates a value of 587,727 km(2) up to the year 2000. Although most of the efforts have been concentrated in mapping primary tropical forest deforestation, there is also evidence of large-scale deforestation in the cerrado savanna, the second most important biome in the region.   The main purpose of this work was to assess the extent of agriculture/pasture and secondary succession forest in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) in 2000, using a set of multitemporal images from the 1-km SPOT-4 VEGETATION (VGT) sensor. Additionally, we discriminated primary tropical forest, cerrado savanna, and natural/artificial waterbodies. Four classification algorithms were tested: quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), simple classification trees (SCT), probability-bagging classification trees (PBCT), and k-nearest neighbors (K-NN). The agriculture/ pasture class is a surrogate for those areas cleared of its original vegetation cover in the past, acting as a source of carbon. On the contrary, the secondary succession forest class behaves as a sink of carbon.   We used a time series of 12 monthly composite images of the year 2000, derived from the SPOT-4 VGT sensor. A set of 19 Landsat scenes was used to select training and testing data. A 10-fold cross validation procedure rated PBCT as the best classification algorithm, with an overall sample accuracy of 0.92. High omission and commission errors occurred in the secondary succession forest class, due to confusion with agriculture/pasture and primary tropical forest classes. However, the PBCT algorithm generated the lower misclassification error in this class. Besides, this algorithm yields information about class membership probability, with similar to 80% of the pixels with class membership probability greater or equal than 0.8. The estimated total area of agriculture/pasture and secondary succession forest in 2000 in the BLA was 966 x 103 and 140 x 103 king, respectively. Comparison with an existing land cover map indicates that agriculture/pasture occurred primarily in areas previously occupied by primary tropical forest (46%) and cerrado savanna (33%), and also in transition forest (19%), and other vegetation types (2%). This further confines the existing evidence of extensive cerrado savanna conversion.   This study also concludes that SPOT-4 VGT data are adequate for discriminating several major land cover types in tropical regions. Agriculture/pasture was mapped with errors of about 5%. Very high classification errors were associated with secondary succession forest, suggesting that a different methodology/sensor has to be used to address this difficult land cover class (namely with the inclusion of ancillary data). For the other classes, we consider that accurate maps can be derived from SPOT-4 VGT data with errors lower than 20% for the cerrado savanna, and errors lower than 10% for the other land cover classes. These estimates may be useful to evaluate impacts of land use/land cover change on the carbon and water cycles, biotic diversity, and soil degradation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

However, the distribution of Case-1 waters in global scale has been vague, though open ocean waters are often referred to as Case-1 in the literature. In this study, based on recent bio-optical models for Case-1 waters, an inclusive and quantitative Case-1 criterion for remote sensing applications is developed. The criterion allows Case-1 waters to have about two-fold variations of non-pigment absorption and particle backscattering around their exact Case-1 values, allowing a large range of waters to be classified as Case-1. Even so, application of this criterion to ocean color data from the SeaWiFS satellite sensor suggests that Case-1 waters occupy only about 60% of the global ocean surface. Regionally, more Case-1 waters are found in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere, and most Indian Ocean waters are found to be Case-1. The Case-1 percentage and spatial distribution change with season, and with the boundaries chosen in the criterion. Nevertheless, this study for the first time provides a quantitative and geographical perspective of Case-1 waters in global scale, and further demonstrates that many open ocean waters are not necessarily Case-1.

The dependence of the directional ernissivity on the surface snow type (grain size and shape) was examined. We obtained emissivity spectra for five different surface types, i.e., fine dendrite snow, medium granular snow, coarse grain snow, welded sun crust snow, and smooth bare ice. The derived emissivities show a distinct spectral contrast at wavelengths lambda = 10.5-12.5 mu m which is enhanced with increasing the snow grain size. For example, emissivities at both 10.5 mu m and 12.5 mu m for the nadir angle were 0.997 and 0.984 for the fine dendrite snow, 0.996 and 0.974 for the medium granular snow, 0.995 and 0.971 for the coarse grain snow, 0.992 and 0.968 for the sun crust, and 0.993 and 0.949 for the bare ice, respectively. In addition, the spectral contrast exhibits a strong angular dependence, particularly for the coarser snow and bare ice, e.g., the emissivity lambda = 12.5 mu m for the off-nadir angle of 75 degrees reaches down to 0.927, 0.896, and 0.709 for the coarse grain snow, sun crust, and bare ice cases, respectively. The angular dependent emissivity spectra of the bare ice were quite consistent with the spectra predicted by the Fresnel reflectance theory. The observed results firmly demonstrate that the directional emissivity of snow in the TIR can vary depending upon the surface snow type. The high variability of the spectral emissivity of snow also suggests the possibility to discriminate between snow and ice types from space using the brightness temperature difference in the atmospheric window.

This is due partly to specific attributes of these environments, such as short growing season, long periods of darkness in winter, persistence of snow cover, and dominance of evergreen species, but also to the design of the models. We present a new method for monitoring vegetation activity at high latitudes, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI. It estimates the NDVI of the vegetation during winter and applies a double logistic function, which is uniquely defined by six parameters that describe the yearly NDVI time series. Using NDVI data from 2000 to 2004, we illustrate the performance of this method for an area in northern Scandinavia (35 x 162 km(2), 68 degrees N 23 degrees E) and compare it to existing methods based on Fourier series and asymmetric Gaussian functions. The double logistic functions describe the NDVI data better than both the Fourier series and the asymmetric Gaussian functions, as quantified by the root mean square errors. Compared with the method based on Fourier series, the new method does not overestimate the duration of the growing season. In addition, it handles outliers effectively and estimates parameters that are related to phenological events, such as the timing of spring and autumn. This makes the method most suitable for both estimating biophysical parameters and monitoring vegetation phenology. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Lascar is one of the most active volcanoes in Central Andes characterized by a recent cyclic activity. Additionally, it is located in favourable conditions for radar imaging. Lascar thus offers very good conditions for studying large to small scale ground deformations associated with volcano dynamics. The analysis of InSAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry) time series data from the European and Japanese satellites (ERS, JERS) acquired between 1993 and 2000, encompassing three eruptive events, confirmed the absence of broad far-field deformation signal. Thus during the recent activity of Lascar we discard significant magmatic input at depth. The following approaches were used to improve the InSAR signal/noise ratio in order to detect possible local deformation. We carried out a quantitative evaluation of the potential tropospheric contribution in INSAR interferograms for the Salar de Atacama-Lascar area using radar (ASAR-ENVISAT) and spectrometer (MODIS) data. We also used an accurate aerial photogrammetric and GPS constrained DEM in our InSAR data reprocessing. We find a co-eruptive ground-deformation confined into the summit crater for the 1995 eruption. This deformation has spatial dimension of 500 by 400 in and relates to a subsidence of crater floor up to 17 mm. We interpret it as pressure or volume decrease at subsurface levels below the active crater. Our study made it possible to image a new near-field volcanic deformation confined within the summit crater of the Lascar volcano. It also demonstrates that the combination of precise photogrammetry DEM and INSAR data can significantly improve our ability to remotely sense subtle surface deformation on these explosive volcanoes. This methodology might contribute to better understand volcano dynamics and to complement their monitoring in remote areas. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Mapping landcover with medium resolution data from Landsat presents challenges due to differences in time and space between scene acquisitions required for full coverage. These differences cause landcover signatures to vary due to haze, solar geometry and phenology, among other factors. One way to circumvent this problem is to have an image interpreter classify each scene independently, however, this is not an optimal solution in the north due to a lack of spatially extensive reference data and resources required to label scenes individually. Another possible approach is to stabilize signatures in space and time so that they may be extracted from one scene and extended to others, thereby reducing the amount of reference data and user input required for mapping large areas. A radiometric normalization approach was developed that exploits the high temporal frequency with which coarse resolution data are acquired and the high spatial frequency of medium resolution data. The Current paper compares this rachometric correction methodology with an established absolute calibration methodology for signature extension for landcover classification and explores factors that affect extension performance to recommend how and when signature extension can be applied. Overall, the new normalization method produced better extension and classification results than absolute calibration. Results also showed that extension performance was affected more by geographical distance than by differences in anniversary dates between acquisitions for the range of data examined. Geographical distance in the north-south direction leads to poorer extension performance than distance in the east-west direction due in part to differences in vegetation composition assigned the same class label in the latitudinal direction. While extension performance was somewhat variable and in some cases did not produce a best classification result by itself. it provided an initial best guess of landcover that can subsequently be refined by an expert image interpreter.

The Kuparuk River Watershed (8140 km(2)) test site on the North Slope of Alaska was chosen for its snowpack containing a think depth hoar layer and long history of ground truth data. A new regional snow water equivalent algorithm was developed to determine if it could produce better results than the existing algorithms in an area known to contain significant depth hoar. The four algorithms were tested to see how well they could determine snow water equivalent: (1) on a per pixel basis, (2) across swath-averaged spatial bands of approximately 850 km(2), and (3) on a watershed scale. The algorithms were evaluated to see if they captured the annual spatial distribution in snow water equivalent over the watershed. Results show that the algorithms developed by Chang and from this research are generally within 3 cm of the spatially averaged snow water equivalents over the entire watershed. The algorithms produced by Chang, Tait, and in this research were able to predict the basin-wide ground measured snow water equivalent value within a percent error range from -32.4% to 24.4% in the years with a typical snowpack.

The Getis statistic may be used to quantify the degree of spatial homogeneity or heterogeneity of a spatial data set. We test the application for sequential SPOT imagery that includes a coral reef in the Savusavu region of Fiji that underwent extensive damage due to an industrial accident between the image dates. The ability of the statistic to capture this damage is evaluated through comparison against a null case of open water with no change. A decadal time sequence of SPOT imagery for the Bunaken region of North Sulawesi is also examined to determine whether the statistic may be useful for image understanding where there is a lack of independent knowledge of the degree of coral stress in the area.   For the time series of data analyzed for the Bunaken region, we believe that a change in the spatial statistic applied to SPOT data represents a change in reef heterogeneity. Our premise is that heterogeneity is, at this scale, a surrogate for changes in \'reef health\' with the assumption that a healthy reef illustrates heterogeneity at the scale of the statistical operator. With additional data, this change detection procedure can be used to identify potential \'hot spots\' that warrant field examination for potential reef damage. This alternative to per-pixelbased approaches has the advantage that it is relatively insensitive to changes in depth, water constituents and atmospheric variability within the area of the spatial operator.

In fact, volcanic ash clouds pose a serious hazard for air traffic and the synoptic (and possibly frequent) coverage offered by satellites can provide exciting opportunities for monitoring activities as well as for risk mitigation purposes.   A new, AVHRR-based technique for improved automatic detection of volcanic clouds by means of multi-temporal analysis of historical, long-term satellite records has been recently proposed. The technique basically rests on the Robust AVHRR Techniques (RAT) approach, which is an innovative strategy of satellite data analysis, devoted to a former characterisation of the measured signal, in terms of expected value and natural variability and a further recognition of signal anomalies by an automatic, unsupervised change detection step. In this work, an extension of this method to nighttime observations is presented, by using thermal infrared information coming from AVHRR bands centred approximately at 3.5, 11.0 and 12.0 mum. Results achieved for two recent eruptive events of Mount Etna (occurred in May 2000 and in July 2001) seem to be encouraging, showing clear improvements in terms of ash detection sensitivity as well as in terms of false alarms reduction. The technique performance is also evaluated by comparison with the traditional \"split-window\" brightness temperature difference method; this exercise revealed a general improvement obtained by the proposed approach, even though some common problems still remain unsolved. The main merits of such an approach are its intrinsic self-adaptability to different environmental/naturat/observationaI conditions and its natural exportability also to different satellite sensors. The results here presented show the benefits of such a technique especially when different observational conditions (time of pass, seasonal period, atmospheric moisture, solar illumination, volcanic cloud composition, satellite angles of view, etc.) are considered.   The future prospects, also in terms of possible operational scenarios, coming from the implementation of such an approach on the new generation of satellite sensors (like, for example, SEVIRI aboard Meteosat Second Generation platform) are also discussed.

These included published recent estimates of the NOAA-11 and NOAA-14 AVHRR calibration trajectories for channels I and 2; the best available estimates for the water vapour, aerosol and ozone amounts at the time of AVHRR data acquisition; an improved bidirectional reflectance algorithm that also takes into consideration surface topography; and an improved image screening algorithm for contaminated pixels. Unlike the previous study that compared the composite images to a single-date AVHRR image, we employed coincident TM images to approximate the AVHRR pixel field of view during the data acquisition. Compared to ABC3, the modified procedure ABC3V2 was found to improve the accuracy of AVHRR pixel reflectance estimates, both in the sensitivity (slope) of the regression and in r(2). The improvements were especially significant in AVHRR channel 1. In comparison with reference values derived from two full TM scenes, the corrected AVHRR surface reflectance estimates had average standard errors values of +/- 0.009 for AVHRR C1, +/- 0.019 for C2, and +/- 0.04 for NDVI; the corresponding r(2) values were 0.55, 0.80, and 0.50, respectively. The changes in ABC3V2 were not able to completely remove interannual variability for land cover types with little or no vegetation cover, which would be expected to remain stable over time, and they increased the interannual variability of mixed forest and grassland. These results are attributed to a combination of increased sensitivity to interannual dynamics on one hand, and the inability to remove all sources of noise for barren or sparsely vegetated northern land cover types on the other.

In this study, surface height measured independently by SRTM and SLA-02 was cross-validated. SLA data was first verified by field observations, and examinations of individual lidar waveforms. The geolocation accuracy of the SLA height data sets was examined by checking the correlation between the SLA surface height with SRTM height at 90 in resolution, while shifting the SLA ground track within its specified horizontal errors. It was found that the heights from the two instruments were highly correlated along the SLA ground track, and shifting the positions did not improve the correlation significantly. Absolute surface heights from SRTM and SLA referenced to the same horizontal and vertical datum (World Geodetic System (WGS) 84 Ellipsoid) were compared. The effects of forest cover and surface slope on the height difference were also examined. After removing the forest effect on SRTM height, the mean height difference with SLA-02 was near zero. It can be further inferred from the standard deviation of the height differences that the absolute accuracy of SRTM height at low vegetation area is better than the SRTM mission specifications (16 in). The SRTM height bias caused by forest cover needs to be further examined using future spaceborne lidar (e.g. GLAS) data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Both intrinsic radiometry and the effects of Space Imaging processing on radiometry were investigated. Relative radiometry was examined with uniform Antarctic and Saharan sites. Absolute radiometric calibration was performed using reflectance-based vicarious calibration methods on several uniform sites imaged by IKONOS coincident with ground-based surface and atmospheric measurements. Ground-based data and the IKONOS spectral response function served as input to radiative transfer codes to generate a top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance estimate. Calibration coefficients derived from each vicarious calibration were combined to generate an IKONOS radiometric gain coefficient for each multispectral band assuming a linear response over the full dynamic range of the instrument. These calibration coefficients were made available to Space Imaging, which subsequently adopted them by updating its initial set of calibration coefficients. IKONOS imagery procured through the NASA Scientific Data Purchase was processed with or without a Modulation Transfer Function Compensation (MTFC) kernel. The radiometric effects of this kernel on various scene types were also investigated. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

While global vegetation classifications have relied on seasonal changes in multitemporal data, seasonal vegetation dynamics have seldom been explored at higher spatial and spectral resolutions. In particular, investigations of vegetation phenology in the hyperspectral domain have been limited. This paper uses endmember average root mean square error (EAR), a method for selecting endmembers for multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA), to explore temporal changes in the spectral characteristics of the selected endmembers. The images modeled by these endmembers demonstrate temporal changes in the confusion between vegetation species in southern California chaparral.   Endmembers were selected from five Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) images of the area surrounding Santa Barbara, CA, USA. The selected endmembers demonstrated spectral changes that were consistent with an increase in nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV) as soil water balance decreased. Polygon level modeling accuracies for soil water surplus images ranged between 59% and 90%, while accuracies for soil water deficit images ranged between 52% and 81%. Variation in NPV content in the water deficit images resulted in increased confusion between chaparral species. Increasing the number of endmembers used to model each land cover class significantly increased accuracy in the water deficit images. Seasonal variations in the spectral response of chaparral are important for determining the separability of chaparral species. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Methodologically, the project combines remote sensing with CO2 fluxes measured by eddy covariance technique from the top of a 40-m mast located in the center of Copenhagen. These data are supplemented by flux measurements from a mobile system on a 10-m mast which is moved between different urban types, including a major entrance road, and residential and industrial areas. By comparing the time series of vertical CO2 exchange and the number of cars on the major entrance roads, it is demonstrated that the traffic intensity has a major impact on the urban carbon budget. The spatial distribution of the CO2 emission rates is examined through texture-based classification of Landsat-TM satellite images. Local traffic intensity and local heating is seen as a function of specific local urban land use and activities, and the corresponding satellite image texture is used as a proxy for the CO2 emission from these components. The urban scene is divided into urban land use classes that constitute homogenous areas in terms of main types of activity and these are linked to specific levels Of CO2 emission. For this purpose, a multi-scale approach based on co-occurrence matrices has been developed and applied.   The paper outlines how the CO2 exchange from the urban sources and sinks can be estimated from continuous flux measurements in central Copenhagen. It is shown that traffic is the largest single CO2 source in the city. The mobile measurements demonstrate that the emission rates ranges from less than 0.8 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in the residential areas up to a maximum of 16 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1) along the major entrance roads in the city center.   An average annual CO2 exchange rate of 35 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1) is calculated by assigning fluxes to each land use type and excluding the effect of remote sources (power plants, air and sea traffic). This value can be compared to a carbon budget recently calculated from national statistics showing that the local urban sources (road traffic, industry, service and household) have a comparable net emission rate of 38 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1).   The perspective of having more precise knowledge of the distribution of sources and sinks is finally discussed in relation to changing land use patterns. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

A large absorption by leaf water occurs in the shortwave infrared wavelengths (SWIR) and the reflectance from plants thereby is negatively related to leaf water content. Two configurations of a water stress index, SIWSI(6,2) and SIWSI(5,2) are derived on a daily basis from the MODIS satellite data using the information from the near infrared (NIR) channel 2 (841-876 nm) and the shortwave infrared channel 5 (1230-1250 nm) or 6 (1628-1652 nm), respectively, which are wavelength bands at which leaf water content influence the radiometric response. The indices are compared to in situ top layer soil moisture measurements from the semiarid Senegal 2001 and 2002, serving as an indicator of canopy water content. The year 2001 rainfall in the region was slightly below average and the results show a strong correlation between SIWSI and soil moisture. The SIWSI(6,2) performs slightly better than the SIWSI(5,2) (r(2) = 0.87 and 0.79). The fieldwork in 2002 did not verify the results found in 2001. However, year 2002 was an extremely dry year and the vegetation cover apparently was too sparse to provide information on the canopy water content. To test the robustness of the SIWSI findings in 2001, soil moisture has been modelled from daily rainfall data at 10 sites in the central and northern part of Senegal. The correlations between SIWSI and simulated soil moisture are generally high with a median r(2) = 0.72 for both configurations of the SIWSI. It is therefore suggested that the combined information from the MODIS near- and shortwave infrared wavelengths is useful as an indicator of canopy water stress in the semiarid Sahelian environment.

This paper describes the first attempt to map daily soil moisture from space over an extended period of time. Methods to adjust for diurnal changes associated with this temporal variability and how to mosaic these orbits are presented. The algorithm for deriving soil moisture and temperature from TMI observations is based on a physical model of microwave emission from a layered soil-vegetation-atmosphere medium. An iterative, least-squares minimization method, which uses dual polarization observations at 10.65 GHz, is employed in the retrieval algorithm. Soil moisture estimates were compared with ground measurements over the U.S. Southern Great Plains (SGP) in Oklahoma and the Little River Watershed, Georgia. The soil moisture experiment in Oklahoma was conducted in July 1999 and Little River in June 2000. During both the experiments, the region was dry at the onset of the experiment, and experienced moderate rainfall during the course of the experiment. The regions experienced a quick dry-down before the end of the experiment. The estimated soil moisture compared well with the ground observations for these experiments (standard error of 2.5%). The TMI-estimated soil moisture during 6-22 July over Southern U.S. was analyzed and found to be consistent with the observed meteorological conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Conventional approaches to this problem involve the use image spectral information, basic spectral transformations, or occasionally spatial transformations of image brightness. This research introduces fractional textures and semivariance analysis of image fractions. They were integrated with conventional image measures in stepwise multiple regression modelling of forest structure, (canopy and crown closure, stem density, tree height, crown size) and health (a visual stress index). The goal was to conduct a relative comparison of the potential of the various image variable types in modelling of forest structure and health. Analysis was conducted for both canopy (crowns and shadows) and individual tree crown sample data sets extracted from 10 nm bandwidth spectral bands at three resolutions (0.25, 0.5, 1.0. m). Spatial transformations (texture, sernivariogram range) of image brightness (DN) and image fractions (IF) were consistently the most significant and first entered variables in the best models of the forest parameters. At the canopy-scale, despite a limited number of available plots (6), stable models were produced that demonstrated the potential for spatially transformed variables. Semivariogram range explained 88% of the total variation of 9 of the 18 models and represented 56% of the variables used in all models while texture variables explained 51% of model variance in 8 of the 18 models and represented 40% of the variables used. At the tree crown scale (n = 31), 88% of the total variation of six of eight models was explained by texture variables and 6% by sernivariogram variables. DN and IF variables that were not spatially transformed contributed little to the models at both scales. They represented 4% and 6%, respectively, of the variables used in all models. Spatial information in image fractions and image brightness has proven to be more significant than spectral information in these analyses. Of the spatial resolutions evaluated, 0.5 in consistently produced similar or better models than those using the 0.25 or 1.0 m resolutions. These results demonstrate the potential for integration of spatial transforms of image fractions and raw brightness in high-resolution modelling of forest structure and health.

Healthy and stressed plants were measured with two hyperspectral imagers, laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIFS), and laser-induced fluorescence imaging (LIFI) systems in order to determine if the four handheld remote sensing instruments were equally capable of detecting plant stress and measuring canopy chlorophyll levels in bahia grass. Symptoms of bahia grass plants grown at deficient (0 mg l(-1)) or toxic (25, 50, or 100 ing l(-1)) concentrations of Zn were dominated by leaf chlorosis and plant stunting. Leaf fresh weight, leaf dry weight, CO2 assimilation, total chlorophyll, and leaf thickness followed (+) quadratic models in which control plants (0.5 mg l(-1) Zn) exhibited higher responses than plants grown at either deficient or toxic levels of Zn. Normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI=(NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)] and ratio vegetation index [RVI=R-750/R-700, in which R denotes reflectance] values were calculated for calibrated digital images from both hyperspectral imagers. The NDVI and RVI values from both hyperspectral imagers were fit best by (+) quadratic models when treatments were constrained between Wand 100 ing l(-1) Zn, but were fit best by linear regression models with ( -) slopes when treatments were constrained between 0.5 and 100 ing l(-1) Zn. Furthermore, both NDVI and RVI algorithms were effective in predicting the concentrations of chlorophyll in canopies of bahia grass grown at the various levels of Zn. In contrast, red/far-red (R/FR) fluorescence ratios estimated from leaf fluorescence values measured with the LIFS and LIFI instruments were fit best by ( -) quadratic models when treatments were constrained between 0 and 100 mg l(-1) Zn, but were fit best by linear regression models with (+) slopes when treatments were constrained between 0.5 and 100 mg l(-1) Zn. A series of regression analyses were conducted among plant biometric, biochemical, and leaf anatomical parameters (treated as independent variables) and the remote sensing algorithms, NDVI, RVI, blue/green (BL/GR), and R/FR (treated as dependant variables). In general, residuals were significantly higher for NDVI and RVI models compared to the BL/GR and R/FR models indicating that the NDVI and RVI algorithms were able to measure total chlorophyll and plant biomass more accurately than the BL/GR and R/FR algorithms. However, unique capabilities of LIFS and LIFI instruments continue to argue for the development of laser-induced fluorescence remote sensing technologies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Notwithstanding the improvements arising from these missions, there are many lessons to be learnt from current experiences in using MODIS data.

The incoming fluxes were measured near the ground and the outgoing fluxes from a helicopter.

Using the data sets from Iceland and Greenland, and data sets with entirely ground-based albedo measurements from the Morteratschgletscher (Switzerland) and Scharffenbergbotnen (Antarctica), new equations for narrowband-to-broadband (NTB) conversion were developed. They have a residual standard deviation of 0.011 for TM and 0.008 for AVHRR and can be applied without having to classify the surface. The helicopter data are also used to develop criteria for distinguishing different types of surfaces, which are needed for tine application of Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDFs). Snow can be distinguished from ice by defining a threshold for a single narrowband albedo. The ratio of the albedos in TM4 and TM2, and to a lesser extent. the ratio of the albedos in AVHRR2 and AVHRR1, may serve as a proxy for the surface characteristics of glacier ice in terms of concentrations of water, debris, and dust.

Our unique data consisted of daily microwave backscattering coefficients at all combinations of five frequencies (Ka, Ku, X, C, and L), all polarizations (HH, VH, HV, and VV), and four incident angles (25degrees 35degrees, 45degrees, and 55degrees) for the entire rice crop period, from before transplantation until postharvest cultivation. A wide range of plant variables, such as leaf area index (LAI), and biomass of the whole plant and plant parts were measured periodically throughout the season. Analyses based on statistical correlation and a simple backscatter process model (the water cloud model) showed that LAI was best correlated with HH- and cross-polarization of the C-band, while fresh biomass was best correlated with HH- and cross-polarization of the L-band. Contrarily, the higher frequency bands (Ka, Ku, and X) were poorly correlated with LAI and biomass. Interestingly, the weight of heads (ultimately the grain yield) was highly correlated with the backscattering coefficient of the Ka- and Ku-bands, while the others were poorly correlated. The simple scattering process model may be applicable for C- and L-bands in rice canopies, while it may not be suitable for Ka- and Ku-bands. In the model, LAI was a better canopy descriptor for the C-band, while total fresh biomass was a better canopy descriptor for the L-band. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Although remote sensing techniques have been proven useful to assess N and lignin contents in continuous green canopies, more studies are needed to address their capabilities, particularly in low and sparsely vegetated ecosystems. We investigated the possibility of estimating canopy N and lignin concentrations in chaparral vegetation using Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) reflectance acquired over an area around Point Dume in the Santa Monica Mountains (Los Angeles, CA, USA). Two approaches were tested: multiple stepwise regression based on first difference reflectance (FDR) and reflectance (R) indices. Multiple stepwise regressions (of three or fewer wavelengths) accounted for a large variance in canopy biochemical concentration (r(2) similar to 0.9, P<0.01). Log transformed R indices [log (1/R)] formulated on the basis of previously known N and lignin absorption wavelengths also showed significant correlations (P < 0.01) with canopy biochemical concentration (r(2) ranging from 0.39 to 0.48). In addition, the contribution of structural and biochemical signals and background effects on the performance of these indices was evaluated. These indices accounted for a increased variance when adding information on canopy structural attributes (e.g., relative contribution of each species and biomass amount) to foliar biochemical concentration. The relative contributions of foliar biochemical concentration and canopy structure (biomass amount) on the spectral signal were further evaluated by analyzing the residuals from linear regressions: foliar N concentration accounted for 42% of the variance for a normalized difference index based on the 1510-nm N absorption feature, while the foliar lignin concentration accounted for 44% of the variance for a normalized difference index based on the 1754 nm lignin absorption feature. These percentages increased to 58% when stands with senescing vegetation were disregarded. We propose the two indices, Normalized Difference Nitrogen Index (NDNI = [log (1/R-1510) - log (1/R-1680)]/[log (1/R-1510) + log (1/R-1680)]) and Normalized Difference Lignin Index (NDLI = [log (1/R-1754) - log (1/R-1680)]/[log (1/R-1754) + log (1/R-1680)]) as indices to assess N and lignin in native shrub vegetation.

Using this method, we produced a map showing the distribution of annual NPP in East Asia in 1998 and calculated that the mean NPP for that area in that year was 634 g C/m(2)/year. Comparing the estimated NPP obtained from model computation with the observed NPP obtained from an NPP database, we found that the estimated NPP closely approximates the observed NPP, with an average error of - 20%. We checked the accuracy of a six-biome land cover map using a Geographic Information System (GIS) data set for Japan [Data Sets for GIS on the Natural Environment, Japan (DS_GIS_NEJ), Japan Environment Agency, Ver. 2, 1999] and how the accuracy of the map affects NPP estimation. Results show that an accurate land cover map is essential if one is to accurately and reliably estimate NPP, and it is especially crucial if one is to estimate the NPP of an individual biome (e.g., for crop prediction).

Analytical methods based on image-by-image interpretation are too time-consuming and labor-intensive for studies of large areas to be undertaken with any degree of frequency. One potential solution is to develop algorithms or classifiers that can be generalized beyond the arena of the initial training to new images from different spatial, temporal or sensor domains. Building upon earlier success with a generalized classifier to monitor forest change, we now address the question of generalization for classifications of stable landcovers. We evaluate the ability of a supervised neural network, Fuzzy ARTMAP, to identify conifer forest across time and space with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images for a region in northwest Oregon. We also assess the effects of atmospheric corrections on generalized classification accuracies. Using midsummer images atmospherically corrected with a simple dark-object-subtraction (DOS) method, there is no statistically significant loss of accuracy as the classification is extended from the initial training image to other images from the same scene (path and row): temporal generalization is successful. Extending the classifier across space and time to nearby scenes results in a mean decline of 8-13% accuracy depending on the atmospheric correction used. Obvious sources of error, such as seasonality solar angle variation, and complexity of landcover identification, do not explain the decline in error. Additionally, the patterns in generalization accuracies are complex, and the relationship between pairs of training and testing images is not necessarily reciprocal, i.e., good training data are not necessarily good testing data. Simple DOS atmospheric corrections produce classifications with comparable accuracies as classifications from the more complex radiative transfer corrections. These findings are based on over 200 classifications. A high degree of variability in the classification accuracies underscores the importance of extensive, in-depth analysis of remote sensing techniques and applications, and highlights the potential problem for misleading results based on just a few tests. Generalization is well suited for multitemporal classifications of one Landsat scene. Using simple DOS and midsummer images, generalization offers the opportunity for frequent landcover mapping of a Landsat scene without having to retrain the classifier for each time period of interest. However, at this point, the utility of regional landcover mapping with a generalized classifier remains limited. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Derived numerical characteristics of mean transmittance profiles (the rate of attenuation, whole canopy transmittance, and the radiation-effective height) were similar for both methods across the sites. Measures of the variance and skewness of transmittance also showed similar patterns far corresponding heights between methods. The two methods exhibited greater correspondence in the eastern stands than in the western ones; differences in the interaction between canopy organization and the sensor characteristics between the stand types might explain this. The narrower, more isolated crowns of the western stands permit a deeper penetration into the canopy of nadir-directed laser light than of direct solar radiation from typical elevation angles. Transects of light transmittance in two stands demonstrate that the SLICER sensor can capture meaningful functional variation. Additionally, for one stand with numerous overlapping transects we constructed a three-dimensional View of the transmittance field. Using geostatistics, we demonstrated that the spatial covariance measured in the horizontal plane varied as a function of height. These results suggest a means to remotely assess an important functional characteristic of vegetation, providing a capacity for process-based ecological studies at large scales.

Semiempirical kernels are nonlinear geometric functions derived from a simplification of physical models of scattering. These are combined linearly to fit observed bidirectional reflectance measurements. White-sky albedo (bihemispherical reflectance) is the integral of directional reflectance for all viewing and illumination directions and is a true surface property. The variance of retrieved white-sky albedo is a function of the noises of measurement, the specific viewing and illumination geometry of the surface scattering measurements, and the number of observations used in the inversion. By selecting the kernel combination that provides the least variance of white-sky albedo, our studies show that a more stable estimate of white-sky and black-sky (directional-hemispherical) albedo is produced.

Currently MASTER is flown on the Department of Energy (DOE) King Air Beachcraft B200 aircraft and the NASA DC-8. In older to validate the in-flight performance of the instrument, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of Arizona conducted a joint experiment in December 1998. The experiment involved overflights of the MASTER instrument at two sites at three elevations (2000, 4000, and 6000 m). The two sites: Ivanpah Playa, California, and Lake Mead, Nevada, were selected to validate the visible-shortwave infrared and thermal infrared (TIR) channels, respectively. At Ivanpah Playa, a spectrometer was used to determine the surface reflectance and a sun photometer used to obtain the optical depth. At Lake Mead contact and radiometric surface lake temperatures were measured by buoy-mounted thermistors and self-calibrating radiometers, respectively. Atmospheric profiles of temperature, pressure, and relative humidity were obtained by launching an atmospheric sounding balloon. The measured surface radiances were then propagated to the at-sensor radiance using radiative transfer models driven by the local atmospheric data. There was excellent agreement between the predicted radiance at sensor and the measured radiance at sensor at all three altitudes. The percent difference between the channels not strongly affected by the atmosphere in the visible-shortwave infrared was typically 1-5% and the percent difference between the TIR channels not strongly affected by the atmosphere was typically less than 0.5%. These results indicate the MASTER instrument should provide a well-calibrated instrument for Earth Science Studies. It should prove particularly valuable for those studies that leverage information across the electromagnetic spectrum from the visible to the TIR. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

The goal of this research was tp compare multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing approaches for detecting human disturbances of arid environments. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was tested using both narrow and broad band-widths. Broadband NDVI provided results (r(2) = 0.63) similar to NDVI derived from individual hyperspectral channels (r(2) = 0.60). While the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was designed as an improvement to NDVI for sparse vegetation, in this study SAVI performed significantly worse than NDVI (r(2) = 0.51). The modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) provided an insignificant improvement overt NDVI (r(2) = 0.64). Linear mixture modeling provided significantly better results, r(2) of 0.74. Cross-validation was used to test the significance of differences between the various methods and to determine the standard error associated with each method. Results suggest that any improvements provided by adjusted vegetation indices over NDVI may be strongly dependent on those adjustments being derived from local conditions. The use of a linear mixture model with multiple soil endmembers appears to provide the best method for quantifying sparse vegetative cover. Though present in small amounts, a single plant species, Krameria erecta, was strongly correlated with residuals of the mixture model. Inclusion of a spectral endmember for this species increased the r(2) of the fit with percent green cover to 0.86. However, it is not clear if the explained variation was actually due to K. erecta or a correlated phenomena. Problems were also identified with the use of multiple vegetation endmembers.

The sensitivity of snow spectral reflectance to grain size translates these grain size gradients into spectral nature of snow must be accounted for by use of multiple snow endmembers of varying grain size. We performed numerical simulations to demonstrate the sensitivity of mixture analysis to grain size for a range of sizes and snow fractions. From Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data collected over Mammoth Mountain CA on 5 April 1994, a suite of snow image endmembers spanning the imaged region\'s grain size range were extracted. Mixture models with fixed vegetation, rock, and shade were applied with each snow endmember. For each pixel, the snow fraction estimated by the model with least mixing error (RMS) was chosen to produce an optimal map of subpixel snow-covered area.

The measurements were carried out on the tongue of the Morteratschgletscher, Switzerland. On the basis of directional measurement several bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) were derived for dirty and clean glacier ice and for solar zenith angles between 46 degrees and 60 degrees. The anisotropic reflectance factor ranges between 0.70 and 1.60 for TM 2 and between 0.56 and 1.72 for TM 4. The BRDFs exhibit nadir darkening and maximum brightening near the forward limb. Dirty and wet ice reflect more anisotropically than clean ice. We give an example to illustrate the effect of anisotropic reflectance on the TM-derived albedo along a cross-section of the glacier. For solar zenith angles around 48 degrees and in the nadir viewing direction we found differences of 0.05 (in TM 2) and 0.08 (in TM 4) between the albedo (a) and birectional reflectance (r). the differences prove to be more or less uniform for both clean ice and dirty ice. It is therefore suggested that once can convert r to a without having to classify the glacier surface.

Numerical inversion of these models has provided estimates of vegetation structural and biophysical characteristics from multiangle, remotely sensed optical data. The number of angularly unique observations compared to BRDF model parameters largely determines the accuracy of retrievals. To increase this ratio, additional observations of a target must be acquired and the BRDF models and inversions must be simplified. The former will occur when the EOS instruments become available. Previous studies suggest that simplification of BRDF model inversions may best be accomplished by constraining the leaf optical parameters. This study focused on full-range (400-2500 nm) leaf and litter spectral properties convolved to ASHRR, MODIS, and MISR optical channels. Using a diverse array of woody plant and grass species, we found robust and readily usable interrelationships among spectra through correlation, regression and principal components analyses. Significant differences between green leaf and litter optical properties and their sensor specific interrelationships indicate that green leaf optical constraints may be useful with BRDF retrievals to detect the onset of canopy senescence. These findings will provide increased efficiency in canopy BRDF model inversions by decreasing the number of observations required to retrieve canopy structural and biophysical information from multiangle remotely sensed data.

Although a few of the sites of lacustrine sediments were previously examined in the field, their extent now visible on the images yields a new perspective on the Early- to Mid-Holocene wet phase that affected northern Africa. Freshwater wetlands across an area exceeding 15,000 km(2) existed between 8800 and 4500 B.P. owing to a significant increase in rainfall. The phenomenon called the West Nubian Lake constitutes the largest-scale hydrographic evidence in the eastern Sahara for a northward shift of the tropical min belt. Given that the region now receives less than 15 mm of precipitation per year on average, the former open water body and its vegetated catchment may have acted as a modifier of the regional climate. In connection with the detection of a buried major palaeodrainage system near Kufra (SE Libya), the West Nubian Lake confirms the new multifrequency and multipolarization radar imaging as a powerful tool for the reconstruction of arid land palaeohydrology.

A sequence of operations was carried out to remove radiometric distortions from AVHRR composites (1 km pixel sire) prepared for the landmass of Canada using multidate NOAA-11 data for the 1993 growing season: atmospheric corrections for AVHRR Channels 1, 2, and 4; identification and replacement of cloud-contaminated pixels; bidirectional reflectance corrections of Channels 1 and 2; and principal component (PC) calculations to retain significant Independent PC channels. Input principal components were classified using an unsupervised clustering algorithm, and accuracies were assessed through a comparison to 30 m Landsat TM pixels at five different sites in three biomes. We found that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was the most effective single spectral dimension to derive land cover types, but other channels (especially 1 and 2) were needed to obtain highest accuracies. Overall, classification accuracies for the 30 m pixels were between 45% and 60%. Mixes of land cover classes within AVHRR pixels were the principal reason for the low accuracies. When considering only AVHRR pixels with one dominant band cover type, the accuracy increased up to 80% or more in proportion to the mixed types retained. The accuracy also increased when a dispersed class (mixed forest) was combined with the more ubiquitous coniferous forest class. The intrinsic AVHRR resolution and the compositing process are the major factors influencing the impact of mixed cover types on the classification accuracy.

We distinguish between direct correction, in which the aerosol loading is derived from the image itself (or supplied from external sources) followed by correction of the image using an appropriate radiative transfer model, and indirect correction, achieved by defining remote sensing functions that are less dependent on the aerosol loading. To some degree this was already achieved in global remote sensing of vegetation where a composite of several days of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measurements, choosing the maximal value, was used instead of a single cloud-screened value. The atmospheric resistant vegetation index (ARVI) introduced recently for the Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is the most appropriate example of indirect correction, where the index is defined in such a way that the atmospheric effect in a blue spectral channel cancels to a large degree the atmospheric effect in the red channel in computations of the vegetation index. Atmospheric corrections can also use aerosol climatology or simultaneous measurements with ground-based instrumentation. These aspects of aerosol studies and remote sensing are reviewed in this article. New advances in ground-based instrumentation and future satellite systems (including measurements of polarization) are discussed. In the conclusions a strategy is introduced for a combination of ground-based measurements, with direct and indirect corrections that is implemented for the EOS-MODIS and recommended for other similar platforms. Such strategy, planned in advance, is a first step to face the challenge and take advantage of the opportunities that the remote sensing community will face with the launch of EOS and ADEOS in the next several years.', 'CNRS,OPT ATMOSPHER LAB,VILLENEUVE DASCQ,FRANCE.

This study examines the use of metrics derived from the NDVI temporal profile, as well as metrics derived from observations in red, infrared, and thermal bands, to improve discrimination between 12 cover types on a global scale. According to separability measures calculated front Bhattacharya distances, average separabilities improved by using 12 of the 16 metrics tested (1.97) compared to separabilities using 12 monthly NDVI values alone (1.88). Separabilities improved from poor to good in 20 out of 25 pairs of cover types with poor separability. Percentage of pixels correctly classified in a maximum likelihood classifications also improved by using the metrics from 76% to 86%. Overall, the most robust metrics for discriminating between cover types were: mean NDVI, maximum NDVI, NDVI amplitude, AVHRR Band 2 (near-infrared reflectance) and Band 1 (red reflectance) corresponding to the time of maximum NDVI, and maximum land surface temperature. Deciduous and evergreen vegetation can be distinguished by mean NDVI, maximum NDVI, NDVI amplitude, and maximum land surface temperature. Needleleaf and broadleaf vegetation can be distinguished by either mean NDVI and NDVI amplitude or maximum NDVI and NDVI amplitude.RP DeFries, R (通讯作者)，UNIV MARYLAND,DEPT GEOG,LAB GLOBAL REMOTE SENSING STUDIES,1113 LEFRAK HALL,COLLEGE PK,MD 20742, USA.RI Townshend, John RG/G-2607-2011', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 30, 268, 283, 3, 72, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

From the degraded image data, a set of weights representing the proportions of cover types within the mixed pixels of a coarse spatial/fine temporal resolution image [e.g., NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)] is produced. These weights and the AVHRR spectral band reflectances are used in multiple linear regression analyses to extract mean cover type reflectances. A simulation study was conducted to define the operational limitations of this technique. Cover type reflectances are accurately estimated if the cover types are spatially well represented within the area of interest, are spectrally distinct, and have small within-class spectral variability. The accuracy of retrieved reflectances is most sensitive to errors in the coarse spatial resolution data and least sensitive to errors in the weights, By applying this technique to multiple images, temporal profiles of subpixel cover type reflectance may be obtained.

The reference crop evaporation has been calculated using the Priestley-Taylor equation. The observed variations of crop (wheat) height, leaf area index, and weather conditions for 30 days at Phoenix (Arizona), together with the reflectances of different types of soil in wet and dry states, are used in the simulation. The total evaporation calculated from the model compared well with lysimeter observations. Variations in soil evaporation can introduce considerable scatter in the relation between the crop coefficient and leaf area index, while this scatter is much less for the relation between transpiration coefficient and leaf area index. The simulation results for 30 days of crop and weather data and reflectances of 19 soil types in wet and dry conditions gave significant linear correlations between the transpiration coefficient and the vegetation indices, the explained variance (r2) being highest for the soil adjusted vegetation index (r2 = 0.88) and lowest for the normalized difference (r2 = 0.81). A clump vegetation model is used to address the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the relationship between the transpiration coefficient and soil adjusted vegetation index.

The canopy is approximated by an array of porous cylinders located at the vertices of equilateral triangles. The model is split into two submodels, each describing a different level of structure: 1) The macrostructure submodel is based on Brown and Pandolfo (1969), who applied geometrical optics theory to an array of opaque cylinders. This model is adapted for porous cylinders and is used to derive expressions for directional interception efficiency as a function of height, radius, spacing and porosity of the cylinders. 2) The microstructure submodel makes use of the average canopy transmittance theory, applied to a cylinder, to compute the porosity of the clumps as a function of the leaf area density, the leaf inclination distribution function, the dimensions of the cylinder (height and radius), and the transmittance of green leaves in the appropriate spectral band. It is shown that, in the case of erectophile plant stands, the daily porosity of the cylinder can be approximated by the porosity calculated using the extinction coefficient of diffuse radiation. Directional interception efficiency, geometric conditions (incidence/viewing), and landscape component reflectances are used to compute hemispherical (interception, absorption, and reflectance) and directional (reflectance) radiative fluxes from simple analytical formulae. This model is validated against a data set of biological, radiative (PAR region) and radiometric (SPOT channels) measurements, collected in Niger on pearl millet (Pennisetum typhoides). The model fits the data quite well in terms of hourly and daily single-band or combined (NDVI) radiative fluxes. Close correspondence to measured fluxes, using few parameters, and the possibility of inversion makes the present model a valuable tool for the study of radiative transfer in discontinuous canopies.', 'INST RECH AGRON TROP,PROGRAMME CLIMAT PLANTE PROD,F-34032 MONTPELLIER,FRANCE.RI begue, agnes/A-5718-2011', NULL, NULL, 'begue, agnes/0000-0002-9289-1052', NULL, NULL, 21, 24, 24, 0, 4, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

In particular, the following quantities are considered: 1) the ratio of near IR (700-1100 nm) to visible (600-690 nm) reflected intensities in the nadir direction, 2) the ratio of the fraction of incident energy reflected in the near IR to that in the visible (ratio of canopy hemispheric reflectances), 3) the normalized difference between the near IR and visible nadir reflected intensities, 4) the visible intensity transmitted in a given downward direction, and 5) the visible energy incident on the soil surface. A realistic radiative transfer model is proposed for calculating these radiometric quantities. Also simple approximate models are derived for the radiation transmitted through the canopy. With these models, the sensitivity of the reflected and transmitted quantities to various canopy and illumination conditions are then determined. Specifically, the effects of 1) sun angle, 2) the ratio of the diffuse-to-direct incident radiation, 3) the leaf-normal distribution for the canopy, 4) the scattering properties of the leaves, and 5) the soil albedo are considered. The sensitivity of the calculated quantities are presented as a function of the leaf area index of the canopy, and, for the reflected quantities, also as a function of the fraction of visible light absorbed in the canopy.RP SHULTIS, JK (通讯作者)，KANSAS STATE UNIV AGR & APPL SCI,DEPT NUCL ENGN,WARD HALL,MANHATTAN,KS 66506, USA.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 32, 5, 5, 0, 1, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

The anisotropic reflectance of snow in conifer forests is greatly influenced by the high reflectance of snow and the complex travel pathways of radiation in 3D canopy structures, which complicates BRDF simulations. Although bidirectional reflection models have been widely established for snow-free forests, few studies have attempted to simulate the BRDF in snow-covered forests. Therefore, we propose a new snow-covered forest bidirectional reflectance (SFBR) model by coupling geometric optical and radiative transfer models, which includes a snow anisotropic reflectance model (ART), needle leaf optical properties model (LIBERTY), canopy radiative transfer model (4SAIL), and geometric optical model (GOST2). The SFBR model mainly focuses on conifer forests with snow backgrounds; it can simulate anisotropic reflectance spectra from 400 nm to 2500 nm and is the only model to fully consider discontinuous canopy distribution, topographic effects, and snow anisotropy. The SFBR model was validated by simulating the reflectance over snow-covered forests, the results of which showed good consistency with simulations of 3D scene model and remote sensing observations. The proposed SFBR model has the potential to quantify radiation interactions between the snow background and forest overstory, evaluate the sensitivity of canopy reflectance to snow and forest properties, and retrieve snow-covered forest parameters from satellite-observed reflectance data.', '[Chen, Siyong; Xiao, Pengfeng; Zhang, Xueliang; Ma, Wei; Liu, Hao] Nanjing Univ, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Geog Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Land Satellite Remote Sensing Applicat, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci,Minist Nat Resources, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

The arid climate, sparse vegetation and low topographic relief result in very high interferometric coherence magnitude between most pairs of dates, even for those separated by multiple years. For pairs of dates with differing soil moisture conditions, such as a \"dry\" date and a date immediately following one of the precipitation events, the interferometric coherence magnitude is much lower. However, pairs spanning the same event, but with a longer time interval, have high interferometric coherence magnitude. This observation suggests that the phase changes that result in lower coherence for some pairs are not permanent, such as those that would result from erosion or deposition of material, but are due to the variations in soil moisture. In support of this view, when we compare the phase of individual pixels to their neighbors, we observe similar phase change trends for each precipitation event. We present a simple statistical model of the relationship between soil moisture and phase, and show that it predicts the observed coherence and phase histories within this particular SAR time series. We also show how the parameters of this relationship can be inferred from the InSAR observables, and can be used to reduce the soil moisture effects on coherence and phase even for pairs of dates that were not used in that parameter estimation. For the test data considered here, the noise associated with soil moisture is reduced by 40%.

To address these issues, this study used mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) as an index to indicate human exposure to extreme heat, and generated hourly heat exposure maps at a 1-m spatial resolution in Summer 2020 for heat wave and non-heat wave days across three diversely urbanized and climatically different U.S. cities (Riverside, CA; Des Moines, IA; and Boston, MA) using the SOlar LongWave Environmental Irradiance Geometry (SOLWEIG) model and multi-source remote sensing and GIS data. Based on these high-frequency and microscale maps, we found that heat exposure in urban canyons of downtown areas was high due to relatively low building\'s height to street\'s width (H/W) ratio, which resulted in a limited shading effect in the studied cities. Heat exposure during heat waves was enhanced by 6 degrees C to 10 degrees C compared to non-heat wave conditions, with the main differences occurring in the early afternoon between 12 pm and 2 pm. We found that hot cities (Riverside, 63 degrees C) had higher heat exposure than warm cities (Des Moines and Boston, 53 degrees C and 51 degrees C) during heat waves. Heat exposure in urban core areas was approximately 5C higher than that in rural areas during heat waves. Additionally, we found that sky view factor was the most important urban morphology factor influencing heat exposure, with a relative importance of over 67% in these cities, but the role of impervious surface and trees varied among these cities. Impervious surface area (ISA) contributed more to heat exposure than trees in dry and hot regions (Riverside), but not in humid and warm cities (Des Moines and Boston). This study is the first to generate hourly heat exposure maps at a 1-m resolution for heat wave and non-heat wave days, and to investigate spatiotemporal patterns and the impacts of urbanization intensity and urban morphology on heat exposure in multiple cities.

However, the specific components of the SMB such as snowfall (SF), rainfall (RF) and runoff (RU), and their corresponding temporal and spatial variability remain poorly understood. Here, we explore the respective contributions of SF, RF, and RU to the seasonal and transient crustal deformations of Greenland during the past two decades using GPS network and satellite gravimetry (GRACE) datasets, and regional climate model output. Our study unraveled that the largest annual vertical displacement caused by precipitations is in southeastern Greenland, reaching 7.27 mm. The largest surface displacement caused by RU is in western Greenland, reaching 19.82 mm. Ice mass gain/loss in Greenland shows a clear correlation between latitude and temperature, with greater variations in the south compared to the north. The transient deformation signals in Greenland mainly manifested in terms of abrupt subsidence in 2010, followed by uplift in 2014. The 2014 uplift can mainly be attributable to the combined effect of SF, RF, and RU. The largest transient signal occurs in the southeast subregions, with peak-to-peak amplitude exceeding 10 mm. Transient crustal deformation is mainly caused by precipitation in southeastern Greenland, while the contribution of RU dominates most of the time and in most subregions. We find that even though RF is increasing due to an increasingly warmer climate, its effect on SMB is still negligible, when compared with SF and RU. In some subregions and some periods, SF could become the primary contributor to transient SMB variations in Greenland.', '[Li, Wenhao; Shu, Chanfang] Nanjing Tech Univ, Sch Geomat Sci & Technol, Nanjing 211816, Peoples R China.

But in China, they have been suffering from severe invasion by Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora). Accurate information on spatial distribution of mangroves and S. alterniflora is a prerequisite to protecting indigenous mangrove ecosystems and managing S. alterniflora invasion. However, the classification performance is often constrained by two major issues: (1) A single-date image, regardless of acquisition time, hardly provides optimal spectral separability among evergreen mangroves, deciduous S. alterniflora and mudflats; (2) Due to the gradual invasion process, the mixtures between land cover classes are prevalent in moderate-resolution images. The use of high-resolution (finer than 2 m) image time series could effectively solve these two issues. However, due to frequent cloud cover in coastal areas and long revisit time of high-resolution satellite sensors, the collection of high-resolution image time series is still a great challenge, let alone substantial expenses. In this study, we proposed a new multi-temporal classification approach to fine-scale mapping of exotic S. alterniflora and native mangroves using synthetic high-resolution image time series derived from spatiotemporal fusion of WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2 data. A total of six synthetic WorldView-2-like images in different phenological periods were produced by the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) method. With the combination of the original and synthetic images, both types of image-based multi-temporal features and pixel-based image compositing features were extracted and evaluated in the following Random Forest classifications. Monte Carlo cross-validation was adopted to provide robust accuracy estimates, and a spatially explicit confidence map was generated to show classification uncertainty and potential errors. In order to further demonstrate the necessity of generating synthetic WorldView-2 images, the entire classification process was repeated using Sentinel-2 images at 10-m spatial resolution and the comparison between fine-and moderate resolution classification results was made in terms of classification accuracies, classification maps and fractional abundances. Our results show that the spectral profiles of S. alterniflora and mangroves generated from the synthetic WorldView-2 images were consistent with the ones from the paired Sentinel-2 images. Meanwhile, the spatial details of high landscape heterogeneity, unrecognizable in the Sentinel-2 images, were revealed by the synthetic WorldView-2 images. Compared to the single-date classification with the original WorldView-2 image, most of multi-temporal classifications using both the original and synthetic images provided more accurate results, with the overall accuracy raised by up to 3.9%. Among various temporal features adopted in this study, the use of the image-based, stacked spectral reflectance and vegetation index features of all original and synthetic images produced the best classification performance, increasing the producer\'s and user\'s accuracies of mangroves, S. alterniflora and mudflats by 2.5%-7.1%. Finally, the Sentinel-2 classification accuracies were generally lower than the WorldView-2 counterparts across all temporal features, with a 6% difference in the highest overall accuracy between the two. Prediction errors of the moderate-resolution classification were often found in heterogeneous landscapes, where S.   alterniflora was mixed with mangroves or mudflats. Considering the availability of moderate-resolution data with high revisit frequencies, such as Sentinel-2A/B and Landsat 8/9, future fine scale mapping exercises might benefit from the multi-temporal classification approach with spatiotemporal fusion of moderate-and high-resolution data, alleviating the problem of the scarcity of high-resolution data in cloudy areas.', '[Chen, Wenjing; Shi, Chen] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Resource Environm & Tourism, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.', 'Capital Normal UniversityRP Shi, C (通讯作者)，Capital Normal Univ, Coll Resource Environm & Tourism, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.', 'shichen0516@outlook.com', NULL, 'National Natural Science Foundation of China [41601363]', 'This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China   (41601363) .', 79, 0, 0, 10, 10, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

We analyzed the feasibility of the PRISMA mission -one of the first spaceborne spectrometers operationally active- to assess fire severity by leveraging hyperspectral data dimensionality through the retrieval of sub-pixel components directly related to fire severity in the field. Multispectral data provided by Sentinel-2, commonly used in fire severity quantitative assessments, were used as a benchmark method. Multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) was used to retrieve fractional cover of char, photosynthetic vegetation (PV), as well as non-photosynthetic vegetation and soil (NPVS) from post-fire PRISMA Level 2D and Sentinel-2 Level 2A scenes in one of the largest wildfires ever recorded in the western Mediterranean Basin. Ground-truth data were obtained using the Composite Burn Index (CBI) to procure three field-measured severity metrics: vegetation, soil and site. The relationship between the CBI data on a continuum scale and the cover of char, PV and NPVS image fractions retrieved from PRISMA and Sentinel-2 was assessed through Random Forest regression (RFR). Likewise, Ordinal Forests (OF) algorithm was used to classify categorized CBI data (low, moderate and high fire severity). PRISMA-based RFR fire severity estimates at vegetation, soil and site levels (R2 = 0.64-0.79 and RMSE = 0.33-0.41) outperformed those of Sentinel-2 (R2 = 0.27-0.53 and RMSE = 0.54-0.60), and were in line with previous studies using airborne hyperspectral sensors at higher spatial resolution. Fire severity underestimation for high field CBI values was almost unnoticeable in the PRISMA estimates. Categorical fire severity, not currently estimated using hyperspectral data but with high interest in post-fire management, were accurately predicted by PRISMA-based OF classification, with consistent user\'s and producer\'s accuracy for each fire severity category. The high confusion between moderate and low/high fire severity categories, typical when unmixing broadband multispectral data, was overcome by the PRISMA-based classification scheme. Our results suggest that new spaceborne spectrometer missions can support reliable fire severity assessments equivalent to airborne spectrometers, but readily applicable to large-scale assessments of extreme wildfire events.', '[Quintano, Carmen] Univ Valladolid, Sch Ind Engn, Elect Technol Dept, Valladolid 47011, Spain.

Numerous studies suggest imaging spectroscopy can characterize foliar biochemical and morphological traits at the canopy scale, but there is only limited evidence for retrieving canopy photosynthetic capacity (e.g., maximum carboxylation rate, Vc,max and maximum electron transport rate, Jmax). Moreover, the effect of canopy structure within forest communities on scaling up spectra-trait relationships from leaf to canopy level is not well known. To advance the spectra-trait approach and enable the estimation of key traits using remote sensing, we collected imaging spectroscopy data from an Unoccupied Aerial System (UAS) platform over two forest sites in China (a subtropical forest in Mt. Dinghu and a tropical rainforest in Xishuangbanna). At these sites, we also collected ground measurements of leaf spectra and traits, including biochemical (leaf nitrogen, phosphorus, chlorophyll, and water content), morphological (leaf mass per area, LMA) and physiological (Vc,max25 and Jmax25) traits (n = 135 tree-crowns from 42 species across two sites). Using a partial least-squares regression (PLSR) approach, we built and tested spectra-trait models with repeated cross-validation. The spectral models developed with leaf spectra were directly transferred to canopy spectra to evaluate the effect of canopy structure. We further applied canopy spectral models to map these traits at indi-vidual tree-crown scale. The results demonstrate that (1) UAS-based canopy spectra can be used to estimate Vc, max (R2 = 0.55, nRMSE = 11.79%), Jmax (R2 = 0.54, nRMSE = 12.34%), and five additional foliar traits (R2 = 0.38-0.60, nRMSE = 10.11-13.56%) at the tree-crown scale with demonstrated generalizability across two sites; (2) canopy structure strongly affects the spectra-trait relationships from leaf to canopy level, but the effects vary considerably across foliar traits and cannot be well captured by the 4SAIL canopy radiative transfer model. UAS-based imaging spectroscopy maps large variability in all foliar traits (including physiological traits) with spatially explicit information, reproducing the field-observed inter-and intra-specific variations. These results demonstrate the capability of using UAS-based imaging spectroscopy for characterizing the variability of foliar physiological traits at individual tree-crown scale over forest landscapes and highlight the similar generaliz-ability but different biophysical mechanisms underlying spectra-trait relationships at leaf and canopy levels.', '[Liu, Shuwen; Yan, Zhengbing; Guo, Zhengfei; Song, Guangqin; Wu, Qianhan; Zhang, He; Cheng, K.

However, current geolocation accuracy may limit further science applications of footprint-level products as early adopters have found it difficult to align with in-situ forestry inventory data and high-resolution imagery for calibration and validation purpose. Here we developed a new means to rapidly evaluate and mitigate the impact of systematic geolocation error on the performance of GEDI\'s forest height estimates in the US. By integrating nationwide high-resolution airborne lidar data collected through the 3D Elevation Program of the USGS, we provided optimal geolocation adjustments of GEDI at per beam level and tracked their performances over the first 18-mo. Our results suggest that the first release of GEDI product (R01) can have large systematic geolocation errors at beam level (i.e., 50.5% of beams with an error > 20 m). Its impact on canopy height measurement could drastically vary in space and time, which in turn also offers a separate indirect method to evaluate and track geolocation performance. The second release of GEDI data (R02) has achieved a much-improved systematic geolocation accuracy which is shown to meet the mission requirement (0.2% beams >20 m and 80.8% beams <10 m) and should be able to meet requirements from many practical science applications tolerant to moderate geolocation errors. In sum, our approach has provided a shortterm solution for an enhanced Cal/Val strategy for GEDI. While further improvements will certainly be made in future releases, it can potentially create an alternative pathway to generate and validate biomass products by linking GEDI footprint samples directly with in-situ data collections.', '[Tang, Hao] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Singapore 117570, Singapore.

The illuminated scene is the temperate forest at the Eifel National Park, North-West Germany. Dominant species are beech and spruce trees. Forest height ranges roughly from 10 to 30 m, with peaks up to over 40 m. Forest Above Ground Biomass (AGB) ranges from 20 to 300 Mg/ha, with peaks up to over 400 Mg/ha. SAR data include P-, L-, and C-band surveys acquired by flying up to 30 trajectories in two headings to provide tomographic imaging capabilities. L-and C-band data were acquired by simultaneously flying two aircraft to gather bistatic data along different trajectories.The SAR dataset is complemented by 3D structural canopy measurements made via terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle lidar (UAV-L) and airborne laser scanning (ALS), and in-situ forest census. This unique combination of SAR tomographic and multi-scale lidar data allows for direct comparison of canopy structural metrics across wavelength and scale, including vertical profiles of canopy wood and foliage density, and per-tree and plot-level above ground biomass (AGB). The resulting TomoSense data-set is free and openly available at ESA for any research purpose. The data-set includes ALS-derived maps of forest height and AGB, forest parameters at the level of single trees, TLS raw data, and plot-average TLS vertical profiles. The provided SAR data are coregistered, phase calibrated, and ground steered, to enable a direct implementation of any kind of interferometric or tomographic processing without having to deal with the subtleties of airborne SAR processing. Moreover, the data-base comprises SAR tomographic cubes representing forest scattering in 3D both in Radar and geographical coordinates, intended for use by non-Radar experts. For its unique features and completeness, the TomoSense data-set is intended to serve as an important basis for future research on microwave scattering from forested areas in the context of future Earth Observation missions.', '[Tebaldini, Stefano; d\'Alessandro, Mauro Mariotti] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Elettron Informaz & Bioingn, Milan, Italy.

Nevertheless, natural clouds exhibit complex vertical inhomogeneity, such as overlapping clouds. This study investigates the potential of multispectral observations for characterizing overlapping cloud prop-erties and introduces a new CTH retrieval algorithm for overlapping CTHs. Synthetic radiative transfer simu-lations and an information content analysis are applied to demonstrate the theoretical basis of using passive radiometers for overlapping cloud property retrievals. Specifically, this method leverages the merits of four shortwave infrared (0.87, 1.6, 2.13 and 2.25 mu m) channels in distinguishing cloud optical and microphysical properties in different phases and the capabilities of longwave infrared (8.6, 11 and 12 mu m) channels for the corresponding CTHs. The method performs effectively for overlapping clouds with an optically thin but detectable ice layer (optical thickness less than similar to 7) above a liquid water layer. We consider collocated Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI)/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements to provide sufficient spectral information. Compared with conven-tional single-layer-assumed CTH retrievals, our CTHs for both upper-layer ice and lower-layer water clouds show closer agreement with those indicated by active instruments. Statistically, the average bias of the upper ice CTH results is constrained from-2.89 km to-1.36 km and we obtain lower water CTHs with an average bias of-1.21 km. The cloud properties based on our retrievals also make the simulated multichannel radiances more consistent with the observed ones. The new method will greatly improve our understanding of the vertical structures of overlapping clouds and their parameterization in general circulation models; thus, we suggest that including increased numbers of cloud-sensitive channels is necessary to better determine cloud properties.', '[Teng, Shiwen] Ocean Univ China, Frontier Sci Ctr Deep Ocean Multispheres & Earth S, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China.

The concentration of particulate organic carbon (POC) in the surface ocean waters is one of the biogeochemically important data products derivable from satellite ocean color observations. The data record of standard global POC product is available from NASA and has been obtained from the empirical power-function relationship between POC and a single blue-to-green band ratio of ocean remote-sensing reflectance, Rrs(lambda), which is here referred to as the BR-PF algorithm. Recently, we formulated a new suite of satellite ocean-color sensor-specific global POC algorithms that are referred to as hybrid algorithms because they contain two components, one based on the maximum band-ratio (MBR) and the other on the band ratio difference index (BRDI) of reflectance (Stramski et al., 2022). The present study describes the validation analysis and provides performance assessment of hybrid algorithms for SeaWiFS, MODIS, and VIIRS-SNPP satellite ocean color sensors. For comparison, the standard global (BR-PF) algorithms and the color-index (CI) algorithm from the literature were also analyzed. The analyses were made with an in situ validation dataset containing concurrent measurements of POC and Rrs(lambda) as well as three satellite validation datasets containing data matchups of field measurements of POC and satellite-derived Rrs(lambda) from the SeaWIFS, MODIS-Aqua, and VIIRS-SNPP missions. The hybrid algorithms showed an overall improvement of performance compared to other algorithms, in particular in waters with relatively high POC compared to the standard BR-PF algorithms. The aggregate bias of hybrid algorithm-derived POC is small or negligible (<10%) for the validation datasets, and a measure of median percentage difference is about 20% for the in situ validation dataset and ranges between about 20% and 30% for the satellite validation datasets. In addition, comparisons of POC retrievals from the three sensor-specific hybrid algorithms show good inter-sensor consistency.

This article proposes a simple leaf radiative transfer model called ISPECT. It explains the difference in optical properties observed on the adaxial (upper) and abaxial (lower) sides of leaves, i.e., their dorsiventrality, with a limited number of structural parameters. The performance of ISPECT in estimating LMA is compared to that of five other leaf radiative transfer models (FASPECT, DLM, PROSPECT-D, PROSPECT-5B, and Leaf-SIP). We tested six experimental datasets with 962 leaf samples and two spectral ranges: the solar domain (0.4-2.5 mu m) and the shortwave infrared (1.7-2.4 mu m). Results show that PROSPECT-D and PROSPECT-5B accurately estimate LMA using the shortwave infrared spectra, while ISPECT and FASPECT perform well in both spectral ranges. Further analysis demonstrates that leaf dorsiventrality is likely to be an influential factor for LMA estimation: thus ISPECT can accurately estimate LMA in the solar and shortwave infrared domains, with NRMSE of 26.0% and 28.8%, respectively. This motivates further studies on LMA mapping from spaceborne imaging spectrometers (e.g., PRISMA, GaoFen-5, EnMAP) by coupling ISPECT with canopy radiative transfer models.', '[Shi, Hanyu; Ma, Mingguo] Southwest Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Chongqing Jinfo Mt Karst Ecosyst Natl Observat & R, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.

Monitoring forest degradation as compared to deforestation presents technical challenges because degradation involves widespread, low-intensity AGB removal under varying temporal dynamics. Charcoal production is a key driver for forest degradation in Africa and is projected to increase in the future years. In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where charcoal production drives widespread ABG removal, the utility of optical remote sensing for degradation quantification is challenged by the large inter-seasonal variation and high complexities in ecosystem structure. Limited field measurements on tree structure and aboveground biomass density (AGBD) in many parts of the SSA also impose constraints. In this study, we present a novel data fusion approach combining 3D forest structure from NASA\'s GEDI Lidar with optical time-series data from Landsat to quantify biomass losses associated with charcoal-related forest degradation over a 10-year time period. We used machine learning models with Landsat spectral indices from the time period of limited hydric stress (LHS) as predictor variables. By applying the best performing Random Forest (RF) model to LandTrendrstabilized annual LHS Landsat composites, we produced annual forest AGBD maps from 2007 to 2019 over the Mabalane district in southern Mozambique where the dry forest ecosystem was under active charcoal-related degradation since 2008. The RF model achieved an RMSE value of 7.05 Mg/ha (RMSE% = 42%) and R2 value of 0.64 using a 10-fold cross-validation dataset. We quantified a total AGB loss of 2.12 & PLUSMN; 0.06 Megatons (Mt) over the 10-year period, which is only 6.35 & PLUSMN; 2.56% less than the total loss estimated using field-based data as previously published for the same area and time. In addition to quantifying biomass loss, we constructed annual AGBD maps that enabled the characterization of disturbance and recovery. Our framework demonstrates that fusing GEDI and Landsat data through predictive modeling can be used to quantify past forest AGBD dynamics in low biomass forests. This approach provides a satellite-based method to support REDD+ monitoring and evaluation activities in areas where field data is limited and has the potential to be extended to investigate a variety of different disturbance events.', '[Liang, Mengyu; Duncanson, Laura; Silva, Julie A.] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.

Owing to the difficulties associated with collecting structural data from traditional field measurements, numerous studies have investigated the utility of Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) for providing landscape-scale structural information that may be useful for exploring animal-habitat associations. Notably, almost all of these studies have involved the use of LiDAR from airborne rather than terrestrial platforms. However, vegetation metrics that might be important for explaining bird species occurrence and diversity, such as understory vegetation complexity and overall vegetation volume, may be partially obscured from airborne sensors by tree canopy cover. These challenges might be overcome by terrestrial and UAV LiDAR sensors that can provide detailed information of understory forest strata. For the first time, we collected terrestrial LiDAR (TLS) and unoccupied aerial vehicle LiDAR (ULS) data in a woodland landscape to compare the ability of both sensors to identify relationships among vegetation structural metrics and bird species richness and abundance. Overall, TLS and ULS models provided similar results based on the sampling methodology we used for LiDAR data collection in an open woodland landscape. Canopy roughness, ground vegetation vertical complexity, total vegetation volume and canopy height derived from these sensors were among the most common significant variables in explaining avian diversity and individual species abundance. Individual species abundance models provided better prediction power (up to R2 = 0.82 (TLS) and R2 = 0.83 (ULS)) than bird community abundance by functional guilds (up to R2 = 0.40 (TLS), R2 = 0.41 (ULS)) and overall bird abundance (R2 = 0.10 (TLS), R2 = 0.16 (ULS)), species richness (R2 = 0.14 (TLS), R2 = 0.14 (ULS)) and diversity (R2 = 0.17 (TLS), R2 = 0.16 (ULS)).

Specifically, knowledge of snow density spatial and temporal variability could improve modelling of snow water equivalent, which is relevant for managing freshwater resources in context of ongoing climate change. The possibility of estimating snow density from remote sensing has great potential, considering the availability of satellite data and their ability to generate efficient monitoring systems from space.   In this study, we present an innovative method that combines meteorological parameters, satellite data and field snow measurements to estimate thermal inertia of snow and snow density at a catchment scale. Thermal inertia represents the responsiveness of a material to variations in temperature and depends on the thermal conductivity, density and specific heat of the medium. By exploiting Landsat 8 data and meteorological modelling, we generated multitemporal thermal inertia maps in mountainous catchments in the Western European Alps (Aosta Valley, Italy), from incoming shortwave radiation, surface temperature and snow albedo. Thermal inertia was then used to develop an empirical regression model to infer snow density, demonstrating the possibility of mapping snow density from optical and thermal observations from space. The model allows for estimation of snow density with R-CV(2) and RMSECV of 0.59 and 82 kg m(-3), respectively. Thermal inertia and snow density maps are presented in terms of the evolution of snow cover throughout the hydrological season and in terms of their spatial variability in complex topography. This study could be considered a first attempt at using thermal inertia toward improved monitoring of the cryosphere. Limitations of and improvements to the proposed methods are also discussed.   This study may also help in defining the scientific requirements for new satellite missions targeting the cryosphere. We believe that a new class of Earth Observation missions with the ability to observe the Earth\'s surface at high spatial and temporal resolution, with both day and night-time overpasses in both optical and thermal domain, would be beneficial for the monitoring of seasonal snowpacks around the globe.', '[Colombo, Roberto; Pennati, Greta; Pozzi, Giulia; Garzonio, Roberto; Cogliati, Sergio; Rossini, Micol] Univ Milano Bicocca, Earth & Environm Sci Dept, Milan, Italy.

Moreover, forest degradation is a major concern, as the potential for carbon sequestration is reduced. Degradation is related to location, anthropogenic drivers, climate, and forest types, and there is no unique detection methodology to map this phenomenon on a global scale. This study proposes a procedure for detecting degraded forests using Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral imagery in Guinea, West Africa, and demonstrates that consideration of context improves degraded forest detection. In Guinea, the primary degradation process is selective logging in the massif forest, in addition to forest fragmentation caused by land use change. Monitoring forest degradation using remote sensing methods usually requires significant overhead in terms of photo-interpretation expertise. We proposed an approach to monitoring degradation through a semi-automated classification procedure with minimum photo-interpretation costs. First, the radio-metric values of the Sentinel-2 data were explored using a photo-interpreted reference map and ground obser-vations carried out with a local forester. Many of the ground observations found that forests considered as intact in the photo-interpreted reference map were degraded. This suggests photo-interpretation can be affected when investing in a single-date image. Our results showed that radiometric moisture-related indices (canopy water content [CWC], moisture stress index [MSI]), associated with leaf area index (LAI) retrieved from S2 data, were strongly related to the degree of degradation. Second, we improved the mapping of degraded forests through photo-interpretation of S2 data. Third, classification methodologies involving LAI, MSI, and CWC were estab-lished, and the results were compared with the improved photo-interpreted map. Two types of classification were compared: standard pixel-based classification and a hybrid method of classification that took contextual infor-mation into account by including neighbour pixel values in the algorithm to consider the pixel context, similar to the photo-interpretation methods. The inclusion of neighbour pixels in the semi-automated classification process led to a substantial improvement in the results. When contextual information was included, photo-interpretation of 1.6% of the latest year\'s data was sufficient to reach an overall accuracy above 85% requiring no use of past reference maps. Our method strongly supports the photo-interpretation procedure for less time-consuming and expensive map production, offering a significant foundation for degraded forest delineation in regions under similar conditions of canopy opening.', '[Quang, An Vo; Delbart, Nicolas] Univ Paris, UMR8236, Lab Interdisciplinaire Energies Demain, UFR GHES, Case 7001, F-75205 Paris 13, France.

Earth Observation (EO) is a valuable data source to cover this demand. In particular, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) missions offer new opportunities to map built-up areas on a global scale. Using Sentinel-2 images, recent urban mapping efforts achieved promising results by training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on available built-up data. However, these results strongly depend on the availability of local reference data for fully supervised training or assume that the application of CNNs to unseen areas (i.e. across-region generalization) produces satisfactory results. To alleviate these short-comings, it is desirable to leverage Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) algorithms that can take advantage of un-labeled data, especially because satellite data is plentiful. In this paper, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation (DA) approach using SSL that jointly exploits Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MSI to improve across-region generalization for built-up area mapping. Specifically, two identical sub-networks are incorporated into the proposed model to perform built-up area segmentation from SAR and optical images separately. Assuming that consistent built-up area segmentation should be obtained across data modality, we design an unsupervised loss for unlabeled data that penalizes inconsistent segmentation from the two sub-networks. Therefore, we propose to use complementary data modalities as real-world perturbations for consistency regularization. For the final prediction, the model takes both data modalities into account. Experiments conducted on a test set comprised of sixty representative sites across the world showed that the proposed DA approach achieves strong improvements (F1 score 0.694) over fully supervised learning from Sentinel-1 SAR data (F1 score 0.574), Sentinel-2 MSI data (F1 score 0.580) and their input-level fusion (F1 score 0.651). To demonstrate the effectiveness of DA, we also performed a comparison with two state-of-the-art products, namely GHS-BUILT-S2 and WSF 2019, on the test set. The comparison showed that our model is capable of producing built-up area maps with comparable or even better quality than the state-of-the-art global human settlement maps. Therefore, the multi-modal DA offers great potential to be adapted to produce easily updateable human settlements maps at a global scale.', '[Hafner, Sebastian; Ban, Yifang; Nascetti, Andrea] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Geoinformat, S-11428 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Royal Institute of TechnologyRP Ban, YF (通讯作者)，KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Geoinformat, S-11428 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'yifang@kth.seRI Nascetti, Andrea/HTN-3468-2023; Hafner, Sebastian/HJY-7318-2023', 'Nascetti, Andrea/0000-0001-9692-8636; Hafner,   Sebastian/0000-0003-3560-638X', 'Swedish National Space Agency under Grant dnr [155/15]; Digital Futures   under the grant for the EO-AI4GlobalChange Project; ESA-China Dragon 5   Program under the EO-AI4Urban Project', 'This work was supported in part by the Swedish National Space Agency   under Grant dnr 155/15, the Digital Futures under the grant for the   EO-AI4GlobalChange Project, and in part by ESA-China Dragon 5 Program   under the EO-AI4Urban Project.', 80, 8, 8, 12, 37, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

To evaluate the effects of fires on carbon cycling and climate change, it is crucial to accurately estimate the amount of carbon released during fires. The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission offers spaceborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) measurements of global forests, providing excellent opportunities for monitoring forest dynamics and carbon emissions. The ICESat-2 Land and vegetation height product (ATL08), Landsat 8 data, and Sentinel-1 data were integrated to estimate biomass burning emissions with a three-phase hierarchy model. In Phase 1, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to establish the relationship between ATL08 LiDAR metrics and reference aboveground biomass (AGB), R2 0.77 and RMSE 56.67 Mg ha-1. In Phase 2, the LASSO regression predicted AGB for all ATL08 segments. A Random Forest Regression model was trained with Landsat 8 reflectance data and derived vegetation indices, Sentinel-1 data, and terrain variables as predictors and with the LASSO predicted AGB as the response variable, R2 0.71 and RMSE 45.91 Mg ha-1. Wall-to-wall maps of pre-fire and post-fire AGB were produced with the Random Forest model. In Phase 3, the difference between the pre-fire and the post-fire AGB was converted to carbon emissions. The estimated biomass burning emissions of the 2018 Carr fire group, the 2018 Camp fire, and the 2019 Walker fire in California are 3.54 (+/- 0.067) Tg C, 1.66 (+/- 0.041) Tg C, and 0.45 (+/- 0.022) Tg C, respectively. Forests have the highest biomass burning emissions with an average emission of 30.09 Mg ha-1, approximately twice and four times the average emissions from shrubs and grasses.

Similar to other optical satellites, cloud-induced data missing in PlanetScope satellites substantially hinders its use for broad applications. However, effective gap-filling in PlanetScope image time series remains challenging and is subject to whether it can 1) consistently generate high accuracy results regardless of different gap sizes, especially for heterogeneous landscapes, and 2) effectively recover the missing pixels associated with rapid land cover changes. To address these challenges, we proposed an object-class based gap-filling (\'OCBGF\') method. Two major novelties of OCBGF include 1) adopting an object-based segmentation method in conjunction with an unsupervised classification method to help characterize the landscape heterogeneity and facilitate the search of neighboring valid pixels for gap-filling, improving its applicability regardless of the gap size; 2) employing a scenario-specific gap-filling approach that enables effective gap-filling of areas with rapid land cover change. We tested OCBGF at four sites representative of different land cover types (plantation, cropland, urban, and forest). For each site, we evaluated the performance of OCBGF on both simulated and real cloud-contaminated scenarios, and compared our results with three state-of-the-art methods, namely Neighborhood Similar Pixel Interpolator (NSPI), AutoRegression to Remove Clouds (ARRC), and Spectral-Angle-Mapper Based Spatio-Temporal Similarity (SAMSTS). Our results show that across all four sites, OCBGF consistently obtains the highest accuracy in gap-filling when applied to scenarios with various gap sizes (RMSE = 0.0065, 0.0090, 0.0092, and 0.0113 for OCBGF, SAMSTS, ARRC, and NSPI, respectively) and with/without rapid land cover changes (RMSE = 0.0082, 0.0112, 0.0119, and 0.0120 for OCBGF, SAMSTS, ARRC, and NSPI, respectively).

NSC results show that the DNN-based model could reproduce the physical response of ASCAT observables to changes in LSVs. Results indicated that ao40 is sensitive to surface soil moisture and LAI and that these sensitivities vary with time, and are highly dependent on land cover type. The a \' was shown to be sensitive to LAI, but also to root zone soil moisture due to the dependence of vegetation water content on soil moisture.

Accurately estimating river discharge with land surface models (LSMs) remains challenging due to the difficulty in estimating land water storages such as snow, soil moisture, and groundwater. While data assimilation (DA) ingesting optical, microwave, and gravity measurements from space can help constrain theses storage states, its impacts on runoff and eventually river discharge are not fully understood. Here, by taking advantage of recently published land DA results that jointly assimilate eight different combinations of observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E), we quantify to what degree multi-sensor land DA improves the river discharge simulation skills over 40 global river basins, and investigate the complementary strengths of different satellite measurements on river discharge. To be more specific, river discharge is updated by feeding gridded runoff from the eight multi-sensor DA simulations into a vector-based river routing model named the Routing Application for Parallel computatIon of Discharge (RAPID). Our modeling results, including 7-year simulations at 177,458 river reaches globally, are used to study the seasonal to interannual variability of river discharge. It is found that assimilating GRACE has the greatest impact on global runoff patterns, leading to the most pronounced improvements in spatial river discharge in the middle and high latitudes with the R2 increased by 0.16. The seasonal variation of spatial discharge is most skillful during the boreal summer. However, our evaluation also shows model and DA still struggle to generate reasonable variability and averaged discharge over permafrost regions.

The distribution of water resources is in a continuous change due to global warming affecting the productivity of ecosystems around the globe, but there is a lack of non-destructive methods capable of continuous monitoring of plant and leaf water content that would help us in understanding the consequences of the redistribution of water. We studied the utilization of novel small hyperspectral sensors in the 1350-1650 nm and 2000-2450 nm spectral ranges in non-destructive estimation of leaf water content in laboratory and field conditions. We found that the sensors captured up to 96% of the variation in equivalent water thickness (EWT, g/m(2)) and up to 90% of the variation in relative water content (RWC). Further tests were done with an indoor plant (Dracaena marginate Lem.) by continuously measuring leaf spectra while drought conditions developed, which revealed detailed diurnal dynamics of leaf water content. The laboratory findings were supported by field measurements, where repeated leaf spectra measurements were in fair agreement (R-2 = 0.70) with RWC and showed similar diurnal dynamics. The estimation of leaf mass per area (LMA) using leaf spectra was investigated as a pathway to improved RWC estimation, but no significant improvement was found. We conclude that close-range hyper spectral spectroscopy can provide a novel tool for continuous measurement of leaf water content at the single leaf level and help us to better understand plant responses to varying environmental conditions.', '[Junttila, S.; Saarinen, N.; Kankare, V.; Yrttimaa, T.; Vastaranta, M.] Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Forest Sci, Joensuu 80101, Finland.

However, its measurement accuracy is largely limited by the complex atmospheric delay distortion in alpine valley regions, resulting in poor performance of landslides detection and monitoring. Particularly, the spatial atmospheric heterogeneity over wide areas cannot be accurately reflected by conventional empirical phase-elevation models or external databased methods. In this study, we proposed a multi-temporal moving-window linear model (MMLM) to correct the tropospheric delay for wide-area landslides investigation. This is a linear regression model based on the elevation-phase relationship for modeling multi-temporal phases within a sliding local window. It mitigates the influence of local turbulent phase, local landslide deformation, and phase unwrapping error on parameter estimation, providing precise heterogeneous atmospheric corrections for wide-area InSAR landslide identification and monitoring. A simulation experiment was conducted to analyze the sensitivity of model parameters settings and evaluate the effectiveness of the MMLM model. Furthermore, we demonstrated the performance of the MMLM model through a comparison with the ERA5, GACOS, spatial-temporal filtering, and traditional linear model using descending and ascending Sentinel-1 data over the reservoir area of the Lianghekou hydropower station. Among the above-mentioned methods, the standard deviation of original unwrapped phases achieved the largest decrease of more than 35% and 50% after correction by the MMLM model for the descending and ascending Sentinel-1 tracks, respectively. In addition, the accurate deformation corrected by the MMLM model improved the landslides investigation, not only can help for delineating landslide boundaries in space but also retrieving movement evolution in time.', '[Wang, Yian; Dong, Jie; Gong, Jianya] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

TIR-RS is now commonly applied in regional- and continental-scale analyses, such as those focused on fire and surface energy balance. However, its application lags in plant physiology and ecology, for which a finer-scale understanding of plant canopy temperatures would be useful to elucidate plant water dynamics, for example. In particular, while methods to disaggregate TIR-RS pixels in horizontal space have advanced, possible vertical stratification of plant canopy temperature and its implications for understanding the correspondence between TIR-RS and finer-scale, field-based thermal measurements (e.g. made with a thermal camera) remain unexplored. Here, we use data from a thermal camera deployed concurrently with the recent ECOSTRESS mission to quantify vertical temperature gradients within tree canopies and temperatures of overvs. under-story plants in a Mediterranean woodland savanna. We then leverage diverse ancillary data to maximize the geometric comparability of ECOSTRESS and thermal camera measurements, in order to assess the extent to which the two forms of thermal measurements correspond. Specifically, we ask: (1) What are the patterns of intra-canopy and over- vs. under-story vertical temperature in a Mediterranean woodland savanna?, and (2) How can vertically-resolved, but spatially-limited field-based temperature measurements be reconciled with spatiallyextensive, but surface-only, temperature measurements of a space-borne remote sensor? We found consistent patterns of vertical thermal heterogeneity both within tree canopies and between ecosystem over- and understories. The daytime difference between the top and bottom thirds of blue oak canopies was, on average, 0.48 degrees C - and sometimes several times larger. Notably, canopy tops are cooler, likely associated with the understory grass reaching daytime temperatures often exceeding over-story temperatures by 10 degrees C. Given the consistency of the intra-canopy temperature gradients, we expected the ECOSTRESS sensor would be in better agreement with camera measurements of canopy tops than bulk canopies or canopy bottoms. However, withincanopy gradients were overwhelmed by other sources of disagreement between the measurements, in part associated with upscaling camera measurements across space. Overall, thermal camera and ECOSTRESS measurements were largely in agreement at night (pixel RMSE = 1.1 degrees C), but they were more divergent during times of low (but >0 W/m2) and high incoming solar radiation (daytime pixel RMSE = 3.5 degrees C).', '[Johnston, Miriam R.; Moorcroft, Paul R.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, 26 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.

Terrain features such as slope, gradient, and morphology, as well as forest structure attributes including canopy cover, height, and presence of on ground coarse wood, all influence the quality and quantity of salmonid habitat in forested ecosystems. The increasing availability of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data for forest applications offers an opportunity to utilize these data for assessing the quality and quantity of habitat, which is often costly and difficult to characterize. ALS data provides detailed and accurate Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) under forest canopies, which in turn enable the characterization of detailed stream networks, as well as stream and terrain attributes important to salmonids. At the Nahmint watershed on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, we sampled six, 200 m long stream reaches, describing a range of terrain and stream features following standard data collection protocols. Our objective in this research was to use ALS data to estimate three attributes from the 3D point cloud and DEM that are known to be important for salmonids, including bankfull width,instream wood and discrete stream morphological units. Results indicate that ALS-based estimates had strong, significant, correlations with field measured attributes (with Pearson\'s correlation of 0.80 and 0.81 for bankfull width and instream wood, respectively). Bankfull width was slightly underestimated using the ALS data (Bias =-1.01 m; MAD = 1.89 m; RMSD = 2.05 m) and 80% of instream wood pieces were detected. Using ALS-derived predictors in a Random Forest model, discrete stream morphological units (i.e. pools, riffles, glides, cascades) were classified with an overall accuracy of 85%, with pools having the highest user\'s class accuracy at 96%. Results presented herein indicate that ALS data can be used to provide a fine scale characterization of stream attributes that are required to identify salmonid habitat, providing critical information for sustainable forest management decision making, and providing a foundation for advanced salmonid habitat modeling.', '[Kuiper, Spencer Dakin; Coops, Nicholas C.; Tompalski, Piotr] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Resources Management, Integrated Remote Sensing Studio, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.

Physically-based LiDAR radiative transfer (RT) models are essential tools for interpreting LiDAR signals, designing LiDAR systems, and validating information retrieval methods. Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) is one of the most accurate and comprehensive 3D RT models that simulate LiDAR signals of urban and natural landscapes. Its physical modeling relies on a forward Monte Carlo mode optimized by a ray-tracking technique, also called DART-RC (Ray Carlo) mode. However, DART-RC is not adapted to simulate massive LiDAR signals of large landscapes due to its constraints of high memory demand and long computational time. Therefore, we developed a novel computationally efficient LiDAR modeling method based on a new DART modeling mode called DART-Lux. It simulates LiDAR signal by adapting the bidirectional path tracing algorithm of DART-Lux to the time and power measurements and by implementing the LiDAR instrument and multiple product outputs in DART-Lux. We verified the accuracy of DART-Lux for LiDAR modeling using DART-RC as a reference for several case studies with different LiDAR configurations (i.e., single-pulse waveform, multi-pulse point cloud, multi-pulse photon counting, with and without solar signal) on realistic scenes from the RAMI experiment. Results stress that i) DART-Lux is consistent with DART-RC, for example, R-2 = 1 and rRMSE = 0.21% for the waveform of a forest simulated with a huge number of rays; ii) DART-Lux converges faster than DART-RC: its processing time is usually about half that of DART-RC, and over ten times smaller if the solar signal is simulated; iii) DART-Lux memory usage can be a hundred times less than DART-RC. Also, several sensitivity studies with various sensor configurations and solar directions illustrate the usefulness of DART-Lux for impact studies. This new DART-Lux LiDAR model opens promising perspectives for large-scale LiDAR applications with 3D modeling.

Present day sustainable forest management practices go beyond forest inventory and increasingly include aspects such as carbon accounting and regeneration assessments. Such monitoring requires often unavailable, spatially exhaustive and up-to-date information on forest attributes over broad areas. Recent developments in the acquisition of broad-scale forest attribute information from remotely sensed data has included the use of multiple technologies that take advantage of globally available data products to derive forest attribute layers. However, less is known about the applicability and performance of such products when used to produce broad-scale, accurate, and up-to-date forest information products. This study aimed to evaluate the agreement between two broad-scale forest canopy height products - Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2) and the National Terrestrial Ecosystem Monitoring System (NTEMS) imputed canopy height layers for Canada - across a variety of ecological gradients. Overall, the two datasets showed high correspondence, with a root-mean-square difference of 4.87 m, and 85% of ICESat-2 canopy heights falling within the 95% confidence interval of the NTEMS height estimate. Across ecozones, canopy heights in the Taiga Shield West and Boreal Shield West had stronger agreement (91% of ICESat-2 segments within the 95% confidence interval of NTEMS), while the Taiga Cordillera and Taiga Shield East had lower agreement (< 75% of ICESat-2 segments within the 95% confidence interval of NTEMS). Interestingly, we found that the modeled heights based upon optical satellite data had a less generalized distribution than heights from ICESat-2 as well as achieving a greater representation for the taller (overall and by ecozone) height classes. An increase in absolute difference between data products was also found as a function of increasing slope. Finally, the correspondence between products was evaluated across disturbed areas (35 to 10 years since disturbance) to assess the agreement of the two products in areas of regenerating forest. In general, the analysis found that burned areas, which tend to be more structurally heterogeneous, had lower agreement between products then harvested areas. The high overall correspondence between the data products demonstrate the potential for integration of ICESat-2 to inform (via calibration / validation) or update height products based upon optical satellite data.', '[Mulverhill, Christopher; Coops, Nicholas C.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Resources Management, Integrated Remote Sensing Studio, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.

Spectroscopy, particularly optical hyperspectral reflectance coupled with machine learning, can provide rapid, efficient, and cost-effective quantification of SOC. However, how to exploit soil hyperspectral reflectance to predict SOC concentration, and the potential performance of airborne and satellite data for predicting surface SOC at large scales remain relatively underknown. This study utilized a continental-scale soil laboratory spectral library (37,540 full-pedon 350-2500 nm reflectance spectra with SOC concentration of 0-780 g.kg(-1) across the US) to thoroughly evaluate seven machine learning algorithms including Partial-Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Ridge, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) along with four preprocessed spectra, i.e. original, vector normalization, continuum removal, and first-order derivative, to quantify SOC concentration. Furthermore, by using the coupled soil-vegetation-atmosphere radiative transfer model, we simulated twelve airborne and spaceborne hyper/multi-spectral remote sensing data from surface bare soil laboratory spectra to evaluate their potential for estimating SOC concentration of surface bare soils. Results show that LSTM achieved best predictive performance of quantifying SOC concentration for the whole data sets (R-2 = 0.96, RMSE = 30.81 g.kg(-1)), mineral soils (SOC <= 120 g.kg(-1), R-2 = 0.71, RMSE = 10.60 g.kg(-1)), and organic soils (SOC > 120 g.kg(-1), R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 62.31 g.kg(-1)). Spectral data preprocessing, particularly the first-order derivative, improved the performance of PLSR, RF, Ridge, KNN, and ANN, but not LSTM or CNN. We found that the SOC models of mineral and organic soils should be distinguished given their distinct spectral signatures. Finally, we identified that the shortwave infrared is vital for airborne and spaceborne hyperspectral sensors to monitor surface SOC. This study highlights the high accuracy of LSTM with hyperspectral/multispectral data to mitigate a certain level of noise (soil moisture <0.4 m(3).m(-3), green leaf area < 0.3 m(2).m(-2), plant residue <0.4 m(2).m(-2)) for quantifying surface SOC concentration. Forthcoming satellite hyperspectral missions like Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) have a high potential for future global soil carbon monitoring, while high-resolution satellite multispectral fusion data can be an alternative.', '[Wang, Sheng; Guan, Kaiyu; Zhang, Chenhui; Lee, DoKyoung; Margenot, Andrew J.; Zhou, Wang; Zhou, Qu] Univ Illinois, Agroecosyst Sustainabil Ctr, Inst Sustainabil Energy & Environm, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.

In addition to the Pearson correlation coefficients performed to quantitatively analyze the consistency and inconsistency of each dataset, an NDVI quality control (QC) layer and Landsat NDVI are also used to evaluate the findings. The results indicate that the GIMMS has the highest NDVI mean, while SPOT has the lowest.

Fire severity data with wide spatial and temporal coverage enhances understanding of fire\'s impact on vegetation and improves planning to mitigate the risk of destructive wildfires. In this study, we develop a machine learning workflow that converts a spatial database of known fire events into a collection of gridded fire severity maps representing levels of canopy scorch due to wildfires and planned fuel reduction burns (prescribed burns). This workflow uses a dataset of observed fire severity interpreted from post-fire aerial images (3-7 cm spatial resolution; -11,649 labels from 64 unique fires) to train and test a supervised classifier that predicts fire severity using 13 Landsatderived spectral indices. For a target fire, the classifier generates a pixel-level prediction of fire severity with classes belonging to one of five ordinal categories ranging from unburnt, three levels of canopy scorch, and canopy consumed by fire. The classifier\'s accuracy was 84.2% (Kappa score = 0.799) and testing was undertaken across multiple fire types (wildfire / prescribed burn), seasons, forest types and topography. MODIS thermal anomalies and a MODIS-derived burn area product were used to augment the fire severity database with startand end-of-fire dates to enable accurate delineation of pre- and post-fire Landsat imagery; this method increased model accuracy from 78.0% (Kappa = 0.72). The model was then applied to a regional 16-year (2005 to 2020) history of fire events (n fires = 713, -1Mha) in the sclerophyll eucalypt forests and woodlands of the Northern Jarrah Forest, Western Australia. On fires with MODIS-adjusted start and end dates, high severity fire (>80% canopy scorch) was predicted more often in wildfires (67.9%, 124900 ha) compared to prescribed burns (14.6%, 110300 ha). However, the total predicted area of high-severity fire was comparable between fire types due to prescribed burns being more frequent on the landscape. We provide the first fire severity model in Western Australia that is broadly calibrated to both prescribed burns and wildfires across multiple conditions. Our model outputs are made freely available and offer opportunities to better understand the interactions between prescribed burns and wildfires, and the effects of fire severity on the environment.', '[Dixon, Dan J.; Callow, J.

The most typical scenario is flying below intermittent clouds and under turbulent conditions, which causes tilting of the platform. This study aims to advance hyperspectral imaging from UAS in most weather conditions by addressing two challenges: (i) the radiometric and spectral calibrations of miniaturized hyperspectral sensors; and (ii) tilting effects on measured downwelling irradiance. We developed a novel method to correct the downwelling irradiance data for tilting effects. It uses a hybrid approach of minimizing measured irradiance variations for constant irradiance periods and spectral unmixing, to calculate the spectral diffuse irradiance fraction for all irradiance measurements within a flight. It only requires the platform\'s attitude data and a standard incoming light sensor. We demonstrated the method at the Palo Verde National Park wetlands in Costa Rica, a highly biodiverse area. Our results showed that the downwelling irradiance correction method reduced systematic shifts caused by a change in flight direction of the UAS, by 87% and achieving a deviation of 2.78% relative to a on ground reference in terms of broadband irradiance. High frequency (< 3 s) irradiance variations caused by high-frequency tilting movements of the UAS were reduced by up to 71%. Our complete spectral and radiometric calibration and irradiance correction can significantly remove typical striped illumination artifacts in the surface reflectance-factor map product. The possibility of collecting precise hyperspectral reflectance-factor data from UAS under varying cloud cover makes it more operational for environmental monitoring or precision agriculture applications, being an important step in advancing hyperspectral imaging from UAS.', '[Koppl, Christian J.; Wang, Sheng; Jin, Hongxiao; Bauer-Gottwein, Peter; McKnight, Ursula S.; Garcia, Monica] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, Bygning 115, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.

These datasets provide unprecedented power to detect patterns of time trends involving information from all pixels on a map. However, rigorously testing for time trends requires a solid statistical foundation to identify underlying patterns and test hypotheses. Appropriate statistical analyses are challenging because environmental data often have temporal and spatial autocorrelation, which can either obscure underlying patterns in the data or suggest false associations between patterns in the data and independent values used to explain them. Existing statistical methods that account for temporal and spatial autocorrelation are not practical for remote-sensing datasets that often contain millions of pixels. Here, we first analyze simulated data to show the need to account for both spatial and temporal autocorrelation in time-trend analyses. Second, we present a new statistical approach, PARTS (Partitioned Autoregressive Time Series), to identify underlying patterns and test hypotheses about time trends using all pixels in large remotesensing datasets. PARTS is flexible and can include, for example, the effects of multiple independent variables, such as land-cover or latitude, on time trends. Third, we use PARTS to analyze global trends in NDVI, focusing on trends in pixels that have not experienced land-cover change. We found that despite the appearance of overall increases in NDVI in all continents, there is little statistical support for these trends except for Asia and Europe, and only in some land-cover classes. Furthermore, we found no overall latitudinal trend in greening for any continent, but some latitude by land-cover class interactions, implying that latitudinal patterns differed among land-cover classes. PARTS makes it possible to identify patterns and test hypotheses that involve the aggregate information from many pixels on a map, thereby increasing the value of existing remote-sensing datasets.', '[Ives, Anthony R.; Morrow, Clay J.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Integrat Biol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

However, recent advancements in the availability of remote sensing data (e.g., the free data policies of the Landsat and Sentinel Programs) and cloud computing platforms (e.g., Google Earth Engine (GEE)) provide new opportunities for monitoring forest degradation. Several recent studies focus on monitoring forest degradation in the tropics, particularly the Amazon, but there are less studies of temperate forest degradation. Compared to the Amazon, temperate forests have more seasonality, which complicates satellite-based monitoring. Here, we present an approach, Continuous Change Detection and Classification - Spectral Mixture Analysis (CCDC-SMA), that combines time series analysis and spectral mixture analysis running on GEE for monitoring abrupt and gradual forest degradation in temperate regions. We used this approach to monitor forest degradation and deforestation from 1987 to 2019 in the country of Georgia. Reference conditions were observed at sample locations selected under stratified random sampling for area estimation and accuracy assessment. The overall accuracy of our map was 91%. The user\'s accuracy and producer\'s accuracy of the forest degradation class were 69% and 83%, respectively. The sampling-based area estimate with 95% confidence intervals of forest degradation was 3541 +/- 556 km(2) (11% of the forest area in 1987), which was significantly larger than the area estimate of deforestation, 158 +/- 98 km(2).

However, spatially-continuous information on LCC variability at fine time-steps, and at fine spatial resolutions across regional spatial extents, is sparse. In this study, we improved a physically-based, two-step inversion approach by using an advanced canopy-to-leaf reflectance conversion model to estimate LCC at fine spatial resolution (20 m) from Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) data. The first step is to convert MSI canopy reflectance to leaf reflectance using look-up tables constructed from a geometric optical model (4-Scale). The second step is to estimate LCC from the modeled leaf reflectance using the PROSPECT-5 leaf optical model. Both leaf reflectance and LCC derived from MSI were validated against field measurements at a mixed temperate forest site in Canada to examine the accuracy of leaf area index (LAI) and LCC retrievals. The results demonstrate robust canopy-level inversions with strong relationships between measured and MSI-derived leaf reflectance (R-2 = 0.995, p < 0.001, RMSE = 0.0143). The modeled LCC results were also strong when compared to measured LCC samples: R-2 = 0.849, p < 0.001, and RMSE = 0.304 mu g/cm(2), respectively. The most important Sentinel-2 MSI band for LAI and LCC derivation was centered at 705 nm (Band 5). Importantly, this two-step radiative transfer inversion approach substantially improved upon the current LAI and LCC algorithms adopted by the Sentinel-2 Application Platform, which underestimated LAI by 52.93% and overestimated LCC by 44.45%. This work highlights the potential of the physically-based two-step inversion method for deriving leaf and canopy traits from Sentinel-2 at very fine spatial and temporal resolutions, for a wide range of terrestrial ecological applications.', '[Li, Yingjie; Ma, Qingmiao] Jiangsu Normal Univ, Sch Geog Geomat & Planning, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

Nevertheless, the temporal resolution of optical sensors is strongly affected by cloud cover, resulting in significant missing information. The use of complementary acquisitions, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, opens the door to the development of new multi-sensor methodologies aiming at the reconstruction of missing information. However, the joint exploitation of new radar and optical missions, such as the Sentinel, raises new challenges given the different nature and response of the two data sources. In this work, the SenRVM methodology is proposed as a new multi-sensor approach to regress SAR time series towards Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). A deep Recurrent Neural Network architecture which integrates SAR acquisitions and ancillary data is adopted. The regression task permits a continuous optical temporal resolution of 6 days. Multiple experiments are carried out to assess the SenRVM framework by studying two large-scale areas in France. Through an extensive interpretation of the results, SenRVM is evaluated on three main vegetation types (grasslands, crops, and forests). High accurate results (R2 0.83 and MAE < 0.05) over more than 140,000 vegetation polygons are obtained, both for multi-class and class-specific models. The importance of the SenRVM input features is discussed through an ablation study, highlighting that the relevance of the features differs for the various classes. The good performances of SenRVM are assessed by evaluating the quality of the reconstruction over short- and long-term data gaps. Results are compared to five state-of-the-art methodologies. Finally, some preliminary experiments are first carried out to show how SenRVM results could be used to improve the existing cloud & shadow masks.

The methodology assessed the level of agreement between the temporal variations of Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR). The simultaneous changes were classified according to their sign, magnitude and level of confidence, whereby the respective products uncertainties were taken into consideration. A set of pro-posed agreement metrics were used to identify temporal and spatial biases of non-coherency, non-significance, sensitivity and the overall level of agreement of the temporal changes between two ECVs. We applied the methodology using the Joint Research Center (JRC) Two-stream Inversion Package (TIP) products at 1 km, those provided by the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) based on the SPOT/VGT and Proba-V at 1 km, and the MODIS MCD15A3 at 500 m. In addition, the same analysis was applied with aggregated products at a larger scale over Southern Africa. We found that the CGLS LAI and FAPAR products lacked consistency in their spatial and temporal changes and were severely affected by trends. The MCD15A3 products were characterized by the highest number of non-coherent changes between the two ECVs but temporal inconsistencies were mainly located over the eastern hemisphere. The JRC-TIP products were highly consistent. The results showed the advantages of physically-based retrieval algorithms, in both JRC-TIP and MODIS products, and indicated also that, except for MODIS over forests, aggregated products using an uncertainty-based weighted average led to higher agreement between the ECVs changes.', '[Mota, Bernardo; Gobron, Nadine; Morgan, Olivier; Cappucci, Fabrizio; Lanconelli, Christian; Robustelli, Monica] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Via Enrico Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy.

We propose to map and count oil palms by estimating tree densities per pixel for large-scale analysis. This allows for fine-grained analysis, for example regarding different planting patterns. To that end, we propose a new, active deep learning method to estimate oil palm density at large scale from Sentinel-2 satellite images, and apply it to generate complete maps for Malaysia and Indonesia. What makes the regression of oil palm density challenging is the need for representative reference data that covers all relevant geographical conditions across a large territory. Specifically for density estimation, generating reference data involves counting individual trees. To keep the associated labelling effort low we propose an active learning (AL) approach that automatically chooses the most relevant samples to be labelled. Our method relies on estimates of the epistemic model uncertainty and of the diversity among samples, making it possible to retrieve an entire batch of relevant samples in a single iteration. Moreover, our algorithm has linear computational complexity and is easily parallelisable to cover large areas. We use our method to compute the first oil palm density map with 10m Ground Sampling Distance (GSD), for all of Indonesia and Malaysia and for two different years, 2017 and 2019. The maps have a mean absolute error of +/- 7.3 trees/ha, estimated from an independent validation set. We also analyse density variations between different states within a country and compare them to official estimates.

Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has the ability to capture ground deformation of landslides with high precision over a large area. However, in mountainous regions this capability is often limited by decorrelation noise and atmospheric phase artifacts. Over Eldorado National Forest, California, where many landslides need to be monitored and investigated, InSAR images are severely affected by atmospheric noise and the coherence is highly variable throughout the year, challenging InSAR techniques to effectively detect movement of active landslides. In order to obtain reliable measurements, we have designed an interferogram selection method and an InSAR segment processing (SP) technique to improve the deformation measurement. Compared with the traditional non-segment processing (NSP), the SP technique has demonstrated advantages in reducing the impact of atmospheric noise. Our results from both the ascending and descending InSAR datasets based on SP indicate that many landslides along the Highway 50 corridor were creeping at a rate of less than 10 cm/year during the investigation period. We have found that landslide movements in the study region present obvious seasonal patterns. The precipitation and pore-water measurements and our hydrogeological diffusion models suggest that the seasonal movements of these landslides are primarily driven by the pore-water pressures, and the peak deformation of the landslides may occur in the dry season (May to October) due to the time lag of precipitation infiltration. In addition, we have observed subtle upward movement of the landslides after the precipitation begins, which is likely caused by the swelling of clay-rich landslide body due to an increase in the pore pressure. Furthermore, several other localized unstable regions which may contain potential landslide hazards were also detected and mapped in the study area, and their dynamics need further investigation. We conclude that InSAR is capable of detecting slow landslide motions over difficult terrains if associated artifacts in the interferograms are suppressed. InSAR time-series measurements along with hydrogeological models enable us to characterize the time delay between peaks of landslide motions and precipitation.', '[Kang, Ya; Zhao, Chaoying] Changan Univ, Sch Geol Engn & Geomat, Xian 710054, Peoples R China.

Long-term LAI maps are typically generated with satellite images at moderate spatial resolution (0.25 to 1 km), such as those from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). While useful for regional-scale land surface modeling, these moderate resolution products often cannot resolve spatial heterogeneity important for many agricultural and hydrological applications. This paper proposes an approach to map LAI at 30-m resolution based on Landsat images for the Contiguous US (CONUS) consistent with the MODIS product, aimed at multi-scale modeling applications. The algorithm was driven by 1.6 million spatially homogeneous samples derived from MODIS LAI and Landsat surface reflectance products from 2006 to 2018. Based on these samples, we trained separate random forest models to estimate LAI from Landsat surface reflectance for eight biomes of the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). A balanced sample design regarding the saturation status of MODIS LAI and a machine-learning-based noise detection technique were introduced to mitigate the trade-off in estimation accuracy between medium LAI (e.g., 3 to 4, unsaturated) and high LAI (e.g., 4-6, saturated).   This approach was evaluated using ground measurements from 19 National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites and eight independent sites from other sources. These sites comprise a representative sample of forests, grasslands, shrublands, and croplands across the US. For NEON sites, the LAI estimates show an overall Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.8 with r(2) of 0.88. For the eight independent sites, the Landsat LAI algorithm achieves RMSE between 0.52 and 0.91. The uncertainty in Landsat estimated LAI varies across biomes and locations. The proposed algorithm was implemented on the Google Earth Engine platform, allowing for the rapid generation of long-term high-resolution LAI records from the 1980s using Landsat images (code is available at https://github.com/yanghuikang/Landsat-LAI).

However, the relationships between SIF and gross primary productivity (GPP) are not fully understood, which is mainly due to the challenges of decoupling structural and physiological factors that control the relationships. Here, we report the results of continuous observations of canopy-level SIF, GPP, absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), and chlorophyll: carotenoid index (CCI) in a temperate evergreen needleleaf forest. To understand the mechanisms underlying the relationship between GPP and SIF, we investigated the relationships of light use efficiency (LUEp), chlorophyll fluorescence yield (?F), and the fraction of emitted SIF photons escaping from the canopy (fesc) separately. We found a strongly non-linear relationship between GPP and SIF at diurnal and seasonal time scales (R2 = 0.91 with a hyperbolic regression function, daily). GPP saturated with APAR, while SIF did not. Also, there were differential responses of LUEp and ?F to air temperature. While LUEp reached saturation at high air temperatures, ?F did not saturate. We found that the canopy-level chlorophyll: carotenoid index was strongly correlated to canopy-level ?F (R2 = 0.84) implying that ?F could be more closely related to pigment pool changes rather than LUEp. In addition, we found that the fesc contributed to a stronger SIF-GPP relationship by partially capturing the response of LUEp to diffuse light.

Here, we present a technique that addresses this question by linking the SARderived velocity measurements with the glacier elevation change and the specific mass balance (i.e. mass balance per unit area). The technique computes the speckle offset tracking results from the north, east and vertical flow displacement time series, with the vertical component further split into a Surface Parallel Flow (SPF) advection component due to the motion along a glacier surface slope and a non-Surface Parallel Flow (nSPF). The latter links the glacier surface elevation change with the specific mass balance and strain rates. We apply this technique to ascending and descending Sentinel-1 data to derive the four-dimensional flow displacement time series for glaciers in southeast Alaska during 2016-2019. Time series extracted for a few characteristic regions demonstrate remarkable temporal variability in flow velocities. The seasonal signal observed in the nSPF component is modeled using the Positive Degree Day model.

An innovative fusion strategy is proposed to investigate the displacement history of the Oct. 11, 2018 Baige landslide, which has two steps: (1) selecting the optimal correlation window size and search step to eliminate the inconsistency of image correlation for different sensors, and (2) inverting the fused displacement time-series from correlation results to enhance the temporal sampling density. The normalized displacement velocity indicates that the Oct. 11, 2018 Baige landslide is characterized by high-speed sliding (28 m/yr) and high shear outlet with an average elevation difference of around 82 m. The fused displacement time series indicates that the whole phase transformation can be from the secondary stage to the tertiary stage on Mar. 26, 2017. Furthermore, the displacement velocity shows four quiescence phases in the secondary stage and two acceleration phases in the tertiary stage. The seasonal precipitation is assumed as the main external triggering factor, and it combined with the brittle geological material attributes to control the precursory landslide displacement evolution and caused the catastrophic slope failure on Oct. 11, 2018. The precursory displacement signals with a magnitude above 5 m/day of the second landslide (Nov. 3, 2018) is quantified by the 52 image correlation.

While thermometers on buoys measure SST relatively accurately, only sensors aboard satellites give global and repeated SST measurements necessary for many applications, including climate modeling. For satellite-based thermal infrared sensors, an atmospheric correction converts calibrated brightness temperatures measured at orbital height into an SST estimate, but imperfect assumptions in the correction algorithm coupled with variability in atmospheric conditions and viewing geometries can lead to a wide range of errors and uncertainties in the satellite-derived SST retrievals. Estimates of the resulting errors are imperative for satellite-derived SST assimilation into climate models. This paper evaluates the use of machine learning Decision Tree algorithms to predict the central tendency and dispersion of errors in satellite-derived SST retrievals. First, using records from the NASA R2014.1 MODIS Aqua SST Matchup Database, which includes matched-up satellite and in situ SST measurements, a set of seven variables was derived that addresses the assumptions and known issues in the satellite SST retrieval process. Then, both Random Forest and Cubist Decision Trees were used to predict the SST residual (satellite SST minus skin-corrected buoy SST) for each matchup. While both Decision Tree methods performed similarly well, the Cubist model is more easily interpreted and yields better predictions of errors for relatively infrequent conditions. Various characteristics of the groups of matchups identified by Cubist were explored, and uncertainty values for the error estimates were derived for each group. Overall, the Cubist model predicted the skin SST residual with a root-mean-squared-error of 0.380 degrees C across nighttime cloud-filtered domains, demonstrating that a Cubist model is viable for quantitatively and accurately predicting Single Sensor Error Statistics per pixel as required by the Group for High Resolution SST. In this paper, we present the training and testing of both Decision Tree models. Because of its interpretability, we explore in detail the characteristics of the Cubist-derived groups to gain new geophysical insight into the satellite-derived SST retrieval error across different measurement conditions.', '[Kumar, Chirag] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.

In commercial agricultural systems, combine harvesters with onboard yield monitors collect real-time yield data during harvest with high spatial resolution, generating a large ground dataset. Here, we leveraged a yield monitor dataset of over one million maize field observations across the United States Corn Belt from 2008 to 2018 to evaluate the Scalable Crop Yield Mapper (SCYM). SCYM uses region-specific crop model simulations and climate data to interpret vegetation indices from satellite observations, thus enabling efficient sub-field yield estimation across large regions and multiple years without reliance on ground data calibration. We used the ground dataset to compare alternative SCYM model implementations, define minimum required satellite observation criteria, and evaluate the sensitivity of satellite-based yield estimates to on-the-ground variation in management, soil, and annual weather. We found that smoothing annual time series data with harmonic regression increased 30 m pixel-level accuracy from r(2) = 0.31 to 0.40 and reduced dependency on specific satellite observation timing, enabling robust yield estimation on 97% of annual maize area using only Landsat data. Agreement improved as the assessment was aggregated to field-level (r2 = 0.45) and county-level (r(2) = 0.69) scales, demonstrating the need for fine-resolution ground truth data to better assess sub-field level accuracy in high resolution products. We found that SCYM and ground data showed a similar yield response to management and environmental variation, particularly capturing linear and nonlinear responses to sowing density, soil water holding capacity, and growing season precipitation. However, sensitivity to factors like soil quality and planting date was muted for SCYM estimates compared to ground-based yields. Random forest models were able to match SCYM performance when trained on at least 1000 ground observations, but performed poorly when tested on years and locations not represented in the training data.

Field sampling to assess the abundance of EB is challenging because of their \"epiphytic\" habitat, which makes large-scale quantifications impractical. The abundance of EBs is highly related to forest structure, physical environment and microclimate. These characteristics may permit landscape-scale assessments using a synoptic sensing approach. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the plot-scale EB biomass density (kg ha(-1)) and a comprehensive set of field and airborne light detection and ranging (lidar)-derived forest biophysical, topographic and bioclimatic attributes (factors), and assessed the feasibility of landscape-scale mapping of EB biomass in TMCFs. The study was carried out in 16,773 ha of TMCFs on Chilan Mountain in northeastern Taiwan. The relationship between EB biomass density data from 21 plots (30 x 30 m) and 39 field or 1-m gridded lidar data-derived forest structural, topographic and bioclimatic factors was investigated. We applied a partial least squares regression (PLSR) model to minimize the effects of multi-collinearity among those 39 factors, and selected latent variables (LVs) explaining the majority of data variation for landscape-scale EB biomass mapping. The first four LVs explained 92% of the data variation, and the performance of the PLSR was satisfactory (R-2 = 0.92, p < 0.001). The majority (35 out of 39) of the selected forest structural, topographic and bioclimatic factors were significantly related to one or more LVs, and most (37 out of 39) could be directly derived or were indirectly related to lidar metrics, thereby permitting the landscape-scale mapping of EB biomass density. We estimated that the mean (+/- standard deviation) EB biomass density was 296.5 +/- 373.1 kg ha(-1) and that the total EB biomass of the TMCF of Chilan Mountain was 4973.9 Mg. This study demonstrates that the proposed approach may be feasible for landscape-scale EB biomass mapping, thereby advancing our understanding of the role of EBs in the hydrological and nutrient cycles of TMCFs. The outcomes of the PLSR may elucidate the physiological mechanisms underpinning EB abundance in TMCFs and guide ecological management under future climate scenarios.', '[Lai, Guan-Yu; Liu, Hung-Chi; Huang, Cho-ying] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geog, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.

This study aimed at evaluating how satellite images at different resolutions (spatial, spectral and temporal) can influence the representation of soil variability over time, the percentage of bare soil areas and spatial predictions of soil properties in southeastern Brazil. We used single-date and multi-temporal images (SYSI, Synthetic Soil Images) of bare soil pixels from the Sentinel2-MultiSpectral Instrument (S2-MSI) and the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (L8-OLI) to conduct this research. Two SYSIs were obtained from images acquired in four years (2016-2019) for each satellite (SYSI S2-MSI and SYSI L8-OLI) and a third SYSI, named SYSI Combined, was obtained by combining the images from both satellites. The single date images for each satellite was acquired in September, when the influence of clouds was low and bare soil pixels was predominant. Single-date images and SYSIs were compared by means of their spectral patterns and ability to predict topsoil properties (clay, sand, silt, and organic matter contents and soil color) using the Cubist algorithm. We found that the SYSIs outperformed single-date images and that the SYSI Combined and SYSI L8OLI provided the best prediction performances.

For this, the conventional reference-based Pearson correlation (R) and a statistical technique called Triple Collocation (TC)-based R are calculated. In addition, two alternatives for linear combination of the three data sources for maximizing R against the truth are evaluated, the first using a reference product (i.e. assumed truth) and the second based on TC where three data sources are combined without the need for an underlying reference or assumed truth. The estimated optimal combination weights represent quantitative contributions of the three products in forming the new combined product having the maximized R. Two reanalysis products: the European Centre for Medium Range Forecast (ECMWF) Interim product (ERA-Interim) and the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application Land version 2 reanalysis product (MERRA2), are used as the references as well as data alternatives to calculate the conventional reference-based R and the TC-based R combinations. Both types of R, and their derived optimal weights are then compared globally and analyzed under various climate, land cover, and vegetation conditions. Despite the differences between the conventional R and the TC-based R, both metrics displayed consistent spatial distributions and can reflect the temporal variations of each studied dataset without considerable impact from adopted references. All products had difficulty in retrieving SM over arid and polar regions while exhibiting good performance in areas such as South America and Australia. While ASCAT presented higher R values over tropical, savannas, and the vegetation water content interval of 2-5 kg/m(2), SMAP and SMOS-IC displayed overall comparable and continually high temporal performances across almost all conditions. In the case of the derived optimal weights, a global complementarity of the areas was observed where each satellite-based observation product showed its respective advantage in capturing SM variations in different geographic areas.', '[Zhang, Runze; Lakshmi, Venkat] Univ Virginia, Sch Engn Syst & Environm, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.

Considering the dual-polarimetry with limited observables, the surface roughness parameters such as the RMS height and auto-correlation length are first estimated by optimizing the semi-empirical Oh2004 model applied to the ALOS2 data acquired under bare soil condition. The vegetation water content corresponding to each ALOS2 acquisition time is derived from an empirical model applied to the temporally interpolated MODIS NDVI data. Then, the obtained roughness and vegetation optical depth are substituted into the Water Cloud Model which we modified by adding a double-bounce component according to the L-band scattering processes to retrieve the effective scattering albedo and soil moisture. The results show that the optimized surface RMS height and the associated slope are negatively related to a dual-angular radar index Delta HH, indicating the feasibility to optimize the relatively stable surface roughness parameters before retrieving the soil moisture dynamics. The obtained vegetation optical depth which is cross-validated against a normalized cross-polarized radar descriptor indicates a significant increase from May to August, in response to the vegetation phenological growth. Furthermore, the time variable scattering albedo is less than 0.08, and slightly increases with the vegetation development. By accounting for the double-bounce component, the retrieved soil moisture better agrees with the ground measurements with R = 0.89 and RMSE = 0.058 m(3)/m(3), but exhibits an overestimation issue for the soil moisture higher than 0.35 m(3)/m(3) due to the saturation of SAR signal and the relatively strong vegetation cover. A positive correspondence (R = 0.81) between the retrieved soil moisture and the interpolated NDVI was found, verifying their close coupling in the soil-vegetation system.

Such measurements, when combined with modelling, have the potential to make a significant cost-effective contribution to the progressive abandonment strategy of recently closed coalfields. Applications of DInSAR over coalfields have observed heave in coal measures rocks and temporal correlations between the rise of mine water and deformation time-series. The cessation of systematic dewatering can have a variety of detrimental impacts and knowledge of the time-scales (i.e. the rate of rebound) and structure of the mine system are crucial to the remediation strategy. Although mine plans and borehole measurements provide vital information in this regard, mine plans are often incomplete or inaccurate, whereas monitoring boreholes are spatially sparse. Consequently, groundwater can flow in unanticipated directions via goaf, mine shafts and roadways, making it difficult to determine where the impacts of rebound are likely to occur. In this study, ground deformation data obtained using ISBAS DInSAR on ENVISAT (2002-2009) and Sentinel-1 (2015-2019) data are used to develop a simple method to model groundwater rebound in abandoned coalfields. A forward analytical model based upon the principle of effective stress and mine water ponds is first implemented to estimate surface heave in response to changes in groundwater levels measured in monitoring boreholes. The forward model is then calibrated and validated using the ground deformation data. The DInSAR data were subsequently inverted to map the change in groundwater levels in greater detail across the coalfield and forecast surface discharges in order to support mitigation strategies.', '[Gee, David; Grebby, Stephen; Marsh, Stuart] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Geospatial Inst, Nottingham NG7 2TU, England.

Majority of them require several tunable parameters or can only detect abrupt forest disturbances. The aim of this study was to develop a new thresholdand trend-based vegetation change monitoring algorithm (TVCMA) that can detect abrupt and gradual changes in vegetation within forested and non-forested areas. To test the algorithm, the Polish and Slovak Tatra Mountains were used as the study area. Strong winds and bark beetle outbreaks (BBOs) are the primary causes of vegetation disturbances in this region. An annual time series of vegetation indices from 1984 to 2016 was used as the input. The long time span necessitated the use of scenes from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Operational Land Imager (OLI). Fifty-one images were atmospherically and topographically corrected. The collected in situ data included the chlorophyll content, leaf area index, absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, and spectral signatures of non-forest vegetation, dwarf pine, and forest stands in 190 sample plots. To select the vegetation indices (VIs) most suitable for disturbance detection, ten satellite-based VIs were correlated with the acquired field data. The normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) was found to be more sensitive to vegetation disturbances and more resistant to data noise than any other tested index. The TVCMA uses two separate approaches, namely, thresholding, which indicates where and when the disturbances occurred, and a regression analysis, which presents the general trend in the time series for each pixel. The number of detected disturbances, the Spearman\'s correlation coefficient between the modeled trend line and satellite observations, and p-values were calculated. Different threshold values were tested to identify the value that yielded the most accurate results. By using 200 randomly selected validation points, we achieved an 83.3% producer\'s accuracy for disturbances (PAD), 46.3% user\'s accuracy for disturbances (UAD), and 97.8% overall accuracy (OA). These results confirm the potential of TVCMA for monitoring abrupt and gradual changes in vegetation.

Acting early based on alerts provided by early warning systems (EWS) can potentially provide substantial mitigation, reducing the financial and human cost. However, existing EWS tend only to monitor current, rather than forecast future, environmental and socioeconomic indicators of drought, and hence are not always sufficiently timely to be effective in practice. Here we present a novel method for forecasting satellite-based indicators of vegetation condition. Specifically, we focused on the 3-month Vegetation Condition Index (VCI3M) over pastoral livelihood zones in Kenya, which is the indicator used by the Kenyan National Drought Management Authority (NDMA). Using data from MODIS and Landsat, we apply linear autoregression and Gaussian process modelling methods and demonstrate high forecasting skill several weeks ahead. As a bench mark we predicted the drought alert marker used by NDMA (VCI3M < 35). Both of our models were able to predict this alert marker four weeks ahead with a hit rate of around 89% and a false alarm rate of around 4%, or 81% and 6% respectively six weeks ahead. The methods developed here can thus identify a deteriorating vegetation condition well and sufficiently in advance to help disaster risk managers act early to support vulnerable communities and limit the impact of a drought hazard.', '[Barrett, Adam B.; Duivenvoorden, Steven; Salakpi, Edward E.; Oliver, Seb] Univ Sussex, Dept Phys & Astron, Data Intens Sci Ctr, Brighton BN1 9QH, E Sussex, England.

Here, we present the first comprehensive vegetation map of GMME at high (10-m) spatial resolution. The map consists of nine key vegetation cover types (VCTs), which were derived in a two-step process integrating data from high-resolution WorldView-3 images (1.2-m) and Sentinel-2 images using a deep-learning workflow. We evaluate the role of anthropogenic, topographic, and climatic factors in affecting the fractional cover of the identified VCTs in 2017 and their MODIS-derived browning/greening rates in the preceding 17 years at 250-m resolution. Results show that most VCTs showed a preceding greening trend in the protected land. In contrast, the semi- and unprotected land showed a general preceding greening trend in the woody-dominated cover types, while they exhibited browning trends in grass-dominated cover types. These results suggest that woody vegetation densification may be happening across much of the GMME, alongside vegetation declines within the non-woody covers in the semi- and unprotected lands. Greening and potential woody densification in GMME is positively correlated with mean annual precipitation and negatively correlated with anthropogenic pressure. Increasing woody densification across the entire GMME in the future would replace high-quality grass cover and pose a risk to the maintenance of the region\'s rich savanna megafauna, thus pointing to a need for further investigation using alternative data sources. The increasing availability of high-resolution remote sensing and efficient approaches for vegetation mapping will play a crucial role in monitoring conservation effectiveness as well as ecosystem dynamics due to pressures such as climate change.', '[Li, Wang; Buitenwerf, Robert; Munk, Michael; Bocher, Peder Klith; Svenning, Jens-Christian] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Biodivers Dynam Changing World BIOCHANGE, Ny Munkegade 114, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.

Analysis of satellite-derived burned areas has allowed the identification of fire patches and their morphology as a new resource for tracking fire spread to improve fire models used to assess the impact of fires on climate and the carbon cycle. A critical parameter of the flood-fill algorithm used to create fire patches is the cut-off (in days) below which it aggregates two contiguous burned pixels to the same fire patch. However, the current level of validation is insufficient to understand the effect of the cut-off values and sensor resolutions on the subsequent fire-patch morphology. The FRY v1.0 database of functional fire-patch traits (e.g., size, elongation, and direction) emanates from the analyses of two global burned-area products derived from MODIS and MERIS sensors with different spatial and temporal resolutions and with cut-off values of 3, 5, 9, and 14 days. To evaluate whether the FRY products are accurately identifying the spatial features of fire patches and what are the most realistic cut-off values to use in different sub-regions of North America, we propose a new functional diversity trait-based approach, which compares the satellite-derived fire patches to forest service perimeters as reference data. This paper shows the accuracy of the FRY fire patches >= 300 ha in North America during 2005-2011. Our analysis demonstrates that fire patches with a high cut-off of 14 days and those derived from the MODIS sensor, with their high temporal resolution, better identify the fire diversity in North America. In conclusion, our statistical framework can be used for assessing satellite-derived fire patches. Furthermore, the temporal resolution of satellite sensors is the most important factor in identifying fire patches- thus space agencies should consider it when planning the future development of cost-effective climate observation systems.', '[Moreno, M.

Indeed, combined with the viewing geometry and neighbour effects, it strongly affects the direct, diffuse and multi-scattered scene irradiance, which in turn impacts the radiative budget and remote sensing signals of the landscapes. The increased availability of digital elevation models (DEM) and the advancement of 3D radiative transfer (RT) models allow us to better address these topographic effects. DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) is one of the most accurate and comprehensive 3D RT models that simulate remote sensing observations of natural and urban landscapes with topography and atmosphere. It simulates environmental effects (i.e., impact of adjacent landscape on the observed landscape) using a so-called infinite slope mode that infinitely duplicates the observed landscape while ensuring the continuity of slope and altitude at the DEM edges. Up to DART version 5.7.4, this mode was slightly inaccurate and computer intensive, depending on the topography. This paper presents an innovative modelling strategy that greatly improves it in terms of accuracy, image quality and computer efficiency. For that, a fictive auxiliary oblique plane, adapted to the landscape topography, is introduced for managing the scene illumination, the Earth-Atmosphere coupling and the storage of the radiation that exits the scene before being projected onto the sensor plane. Improvements and validations are illustrated both visually and quantitatively by DART images, radiometric products and radiative budget. For example, the observed reflectance of a Lambertian slope is equal to the expected analytical value. In addition, the solar plane reflectance of a forest on a mountain slope (experimental scene) has an average error of about 0.01% relative to the reflectance of the same forest stand in the reference scene (i.e., nine duplications of the experimental scene). This new modelling is already integrated in the official DART version (https://dart.omp.eu).', '[Wang, Yingjie; Lauret, Nicolas; Gastellu-Etchegorry, Jean-Philippe] Univ Toulouse, CNES CNRS IRD UPS, CESBIO, F-31401 Toulouse 09, France.', 'Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre   National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour   le Developpement (IRD)RP Wang, YJ (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, CNES CNRS IRD UPS, CESBIO, F-31401 Toulouse 09, France.', 'yingjiewang1102@gmail.com', 'LAURET, Nicolas/0000-0003-0594-6252; wang, yingjie/0000-0001-5041-8550', 'Region Occitanie Pyrenees-Mediterranee, France; TOSCA program of French   Space Centre (CNES)', 'This research is supported by the Region Occitanie   Pyrenees-Mediterranee, France and by the TOSCA program of French Space   Centre (CNES).

Remote sensing data enable the surveying and analysis of river geomorphology by providing multi-temporal Earth observation data from satellites at fine spatial and temporal resolutions. We proposed an optimized RivWidth method to automatically calculate width for all channels in a water map and parallelized it to produce the Multi-temporal China River Width (MCRW) dataset, which is the first 30-m multi-temporal river width dataset for China during 1990-2015, including estimates under both seasonal fluctuations and dynamic inundation frequencies. The MCRW dataset is made up of 1.3 x 10(8) seasonal estimates of river width, and covers 1.4 x 10(5) km of rivers in China. We validated the MCRW dataset against in-situ measurements. The MCRW estimates at maximum water extent showed a satisfactory accuracy of 15.0% and 15.2% for the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE), respectively. The MCRW dataset was further compared with the current state-of-the-art global product, the Global River Widths from Landsat (GRWL) dataset, which demonstrated the superiority of the MCRW in describing the basins of China. Our analysis indicated that the mean river widths of China in both summer and winter have increased over the past 25 years, and river width of the Yangtze River mainstream in the lower drainage region has shown a downward trend while the its middle reaches and tributaries (upstream of the Three Gorges Dam) have shown an upward trend. We also developed a locally adaptive search method to quantify seasonal (summer and winter) river width variability. The results revealed that most of the rivers were wider in summer during the study period, and mainstream of Yangtze River in middle/lower region exhibited less seasonal variability than its tributaries. Larger widths were observed in the middle reaches of the Yellow River and the upper reaches of the Black River in winter due to ice-jam floods. Overall, the generated MCRW dataset has the potential to serve as a fundamental resource in Earth system science, and could provide valuable support to surface water resource and riverine management.', '[Yang, Jie; Huang, Xin] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

However, evident differences of quantitative glacier mass balance (MB) estimations on fine scales exist in the prior reports. The large uncertainties in current geodetic observations over this region highlight the need for more independent validations and investigations on the spatial variability of glacier change. This study enriched glacier MB estimates over the SETP by using the newly released global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) - the TanDEM-X and analyzed the spatial pattern of glacier change on multi-spatial scales by comparing available satellite-based geodetic observations. Results reveal that the TanDEM-X - SRTM elevation differences, which show no obvious horizontal shifts and no significant elevation-dependent bias, provide reliable elevation change information over this challenging area. On the regional scale, the geodetic datasets (the ASTER elevation change rates data, TanDEM-X- SRTM differences, ICESat) achieved a highly consistent estimate of glacier MB at -4.11 +/- 1.52 Gt a(-1) (-0.60 +/- 0.16 m w.e. a(-1)) during 2000 and 2010s. On the subregional scale, the two gridded geodetic datasets revealed a clear contrast between moderate thinning of spring-accumulation type glaciers in the south and significantly more negative glacier MB of summer-accumulation type glaciers in the north. Glacier-wide MB showed high heterogeneity, which was closely related to the combined effect of topographic variation and climate forcings. We observed similar glacier thinning rates between debris-covered land-terminating glaciers and clean-ice glaciers (-0.50 +/- 0.32 m w.e. a(-1)) but remarkable more negative MB (-0.89 +/- 0.36 m w.e. a(-1)) of debris-covered glaciers connected with glacial lakes, which may indicate different evolution process of debris-covered glaciers in the monsoon-influenced region. This study demonstrates that current satellite-based geodetic observations achieve overall consistent patterns of glacier mass changes even over the most challenging mountainous areas (complicated terrain and climate). With the global TanDEM-X DEM and increasing observations from the mission, we expect improved consistency in glacier MB estimation on large spatial scales as well as detailed investigation of glacier mass change variability in the future.', '[Ke, Linghong; Yong, Bin] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.

Modeling emitted microwave brightness temperatures (TB) is made possible using a physical radiative transfer model that takes into account microstructural and stratigraphic structure of the snowpack. However, prescribing the microstructure remains a difficult task. This paper aims to find proper microstructure parametrization and the snow emission model formulation that best optimize TB simulations for Arctic and Subarctic snowpacks. Surfaced-based radiometric measurements in conjunction with in-situ snowpack characterization were used for testing different configurations based on the Snow Microwave Radiative Transfer model (SMRT), with two electromagnetic models (Dense Media Radiative Transfer Quasi Crystalline Approximation, DMRT, and Improved Born Approximation, IBA) and two microstructure description theories (Sticky Hard Sphere, SHS, and Exponential, Exp). We compare the performance of three configurations (DMRT-SHS, IBA-SHS and IBA-Exp) with a unique large dataset (119 snowpits with concomitant microwave ground-based radiometer observations) covering a wide range of Arctic and Subarctic snow types in Northern and Eastern Canada. Results show that the input measured microstructure parameters must be scaled up in order to better match simulated and observed TB at 11, 19, 37 and 89 GHz. We show that the IBA-Exp gives the best results, with a Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) lower by up to 30% for Subarctic snow and 24% for Arctic snow compare to the other model configurations we used. In addition, we undertake a complementary experiment on isolated homogeneous snow slabs to investigate the sensitivity of the scaling factor to snow microstructure. The retrieved microwave correlation length appears significantly different than the in-situ Debye correlation length. At high frequencies, the observed variability of these scaling factors with frequency and snowpack types means that density, SSA and estimated correlation length seem insufficient to appropriately fully characterize snow microstructure for microwave modeling purposes.', '[Vargel, Celine; Royer, Alain; St-Jean-Rondeau, Olivier; Sasseville, Vincent; Langlois, Alexandre] Univ Sherbrooke, Ctr Rech & Applicat Teledetect CARTEL, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada.

However, calculating accurate sediment budgets is challenging in tidal marsh-influenced estuaries where suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) typically vary on scales of hours and hundreds of meters, and where SSC dynamics are driven by a complex and often site-specific interplay of hydrodynamic and meteorological conditions. The mapping of SSC using ocean-color remote sensing is well established and can help capture the spatio-temporal variability of SSC and determine the dominant drivers regulating sediment budgets. However, the coarse spatial resolution of traditional ocean-color sensors (1-km) generally precludes their use in coastal-marsh estuaries. Here, using the Plum Island Estuary (Massachusetts, USA) as an example, we demonstrate that high-spatial-resolution maps of SSC derived from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2A/B Multispectral Instruments (MSI) can be used to determine the main drivers of SSC dynamics in tidal marsh-influenced estuaries, despite the long revisit time of these sensors. Local empirical algorithms between SSC and remote-sensing reflectance were derived and applied to a total of 46 clear-sky scenes collected by the OLI and the MSI between 2013 and 2018. The analysis revealed that this 5-year record was sufficient to capture a representative range of meteorological and tidal conditions required to determine the main drivers of SSC dynamics in this mid-latitude system. The interplay between river and tidal flows dominated SSC dynamics in this estuary, whereas wind-driven resuspension had a more moderate effect. The SSC was higher during spring because of increased river discharge due to snowmelt. Tidal asymmetry also enhanced sediment resuspension during flood tides, possibly favoring deposition on marsh platforms. Together, water level, water-level rate of change, river discharge and wind speed were able to explain > 60% of the variability in the main channel SSC, thereby facilitating future prediction of SSC from these readily available variables. This study demonstrates that the existing multi-year records of high-resolution remote sensing can provide a representative depiction of SSC dynamics in hydrodynamically-complex and small-scale estuaries that moderate-resolution ocean color remote sensing and in situ measurements are unable to capture.', '[Zhang, Xiaohe; Fichot, Cedric G.; Baracco, Carly; Neugebauer, Sydney; Fagherazzi, Sergio] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA.

The derivation of spatially and temporally consistent TCDM, however, typically requires field calibration to account for differences in instrument/survey parameters. Lidar surveys with no coincident field measurements consequently will have an unknown error associated with TCDM limiting their application. In this study, we analysed an extensive set of lidar captures with coincident field data to determine the lidar TCDM that best match the canopy gap probability (P-gap), foliage projective cover (FPC) and crown projective cover (CPC). Furthermore, we developed and evaluated models designed to reduce the bias introduced by variations in lidar instrument and survey acquisition parameters. The dataset incorporated 148 field sites (100 m diameter circular plots) coincident with 13 different lidar surveys between 2008 and 2015, distributed across a range of Australian forests and woodlands. The best lidar metric for 1 - P-gap, achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.7% with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of 6.1-7.3%, was the proportion of all returns greater than a canopy height threshold (tcanopy) of 1.5 m above ground (dall). The best metric for FPC (RMSE = 6.0%, CI = 5.3-6.7%) used the proportion of returns, weighted as the fraction of the number of returns recorded from each pulse (dweighted), with tcanopy of 1.7 m. The best metric for CPC (RMSE = 7.0%, CI = 6.4-7.7%) was the proportion of 0.5 m pixels greater than 0.8 m above the ground, for an interpolated canopy height model (dinterp). Overall bias for these metrics was low (similar to 1%), however, the bias for individual surveys varied significantly. For example, for one survey dall consistently underestimated 1 - P-gap with a bias of -8.3%, while a different survey consistently overestimated 1 - P-gap with a bias of 3.8%. Elastic net regression models, using instrument, survey and plot parameters as predictor variables, were unable to consistently remove the bias. No relationships could be discerned between lidar parameters and the bias between lidar metrics and field measurements, potentially due to complex interactions between parameters, the spatial scale of the field plots, and uncertainties in field measurements and lidar attributes. Although the bias could not be modelled, the results provide metrics to derive P-gap, FPC and CPC with less than 10% error from lidar surveys captured with similar parameters across Australia (>600,000 km(2)).', '[Fisher, Adrian; Arrnston, John; Goodwin, Nicholas; Scarth, Peter] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Joint Remote Sensing Res Program, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.

Lidar has been used for tracking the evolution of PBLH by using aerosol backscatter as a tracer, assuming aerosol is generally well-mixed in the PBL; however, the validity of this assumption actually varies with atmospheric stability. This is demonstrated here for stable boundary layers (SBL), neutral boundary layers (NBL), and convective boundary layers (CBL) using an 8-year dataset of micropulse lidar (MPL) and radiosonde (RS) measurements at the ARM Southern Great Plains, and MPL at the GSFC site. Due to weak thermal convection and complex aerosol stratification, traditional gradient and wavelet methods can have difficulty capturing the diurnal PBLH variations in the morning and forenoon, as well as under stable conditions generally. A new method is developed that combines lidar-measured aerosol backscatter with a stability dependent model of PBLH temporal variation (DTDS). The latter helps \"recalibrate\" the PBLH in the presence of a residual aerosol layer that does not change in harmony with PBL diurnal variation. The hybrid method offers significantly improved PBLH detection, with better correlation and smaller biases, under most thermodynamic conditions, especially for SBL and CBL. Relying on the physical process of PBL diurnal development, different schemes are developed for growing, maintenance, and decaying periods. Comprehensive evaluation of this new method shows much better tracking of diurnal PBLH variation and significantly smaller biases under various pollution levels.', '[Su, Tianning; Li, Zhanqing] Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.

To improve classification accuracy inclusion of features from auxiliary geospatial datasets in classification models is applied since 1980s. However, the method is mostly limited to pixel-based classifications, and the coverage, accuracy and resolution of free and open-access auxiliary datasets have been poor until recent years.   We evaluated how recent global coverage open-access geospatial datasets improve object-based LULC classification accuracy compared to using only spectral and texture features from satellite images. We applied feature sets topography, population, soil, canopy cover, distance to watercourses and spectral-temporal metrics from Landsat-8 time series on the southern foothills and savanna of Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, where the landscape is characterized by heterogeneous and fragmented mosaic of disturbed savanna vegetation, croplands, and settlements.   The classification was based on image objects (groups of spectrally similar pixels) derived from segmentation of four Formosat-2 scenes with 8 m spatial resolution using 1370 ground reference points for training, validation, and for defining 17 LULC classes. We built six Random Forest classification models with different sets of object features in each. The baseline model having only spectral and texture features was compared with five other models supplemented with auxiliary features.   Inclusion of auxiliary features significantly improved classification overall accuracy (OA). The baseline model gave a median OA of 60.7%, but auxiliary features in other models increased median OA between 6.1 and 16.5 percentage points. The best OA was achieved with a model including all features of which elevation was the most important auxiliary feature followed by Enhanced Vegetation Index temporal range and slope degree.   Applying object-based classification to geospatial information on topography, soil, settlement patterns and vegetation phenology, the discriminatory potential of challenging LULC classes can be significantly improved. We demonstrated this for the first time, and the technique shows good potential for improving LULC mapping across a multitude of fragmented landscapes worldwide.', '[Hurskainen, P.; Adhikari, H.; Siljander, M.; Pellikka, P.

Here we present a semi-automatic, operational algorithm for mapping and monitoring of woody vegetation canopy cover and height at a regional scale using freely available Landsat time series data. The presented algorithm employs automatic data processing and mapping using a set of lidar-based vegetation structure prediction models. Changes in vegetation cover are detected separately and integrated into the structure time-series. Sample-based validation and inter-comparison with existing datasets demonstrates the spatial and temporal consistency of our regional data time-series. The dataset reliably reflects changes in tree cover (tree cover loss user\'s accuracy of 0.84 and producer\'s accuracy of 0.75) and can serve as a tool to map annual forest extent (user\'s accuracy of 0.98 and producer\'s accuracy of 0.81 for 10% canopy cover threshold to define the forest class). The tree height estimates are consistent with a GLAS-based global map (mean average error of 3.7 m, the correlation coefficient of 0.92 and the R-2 of 0.85). The algorithm was prototyped within the Lower Mekong region where it revealed an intensive woody vegetation dynamic. Of the year 2000 forest area (defined using canopy cover threshold of 10% and tree height threshold of 5 m), 9.4% was deforested by the year 2017, and 16.6% was affected by stand-replacement disturbance followed by reforestation. The average annual area of stand-level forest disturbance within the region was 2.34 Mha, and increased by 34% from 2001 (1.85 Mha) to 2017 (2.48 Mha). Total forest area decreased by 6.2% within the region, and 11.1% of year 2000 primary forest area was lost by 2017. At the national level, Cambodia demonstrated the highest rate of deforestation, with a net forest area loss of 22.5%. We estimated that 21.3% of 2017 forest cover had an age of 17 years or less, illustrating the intensive forest land uses within the region.

The heavy loads of smoke particles emitted in the atmosphere reached the Iberian Peninsula (IP) a few days later on 7 and 8 September. Satellite imagery allows to identify two main smoke clouds emitted during two different periods that were injected and transported in the atmosphere at several altitude levels. Columnar properties on 7 and 8 September at two Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) mid-altitude, background sites in northern and southern Spain are: aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 440 nm up to 0.62, angstrom ngstrom exponent of 1.6-1.7, large dominance of small particles (fine mode fraction > 0.88), low absorption AOD at 440 nm (< 0.008) and large single scattering albedo at 440 nm (> 0.98). Profiles from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) show the presence of smoke particles in the stratosphere during the transport, whereas the smoke is only observed in the troposphere at its arrival over the IP. Portuguese and Spanish ground lidar stations from the European Aerosol Research Lidar Network/Aerosols, Clouds, and Trace gases Research InfraStructure Network (EARLINET/ACTRIS) and the Micro-Pulse Lidar NETwork (MPLNET) reveal smoke plumes with different properties: particle depolarization ratio and color ratio, respectively, of 0.05 and 2.5 in the mid troposphere (5-9 km) and of 0.10 and 3.0 in the upper troposphere (10-13 km). In the mid troposphere the particle depolarization ratio does not seem time-dependent during the transport whereas the color ratio seems to increase (larger particles sediment first). To analyze the horizontal and vertical transport of the smoke from its origin to the IP, particle dispersion modelling is performed with the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model (HYSPLIT) parameterized with satellite-derived biomass burning emission estimates from the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). Three compounds are simulated: carbon monoxide, black carbon and organic carbon. The results show that the first smoke plume which travels slowly reaches rapidly (similar to 1 day) the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) but also shows evidence of large scale horizontal dispersion, while the second plume, entrained by strong subtropical jets, reaches the upper troposphere much slower (similar to 2.5 days). Observations and dispersion modelling all together suggest that particle depolarization properties are enhanced during their vertical transport from the mid to the upper troposphere.', '[Sicard, M.; Granados-Munoz, M.

Spectroscopic methods often rely on statistical approaches to reduce data redundancy and enhance useful prediction of physiological traits. Given the mechanistic uncertainty of spectroscopic techniques, genetic modification of plant biochemical pathways may affect reflectance spectra causing predictive models to lose power. The objectives of this research were to assess over two separate years, whether a predictive model can represent natural and imposed variation in leaf photosynthetic potential for different crop cultivars and genetically modified plants, to assess the interannual capabilities of a partial least square regression (PLSR) model, and to determine whether leaf N is a dominant driver of photosynthesis in PLSR models. In 2016, a PLSR analysis of reflectance spectra coupled with gas exchange data was used to build predictive models for photosynthetic parameters including maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco (V-c,V-max), maximum electron transport rate (J(max)) and percentage leaf nitrogen ([N]). The model was developed for wild type and genetically modified plants that represent a wide range of photosynthetic capacities. Results show that hyperspectral reflectance accurately predicted V-c,V-max,V- J(max) and [N] for all plants measured in 2016. Applying these PLSR models to plants grown in 2017 resulted in a strong predictive ability relative to gas exchange measurements for V-c,V-max but not for J(max,) and not for genotypes unique to 2017. Building a new model including data collected in 2017 resulted in more robust predictions, with R-2 increases of 17% for V-c,V-max. and 13% Plants generally have a positive correlation between leaf nitrogen and photosynthesis, however, tobacco with reduced Rubisco (SSuD) had significantly higher [N] despite much lower V-c,V-max. The PLSR model was able to accurately predict both V-c,V-max lower and higher leaf [N] for this genotype suggesting that the spectral based estimates of V-c,V-max and leaf nitrogen [N] are independent. These results suggest that the PLSR model can be applied across years, but only to genotypes used to build the model and that the actual mechanism measured with the PLSR technique is not directly related to leaf [N]. The success of the leaf-scale analysis suggests that similar approaches may be successful at the canopy and ecosystem scales but to use these methods across years and between genotypes at any scale, application of accurately populated physical based models based on radiative transfer principles may be required.', '[Meacham-Hensold, Katherine; Montes, Christopher M.; Ainsworth, Elizabeth A.; Bernacchi, Carl J.] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL USA.

Processing steps include (1) atmospheric correction and masking of MSI and OLI imagery, and (2) generating scene-based water clarity maps in terms of Secchi depth (SD). We adopted ocean-color based atmospheric correction theory for MSI and OLI sensors modified with associated scene-specific metadata and auxiliary datasets available in GEE to generate uniform remote sensing reflectances (R-rs) products over optically variable freshwater lake surfaces. MSI-R-rs products derived from the atmospheric correction were used as input predictors in a bootstrap forest to determine significant band combinations to predict water clarity.

Our work aimed to investigate the potential of remote sensing to provide new insights into plant photosynthesis at a fine spatial resolution. This goal was achieved by exploiting high-resolution images acquired with the FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) airborne demonstrator HyPlant. The sensor was flown over a mixed forest, and the images collected were elaborated to obtain two independent indicators of plant photosynthesis. First, maps of sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F), a novel indicator of plant photosynthetic activity, were successfully obtained at both the red and far-red peaks (r(2) = 0.89 and p < 0.01, r(2) = 0.77 and p < 0.01, respectively, compared to top-of-canopy ground-based measurements acquired synchronously with the overflight) over the forested study area. Second, maps of GPP and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) were derived using a customised version of the coupled biophysical model Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS). The model was driven with airborne-derived maps of key forest traits (i.e., leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and leaf area index (LAI)) and meteorological data providing a high-resolution snapshot of the variables of interest across the study site. The LCC and LAI were accurately estimated (RMSE = 5.66 mu g cm(-2) and RMSE = 0.51 m(2)m(-2), respectively) through an optimised Look-Up-Table-based inversion of the PROSPECT-4-INFORM radiative transfer model, ensuring the accurate representation of the spatial variation of these determinants of the ecosystem\'s functionality. The spatial relationships between the measured F and modelled BESS outputs were then analysed to interpret the variability of ecosystem functioning at a regional scale. The results showed that far-red F is significantly correlated with the GPP (r(2) = 0.46, p < 0.001) and APAR (r(2) = 0.43, p < 0.001) in the spatial domain and that this relationship is nonlinear. Conversely, no statistically significant relationships were found between the red F and the GPP or APAR (p > 0.05). The spatial relationships found at high resolution provide valuable insight into the critical role of spatial heterogeneity in controlling the relationship between the far-red F and the GPP, indicating the need to consider this heterogeneity at a coarser resolution.', '[Tagliabue, Giulia; Panigada, Cinzia; Cogliati, Sergio; Colombo, Roberto; Rossini, Micol] Univ Milano Bicocca, Remote Sensing Environm Dynam Lab, Milan, Italy.

However, it is relatively difficult to obtain the true value of a pixel due to the scale mismatch between in situ measurements and satellite-based observations, especially for commonly heterogeneous and nonisothermal land areas, which greatly increases the difficulty in estimating pixel-representative LST values from in situ measurements for validation of satellite-based LST products. In this study, a supplemented radiance-based (SR-based) validation method was developed to evaluate the latest moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 Level 2 daily LST/land surface emissivity (LSE) products over a heterogeneous and nonisothermal region of the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) project, West China. In the SR-based framework, pixel-representative LST values are simulated by the MODTRAN model from the corresponding in situ measurements, such as LSE and atmospheric profile measurements, to evaluate the MODIS LST products. The validation results show that the MODIS daytime LST products from the Aqua satellite (MYD11_L2) have a greater accuracy than those from the Terra satellite (MOD11_L2). Analyses of the effect factors indicate a strong correlation between the errors in the MOD11_L2 LST product and the corresponding difference in the MODIS brightness temperature between bands 31 and 32. Although the requirement of synchronous or quasisynchronous in situ measurements for the validated LST products may limit the applicability of the SR-based method, it is still an effective and simple method for validating satellite-derived LST products over mixed pixels.

The extremely intermittent rainfall strongly hinders the economic growth of this region. The freshwater primarily comes from the desalination of seawater along with other resources such as groundwater in the UAE region. Nevertheless, the declining groundwater reserves and expensive desalination approach have made to search for alternative sources for rain enhancement and one such approach is through the cloud seeding. However, there are barely few studies concentrated on the occurrence frequency of clouds and seasonal variability including their natural microphysics and dynamics that is crucial for precipitation augmentation through cloud seeding. Hence, the present study uses two geostationary satellites, namely, Meteosat-8 and Meteosat-10, due to their higher spatiotemporal observations in this region. The two geostationary satellites scan the UAE and adjoining regions in different view angles due to their positioning in different longitudes. Therefore, the Meteosat-8 has more advantage than Meteosat-10 in terms of the biases associated with the angular view and spatial resolution over the UAE and adjoining regions. Hence, the present study also evaluates the biases related to cloud occurrence due to different view angles.   The winter (February March) and summer (June August) seasons indicate the frequent occurrence of clouds with distinct spatial distribution in these arid/semi-arid areas. The Arabian Gulf shows a higher percentage of clouds during winter while frequent convective clouds are noticed during summer over the Al Hajar Mountains. The evaluation of liquid and ice clouds also indicates that the warm cloud percentage is higher over the mountainous regions. However, the ice cloud distribution is higher over the Arabian Gulf during winter while they are highly confined along the Al Hajar Mountains in summer. The evaluation of cloud cover from Meteosat-10 and Meteosat-8 indicates the former shows higher occurrence percentage than the later. The significant biases are noted in warm cloud occurrence along the-mountainous regions from both the satellites. The fractional occurrence of rain is also estimated for different seasons based cloud liquid water path that provides key information to the seedable convective clouds.

Globally, evaporation losses from reservoirs are estimated to be greater than the combined consumption from industrial and domestic water uses. However, this large volume of water loss is only coarsely considered in modern water resources management practices due to the complexities involved with quantifying these losses. By fusing remote sensing and modeling approaches, this study developed a novel method to accurately estimate the evaporation losses from 721 reservoirs in the contiguous United States (CONUS). Reservoir surface areas were extracted and enhanced from the Landsat based Global Surface Water Dataset (GSWD) from March 1984 to October 2015. The evaporation rate was modeled using the Penman Equation in which the lake heat storage term was considered. Validation results using in situ observations suggest that this approach can significantly improve the accuracy of the simulated monthly reservoir evaporation rate. The evaporation losses were subsequently estimated as the product of the surface area and evaporation rate. This paper presents a first of its kind, comprehensively validated, locally practical, and continentally consistent reservoir evaporation dataset. The results suggest that the long term averaged annual evaporation volume from these 721 reservoirs is 33.73 x 10(9) m(3), which is equivalent to 93% of the annual public water supply of the United States (in 2010). An increasing trend of the evaporation rate (0.0076 mm/d/year) and a slightly decreasing trend of the total surface area (-0.011 x 10(9) m(2)/year) were both detected during the study period. As a result, the total evaporation shows an insignificant trend, yet with significant spatial heterogeneity. This new reservoir evaporation dataset can help facilitate more efficient water management practices.', '[Zhao, Gang; Gao, Huilin] Texas A&M Univ, Zachry Dept Civil Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.', 'Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College StationRP Gao, HL (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Zachry Dept Civil Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.', 'hgao@civil.tamu.eduRI Zhao, Gang/H-9030-2019', 'Zhao, Gang/0000-0003-2737-0530', 'NASA Science of Terra, Aqua, and Suomi NPP (TASNPP) Program   [80NSSC18K0939]; Earth and Space Science Fellowship (NESSF) Program   [80NSSC17K0358]; U.S. Department of Energy Water Power Technologies   Office as a part of the SECURE Water Act Section 9505 Assessment', 'This research was supported by the NASA Science of Terra, Aqua, and   Suomi NPP (TASNPP) Program (80NSSC18K0939), and the Earth and Space   Science Fellowship (NESSF) Program (80NSSC17K0358).

This effect is frequently due to mixed land and water thermal pixels. In the case of the Landsat images, radiance mixing can also affect pure water pixels due the cubic convolution resampling of the native thermal measurements. Some authors recommended a general-purpose margin of two thermal pixels to the banks or a minimum river width of three pixels, to avoid near bank effects in water temperature retrievals. Given the relatively course spatial resolution of satellite thermal sensors, the three pixel margin severely restricts their application to temperature mapping in many rivers. This study proposes a new algorithm to enhance the retrieval of stream surface temperature using Landsat 8 thermal data, although it is also applicable to Landsat 7 and Landsat 5. The aim is not to perform a subpixel radiance unmixing but to refine the selection of unmixed, reliable pixels for temperature mapping. For this purpose, the spatial arrangement of native Landsat thermal pixels is approximated, and pure water pixels in the downscaled thermal band are selected accordingly. The least-favourable cubic convolution near-bank radiance mixing is simulated on image basis. Only pure thermal water pixels unaffected by the simulated worst case resampling are selected. The algorithm allowed retrieving water surface temperature in reaches down to 120 m wide, clearly improving the existing three pixel, i.e. 300 m for Landsat 8, recommendation. The enhancing algorithm was applied to a reach in the Ebro River reach, Spain. It provided spatially distributed temperatures in narrow parts, upstream and downstream of a wide reservoir, offering new insight of the overall impact of the reservoir over the river thermal regime.', '[Marti-Cardona, Belen] Univ Surrey, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 29AA03, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England.

However, these TIR measurements have largely been restricted to laboratory leaf level or coarse spatial resolutions due to the lack of suitable data from airborne and spaceborne instruments. The airborne Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES) provides an opportunity to retrieve high spectral resolution emissivity and land surface temperature (LST) that can be exploited for canopy level vegetation research. This study is a high spatial resolution analysis of plant species\' emissivity and LST using HyTES imagery acquired in the Huntington Botanical Gardens on 2014 July 5 and 2016 Jan 25. Leaf and canopy emissivity variation was identified among 24 plant species and used to determine leaf to canopy scaling capabilities. HyTES LST patterns among species and dates were quantified and correlated to LiDAR derived tree canopy attributes. At the leaf scale, one third of the species showed distinct spectral separation from other species. However, at the canopy scale most species were not spectrally separable. Random forest classification demonstrates the high level of confusion between species with overall accuracies < 40%. LST data, derived from TIR measurements, showed that species exhibited significantly different distributions between dates and species. These distributions were largely explained by canopy structure (e.g. tree height and canopy density) and composition of neighboring pixels (e.g. presence of pavement versus trees). While species do not exhibit unique emissivity signatures at the canopy level, the LST variation among species provides a stronger understanding of LST variability in coarser resolution TIR imagery. This study represents the analysis of vegetation characteristics using the NASA\'s HyTES TIR sensor, opening the door for future remote sensing vegetation studies that include using the recently launched ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission.', '[Meerdink, Susan; Gader, Paul] Univ Florida, Civil & Coastal Engn Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.

However, accurate data on when and where low-intensity tillage methods are being used remain scarce, and this scarcity impedes understanding of the factors affecting the adoption and the agronomic or environmental impacts of these practices. In this study, we used composites of satellite imagery from Landsat 5, 7, and 8, and Sentinel-1 in combination with producer data from about 5900 georeferenced fields to train a random forest classifier and generate annual large-scale maps of tillage intensity from 2005 to 2016. We tested different combinations of hyper-parameters using cross-validation, splitting the training and testing data alternatively by field, year, and state to assess the influence of clustering on validation results and evaluate the generalizability of the classification model. We found that the best model was able to map tillage practices across the entire North Central US region at 30 m-resolution with accuracies spanning between 75% and 79%, depending on the validation approach. We also found that although Sentinel-1 provides an independent measure that should be sensitive to surface moisture and roughness, it currently adds relatively little to classification performance beyond what is possible with Landsat. When aggregated to the state level, the satellite estimates of percentage low- and high-intensity tillage agreed well with a USDA survey on tillage practices in 2006 (R-2 = 0.55). The satellite data also revealed clear increases in low-intensity tillage area for most counties in the past decade.

Of the 50 examined lakes, half demonstrated decreasing or increasing Z(sd) trends, and the number of lakes exhibiting significantly decreasing trends also comparable to the number exhibiting increasing trends. The relative contributions of the seven potential driving factors (from both human activities and natural processes) to the interannual changes in water clarity were quantified for each lake using a multiple general linear model regression analysis. The responses of Z(sd) to these drivers showed considerable differences among lakes, and human activities demonstrated significant roles in more lakes than those affected by natural variability, accounting for 50% (25/50) and 20% (10/50) of the lakes, respectively.

Although recent studies show that F is linearly related to gross primary production (GPP) on coarse spatial and temporal scales, it is argued that this relationship may be mainly driven by seasonal changes in absorbed photochemical active radiation (APAR) and less by the plant light use efficiency (LUE).   In this work a high-resolution spectrometer was used to continuously measure red and far-red fluorescence and different reflectance indices within a sugar beet field during the growing season in 2015. Diurnal and seasonal developments were compared to eddy covariance derived GPP.   Additionally, part of the time series coincided with a heatwave. The induced drought stress allowed us to observe F and its relationship to GPP under changing environmental conditions during the seasonal cycle.   Across the season a strong linear relationship between GPP and F750 was found. This relationship however, was mainly driven by changes in APAR and was strongly reduced under drought conditions. We could show that far-red fluorescence yield can explain 59% of the diurnal and 79% of the seasonal variance in the light use efficiency. However, an even stronger relationship between FY760 and the structural vegetation index MTVI2 was found, implying that FY760 is affected by seasonal structural changes of the canopy.

Because of their global dominance, and potential expansion or loss, methods to estimate biomass and carbon in agricultural areas are necessary for monitoring global terrestrial carbon stocks and predicting carbon dynamics. Agricultural areas in the tropics have substantial tree cover and associated above ground biomass (AGB) and carbon. Active remote sensing data, such as airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging), can provide accurate estimates of biomass stocks, but common plot-based methods may not be suitable for agricultural areas with dispersed and heterogeneous tree cover. The objectives of this research are to quantify AGB of a tropical agricultural landscape using a tree-based method that directly incorporates the size of individual trees, and to understand how landscape estimates of AGB from a tree-based method compare to estimates from a plot-based method. We use high-resolution (1.12 m) airborne LiDAR data collected on a 9280-ha region of the Azuero Peninsula of Panama. We model individual tree AGB with canopy dimensions from the LiDAR data. We apply the model to individual tree crown polygons and aggregate AGB estimates to compare with previously developed plot-based estimates. We find that agricultural trees are a distinct and dominant part of our study site. The tree-based approach estimates greater AGB in pixels with low forest cover than the plot-based approach, resulting a 2-fold difference in landscape AGB estimates between the methods for non-forested areas. Additionally, one third of the total landscape AGB exists in areas having < 10% cover, based on a global tree cover product. Our study supports the continued use and development of allometric models to predict individual tree biomass from LiDAR-derived canopy dimensions and demonstrates the potential for spatial information from high-resolution data, such as relative isolation of canopies, to improve allometric models.', '[Graves, Sarah J.; Caughlin, T.

This study presents the first investigation of the impact of vegetation canopy structure (percentage canopy cover and leaf area index, LAI) on FRP retrievals, based on 3D radiative transfer model simulations. The Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model is used to simulate above-canopy observations made through 3D vegetation canopies with different structural arrangements, under which a centrally positioned uniform landscape fire is burning. The vegetation canopy is modelled in two ways, as an opaque structure and as a hybrid turbid medium. The percentage canopy cover in each simulated scene is varied between 5 and 95%, and the FRP retrieved above the canopy is found to decrease in proportion to percentage canopy cover when the canopy is opaque, a finding that is in agreement with a series of small scale outdoor measurements conducted to evaluate the realism of the simulations. However, when the canopy is modelled as a turbid medium, which is in some ways a more realistic representation of a real \'gappy\' vegetation canopy, the degree of FRP interception occurring at any particular canopy cover decreases by similar to 14%, due to some fire emitted thermal energy being transmitted through the canopy gaps. The simulations also reveal the impact of canopy LAI on above-canopy FRP retrievals, reducing these by 6% when both canopy cover and LAI are low (5% and < 1.0 respectively), but by up to 92% when canopy cover and scene LAI are high (95% and similar to 8 respectively). We use the derived relationships between FRP interception and canopy structure, along with MODIS LAI and percentage tree cover data, to adjust 2004-2012 fire radiative energy (FRE) estimates calculated from FRP data collected by the geostationary Meteosat Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) instrument. The adjusted annual FRE is on average 15% greater than estimated, and is characterized by low inter-annual variability as result of the majority of fire activity occurring in areas where percentage tree cover remains below 40%. Landscape burning occurs more frequently in areas of higher tree cover in southern hemisphere rather than northern hemisphere Africa, leading to a larger annual FRE adjustment (18.5% compared to 16.3%). This study illustrates the impact that canopy interception has on FRP for the first time at the satellite scale, and over Africa demonstrates a large but temporally consistent underestimation which can be accounted for using LAI and percentage tree cover metrics when estimating fuel consumption and atmospheric emissions from the FRP retrievals.', '[Roberts, G.] Univ Southampton, Geog & Environm, Southampton, Hants, England.

The fundamental mechanism for the semi-empirical model is the interactions between sea surface waves and the radar microwave. Sea surface waves are generated by ocean surface winds and may be modulated by precipitation or oceanic processes, such as surface currents, internal waves (IWs), and surfactants (e.g. oil spill, and sea ice). Model results for normalized radar cross sections (NRCSs) induced by ocean winds are validated against a database we developed. The ocean wind vectors were observed by in situ buoys of the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC); the RCM NRCSs are obtained from a \"CP simulator\", using composites of RADARSAT-2 quad-pol SAR images. We simulate the dependencies of the NRCSs on wind speeds and incidence angles, for up-wind (wind direction is 0 degrees) and cross-wind (wind direction is 90 degrees) conditions. And we report the potential abilities and limitations of ocean winds monitoring using the RCM CP mode, as well as suggest that the RV-pol should be suitable for hurricane monitoring in the future. As hurricanes containing high winds are generally associated with heavy rain conditions, we discuss the possible mechanisms for precipitation effects related to the RV- and RH-polarizations by simulating two effects on the ocean surface waves. Moreover, we suggest that the RCM CP mode is better able to monitor the ocean surface currents than the fully polarimetry SAR systems (e.g. RADARSAT-2), because of the associated large swath and the possible continuous images of three RCM satellites.', '[Zhang, Guosheng; Zhang, Biao] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

A new satellite mission concept called SEASTAR aims to do just that. The concept is a Ku-band along-track interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system with two squinted beams pointing +/- 45 degrees from broadside and incidence angles around 30 degrees. The paper presents an inversion strategy to retrieve simultaneously ocean surface current and wind vectors and reports on the performance obtained with different wind/current conditions and instrument configurations. Results are based on numerical simulations using a Bayesian approach and existing geophysical model functions (GMFs) of the microwave Normalized Radar Cross Section (NRCS) and Doppler shift.   Using the baseline two-look instrument configuration and realistic instrument noise figures (radiometric resolution: k(p) = 5 and 12%; Delta df = 2 and 5 Hz), the root-mean square errors (RMSE) of the retrieved current and wind vectors are typically better than [0.1 m/s, 10 degrees] for current and [0.5 m/s, 5 degrees] for wind. This inversion setup yields four ambiguous solutions within a current range of similar to 1 m/s. The addition of dual polarization (VV, HH) capability helps to discriminate these ambiguities. The retrieval performance depends weakly on geophysical parameters such as wind speed, current velocity or current direction, but is sensitive to wind direction because of its strong effect on current retrieval through the wind-wave induced artifact surface velocity (WASV). Larger retrieval errors are obtained when the wind is aligned with one of the antenna line-of-sight (LoS) directions, although errors remain typically below [0.2 m/s, 25 degrees] for current and [0.5 m/s, 15 degrees] for wind. Improving the retrieval performance regardless of wind direction could be achieved either with lower noise figures sigma(0), or with higher incidence angles, or by including an additional third-look direction in azimuth (e.g. to achieve a configuration similar to Metop/ASCAT scatterometers) as per the SEASTAR mission concept submitted to EE10.', '[Martin, Adrien C.

Downscaling techniques commonly used with satellite-derived rainfall data build statistical regression relationships between the precipitation and land surface characteristics to obtain rainfall estimates with improved spatial resolution. However, these relationships tend to be extended mistakenly from the regional scale to the hill slope scale. This paper introduces a quadratic parabolic profile (QPP) model for downscaling precipitation. The proposed technique uses a quadratic parabolic equation to express the rule for changes of precipitation with elevation. It is assumed that precipitation is the primary factor restricting vegetation growth during the growing season. Therefore, an ordinary least square regression method is used to fit an \"elevation-normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)\" function to determine the parameters of the QPP model. This method was implemented in the Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR) during the growing seasons of 2009-2013 for both monthly and total precipitation. The results indicated that the precipitation estimates downscaled using the QPP method had higher accuracies than those of commonly used exponential regression, multiple linear regression, and geographically weighted regression models. The average root mean square errors (RMSEs) and mean absolute percent errors (MAPEs) of total precipitation during the growing season of the commonly used models were 17%-69% and 17%-92% higher, respectively, than those of the QPP model. Meanwhile, the precipitation downscaled using the QPP technique also had lower MAPEs and RMSEs than the PERSIANN-CCS, PERSIANN-CDR, GSMaP-RNL, and GSMaP-RNLG products. Downscaled precipitation estimates from the QPP model exhibited patterns with elevation that were more detailed and more reliable than from the commonly used downscaling methods and another four satellite products. In addition, the QPP model is insensitive to errors in the NDVI or elevation. These findings suggest the proposed approach could be implemented successfully to downscale both monthly and total precipitation of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 product throughout the growing season in the TRHR.', '[Zhang, Tao; Li, Baolin; Yuan, Yecheng; Gao, Xizhang; Sun, Qingling; Jiang, Yuhao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Room 1308,Datun Rd 11A, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

In this context, realistic synthetic datasets present an interesting alternative to costly and limited field data. Here, we present a new approach to simulate realistic canopy height and cover type data by combining an individual-tree forest simulator with real LiDAR point clouds of individual trees.   We demonstrate the utility of our approach by re-examining the influence of field plot size on the predictive power of remote-sensing models for biomass estimation. Our approach with a complete (wall-to-wall) field reference dataset and matching synthetic remote sensing data allowed us to not only perform internal cross-validations with field plots that were used to fit the model (as in studies with real data), but to also consider the quality of model predictions to a standardized spatial grid or to the entire region.   Our results confirm earlier reports of smaller predictive errors with increased field plot sizes under internal model validation (RMSE of 125 t/ha at 10 m field plot size and RMSE of 40 t/ha for 50 m field plots). However, we show that this is mainly an artifact of comparing the models with the same data they were fit, thus with validation data of different scales. When validating on a grid with standardized scale, smaller field plots performed almost equally well as larger field plots (small RMSE decrease between 4 t/ha and 7 t/ha when going from 10 m to 50 m plots), and even outperformed them if we assumed that increasing the plot size means that fewer field plots can be obtained (small RMSE increase between 9 t/ha and 12 t/ha when going from 10 m to 50 m plots).   We conclude that synthetic remote sensing datasets are a useful tool for method testing. The suggested approach may be used to reexamine our current methodological understanding, which is often based on tests with real data of very limited sizes, as well as to optimize workflows, model choices and data collection. A wider use of synthetic data could be instrumental in improving remote sensing methodology.', '[Fassnacht, Fabian Ewald] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Geog & Geoecol, Kaiserstr 12, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.

In this study, we address this limitation by exploring two approaches for generating an 8-day series of Landsat resolution (30 m) SW maps for three floodplain sites in south-eastern Australia during the 2010 La Nina Floods. Firstly, we applied a generalized additive regression model (GAM) that empirically relates Landsat-based SW extent to in-situ river flow to then predict additional time steps. Secondly, we used the STARFM and ESTARFM blending algorithms for predicting the Open Water Likelihood at 8-daily intervals and 30 m resolution from Landsat and MODIS imagery. ESTARFM outperformed STARFM and best blending accuracies were achieved in the floodplain site with the slowest changes in inundation extent through time. There was good agreement between the blended and statistically-modeled 8-day SW series and both series provided new and temporally consistent information about changes in inundation extent throughout the flooding cycles. After careful consideration of accuracy limitations and model assumptions, these SW records hold great potential for assimilation into hydrodynamic and hydrological models as well as improved management of terrestrial freshwater ecosystems.', '[Heimhuber, V.; Tulbure, M.

Consequently, the CI is very useful for ecological and meteorological models. One method used to retrieve the CIs of plant canopies is to construct a linear relationship between the CI and the normalized difference between hotspot and dark spot (NDHD) angular index. This method requires a particularly accurate reconstruction of hotspot signatures, which are difficult to measure. In this study, we propose a framework to retrieve CIs from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) parameters, which are generally based on linear CI-NDHD equations. The main algorithm is designed to retrieve CIs in the closed interval [0.33, 1.00]. This range is derived from the CI-NDHD equations and is thus called as the physical range here, although a modified lower boundary can be implemented in the future if necessary. If CIs are outside of this range, then a backup algorithm is designed to reprocess these so-called outlier CIs. The hotspot-adjusted version of the RossThick-LiSparseReciprocal (RTLSR) model (i.e., the RTCLSR model) is employed to reconstruct the hotspot signatures for the MODIS BRDF parameters. This method simplifies the hotspot reconstruction by using two hotspot parameters that are not distinctly scale-dependent particularly in the context of an inhomogeneous coarse spatial resolution. To evaluate this algorithm framework, we collect dozens of global field-measured CIs and calculate their determination coefficient (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE) and bias relative to MODIS CIs derived using both the main algorithm and the backup algorithm. Our results show that this framework can derive MODIS CIs with a high accuracy (i.e., R-2 = 0.80 (0.72), RMSE = 0.07 (0.12), bias = -0.03 (-0.10)) using the main (backup) algorithms and that it shows promise for various ecological applications, especially in combination with the leaf area index (LAI).', '[Jiao, Ziti; Dong, Yadong; Ding, Anxin; Zhang, Xiaoning] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Coll Remote Sensing & Engn, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

This study aims to understand the robustness and sensitivity of the DSI in East Asia, and we investigate the performance of the annual DSI using different Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets. Additionally, the MODIS-based DSI is compared to other drought indices, including the DSI with Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI (DSIAviiRR) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) with the Climate Research Unit (CRU) dataset. Three different drought indices are estimated in East Asia from 2000 to 2013 and compared via a correlation analysis based on a 5 degrees x 5 degrees grid. Specifically, the correlation between the DSI and DSIAvHRR is relatively high (0.796), which suggests the potential use of the DSI based on combined products that include parameters such as the NDVI, although the DSI originally used only MODIS-based products. Characteristics such as the frequency and spatial extent of droughts based on the DSI are compared to those based on the SPEI using the drought classification schemes that were originally proposed for the SPEI and DSI, including mild, moderate, severe and extremely dry classes. Based on the results, we suggest a revised classification according to a comparison of the DSI and SPEI. The frequency and spatial extent results of the SPEI and DSI exhibit good agreement when using this classification. Moreover, the DSI from the revised classification is used to evaluate drought events in East Asia in 2003, 2006, 2008 and 2009.

In this paper, we aim to determine the potential factors that influence changes in thickness of debris-covered glaciers. First, we present the thickness changes of a large debris-covered glacier in the Tienshan Mountain using high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data from three periods in 2000, 2009 and 2013. It is shown that the thickness changes differ greatly over the debris-covered portions of the glacier. These debris-covered regions can be divided into three parts along the glacier axis according to the rate of thickness change. Specifically, these parts include the zone of minimal change, the zone of heavy thinning, and the zone of slight thinning. Detailed information on the closely related factors, including the debris thickness, which was measured across the whole glacier during our field work, and the presence of ice cliffs and supraglacial lakes detected on high-resolution satellite images, are combined to determine the reasons for the differences in melting state among the three zones. The results show that the thickness changes of the debris-covered glacier are jointly influenced by debris thickness and the presence of ice cliffs and supraglacial lakes; moreover, the dominant factor differs among the different zones. The critical debris thickness, which mostly appears in the minimal change zone and accelerates glacier melting, as confirmed through field observations, is not associated with glacier thinning because its location is close to the accumulation zone. The regions where the rates of thinning are greatest coincide with the regions where the ice cliffs are densest.

Reliable estimation of shortwave radiation throughout the globe is particularly important for an in-depth understanding of global changes. Unfortunately, a large number of existing space-based algorithms ignore the effects of topography by simply assuming that the surface is ideally flat. As pointed out by many studies, such neglect toward topographic effects leads to significant errors in derived radiation. This study proposes a shortwave topographic radiation model (SWTRM) by quantifying solar direct radiation shielding, occlusion of sky radiation, reflected radiation from nearby terrain, and invisibility of certain targets. To drive the SWTRM, an artificial neural network (ANN) approach was employed to generate multiple components of the shortwave radiation budget. The new model was run over the Tibetan Plateau region and used MODIS products coupled with digital elevation data (DEM). Topographically corrected shortwave fluxes were derived by coupling SWTRM and ANN outputs. The results show that: (1) the proposed SWTRM works well over mountainous regions; (2) the ANN-based shortwave model provides reasonable retrieval accuracy (RMSE < 60 W/m(2), bias < 13 W/m(2) for all shortwave radiation components). More importantly, the ANN model can simultaneously provide all radiation components that are indispensable for driving the SWTRM; (3) over mountainous areas, the induced error can exceed 600 W/m(2) for shortwave net flux. Hence, topographic effects cannot be neglected; and (4) topography and solar illumination angle are key modulators in deriving shortwave radiation from space, which control the magnitude and spatial distribution of shortwave radiation over mountainous regions.', '[Wang, Tianxing; Yan, Guangjian; Mu, Xihan; Jiao, Zhonghu; Chu, Qing] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

Here we investigated classifier performance under different sample sizes, reference class distribution, and scene complexities. Twenty six 10 km x 10 km blocks with complete reference information across the continental US are used. Per-pixel classification took place using six spectral bands from Landsat imagery. The tested classifiers included Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Bootstrap-aggregation ensemble of decision trees (BagTE), artificial neural network up to 2 hidden layers, and deep neural network (DNN) up to 3 hidden layers. For the entire block, our accuracy assessment indicated that all classifiers, with the exception of NB (a Maximum Likelihood variant), performed similarly. However, when we concentrated on edge pixels (pixels at the border of adjacent land cover classes), it was clear that the SVM and KNN offer considerable accuracy advantages, especially for larger reference datasets. Because of their relatively low execution times SVM and KNN would be recommended for classifications using Landsat\'s spectral inputs and Anderson\'s 11-level classification scheme. However, both SVM and KNN demonstrated substantial accuracy degradation during the parameter grid search. For this reason, an exhaustive parameter optimization process is suggested. While the ANN and DNN neural network variants did not perform as well, their performance may have been restricted by the lack of rich contextual information in our simple six band per-pixel input space. The effect of class distribution in the training dataset was also evident on the calculated accuracy metric. Gradual accuracy degradation as edge pixel presence increased was also observed.

Remotely sensed data have been long used to map urban extent and infrastructure at various spatial and spectral resolutions. Although many datasets and approaches have been tried, there is not yet a universal way to map urban extents across the world. Here we combined a microwave scatterometer (QuikSCAT) dataset at similar to 1 km posting with percent impervious surface area (%ISA) data from the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) that was generated from Landsat data, and ambient population data from the LandScan product to characterize and quantify growth in nine major urban areas in the US Great Plains from 2000 to 2009. Nonparametric Mann-Kendall trend tests on backscatter time series from urban areas show significant expanding trends in eight of nine urban areas with p-values ranging 0.032 to 0.001. The sole exception is Houston, which has a substantial non-urban backscatter at the northeastern edge of the urban core. Strong power law scaling relationships between ambient population and either urban area or backscatter power (r(2) of 0.96 in either model) with sub-linear exponents (beta of 0.911 and 0.866, respectively) indicate urban areas become more compact with more vertical built-up structure than lateral expansion to accommodate the increased population. Increases in backscatter and %ISA datasets between 2001 and 2006 show agreement in both magnitude and direction for all urban areas except Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP), likely due to the presence of many lakes and ponds throughout the MSP metropolitan area.

Data from several satellites providing moderate image resolution are freely available (e.g. Sentinel-2). In addition, very-high-resolution three-dimensional data are available due to the advent of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The increasing availability of auxiliary data offers new opportunities for largescale forest surveys using UAVs. A recently developed hierarchical model-based mode of inference makes it possible to use hierarchically nested auxiliary data in estimating population properties, such as total or mean biomass or volume, and their corresponding uncertainties in a statistically appropriate manner. In this study, hierarchical model-based inference was used to estimate growing stock volume (GSV; m(3) ha(-1)) and its variance using a small sample of field data, a larger sample of UAV data, and wall-to-wall Sentinel-2 data in a study area in SE Norway. The main objective of the study was to compare the performance, in terms of precision, of hierarchical model-based inference (denoted Case C) against two alternative cases. These were (1) model-based inference based on field data and wall-to-wall data, collected either with airborne laser scanning (Case A.1) or Sentinel-2 data (Case A.2), and (2) hybrid inference using a small sample of field data and a larger sample of UAV data (Case B). A second objective was to assess the possibility of reducing the UAV sampling intensity when adopting Case C rather than 13, without decreasing the precision of the GSV estimates. The results, calculated as standard error as percentage of the mean ((SE) over cap (%)), indicated that in case C the precision was of similar magnitude ((SE) over cap (%) = 3.44%) as for Case A.1 ((SE) over cap (%) = 3.69%) and for Case B ((SE) over cap (%) = 3.58%). The standard error of Case A.2 was nearly twice as large ((SE) over cap (%) = 5.81%) as the rest of the cases. The results also indicated possibilities of reducing the UAV sampling intensity without losing precision in cases where wall-to-wall Sentinel-2 data are available (Case C). The same precision for Case C with only five UAV samples was achieved as for Case B with 55 UAV samples. Thus, the study highlights the cost-efficiency of applications of UAV as in Case C and also provides first insights in the use of Sentinel-2 data for GSV estimation in boreal conditions.', '[Puliti, Stefano; Gobakken, Terje; Naesset, Erik] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, NMBU, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway.

This paper presents an efficient and reliable method that uses multi-source geospatial big data, including nighttime light imagery and social media check-in maps, to locate the main center and sub-centers of a polycentric city. Unlike traditional methods that rely on statistical data categorized by administrative units, the proposed method can effectively identify the boundaries of urban centers, and the data source guarantees a timely monitoring and update. Four main procedures are involved: 1) a new observation unit is developed using object-oriented segmentation; 2) main centers are located using cluster analysis (Local Moran\'s I); 3) sub center candidates are selected using significant positive residuals from geographically weighted regression (GWR); and 4) final centers are filtered using global natural breaks classification (NBC). These steps can be reproduced in different regions. To evaluate the effectiveness, the method was applied to three rapidly developing Chinese cities: Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing with different natural and economic characteristics. The performance of the proposed method has been carefully evaluated with qualitative and quantitative analyses. Comparative experiments were also conducted across different datasets to prove the benefits of combining a social media check-in map with remotely sensed imagery in a human environment study.

The accuracy assessment shows that the proposed model has achieved a reasonably high predictive power for monthly NO3--N deposition (slope = 0.96, intercept = 035, R = 0.83, RMSE = 0.72) across China. The spatial NO3--N deposition shows a significant gradient from industrial areas to undeveloped regions, ranging from 0.01 to 26.76 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) with an average of 5.77 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) over China during 2010-2012. The bulk NO3--N deposition shows a clear seasonal variation, with high depositions occurring in the warm season (March-November) and peaking in July and August, and low bulk NO3--N deposition appearing in winter (December-February). This study proves for the first time that the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) HNO3 and NO3- columns and precipitation are powerful to predict the bulk nitrate deposition. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

These dynamics are challenging for land cover classifications on the one hand, but deliver crucial information that can be used to improve the classifiers performance on the other hand. Since up to date mapping of crops is crucial to assess the impact of agricultural land use on the ecosystems, an accurate and complete classification of crop types is of high importance. In the presented study, a new multitemporal data based classification approach was developed that incorporates knowledge about the phenological changes on crop lands. It identifies phenological sequence patterns (PSP) of the crop types based on a dense stack of Sentinel-1 data and accurate information about the plant\'s phenology. The performance of the developed methodology has been tested for two different vegetation seasons using over 200 ground truth fields located in northern Germany. The results showed that a dense time series of Sentinel-1 images allowed for high classification accuracies of grasslands, maize, canola, sugar beets and potatoes (F1-score above 0.8) using PSP as well as standard (Random Forest and Maximum Likelihood) classification method. The PSP approach clearly outperformed standard methods for cereal crops, especially for spring barley where the F1-score varied between zero and 0.43 for standard approaches, while PSP achieved values as high as 0.74 and 0.79 for both vegetation seasons. The PSP based approach also outperformed for oat, winter barley and rye. Furthermore, the PSP classification is more resilient to differences in farming management and conditions of growth since it takes information about each crop types\' growing stage and its growing period into consideration. The results also indicate, that the PSP approach was more sensitive to subtle changes such as the proportion of weeds within a field. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This study details insolation estimates over four continuous seasons from a simple radiative transfer model, employing imager visible data from the geostationary GOES series of satellites, a model developed in the 1980s that has undergone continual upgrades and tests since that time. After an introduction explaining the physics and physical assumptions of this model, recent improvements in spatial and temporal resolution and other model modifications are detailed. Initially a set of current satellite insolation results from years 2014-2015 are compared to those produced for a set of 11 pyranometer measurement locations of the United States Climate Research Network (USCRN) for the years 2003-2004 (Otkin et al., 2005). It is found that the model improvements and modifications on average increase the accuracy of the satellite insolation estimates. Subsequently, insolation estimates from this satellite system are compared to USCRN pyranometer measurements from years 2014 and 2015 at an additional 34 USCRN measurement locations across the conterminous U.S. When satellite data are available for a USCRN location using data from both GOES-East and GOES-West, error statistics from the two satellite sources are compared. Distinctions are made between USCRN locations with differing topography and other relevant physical characteristics. Finally, plans for additional improvements and enhancements of the model are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The skill of the NN retrieval is compared to that of the ESA-CCI soil moisture retrieval as well as modeled soil moisture fields from ERA-interim/land. The NN retrieval is able to capture the observed soil moisture temporal variations with a station-average correlation and anomaly correlation of 0.45 and 0.35, respectively. For most ground stations the model obtained a higher temporal correlation skill, with average correlation and anomaly correlation values of 0.53 and 0.46, respectively. For stations in data-sparse regions, the NN retrieval showed a slightly better performance than the model, illustrating the potential of soil moisture retrievals to inform models in data -sparse areas. A time series analysis further showed that the retrieval is well able to capture soil moisture variability outside of active precipitation phases, such as the soil moisture behavior during the dry down phase. Compared to the ESA-CCI retrieval, the NN methodology obtained higher correlations, as a result of its ability to use the complementary information provided by the active and passive microwave sensors. A global evaluation of the retrieval errors through a triple collocation analysis with SMOS and GLDAS soil moisture estimates showed that the errors are high in energy limited regions, where the NN retrieval appears to be lacking input information. In the data -sparse regions of Africa and South America, the triple collocation analysis confirmed the higher skill of the NN retrieval compared to the model. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

A combination of airborne lidar data and field plots was used to calculate CC, ECC and LAI for a set of 746 systematically placed lidar plots. Generalized additive models were used to link these variables with various types of spectral indices.

For L8, the corresponding RMSEPs were 0.128 (24.5%), 0.108 (22.4%), and 0.614 (20.2%). The marginally better performance of S2 models may be related to the 705 nm red edge band, which frequently occurred among the selected predictors.

Remote sensing can be utilized to derive spatiotemporally continuous PAR. Empirical algorithms can be used to quickly retrieve surface PAR data sets, but their accuracy cannot be guaranteed in regions without local calibration. Physical algorithms generally incorporate all relevant physical processes and can be used globally, but their computational efficiency is often low. In this paper, an efficient algorithm is developed to calculate surface PAR by combining a clear-sky PAR model and the parameterizations for cloud transmittances. In the algorithm, the transmittances for water vapor, ozone, Rayleigh, aerosol, and cloud are each handled across the whole PAR band (400700 nm). In addition, the contribution of the multiple reflections between surface ground and the atmosphere are also expressly considered. The new algorithm is applied to estimate instantaneous PAR with inputs from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products onboard both Terra and Aqua platforms. The daily PAR is estimated from these two instantaneous values by an upscaling method. The instantaneous and daily PAR estimates were validated with in situ data collected in the USA and China. The results indicate that the new algorithm, based on MODIS products, can effectively retrieve PAR with root mean square errors (RMSE) of about 40 W m(-2) and 15 W m(-2) at instantaneous and daily-mean time scales, respectively.

The wetland, however, is extensive and sparsely instrumented, which has inhibited credible understanding of regional flooding across space and time. Here we explore the potential to apply low resolution C-band ENVISAT Advanced SAR imagery for remote estimation of Sudd flooded area. Over a five year study period (2007-2011) the time-averaged flooded Sudd area was found to be 18,033 km(2) with an average annual high of 29,702 km(2) in late September and a low of 10,128 km(2) in early May. Annual peak flood area ranges considerably from 19,259 km(2) in 2009 to 36,649 km(2) in 2007, but we found no systematic trend over the five year study period. Derived flood frequency maps identify areas of open water and permanent flooding (12% of total area), seasonal flooding (29%), and intermittent flooding (48%). To evaluate the certainty of our results, we consider their consistency with (1) prior studies, (2) evapotranspiration estimates from the Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) surface energy balance algorithm, (3) watershed storage anomaly estimates from GRACE, (4) supervised classification of open water area using Landsat, and (5) a rough measure of water availability (antecedent precipitation). The analyses show reasonable temporal and spatial consistency with available lines of evidence. We conclude that low resolution C-band SAR imagery shows promise for study of Sudd wetland flood dynamics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

These variables often exhibit spatial correlation, which has to be accounted for in the calibration models used in predictions, either by direct modelling of the dependencies or by allowing for spatially correlated stochastic effects. Another feature in many remote sensing instruments is that the derived predictor variables are highly correlated, which can lead to unnecessary model over-training and at worst, singularities in the estimates. Both of these affect the prediction accuracy, especially when the training set for model calibration is small. To overcome these modelling challenges, we present a general model calibration procedure for remotely sensed data and apply it to airborne laser scanning data for forest inventory. We use a linear regression model that accounts for multicollinearity in the predictors by principal components and Bayesian regularization. It has a spatial random effect component for the spatial correlations that are not explained by a simple linear model. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme is used to account for the uncertainty in all the model parameters. We tested the proposed model against several alternatives and it outperformed the other linear calibration models, especially when there were spatial effects, multicollinearity and the training set size was small.

This study deals with exploring the feasibility of using diffuse soil spectral information in the visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared range (350-2500 nm) to estimate coarse-scale soil hydraulic parameters and predict soil moisture profiles using a topography-based aggregation scheme in conjunction with a 1D mechanistic water flow model. Three different types of parametric transfer functions (so-called spectrotransfer functions, STFs; pedotransfer functions, PTFs; and spectral pedotransfer functions, SPTF5) were aggregated from the point scale to 1 km(2) pixel size. to provide coarse scale estimates of van Genuchten-Mualem (VGM) hydraulic parameters. The coarse scale hydraulic parameters were evaluated by simulating soil water dynamics of the 1 km(2) pixels across the Zanjanrood River sub-watershed (ZRS) in northwest Iran. Resultant soil water states were compared with ground-truth measurements and advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) estimates of soil water content. The topography-based aggregation scheme was found to provide effective values of the VGM hydraulic parameters across the ZRS study site. The coarse scale STFs performed best in terms of simulating surface, near-surface and subsurface soil water dynamics, followed by the coarse scale SPTFs and PM, which performed similarly. The average simulated soil water contents of the surface layer closely correlated with ASAR estimates during relatively wet periods. Simulated subsurface soil water dynamics matched well with the ground-truth measurements. These findings indicate the feasibility of using spectral data to predict VGM hydraulic parameters and, ultimately, to predict soil water dynamics at the larger scales. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

An empirical approximation to this algorithm provided the simplified NLSST algorithm for computing sea surface temperatures with satellite radiometer data. It has remained a favorite of the remote sensing community for the past 25 years. However, a 1998 study demonstrated that the functional form of the generalized non-linear algorithm, which is here designated the GNLSST, is very much data dependent. In this paper we explore the various functional forms that the GNLSST may take. Rather than using actual satellite data, we model the effects of atmospheric absorption by water vapor, under saturation conditions, on the satellite split-window temperature difference, AT, in the 11-13 pm infra-red spectral region. The parameters used in the GNLSST algorithm are adjusted to demonstrate the various forms that the GNLSST can take. One key finding is that the familiar algorithms used for measuring SST, such as the MCSST, the NLSST and the QSST are all special solutions to the more general GNLSST algorithm. Additionally, the GNLSST may take other forms, which are described graphically.   The simplifying assumptions which yield the NLSST solution represent an approximation to reality when working with actual satellite data. It is demonstrated that minor modifications to the regression procedures, which are used to derive the NLSST with satellite split-window data, may reduce the temperature errors resulting from these approximations. Alternative forms of the GNLSST algorithm may be useful for users of regional split-window satellite data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Global and regional scale CI maps have been generated from POLDER, MODIS, and MISR sensors based on an empirical relationship with the normalized difference between hotspot and darkspot (NDHD) index by previous studies. However, the hotspot, darkspot, and CI values can be considerably different from different bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models and solar zenith angles (SZA). In this study, we evaluated the effects of different configurations of BRDF models and SZA values on CI estimation using the NDHD method. CI maps derived from MISR and MODIS were compared with reference data at the VALERI sites. Results show that for moderate to least clumped vegetation (CI > 0.5), CI values retrieved with the observational SZA agree well with field measurements, while SZA = 0 degrees underestimates, and SZA = 60 overestimates. For highly clumped (CI < 0.5) and sparsely vegetated areas (FCOVER <25%), the Ross-Li model with 60 SZA is recommended for CI estimation. The best NDHD configuration was used to estimate a 15-year time series CI from MODIS BRDF data. The time series CI shows a reasonable seasonal trajectory, and varies consistently with the MODIS leaf area index (LAI). This study enables better usage of the NDHD method for CI estimation, and can be a useful reference for research on Cl validation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Methods to correct lidar elevation data are available, but a reliable method that requires limited field work and maintains spatial resolution is lacking. We present a novel method, the Lidar Elevation Adjustment with NDVI (LEAN), to correct lidar digital elevation models (DEMs) with vegetation indices from readily available multispectral airborne imagery (NAIP) and RTK-GPS surveys. Using 17 study sites along the Pacific coast of the U.S., we achieved an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.072 m, with a 40-75% improvement in accuracy from the lidar bare earth DEM. Results from our method compared favorably with results from three other methods (minimum-bin gridding, mean error correction, and vegetation correction factors), and a power analysis applying our extensive RTK-GPS dataset showed that on average 118 points were necessary to calibrate a site -specific correction model for tidal marshes along the Pacific coast. By using available imagery and with minimal field surveys, we showed that lidar-derived DEMs can be adjusted for greater accuracy while maintaining high (1 m) resolution.

Accurately monitoring cropland burned area is an important task as these estimates are used in the calculation of cropland burning emissions, which are ultimately utilized in policy making decisions. In this paper we developed an independent estimate of cropland burning in Russia through assessing the capabilities of global burned area products (MCD45A1; Roy et al., 2008 and MCD64A1; Giglio et al., 2009) and our own custom Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) based Cropland Regional Area Burned (CRAB) product. An archive of cropland field state samples was generated from very high resolution (<5 m) imagery allowing us a unique perspective into the challenges of mapping cropland burned area through detailed analysis of the Russian agricultural practices. Our analysis showed all three burned area products were unable to map approximately 95% of burn validation samples, demonstrating that the current coarse resolution (defined here as >= 500 m) satellite capabilities are not adequate for accurately mapping burned area associated with agricultural fires. The transient nature of cropland burns and the climatological conditions of the region require multiple subsequent daily overpasses; however, the small spatial scale of the burns requires moderate (defined here as 10-50 m) spatial resolutions. Future opportunities to accurately map cropland burned area may arise with the Sentinel-2 and Landsat constellation missions. (C) 2016 The Authors.

We demonstrate applications of FRM with inventory data from France, Germany, and Norway. The generic FRM achieved results that were comparable to those obtained with more traditional approaches based on model and variable selections. The proposed FRM generates interpretable regression coefficients and enables testing of practically relevant hypotheses regarding estimated models. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

This study develops a new model using WindSat data and a machine learning approach. Dynamic and hydrologic indices are quantified from WindSat wind and rainfall snapshot images over 352 developing and 973 non-developing tropical disturbances from 2005 to 2009. The degree of cyclonic circulation symmetry near the system center is quantified using circular variances, and the degree of strong wind aggregation (heavy rainfall) is defined using a spatial pattern analysis program tool called FRAGSTATS. In addition, the circulation strength and convection are defined based on the areal averages of wind speed and rainfall. An objective TC formation detection model is then developed by applying those indices to a machine-learning decision tree algorithm using calibration data from 2005 to 2007. Results suggest that the circulation symmetry and intensity are the most important parameters that characterize developing tropical disturbances. Despite inherent sampling issues associated with the polar orbiting satellite, a validation from 2008 to 2009 shows that the model produced a positive detection rate of approximately 95.3% and false alarm rate of 28.5%, which is comparable with the pre-existing objective methods based on cloud-pattern recognition. This study suggests that the quantitative microwave-sensed dynamic ocean surface wind pattern and intensity recognition model provides a new method of detecting TC formation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Ground data from the National Forest and Soil Inventory of Mexico (INFyS) were used to calibrate a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm to generate forest biomass (AGB), its associated uncertainty, and forest probability maps. The input predictor layers for the MaxEnt algorithm were extracted from the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) vegetation index (VI) products, ALOS PALSAR L-band dual-polarization backscatter coefficient images, and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model. A Jackknife analysis of the model accuracy indicated that the ALOS PALSAR layers have the highest relative contribution (50.9%) to the estimation of AGB, followed by MODIS-VI (32.9%) and SRTM (16.2%). The forest cover mask derived from the forest probability map showed higher accuracy (kappa = 0.83) than alternative masks derived from ALOS PALSAR (kappa = 0.72-0.78) or MODIS vegetation continuous fields (VCF) with a 10% tree cover threshold (kappa = 0.66). The use of different forest cover masks yielded differences of about 30 million ha in forest cover extent and 0.45 Gt C in total carbon stocks. The AGB map showed a root mean square error (RMSE) of 173 t C ha(-1) and R-2 = 0.31 when validated at the 250 m pixel scale with inventory plots. The error and accuracy at municipality and state levels were RMSE = +/- 4.4 t C ha(-1), R-2 = 0.75 and RMSE = +/- 2.1 t C ha(-1), R-2 = 0.94 respectively. We estimate the total carbon stored in the aboveground live biomass of forests of Mexico to be 1.69 Gt C +/- 1% (mean carbon density of 21.8 t C ha(-1)), which agrees with the total carbon estimated by FAO for the FRA 2010 (1.68 Gt C). The new map, derived directly from the biomass estimates of the national inventory, proved to have similar accuracy as existing forest biomass maps of Mexico, but is more representative of the shape of the probability distribution function of AGB in the national forest inventory data. Our results suggest that the use of a non-parametric maximum entropy model trained with forest inventory plots, even at the sub-pixel size, can provide accurate spatial maps for national or regional REDD+ applications and MRV systems.

Several alternate products can be distinguished: the observed brightness temperature (TB) data at coarse scale, indirect estimates of soil moisture (SM) through the inversion of the coarse-scale TB observations, and fine-scale soil moisture through the a priori downscaling of coarse-scale soil moisture. The SMOS TB products include observations over a large range of incidence angles at both H- and V-polarizations, which allows the merit of assimilating the full set of multi-angular/polarization observations, as opposed to specific sub-sets of observations, to be assessed. This study investigates the performance of various observation scenarios with respect to soil moisture and streamflow predictions in the Murray Darling Basin. The observations are assimilated into the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, coupled to the Community Microwave Emission Modeling (CMEM) platform, using the Ensemble Kalman filter. The assimilation of these various observation products is assessed under similar realistic assimilation settings, without optimization, and validated by comparison of the modeled soil moisture and streamflow to in situ measurements across the basin. The best results are achieved from assimilation of the coarse-scale SM observations. The reduced improvement using downscaled SM is probably due to a lower number of observations, as a result of cloud cover effects on the downscaling method. The assimilation of TB was found to be a promising alternative, which led to improvements in soil moisture prediction approaching those of the coarse-scale SM assimilation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The errors in the model fields are first estimated by comparing them to near-surface Argo salinity measurements, with RMS errors of less than 0.2 pss over most of the global oceans, except for regions of high variability in SSS such as boundary current regions and areas of large precipitation or river run-off. Regional biases are generally less than 0.05 pss but some regions such as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the region to the north of the Gulf Stream extension have larger biases. Various different processing versions of the SMOS data are assessed, including different temporal and spatial averaging, and the daily 1 degrees resolution SMOS differences to FOAM are approximately 3-10 times larger than Argo FOAM differences. The spatial information in the SMOS data is also assessed by comparing spatial gradients in the satellite SSS data with those calculated from other datasets including satellite sea surface temperature (SST) and satellite altimeter sea surface height (SSH) data, as well as with the model\'s gradients. The SMOS data contain information about the underlying ocean dynamics in the summer months, in agreement with the SSH data, which are not present in the satellite SST data or in the model\'s SSS fields. This demonstrates that the data contains useful information which could be used to correct the model through data assimilation. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Results presented in this paper were obtained using the last 620 version of the algorithm.   The correlation between the new vegetation optical depth (VOD) product and the height of the forest estimated by ICES at GLAS lidar on a global scale is investigated. Over South American and African forests a good correspondence between the two variables is observed, with saturation occurring above about 30 m height. Moreover, the comparison between the VOD and the height of the forest shows good spatial and temporal stability, and the r(2) correlation coefficient is within a 0.59-0.69 range. Conversely, discrepancies are observed in some Indonesian islands, particularly New Guinea. Over specific areas, the trends vs. forest height obtained with SMOS VOD are compared with the corresponding trends of AMSR-E VOD. Results are also validated at country-level scale. To this aim, accurate estimates of forest biomass derived from airborne lidar over selected forests of Peru, Columbia and Panama are used. Finally, the soil moisture retrieved over forests is investigated, reporting continental maps for Tropical areas and comparisons with ground measurements in selected forests of the US. Continental maps obtained with the new level 2 V620 algorithm cover almost all forest areas, and show seasonal variations which,are dependent on climatic zones. Comparisons between soil moisture retrievals in forests and ground measurements of the US SCAN network produce worse RMSE values with respect to low vegetation areas. Significant improvements however are achieved after averaging among close nodes of the ground network. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Yet, this information is critical for enhancing management capability and engaging in international initiatives such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+). The use of multi-source inventories (i.e., remote-sensing, field, and other data) in integrated models has shown increasing promise for accurately estimating forest attributes at lower costs. In this study, we compared the use of Landsat 8 OLI versus RapidEye satellite imagery in four modeling approaches (generalized linear model (GLM), generalized additive model (GAM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Random Forests), with and without auxiliary information (e.g., soils characteristics, distance to roads, etc.) to estimate percent canopy cover by pixel for an similar to 1,000,000 ha area in Zambia. We derived plot-level canopy cover as the dependent variable, using field measured data collected according to current National Forest Inventory (NFI) protocol. Using cross-validation statistics, Landsat 8 OLI exhibited better results than RapidEye across modeling approaches likely due to the additional short-wave infrared bands which consistently improved model performance (average root mean squared prediction error = 10.1% versus 11.0%). The GAM approach was more precise, though more challenging to fit. For both remote sensing data sources and all modeling approaches, other auxiliary information improved the model; soil variables were commonly selected for inclusion using a Genetic Algorithm. Using a binomial GAM with Landsat 8 OLI and soil variables, and by applying the current FAO forest/non-forest definition (i.e., canopy cover >10% for a 0.5 ha area), we estimated the total forest area as 758,100 ha (95% bootstrapped confidence interval of +/- 3,953 ha). Overall, our research indicates that sufficiently accurate forest area estimates for Zambia can be obtained using canopy cover GAM models that incorporate NFI data and freely-available remote sensing imagery and soil information.

We used seasonally continuous Landsat TM/ETM + data and generic random forest-based models to synoptically map the extent and dynamics of surface water and flooding (1986-2011) over the Murray Darling Basin (MDB). The MDB is a large semi-arid basin with competing demands for water that has recently experienced one of the most severe droughts in the southeast of Australia. We used a stratified random probability sampling design with 500 sample pixels each observed across time to assess the accuracy of the surface water maps. We further developed models to map flooded forest at a riparian site that experienced severe tree diebacic. Water indices and bands 5 and 6 were among the top 10 explanatory variables most important for mapping surface water. Surface water extent per season per year showed high inter-annual and seasonal variability, with low extent and variability during the Millennium Drought (1999-2009). Accuracy assessment yielded an overall classification accuracy of 99.9% (+/- 0.02% standard error) with 87% (+/- 3%) and 96% (+/- 2%) producer\'s and user\'s accuracy of water, respectively. User\'s and producer\'s accuracies of water were higher for Landsat 7 than Landsat 5 data. Both producer\'s and user\'s accuracies of water were lower in wet years compared to dry years. The approach presented here can be further developed for global application and is relevant to areas with competing water demands. Quantifying the uncertainty of the accuracy assessment and providing an unbiased accuracy estimate are imperative steps when remotely sensed products are intended to be used for follow on applications.

Biomass has extensively been estimated based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a measure of the vegetation greenness. The vegetation optical depth (VOD) derived from satellite passive microwave observations is mainly sensitive to the water content in total aboveground vegetation layer. VOD therefore provides a complementary data source to NDVI for monitoring biomass dynamics in drylands, yet further evaluations based on ground measurements are needed for an improved understanding of the potential advantages. In this study, we assess the capability of a long-term VOD dataset (1992-2011) to capture the temporal and spatial variability of in situ measured green biomass (herbaceous mass and woody plant foliage mass) in the semi-arid Senegalese Sahel. Results show that the magnitude and peak time of VOD are sensitive to the woody plant foliage whereas NDVI seasonality is primarily governed by the green herbaceous vegetation stratum in the study area. Moreover, VOD is found to be more robust against typical NDVI drawbacks of saturation effect and dependence on plant structure (herbaceous and woody compositions) across the study area when used as a proxy for vegetation productivity. Finally, both VOD and NDVI well reflect the spatial and inter-annual dynamics of the in situ green biomass data; however, the seasonal metrics showing the highest degree of explained variance differ between the two data sources. While the observations in October (period of in situ data collection) perform best for VOD (r(2) = 0.88), the small growing season integral (sensitive to recurrent vegetation) have the highest correlations for NDVI (r(2) = 0.90). Overall, in spite of the coarse resolution, the study shows that VOD is an efficient proxy for estimating green biomass of the entire vegetation stratum in the semi-arid Sahel and likely also in other dryland areas.

However, plot-based estimates of such parameters are often not sufficiently precise for their intended purposes, and especially so in developing and tropical countries in which implementation of extensive sample surveys can be cost-prohibitive or infeasible due to inaccessibility. Remotely sensed data can improve the precision of estimates and thereby reduce the need for field samples. To guide investment decision in MRV systems, comparative analyses of the contribution of different types of remotely sensed data to improve precision of estimates are required. The aim of the current study was to quantify the contribution of data from (1) airborne laser scanning (ALS), (2) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) derived from TanDEM-X, (3) RapidEye optical imagery, and global forest map products derived from (4) Landsat and (5) ALOS PALSAR L-band radar imagery to improve precision of AGB and forest area estimates beyond the precision that could be obtained by a pure field-based survey in miombo woodlands of Tanzania. Miombo woodlands is one among the most wide-spread vegetation types in eastern, central, and southern Africa, occupying about 9% of the entire African land area. A 365.6 km(2) region in Liwale district in Tanzania served as area of interest for this study. Eighty-eight ground plots distributed on 11 clusters of eight plots each according to a probability based single-stage cluster sampling design served as field data for regression model calibration used for mapping and estimation of AGB and forest area. Model-assisted estimators were used in the estimation. The relative efficiency (RE) of the ALS-assisted estimates of mean AGB per hectare (variance of the field-based estimate relative to the variance of the ALS-assisted estimate) was 3.6. Relative efficiency translates directly to the factor by which the sample size used for the ALS-assisted estimate would have to be multiplied to arrive at the same precision for a pure field-based estimate. RE values for InSAR and RapidEye were 2.8 and 33, while the global Landsat and PALSAR map products contributed only marginally to improve precision (RE = 13-1.4). For forest area estimation, ALS-assisted estimates showed an RE of 3.7-4.6, while InSAR, RapidEye, and global Landsat and PALSAR maps resulted in RE values of 1.0-13, 2.0-2.1,1.4-1.8, and 1.7, respectively.

Moreover, ALOS PALSAR backscatter and InSAR coherence have yet to be used together to delineate GSV. Due to the observation strategy and the high acquisition success rate over Eurasia, a large amount of high quality ALOS PALSAR L-band data is available over Siberia. Consequently, this paper investigates the capability of ALOS PALSAR backscatter and InSAR coherence for the estimation of GSV in Central Siberia, Russia. The potential of backscatter and coherence are directly compared using the same inventory data. Altogether, 87 PALSAR images are used and eleven forest inventory sites are investigated.   Based on this large dataset it was observed that InSAR coherence acquired in frozen conditions offers the highest potential for GSVestimation. The saturation level for single coherence images was on average 230 m(3)/ha, with an average R-2 between coherence and GSV of 0.58. PALSAR backscatter acquired in unfrozen conditions could also estimate GSV; however, the saturation levels (75-100 m(3)/ha) and the average R-2 (0.42-0.48) were lower. HV backscatter offered only a slightly greater potential than HH backscatter.   A simple inversion approach aiming at the delineation of forest GSV maps based on the multitemporal SAR data was developed and applied to five forest inventory sites. This approach combines HV backscatter data acquired in unfrozen conditions and InSAR coherence data acquired in frozen conditions. In general, the produced maps feature a corrected relative RMSEcorr of <30% which was similar to the accuracy of the forest inventory data. The R-2 between inventory data and SAR data based maps varied between 0.54 and 0.83. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

From a methodological point of view, our approach relies on a Bayesian inference using Gaussian Mixture Model prior distributions on reference spectra of aerosol and water reflectance. A reference spectrum for the aerosol characterizes the specific signature of the aerosols on the observed aerosol reflectance. A reference spectrum for the water characterizes the specific signature of chlorophyll-a, suspended particulate matters and colored dissolved organic matters on the observed sea surface reflectance. In our Bayesian inversion scheme, prior distributions of the marine and aerosol variables are set conditionally to the observed values of covariates, typically acquisition geometry acquisition conditions and preestimates of the aerosol and water reflectance in the near-infrared part of the spectrum. The numerical inversion exploits a gradient-based optimization from quasi-randomized initializations.   We evaluate our estimates of the sea surface reflectance from the MERIS TOA observations. Using the MERMAID radiometric in-situ dataset, we obtain significant improvements in the estimation of the sea surface reflectance, especially for the 412, 442, 490 and 510 nm bands, compared with the standard ESA MEGS algorithm and the a state-of-the-art neural network approach (OR). The mean gain value on the relative error for the 13 bands between 412 and 885 nm is of 57% compared with MEGS algorithm and 10% compared with the C2R. The water leaving reflectances are used in Ocean Color for the estimation of the chl-a concentration, the colored dissolved organic matters absorption and the suspended particulate matters concentration underlying the potential of such approach to improve the standard level 2 products in coastal areas.

Most of the existing satellite-based retrieval algorithms are valid only for flat surfaces without accounting for topographic effects. This causes significant errors. Meanwhile, the fixed spatial resolution of remote sensing data makes it difficult to link the satellite-derived longwave radiation to different land models running on various scales. These deficiencies result in an urgent need for topographic modeling and spatial scaling studies of longwave radiation. In this paper, a longwave topographic radiation model (LWTRM) is proposed that quantifies all possible radiation-affecting factors over rugged terrain. For driving the LWTRM, a hybrid method for simultaneously deriving multiple components of longwave radiation from MODIS data is suggested based on artificial neuron networks (ANN) and the radiative transfer simulation. Topographically corrected longwave radiation is then derived by coupling the ANN outputs and LWTRM. Based on this, a general upscaling strategy for longwave radiation is presented. The results demonstrate that: (1) both the proposed LWTRM and the upscaling strategy are rather effective and work well over rugged areas; (2) the ANN-based retrieval method can produce longwave radiation with better accuracy(RMSE <23 W/m(2), bias <9 W/m(2)). More importantly, it can simultaneously derive multiple components of longwave radiation in a consistent manner; (3) over mountainous areas, the radiation cannot be accurately characterized in terms of either spatial distribution or specific values if topographic effects are neglected, for instance, the induced error can reach up to 100 W/m(2) for the longwave net flux; and (4) the topographic effects cannot be ignored below spatial scale of approximately 5 km in the selected study area.

For the first time, spatially explicit CONUS field size maps and derived information are presented. A total of 4,182,777 fields were extracted with mean and median field sizes of 0.193 km(2) and 0.278 km(2), respectively. The CONUS field size histogram was skewed; 50% of the extracted fields had sizes greater than or smaller than 0361 km(2), and there were four distinct peaks that corresponded closely to sizes equivalent to fields with 025 x 0.25 mile, 0.25 x 0.5 mile, 05 x 0.5 mile, and 0.5 x 1 mile side dimensions. There were discernible patterns between field size and the majority crop type as defined by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) cropland data layer (CDL) classification. In general, larger field sizes occurred where a greater proportion of the land was dedicated to agriculture, predominantly in the U.S. Wheat Belt and Corn Belt, and in regions of irrigated agriculture. The results were validated by comparison with field boundaries manually digitized from Landsat 5 and Google-Earth high resolution imagery. The validation was undertaken at 48 approximately 7.5 x 7.5 km sites selected across a gradient of field sizes in each of the top 16 harvested cropland areas in U.S. states that together cover 76% of harvested U.S. cropland. Conventional per-pixel confusion matrix based measures that assess pixel level thematic mapping accuracy, and object extraction accuracy measures, were derived. The overall per-pixel crop field classification accuracy was 92.7% and the overall crop field producer\'s and user\'s accuracies were 93.7% and 94.9%. Comparing all the reference and extracted field objects, 81.4% were correctly matched and the extracted field sizes were on average underestimated by 1.2% relative to the reference field objects.

We use a multi-angle remote sensing approach to determine changes in vegetation structure from differences in directional scattering (anisotropy) observed by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with data atmospherically corrected by the Multi-Angle Implementation Atmospheric Correction Algorithm (MAIAC). Our results show a strong linear relationship between anisotropy and field (r(2) = 0.70) and LiDAR (r(2) = 0.88) based estimates of LAI even in dense canopies (LAI <= 7 m(2) m(-2)). This allowed us to obtain improved estimates of vegetation structure from optical remote sensing. We used anisotropy to analyze Amazon seasonality based on spatially explicit estimates of onset and length of dry season obtained from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM). An increase in vegetation greening was observed during the beginning of dry season (across similar to 7% of the basin), which was followed by a decline (browning) later during the dry season (across similar to 5% of the basin). Anomalies in vegetation browning were particularly strong during the 2005 and 2010 drought years (similar to 10% of the basin). We show that the magnitude of seasonal changes can be significantly affected by regional differences in onset and duration of the dry season. Seasonal changes were much less pronounced when assuming a fixed dry season from June through September across the Amazon Basin. Our findings reconcile remote sensing studies with field based observations and model results as they provide a sounder basis for the argument that tropical vegetation growth increases during the beginning of the dry season, but declines after extended drought periods. The multi-angle approach used in this work may help quantify drought tolerance and seasonality in the Amazonian forests. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Considering the advantages offered with longer microwave wavelengths, most importantly an ability to collect data under cloudy conditions, the exploitation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for monitoring crop condition is of great interest. In this study, multi-polarization RADARSAT-2 (C-band) and Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) CL-band) were used to investigate the potential of SAR to estimate Leaf Area Index (LA!), a strong indicator of crop productivity. A new LAI estimation approach based on coupling of two existing models has been developed. The coupled model was calibrated and validated for two economically important crops, corn and soybeans, using the data collected during the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12) over a site in the Canadian Prairies. The validation of the model generally showed high correlation coefficients (R) between ground measured and estimated LAI values, when dual like-cross polarizations were used (either HH-HV or VV-HV). At C-band, correlations were similar for both dual polarizations with corn R values of 0.83 and 0.81 for HH-HV and VV-HV, respectively; and with soybean R values of 0.80 for both HH-HV and VV-HV. L-band was less sensitive to corn LAI with R values ranging from 0.79 for HH-HV to 059 for VV-HV. Our method was not able to accurately estimate LAI for soybeans using UAVSAR. Errors of estimation (both root mean square error and mean average error) established that C-band for corn and soybeans canopies and L-band for corn canopies can be used to estimate LAI at accuracies similar to those reported in studies using satellite optical sensors. These optical satellite-based LAI measurements are currently used to correct estimates of yield and biomass from crop growth models. This study is important in that it demonstrates the capability of SAR to also estimate LAI but with an all-weather acquisition capability, offering an important advantage for operational crop growth monitoring.

However, most of these indices did not show good results in areas covered by sparse vegetation, like most of the Drylands. In these ecosystems, open spaces between plants are often covered by biological soil crusts (biocrusts), i.e. communities of cyanobacteria, algae, microfungi, lichens, mosses and other microorganisms growing in the uppermost millimeters of the soil. Due to their mostly dark color, biocrusts influence the spectral response of dryland surfaces, making it necessary to assess the sensibility of widely used spectral indices to variations in biocrusts cover. In this study we used spectra of biocrusts, bare soil and vegetation to analyze the effect of biocrust cover on the spectral response of heterogeneous areas. In a second approach we investigated the impact of biocrust water status on spectral characteristics. Based on spectral mixture analysis, we calculated the response of a wide range of vegetation/biocrust/bare soil landscape compositions, obtaining a total of 702 spectra. These were used to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), the Water Index (WI) and surface albedo, and the effect of biocrust cover and water status on these indices was analyzed. Biocrusts exerted a considerable effect on vegetation indices and surface albedo, whereas WI was mostly affected by vegetation type and cover. As biocrust cover increased, the value of NDVI and EVI also increased, whereas albedo decreased, and these effects were more important under low vegetation cover. Moreover, as biocrusts almost immediately turned dark after water pulses, the effect of biocrust cover on spectral indices increased already 30 min after wetting. Although these results varied depending on vegetation type, they demonstrate, that biocrusts largely affect the spectral response of dryland surfaces, and they illustrate how this effect is reinforced by water. Thus, biocrusts need to be considered in studies analyzing dryland phenology, productivity and water status. Moreover, in order to increase the accuracy of hydrological and climate forecast predictions, biocrust effects on surface albedo, both in a dry and wet stage, need to be included.

Giant kelp is a highly dynamic foundation species that supports an ecologically and economically important ecosystem found throughout the globe. Satellite, airborne, and field data are used to evaluate the suitability of HyspIRI\'s spatial, temporal, and spectral coverage for capturing variability in giant kelp biomass and physiological state. We analyze a 28-year time series of giant kelp biomass derived from Landsat satellite imagery in order to identify the dominant temporal modes of variability in giant kelp biomass using the California coast as a model region likely to be relevant to other regions of the globe. Temporal variability in California kelp canopy biomass is compared to the expected availability of cloud-free HyspIRI Visible Shortwave Infrared (VSWIR) views for regions of the world that contain giant kelp populations. Spectral variability is explored by assessing how changes in the physiological condition of giant kelp canopy are exhibited in the reflectance and transmittance of kelp fronds. We compare chlorophyll a to carbon ratios (Chl:C) of kelp fronds collected off the coast of California to laboratory and airborne measurements of hyperspectral reflectance in order to develop metrics of kelp physiological condition. The seasonal cycle dominates giant kelp canopy biomass temporal variability. However, the strength and timing of this cycle varies in both space and time. Our projections of cloud-free HyspIRI coverage indicate that the sensor will be able to capture at least 1 cloud free view each season for nearly all of the global giant kelp habitats, thereby illustrating that HyspIRI will resolve the dominant seasonal cycles in giant kelp biomass. A novel spectral index developed here from field observations explained 76% of the variance in Chl:C and was applied to hyperspectral aircraft observations. These results demonstrate that the spatial, temporal, and spectral coverage provided by HyspIRI has the potential to provide new insights into the ecology and biophysiology of giant kelp.

The study is conducted for two selected temperature conditions: 1) cold (-7.9 degrees C) and 2) warm (-0.4 degrees C). First, the polarimetric SAR response from the snow cover at cold conditions is analyzed with an objective to investigate the sensitivity of linear and polarimetric backscatter to snow thickness. Second, the changes in these sensitivities are examined as a function of change in surface air temperature (from -7.9 degrees C to -0.4 degrees C) through the changes manifested in snow geophysical properties. The dependence of linear and polarimetric backscatter response on radar incidence angle for different snow thicknesses is also evaluated.   Our results demonstrate strong to weak relationships between the polarimetric parameters and snow thickness under cold conditions but virtually no relationship under warm conditions. The strength of this sensitivity varies with parameter type, radar incidence angle and snow geophysical properties. Under the cold conditions, fourteen polarimetric parameters demonstrate a positive relationship and nine demonstrate a negative relationship with snow thickness. This parameter sensitivity to snow thickness indicates an increase in volume or mixed scattering component with increase in snow thickness. The cause of this is primarily an increased microwave interaction with a greater number of dry snow grains, and/or more interaction with increased brine volumes in the brine-wetted snow and upper sea ice layer. A comparison of polarimetric signatures at warm conditions to that at cold conditions shows both an increase and a decrease in response for all snow thicknesses. For thin or medium snow cover, every time a polarimetric parameter response increases or decreases as a consequence of an increase in temperature there is always an opposite response in the same polarimetric parameter for thick snow cover. This is primarily due to the masking effect of moist-snow, likely caused by reduced penetration depth resulting in dominant surface scattering from the air/moist snow interface, and/or the dry snow-brine-wetted snow interface, as opposed to the snow-ice interface. Normal probability density functions (PDFs) employed to determine the snow thickness separation capability of polarimetric parameters show near overlapping signatures of all snow classes under warm conditions, suggesting that snow thickness estimation using snow thermodynamics at warm conditions is not possible.

In sub-Saharan Africa, gross (loss, gain) and net changes in dry tropical forest areas are difficult to quantify at sub-national scales because of high spatio-temporal variability in land cover conditions due to vegetation phenology and land use practices. In this project we developed new, field-validated remote sensing characterizations of dry season surface components to separate forest from non-forest land cover, and assessed forest changes from the 1990s-2010s in a Tanzanian Miombo Woodland landscape. Using a linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) approach with Landsat 5-8 data, we examined the hypothesis that higher proportions of substrate and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) at non-forest regions distinguished them from forest cover against seasonally variable land cover conditions. Subsequently we evaluated the efficacy of multi-temporal classification and single-date image thresholding for identifying forest from non-forest cover. We found significantly greater proportions of substrate and NPV over non-forest compared to forest areas that enabled identification of forest cover across dry season images. Single-date, forest/non-forest maps based on an LSMA-derived metric attained overall accuracies of 81.0-85.3%, which approached multi-temporal unsupervised classifications (86.5% for forest/non-forest maps). Applying the LSMA-derived metric to study forest changes, our study region experienced a net 15.0% loss of 1995 forest area, and a 7.0% overall reduction in the total forest-occupied land cover from 1995-2011. Areas of gross forest gain were substantial, totaling 13.6% of the 1995 forest area. We found differing patterns in gross forest losses and gains among sub-regions and through time in our Tabora study area, which provide bases for testable hypotheses in future research on regional and localized drivers affecting forest cover. Our finding that non-green surface components distinguished forest from non-forest via an LSMA approach may be widely applicable to studying forest conversions in Miombo Woodlands and other dry tropical forests. This approach may also be useful for evaluating how land cover conditions change in response to potential land use or climate driving variables, or the impact of land changes for carbon balance and other ecosystem processes.

Currently, the VIIRS VI suite is undergoing extensive Calibration and Validation (Cal/Val) activities to quantify product performance and to provide guidance for algorithm improvement In this study we utilized AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) based Surface Reflectance (SR) match-up data sets. Match-ups are pairs of VIIRS SR and SR derived from atmospheric correction of VIIRS TOA reflectances using AERONET ground measurements (aerosol and water vapor parameters) and ancillary data. Atmospheric correction is performed with the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) radiative transfer code, the same code used in the operational VIIRS atmospheric correction. Daily time series January 1, 2013-March 31, 2014 of 101 x 101 pixel window match-up subsets at 375 m VIIRS Imagery resolution, centered at the selected AERONET site locations were used. The overall objective of the study was to characterize the performance of the VIIRS TOC VIs (TOC EVI and TOC NDVI) over AERONET sites as a function of accuracy of inputs of atmospheric correction algorithm (aerosol, water vapor and others) and quality control screening (cloud and snow masks). We performed three types of analyses: (I) analysis of overall performance of VI product over all sites, (2) analysis of time series over select sites representative of vegetation types, and (3) sensitivity analysis of VI to cloud, aerosols and snow contamination. Over the period of time series average Accuracy, Precision and Uncertainty statistics were 0.009, 0.035, and 0.038, respectively, for TOC NDVI and -0.004, 0.015, and 0.016, respectively, for TOC EVI. Those statistics were derived based on screening to retain only confidently clear, snow free, non-urban pixels. The reason for the substantial difference in the performance of VIs is a different sensitivity of VIs to residual atmospheric contamination. According to our study VIIRS cloud mask performed reasonably. However, Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) was substantially overestimated in the vicinity of clouds, which resulted in overcorrection of VIIRS visible channels and ultimately overestimation of TOC NDVI. TOC EVI, on the other hand, remained largely unaffected, as an atmospherically resistant index. TOC EVI was also found to be less sensitive to residual snow contamination. Results of this study indicate the need to develop VI-specific quality control, which effectively screens data based on index sensitivity to atmospheric contamination. Monitoring VIIRS VIs over AERONET sites has been automated with a web-based STAR JPSS VI Monitor. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Shabanov, N.] IM Syst Grp, Rockville, MD USA.

This paper presents a modeling approach that considers the multi-directional acquisition within sensor field of view (FOV) in order to simulate realistic images of Earth surfaces, as acquired by passive sensor with a finite FOV. In this approach, the DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) 3-D radiative transfer model (RTM) is coupled with 3-D perspective projection. Current RTMs assume that all parts of the studied landscape are viewed along the same direction, although all passive imagers acquire energy in a FOV with a nonzero solid angle. In addition, they cannot account camera model and its image projection geometry (e.g., perspective projection for camera and parallel-perspective projection for cross-track imager). This situation is particularly problematic for airborne acquisition with low sensor altitude and wide FOV. Our new modeling approach solves this problem: rays that enter a sensor can come from various directions. For that during ray tracking, each passive sensor acquisition is simulated for the exact view direction, which is the instant vector from the scattering point to the sensor position. Camera and cross-track imager are both modeled for most classical configurations. With this implementation, DART provides original simulations and assessments for various research domains, including: 1. Passive sensor imaging; 2. Video captured by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); 3. Local hot spot (HS) effect in a RS image; 4. Pixel-wise comparison between simulated orthorectified perspective-projection images; and 5. Radiance variation among images acquired by airborne and spaceborne systems with different sensor altitudes. These 5 points are illustrated here. Accurate pixel-wise comparison between simulated and acquired RS data, for any configuration is another important application of this approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Simultaneous to collecting topographic data, most ALS instruments record the backscanered intensity for each laser emission and therefore provide additional information on the reflectance characteristics of the surveyed surface. Along with air temperature, the surface albedo of snow and ice was identified as a major driving factor of glacier melt. Consequently, better knowledge on the spatial distribution of the glacier albedo could substantially improve energy balance based glacier melt modeling. In this study, we collected on-glacier spectro-radiometric and albedometer measurements to serve as a ground reference to radiometrically calibrate high resolution ALS intensity data into a distributed albedo proxy map. This method resulted in an albedo proxy with values between 0.6 on the glacier tongue and 0.9 on fresh snow in high altitudes. 99.6% of all values fell within the albedo boundary conditions, i.e. values between 0 and 1. Corrected near-infrared ALS intensity data provided a distributed product that allows simulating albedo in glacier energy and mass balance models more realistically. Remaining challenges are (i) a different surface albedo response in the visual part of the electromagnetic spectrum, (ii) the low radiometric resolution of the ALS system for higher intensity values, and (iii) an insufficient correction of the snow bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF).

Oil and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) have very similar spectra, differing only in two narrow hydrocarbon absorption regions around 1700 and 2300 nm. Confusion between NPV and oil is expressed as an increase in oil fraction error with increasing NPV, as shown by Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) applied to synthetic spectra generated with known endmember fractions. Significantly, the magnitude of error varied depending upon the type of NPV in the mixture. To reduce error, we used stable zone unmixing to identify a nine band subset that emphasized the hydrocarbon absorption regions, allowing for more accurate detection of oil presence using MESMA. When this band subset was applied to post-spill AVIRIS data acquired over Barataria Bay on several dates following the 2010 oil spill, accuracies ranged from 87.5% to 93.3%. Oil presence extended 10.5 m into the marsh for oiled shorelines, showing a reduced oil fraction with increasing distance from the shoreline. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We use ICA to decompose the image cube collected by the instrument into a sum of the outer products of independent, maximally non-Gaussian time series and images of their spatial distribution, and then reassemble the image cube using only sources that appear to be HTEs. Integrating spatially gives the time series of total HTE radiance emission. In this study we test the technique on a number of simulated HTE events, and then apply it to a number of volcanic HTEs observed by the SEVIRI instrument. We find that the technique performs well on small localised eruptions and can be used to correct for saturation. The technique offers the advantage of obviating the need for a priori knowledge of the area being imaged, beyond some basic assumptions about the nature of the processes affecting radiance in the scene, namely that (i) HTE sources are statistically independent from other processes, (ii) the radiance registered at the sensor is a linear mixture of the HTE signal and those from other processes, and (iii) HTE sources can be reliably identified for the reconstruction process. This results in only five free parameters the dimensions of the image cube, an estimate of the data dimensionality and a threshold for distinguishing between HTE and nonHTE sources. While we have focused here on volcanic HTEs, the methodology can, in principle, be extended to studies of other kinds of HTEs such as those associated with biomass burning. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Passive microwave (MW) observations offer an alternative to thermal infrared (TIR) LST retrieval approaches. Although MW has a lower spatial resolution, its temporal record is more complete as it is more tolerant to clouds. Moreover, merging TIR and MW LST with independent random errors should result in enhanced LST products. Despite these benefits, MW-based LST retrievals are not widely adopted for land applications except as an input to soil moisture retrieval algorithms. This research aims to facilitate expanded use of MW-based LST by formulating a model to explain the systematic differences in comparison to TIR-LST, and quantifying random errors in each datastream. To that end, we compile a 6-year dataset over the African continent, combining observations from seven intercalibrated low orbiting satellites equipped with suitable microwave radiometers. We compare the diurnal timing and amplitude of this dataset to TIR-LST time-series produced by LSA-SAF from the Meteosat Second Generation geostationary satellite. A third independent data source, the skin temperature as modeled by the Modern Era Reanalysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) as produced at NASA\'s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office, is included in a triple collocation analysis to calculate the random error in the amplitude anomaly. Results suggest that the anomaly in diurnal LST amplitude over much of the African domain can be estimated from TIR and MW with similar levels of random error for clear sky days, except over dry sandy desert areas where the MW sensing depth extends too far below the surface. The temporal sampling advantage of MW, due to higher cloud tolerance in comparison with TIR retrievals, appears to be substantial but will need to be verified by follow-on studies. Overall the results of this study present a significant step forward in reconciling the systematic differences in LST, preparing the way for a global merger of MW and TIR LST time-series.

The simulations demonstrate how measurements from the planned spaceborne mission, which differ from those of previous LiDAR systems, may perform across a boreal forest to non-forest structure gradient in globally important ecological region of northern Siberia. We used a modified version of FLIGHT to simulate the acquisition parameters of ICESat-2. Modeled returns were analyzed from collections of sequential footprints along LiDAR tracks (link-scales) of lengths ranging from 20 m-90 m. These link-scales traversed synthetic forest stands that were initialized with parameters drawn from field surveys in Siberian Larix forests. LiDAR returns from vegetation were compiled for 100 simulated LiDAR collections for each 10 Mg . ha(-1) interval in the 0-100 Mg . ha-1 above-ground biomass density (AGB) forest gradient. Canopy height metrics were computed and AGB was inferred from empirical models. The root mean square error (RMSE) and RMSE uncertainty associated with the distribution of inferred AGB within each AGB interval across the gradient was examined.   Simulation results of the bright daylight and low vegetation reflectivity conditions for collecting photon counting LiDAR with no topographic relief show that 1-2 photons are returned for 79%-88% of LiDAR shots. Signal photons account for similar to 67% of all LiDAR returns, while similar to 50% of shots result in 1 signal photon returned. The proportion of these signal photon returns do not differ significantly (p > 0.05) for AGB intervals >20 Mg . ha(-1). The 50 m link-scale approximates the finest horizontal resolution (length) at which photon counting LiDAR collection provides strong model fits and minimizes forest structure uncertainty in the synthetic Larix stands. At this link-scale AGB >20 Mg . ha(-1) has AGB error from 20-50% at the 95% confidence level. These results suggest that the theoretical sensitivity of ICESat-2 photon counting LiDAR measurements alone lack the ability to consistently discern differences in inferred AGB at 10 Mg . ha-1 intervals in sparse forests characteristic of the taiga-tundra ecotone.

Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration mapping using Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) allows new insights into such spatiotemporal dynamics for Lake Balaton as bloom start, peak and end timing, duration, maximum chl-a concentrations, spatial extent, rates of increase and decrease, and bloom chl-a concentration integral.

Three approaches to time series smoothing are compared and mapped metrics are evaluated in comparison with phenology metrics of in situ chl-a. The high degree of both spatial and temporal variability is highlighted and discussed, as are methodological limitations and correlation between phenology metrics. Both the feasibility of and novel insights permitted through such phenology mapping are demonstrated, and priority topics for future research are suggested. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Radiometric slope effects are modelled as the products of two models. The first is a simple physical model based on the assumption of a uniform opaque layer of isotropic scatterers, which is independent of terrain type, frequency and polarization. It accounts for the slope-induced variation in the number of scatterers per resolution cell. The second is a semi-empirical model, which accounts for the variation in scattering mechanisms, dependent on terrain type, frequency and polarization. PALSAR FBD (L-band, HH- and HV-polarization) data are used at two test sites in Brazil and Fiji. Results for the Brazilian area, which has slopes up to 25 degrees, show that remaining slope effects for the multi-model case are much smaller than 0.1 dB, for all land cover types. This is much better than the best single-model approach where remaining slope effects can be very small for forests but be as large as 1.77 dB for woodland in HH-polarization. Results for the Fiji area, which has different vegetation types, are very similar. The potential large improvement, using this multi-model approach, in the accuracy of biomass estimation for transparent or open canopies is discussed. It is also shown that biomass change on slopes can be systematically under- or overestimated because of associated change in scattering mechanism. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast, satellite-based monitoring can provide aerosol optical depth (ACID) products with higher spatial resolution and continuous spatial coverage, but it cannot directly measure ground-level PM2.5 concentration. Observation-based and simulation-based approaches have been actively developed to retrieve ground-level PM2.5 concentrations from satellite AOD and sparse ground-level observations. However, the effect of aerosol characteristics (e.g., aerosol composition and size distribution) on the AOD-PM2.5 relationship is seldom considered in observation-based methods. Although these characteristics are considered in simulation-based methods, the results still suffer from model uncertainties. In this study, we propose an observation-based algorithm that considers the effect of the main aerosol characteristics. Their related effects on hygroscopic growth, particle mass extinction efficiency, and size distribution are estimated and incorporated into the AOD-PM2.5 relationship. The method is applied to quantify the PM2.5 distribution in China. Good agreements between satellite-retrieved and ground-observed PM2.5 annual and monthly averages are identified, with significant spatial correlations of 0.90 and 0.76, respectively, at 565 stations in China. The results suggest that this approach can measure large scale PM distributions with verified results that are at least as good as those from simulation-based estimations. The results also show the method\'s capacity to identify PM2.5 spatial distribution with high-resolution at national, regional, and urban scales and to provide useful information for air pollution control strategies, health risk assessments, etc. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, this analysis is not a straightforward task due to the complex relationships among different systems driving the dynamics of the observed variables. Aiming at automatically extracting information from temporal geospatial data, we propose a new approach to detect stochastic and deterministic patterns embedded into time series and illustrate its effectiveness through an analysis of global geospatial precipitation and vegetation data captured over a 14 year period. By knowing such patterns, we can find similarities in the behavior of different systems even if these systems are characterized by different dynamics. In addition, we developed a novel determinism measure to evaluate the relative contribution of stochastic and deterministic patterns in a time series. Analyses showed that this measure permitted the detection of regions on the global map where the radiation absorbed by the vegetation and the incidence of rain occur with similar patterns of stochasticity. The methods developed in this study are generally applicable to any spatiotemporal data set and may be of particular interest for the analysis of the vast amount of remotely sensed geospatial data currently being collected routinely as part of national and international monitoring programs.

Mean monthly satellite maps of PP and NP for both models were generated from 1997 to 2010 using SeaWiFS data for the Irminger basin and North Atlantic. Intra- and inter-annual variability of the two models was compared in six hydrographic zones. Both models exhibited similar spatio-temporal patterns: PP and NP increased from April to June and decreased by August Higher values were associated with the East Greenland Current (EGC), Iceland Basin (ICB) and the Reykjanes Ridge (RKR) and lower values occurred in the Central Irminger Current (CIC), North Irminger Current (NIC) and Southern Irminger Current (SIC). The annual PP and NP over the SeaWiFS record was 258 and 82 gC m(-2) yr(-1) respectively for the VGPM and 190 and 41 gC m(-2) yr(-1) for the WRM. Average annual cumulative sum in the anomalies of NP for the VGPM were positively correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in the EGC, CIC and SIC and negatively correlated with the multivariate ENSO index (MEI) in the ICB. By contrast, cumulative sum of the anomalies of NP for the WRM were significantly correlated with NAO only in the EGC and CIC. NP from both VGPM and WRM exhibited significant negative correlations with Arctic Oscillation (AO) in all hydrographic zones. The differences in estimates of PP and NP in these hydrographic zones arise principally from the parameterisation of the euphotic depth and the SST dependence of photo-physiological term in the VGPM, which has a greater sensitivity to variations in temperature than the WRM. In waters of 0 to 5 degrees C PP using the VGPM was 43% higher than WRM, from 5 to 10 degrees C the VGPM was 29% higher and from 10 to 15 degrees C the VGPM was 27% higher.

Compared to Landsat heritage sensors, the OLI has enhanced features, which include its 12-bit radiometric resolution and the addition of a band centered at 443 nm. The dramatically improved data quality/quantity expands existing applications of Landsat imagery in aquatic sciences from the retrieval of bio-geochemical properties, such as near-surface concentrations of chlorophyll-a (CHL) and total suspended solids (TSS), to benthic mapping. This study offers analysis of OLI\'s absolute radiometric performance over bodies of water using benchmark observations, namely the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) ocean color observations and marine in situ radiometric measurements. Sensor-to-sensor comparisons are performed to derive gain factors (g(1)) from near-concurrent observations in TOA radiance and reflectance domains. The gains in the radiance domain were further validated/adjusted by determining a second set of gains (g(2)) via analysis of OLI-derived water-leaving radiance, i.e., L-w(lambda), against in situ measurements made either at the Ocean Color AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET-OC) sites or during field campaigns. The analyses yield the OLI calibration uncertainties that need to be accounted for when studying aquatic environments. It was found that, for the visible and near-infrared channels, the OLI radiometric responses, on average, are well in agreement (< 2 % discrepancies) with the TOA radiances estimated by ocean color satellites or those predicted by models based on measurements of aquatic and atmospheric properties. However, the TOA radiance at the new 443-nm band is found to be, on average, 3.4 % larger than the reference observations. The inter-sensor comparisons in the reflectance domain, however, indicated slightly different results with the OLI responses being low in the blue bands. To enhance the retrieval accuracy of aquatic-science products from OLI datasets, sets of temporally averaged gains (radiance and reflectance) are derived and recommended for use prior to the retrieval of in-water products.

This study develops a \"region-shrinking\" segmentation technique tailored specifically to the problem of fuzzy object identification, and applies it to the test case of oceanic eddy detection. The region-shrinking technique employs an evolutionary boundary definition procedure to simultaneously identify segments containing oceanic eddies, and refine the boundaries of these segments to correspond to eddy perimeters. This algorithm combines a Non-Euclidean Voronoi segmentation technique with insights from existing work on eddy detection from an oceanographic perspective, with the goal of improving the detection of eddy features through sea level anomaly imagery. It takes into account multiple criteria (vorticity, size, amplitude, the existence of local sea level extrema, concave or convex shape) to iteratively refine the identification and demarcation of oceanic eddies. The resulting polygons define tightly fitted eddy boundaries, and conform to the key rotational and cross-sectional height profile characteristics used by physical oceanographers to identify eddies.

The empirical prediction of September sea ice extent using its trend and two climate variables IST and wind vorticity exhibits a statistically significant relationship (R = 0.97) with a time lag, where IST maximum in summer (June-July) corresponds to the sea ice extent minimum in September. This suggests that IST may serve as an indicator of the basin-wide heat energy accumulated in the Arctic by solar radiation and large-scale atmospheric heat transport from lower latitudes. The process of inducing higher IST is related to the change of atmospheric circulation over the Arctic. Averaged IST and 850 hPa relative vorticity of the polar region show a significant negative correlation ( 0.57) in boreal summer (June-August), suggesting a weakening of the polar vortex in the case of warmer-than-normal IST conditions. Weakening of the polar vortex is accompanied by above-normal surface pressure. Minimum sea ice extent in September was successfully predicted by both multiple linear regression and machine learning support vector regression using preceding summer IST and wind vorticity along with the trend of sea ice extent (R-2 similar to 0.95, cross validation RMSE of 3-4 x 10(5) km(2), and relative cross validation RMSE of 5-8%).

Specifically, we investigated change in area impacted by selective logging, change in tall canopy (30 m +) area, change in lidar canopy structure metrics, and change in above ground biomass (AGB) using a model-based statistical framework. Ground plot measurements were only available from the time of the 2010 lidar acquisition. A simple differencing of the 2010 and 2011 lidar canopy height models identified areas where canopy over 30 m tall had been removed. Area of tall canopy dropped from 22.8% in 2010 to 18.7% in 2011, a reduction of 4.1%. Using a relative density model (RDM) technique the increase in area of roads, skidtrails, landings, and felled tree gaps was estimated to be 17.1%. A lidar-based regression model for estimating AGB was developed using lidar metrics from the 2010 lidar acquisition and corresponding AGB ground plot measurements. The estimator was then used to compute AGB estimates for the site in 2010 and 2011 using the 2010 and 2011 lidar acquisition data, respectively. A model-based statistical approach was then used to estimate the uncertainty of the changes in AGB between the acquisitions. Change in RDMs between lidar acquisitions was used to classify each 50 m cell in the study area as impacted or non-impacted by logging. The change in mean AGB for the entire study area was -9.1 Mg ha(-1) +/- 1.9 (mean +/- SD) (P-value < 0.0001). The change in mean AGB for areas newly impacted in 2011 was -17.9 +/- 3.1 Mg ha(-1) (P-value < 0.0001) while the change in mean AGB for non-impacted areas was significantly less at -2.6 +/- 1.1 Mg ha(-1) (P-value = 0.009). These results provide corroborating evidence of the spatial extent and magnitude of change due to low-intensity logging in tropical forests with heavy residual canopy cover.

Vegetation albedo primarily varies along with the growing season while soil albedo shows day-to-day variations caused by rainfall events. In this study, the objective is to disentangle soil albedo from surface albedo within the visible (VIS) and near infrared (NIR) spectral bands of MODIS and SEVIRI sensors in order to yield a calibration with surface soil moisture (SSM). In a first step, we derive global static maps of soil and vegetation albedos from MODIS products at the resolution of 0.05 degrees over a 4-year period. In a second step, we estimate a daily MODIS white-sky albedo (WSA) by combining 8-day BRDF and TERRA/AQUA reflectance values for each orbit pass. These MODIS products are then projected on the SEVIRI grid of 4 km for further comparison. Then, a physical method is presented to get a daily soil albedo from both MODIS and SEVIRI data. Good correlations are obtained between satellite time series for 2007 and 2008 of retrieved soil albedo and in situ SSM measurements at the 12 SMOSMANIA stations located in southwestern France. A function of an exponential type between albedo and SSM, as supported by the theory, could be verified. As in the VIS domain, the goodness of fit r(2) is about 0.42 and 0.54 for Lahas and Condom, respectively. The Chi-Square test indicates that the relationship is significant with p-value <0.01. Finally, it is shown that most anomalies of soil albedo correlate with anomalies of soil wetness, which yields crucial importance for studying the energy budget.

Field data for ice velocity were used to relocate the footprints collected by different campaigns. Cross-validation was conducted with freeboards extracted from crossovers observed within 30 days of each other. The precision of the freeboard extraction is approximately +/- 0.50 m, when taking one standard deviation as the precision. The freeboard varied from 23 m to 59 m with the mean of 41 m. With assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium (assuming a snow layer, depth of 1 m, a snow density of 360 kg/m(3), an ice density of 915 kg/m(3) and a sea water density of 1024 kg/m(3)), the minimum, maximum and average ice thickness were calculated as 210 m, 550 m and 383 m respectively.

It is possible to calculate an index, which maps the magnitude of improbable change (relative to long term average conditions) following known volcanic eruptions by using low resolution, initial estimates of chlorophyll and bacicscatter along with an archived history of satellite data. We apply multivariate probability analysis to changes in global satellite ocean chlorophyll and particulate backscatter data to create a new metric for observing apparent biological responses to submarine eruptions.

Basin scale validation was performed using annual gridded FLUXNET ET (GFET) and annual basin water balance ET (WBET) data aggregated by various hydrologic unit code (HUC) levels. Point scale validation using monthly data aggregated by years revealed that the MOD16 ET and SSEBop Er products showed overall comparable annual accuracies. For most land cover types, both ET products showed comparable results. However, SSEBop showed higher performance for Grassland and Forest classes; MOD16 showed improved performance in the Woody Savanna class. Accuracy of both the Er products was also found to be comparable over different climate zones. However, SSEBop data showed higher skill score across the climate zones covering the western United States. Validation results at different HUC levels over 2000-2011 using GFET as a reference indicate higher accuracies for MOD16 ET data. MOD16, SSEBop and GFET data were validated against WBET (2000-2009), and results indicate that both MOD16 and SSEBop ET matched the accuracies of the global GFET dataset at different HUC levels. Our results indicate that both MODIS ET products effectively reproduced basin scale ET response (up to 25% uncertainty) compared to CONUS-wide point-based Er response (up to 50-60% uncertainty) illustrating the reliability of MODIS ET products for basin-scale Er estimation. Results from this research would guide the additional parameter refinement required for the MOD16 and SSEBop algorithms in order to further improve their accuracy and performance for agro-hydrologic applications.

Topographic airborne laser scanning has become an established technique to characterize the Earth\'s surface: lidar provides 3D point clouds allowing for a fine reconstruction of the topography while preserving high frequencies of the relief. For flood hazard modeling, the key step, before going onto terrain modeling, is the discrimination of land and water areas within the delivered point clouds. Therefore, instantaneous shorelines, river banks, and inland waters can be extracted as a basis for more reliable DTM generation. This paper presents an automatic, efficient, and versatile workflow for land/water classification of airborne topographic lidar points, effective at large scales (>300 km(2)). For that purpose, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method is used as a classification framework and it is embedded in a workflow designed for our specific goal. First, a restricted but carefully designed set of features, based only on 3D lidar point coordinates and flightline information, is defined as classifier input. Then, the SVM learning step is performed on small but well-targeted areas thanks to a semiautomatic region growing strategy. Finally, label probability output by SVM is merged with contextual knowledge during a probabilistic relaxation step in order to remove pixel-wise misclassification. Results show that a survey of hundreds of millions of points are labeled with high accuracy (>95% in most cases for coastal areas, and >90% for rivers) and that small natural and anthropic features of interest are still well classified even though we work at low point densities (0.5-4 pts/m(2)). We also noticed that it may fail in water-logged areas. Nevertheless, our approach remains valid for regional and national mapping purposes, coasts and rivers, and provides a strong basis for further discrimination of land-cover classes and coastal habitats.

In the absence of an established consensus for the climatology of soil moisture over large domains, presenting a RMSE in soil moisture units requires that it be specified relative to a selected reference data set. To avoid the complications that arise from the use of a reference, the RMSE is presented as a fraction of the local time series standard deviation (fRMSE). For both sensors, the fRMSE(TC) and fRMSE(EP) show similar spatial patterns of relatively high/low errors, and the mean fRMSE for each land cover class is consistent with expectations. Triple colocation is also shown to be surprisingly robust to representativity differences between the soil moisture data sets used, and it is believed to accurately estimate the fRMSE in the remotely sensed soil moisture anomaly time series. Comparing the ASCAT and AMSR-E fRMSE(TC) shows that in general both data sets have good skill over low to moderate vegetation cover. Additionally, they have similar accuracy even when considered by land cover class, although the AMSR-E fRMSEs show a stronger signal of the vegetation cover. (c) 2013 The Authors.

Time series of hotspots, of deforested area and of rainfall (all derived from satellite data) were used to determine the temporal and spatial distributions of fire in Brazil\'s state of Amazonas in order to establish the seasonal patterns of each variable and interactions with biomass burning. From 2003 to 2012, 60% of the hotspots detected were in the southern part of the state, with high variability between different months and years. Between 95% and 99% of the hotspots were recorded during the period of greatest occurrence of burning (July to March) with peaks during the months of August, September and October (the months with the lowest precipitation), suggesting that fires in Amazonas are mainly initiated by humans. Deforestation activity occurs approximately three months before the start of the burning activity. The number of hotspots did not show a relationship with the area deforested but showed a strong inverse relationship with rainfall. There is marked seasonal and annual variability, with patterns changing over time. Over the last decade the hotspots detected in Amazonas are associated not only with changes in land use and cover, but also with the use of fire in managing deforested areas. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Because of its frequent revisits (as little as every 3 h) and adequate spatial resolution (250 m), MODIS bands 1 and 2 have significant potential for mapping the extent of flooded areas and estimating river discharge even for medium-sized basins. Specifically, the different behaviour of water and land in the Near Infrared (NIR) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is exploited by computing the ratio (C/M) of the MODIS channel 2 reflectance values between two pixels located within (M) and outside (C), but close to, the river. The values of C/M increase with the presence of water and, hence, with discharge. Moreover, in order to reduce the noise effects due to atmospheric contribution, an exponential smoothing filter is applied, thus obtaining C/M-*.   Time series of hourly mean flow velocity and discharge between 2005 and 2011 measured at four gauging stations located along the Po river (Northern Italy) are employed for testing the capability of C/M* to estimate discharge/flow velocity. Specifically, the meanders and urban areas are considered the best locations for the position of the pixels M and C, respectively. Considering the optimal pixels, the agreement between C/M-* and discharge/flow velocity is fairly good with values in the range of 0.65-0.77. Additionally, the application to ungauged sites is tested by deriving a unique regional relationship between C/M-* and flow velocity valid for the whole Po river and providing only a slight deterioration of the performance. Finally, the sensitivity of the results to the selection of the C and M pixels is investigated by randomly changing their location. Also in this case, the agreement with in situ observations of velocity is fairly satisfactory (r similar to 0.6). The obtained results demonstrate the capability of MODIS to monitor discharge (and flow velocity). Therefore, its application for a larger number of sites worldwide will be the object of future studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The sensors are mounted on a rotating platform that compensates for changing solar and ship azimuth angles, optimizing the sensor azimuth for minimal contribution of sky radiance to measured water-leaving radiance. This sea-surface reflectance (rho(s)) lies in the order of 25-8% of sky radiance, and is determined through spectral optimization, minimizing the propagation of atmospheric absorption features to R-rs. Up to 15 of these gas absorption features are frequently recognized in (ir)radiance spectra under clear and overcast skies. R-rs was satisfactorily reproduced for a wide range of simulated Case 2 waters and clear sky conditions. A set of 13,784 in situ measurements collected with optimized viewing angles on the high-absorption, low-scattering Baltic Sea was collected in April and July 2010-2011. The processing procedure yielded a 22% retrieval rate of rho(s) for the field data. The shape of the subsurface irradiance reflectance measurements (R(0(-))) measured at anchor stations was well reproduced in above-surface R-rs in those cases where the algorithm converged on a solution for rho(s), except under unstable or weak illumination conditions. Clear-sky conditions resulted in the best correspondence of R-rs and R(0(-)) and gave the highest (>50%) retrieval rates of rho(s). Two indices, derived from the available sensor data, are given to describe illumination conditions, and are shown to predict the ability of the algorithm to retrieve R-rs. (C) 2013 The Authors.

At the Coal Oil Point marine seep field, prominent CH4 anomalies were consistent with advection from known areas of active seepage. For a region with natural CH4 and oil seepage located west of downtown Los Angeles, significant CH4 anomalies were identified for known sources at the La Brea Tar Pits and in close proximity to probable sources, including an office complex documented as venting CH4 continuously and hydrocarbon storage tanks on the Inglewood Oil Field. However, interpretation of anomalies was complicated by noise and false positives for surfaces with strong absorptions at the same wavelengths as CH4 absorption features. Segmentation of results identified 16 distinct locations of contiguous pixels with high CTMF scores and segments were classified into probable CH4 anomalies and confusers based on the spectral properties of the underlying surface over the full spectral range measured by AVIRIS. This technique is particularly well suited for application over large areas to detect CH4 emissions from concentrated point sources and should permit detection of additional trace gasses with distinct absorption features, including carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Thus, imaging spectrometry by an AVIRIS-like sensor has the potential to improve high resolution greenhouse gas mapping, better constraining local sources. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, they present some difficulties to estimate the actual magnitude of fire activity, as the relations between active fires and burned areas are not constant in space and time. Some previous studies have demonstrated that the total burned area can be estimated from the number of hotspots using regional models, but relations were established with coarse resolution data. We present in this paper a more detailed study on the relations between MODE hotspots and burned areas, as extracted from Landsat images, which are commonly considered as reference data for validation of global burned area products. The comparison has been conducted in nine study regions with significant fire activity and in a sample of sites with low fire occurrence. Our results show that MODIS hotspots are very reliable to detect true burned areas, with only 1.8% of them not associated to actual burned patches, except for urban areas where very high commission errors were observed. On the contrary, the number of burned patches not detected by MODIS hotspots was found relatively high considering all fires (36-86%), decreasing for burn patches with a larger size (0-20% for burned patches larger than 500 ha) and for areas with a lower grassland and shrubland cover. A linear relationship between the number of hotspots and the total burned area was observed within each study area. However, the slope of the regression varied strongly between study sites. It was observed that sites with a larger proportion of grass and shrub cover had a larger mean burned area associated to each hotspot. The results presented in this study improve the understanding of the spatial variability and characteristics of the hotspots and should help to use the hotspots in future research.

The model development and analysis is presented to assess the limitations of the existing tau - omega (tau-omega) model with respect to vegetated landscapes and thus to extend the usefulness of the tau - omega model to a wider range of vegetation conditions. An explicit expression is driven for an effective albedo of vegetated terrain from the zero- and multiple-order radiative transfer solutions. The formulation establishes a direct physical link between the effective vegetation parameterization and the theoretical description of absorption and scattering within the canopy. Evaluation of the derived albedo for corn canopies (stem-dominated vegetation) with data taken during the Huntsville 1998 field experiment (Hsv98) are shown and discussed. The simulation results are in good agreement with the data and show that the effective albedo values are significantly smaller than the single-scattering albedo values and increase monotonically as soil moisture increases. The model is also used to simulate effective albedo from a soybean canopy (leaf dominated vegetation) at L-band. Both results illustrate that the fitted albedo values, which are found in the literature, represent effective albedo values rather than the single-scattering albedo values. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

At present, the WF-ABBA validation activities and, in general, fire product validation methodologies are at a markedly less advanced stage than the algorithm itself. Particularly, little is known about detection timeliness, despite the value of such information for assessing the potential of geostationary observations to improve tactical decision making of first responders. This paper contributes to reducing this gap in two ways. Firstly, we describe a new methodology that is suitable for evaluating geostationary satellite wildfire detection in terms of incidents with regard to both timeliness and reliability. This methodology utilizes available official multi-agency wildfire reporting information and multitemporal Landsat imagery. Secondly, we apply the proposed validation method to temporally filtered GOES-West WF-ABBA (ver. 6.1) detections for the 2006 fire season over the State of California and present incident-wise and pixel-wise performance information. The results indicate highly reliable pixel-wise performance of WF-ABBA, with about 75% of fire pixels (or more) corresponding to actual recorded active wildfires. A substantial portion of wildfires were detected during their first hour of activity, and a few incident-even before the initial reports from conventional sources. Although the WF-ABBA performs best at what it was designed for: consistently re-detecting (monitoring) active fires, we believe there is an additional potential for automated detection from current geostationary data to reduce wildfire ignition latencies in the Western U.S. Our results can serve as a guideline for algorithm developers and users of the WF-ABBA fire product.

Air temperature data is usually obtained from measurements made in meteorological stations, providing only limited information about spatial patterns over wide areas. The use of remote sensing data can help overcome this problem, particularly in areas with low station density, having the potential to improve the estimation of T-air at both regional and global scales. Some studies have tried to derive maximum (T-max), minimum (T-min) and average air temperature (T-avg) using different methods, with variable estimation accuracy; errors generally fall in the 2-3 degrees C range while the level of precision generally considered as accurate is 1-2 degrees C. The main objective of this study was to accurately estimate T-max, T-min and T-avg for a 10 year period based on remote sensing-Land Surface Temperature (LST) data obtained from MODIS-and auxiliary data using a statistical approach. An optimization procedure with a mixed bootstrap and jackknife resampling was employed. The statistical models estimated Tavg with a MEF (Model Efficiency Index) of 0.941 and a RMSE of 133 degrees C. Regarding T-max and T-min, the best MEF achieved was 0.919 and 0.871, respectively, with a 1.83 and 1.74 degrees C RMSE. The developed datasets provided weekly 1 km estimations and accurately described both the intra and inter annual temporal and spatial patterns of T-air. Potential sources of uncertainty and error were also analyzed and identified. The most promising developments were proposed with the aim of developing accurate T-air estimations at a larger scale in the future. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, the quantity measured by GRACE represents mass signals integrated over vertical columns, requiring their separation into their original sources. Such a separation is vital for Australia, for which GRACE estimates are affected by leakage from the surrounding oceans. The independent component analysis (ICA) method that uses higher-order statistics, is implemented here to separate GRACE-derived water storage signals over the Australian continent from its surrounding oceans, covering from October 2002 to May 2011. The performance of ICA applied to GRACE is then compared to the ICA of WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM) and the ICA of the Australian Water Resources Assessment (AWRA) system. To study the influence of rainfall variability on the derived independent patterns. use is made of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) data set, from January 2000 to May 2011. Implementing ICA on GRACE-INNS showed a remarkable improvement in separating the continental hydrological signals from the surrounding oceanic anomalies, which was not achievable using a conventional principle component analysis. Reconstructing the continental TWS changes using only those independent components of GRACE that were located over the continent showed a high correlation with WGHM-TWS and AWRA-TWS. Mass concentrations over the oceans and particularly 52 semi-diurnal aliased pattern were separated as independent modes. Correlation analysis between the independent components of GRACE and climate teleconnections showed that the mass anomalies over the northern ocean, Gulf of Carpentaria and north-eastern parts of Australia were significantly correlated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, while those over south and south-eastern parts of Australia were mainly linked to the Indian Ocean Dipole.

Remotely sensed nighttime lights datasets derived from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program\'s Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) provide a consistent measure for characterizing trends in urban sprawl over time (Sutton, 2003). The utility of DMSP/OLS imagery for monitoring dynamics in human settlement and economic activity at regional to global scales has been widely verified in previous studies through statistical correlations between nighttime light brightness and demographic and economic variables (Elvidge et al., 2001; Ghosh et al.. 2010). The quantitative relationship between long-term nighttime light signals and urbanization variables. required for extensive application of DMSP/OLS data for estimating and projecting the trajectory of urban development, however, are not well addressed for individual cities at a local scale. We here present analysis results concerning quantitative responses of stable nighttime lights derived from time series of DMSP/OLS imagery to changes in urbanization variables during 1994-2009 for more than 200 prefectural-level cities and municipalities in China. To identify the best-fitting model for nighttime lights-based measurement of urbanization processes with different development patterns, we comparatively use three regression models: linear, power-law and exponential functions to quantify the long-term relationships between nighttime weighted light area and four urbanization variables: population, gross domestic product (GDP), built-up area and electric power consumption. Our results suggest that nighttime light brightness could be an explanatory indicator for estimating urbanization dynamics at the city level. Various quantitative relationships between urban nighttime lights and urbanization variables may indicate diverse responses of DMSP/OLS nighttime light signals to anthropogenic dynamics in urbanization process in terms of demographic and economic variables. At the city level, growth in weighted lit area may take either a linear, concave (exponential) or convex (power law) form responsive to expanding human population and economic activities during urbanization. Therefore, in practice, quantitative models for using DMSP/OLS data to estimate urbanization dynamics should vary with different patterns of urban development, particularly for cities experiencing rapid urban growth at a local scale.

Using all available Landsat 7 images in two years, time series models consisting of sines and cosines are estimated for each pixel for each spectral band. Dropping the coefficients that capture inter-annual change, time series models can predict surface reflectance for pixels at any location and any date assuming persistence of land cover. The Continuous Monitoring of Forest Disturbance Algorithm (CMFDA) flags forest disturbance by differencing the predicted and observed Landsat images. Two algorithms (single-date and multi-date differencing) were tested for detecting forest disturbance at a Savannah River site. The map derived from the multi-date differencing algorithm was chosen as the final CMFDA result, due to its higher spatial and temporal accuracies. It determines a disturbance pixel by the number of times \"change\" is observed consecutively. Pixels showing \"change\" for one or two times are flagged as \"probable change\". If the pixel is flagged for the third time, the pixel is determined to have changed. The accuracy assessment shows that CMFDA results were accurate for detecting forest disturbance, with both produce\'r\'s and user\'s accuracies higher than 95% in the spatial domain and temporal accuracy of approximately 94%.

Although airborne lidar data has been successfully used to develop vegetation canopy height maps in many regions, for vast, sparsely populated regions such as the boreal forest biome, airborne lidar is not widely available. An alternative approach to canopy height mapping in areas where airborne lidar data is limited is to use spaceborne lidar measurements in combination with multiangular and multi-spectral remote sensing data to produce comprehensive canopy height maps for the entire region. This study uses spaceborne lidar data from the Geosciences Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) as training data for regression tree models that incorporate multi-angular and multi-spectral data from the Multi-Angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MODIS) to map vegetation canopy height across a 1,300,000 km(2) swath of boreal forest in Interior Alaska. Results are compared to in situ height measurements as well as airborne lidar data. Although many of the GLAS-derived canopy height estimates are inaccurate, applying a series of filters incorporating both data associated with the GLAS shots as well as ancillary data such as land cover can identify the majority of height estimates with significant errors, resulting in a filtered dataset with much higher accuracy. Results from the regression tree models indicate that late winter MISR imagery acquired under snow-covered conditions is effective for mapping canopy heights ranging from 5 to 15 m, which includes the vast majority of forests in the region. It appears that neither MISR nor MODIS imagery acquired during the growing season is effective for canopy height mapping, although including summer multi-spectral MODIS data along with winter MISR imagery does appear to provide a slight increase in the accuracy of resulting height maps. The finding that winter, snow-covered MISR imagery can be used to map canopy height is important because clear sky days are nearly three times as common during the late winter period as during the growing season. The increased odds of acquiring cloud-free imagery during the target acquisition period make regularly updated forest height inventories for Interior Alaska much more feasible. A major advantage of the GIAS-MISR-MODIS canopy height mapping methodology described here is that this approach uses only data that is freely available worldwide, making the approach potentially applicable across the entire circumpolar boreal forest region.

Accurate model estimates of both Chl a and a(ph)(lambda) were obtained, with le values in logic, space (N= 42) of 0.839 found for Chl a, and for a(ph),(lambda). R-2 values ranging from 0.771 (547 nm) to 0.910 (655 nm). A statistical resampling exercise to create training and test data sets showed that stable models could be built with similar to 15 training spectra and corresponding measurements of Chl a and a(ph)(lambda), providing important guidance for the implementation of this approach at other locations. The applicability of the models to a reduced-wavelength resolution (8 wavebands) dataset was tested, and showed that reduction in wavelength resolution had little impact on the models\' skill, with R-2 values obtained within similar to 1% of the hyperspectral (101 wavelengths) R-2 values for both Chl a and a(ph)(lambda). That the reduced-wavelength resolution models performed as well as the hyperspectral models points to their potential utility for satellite sensors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

OSTIA uses satellite SST data provided by international agencies via the Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) Regional/Global Task Sharing (R/GTS) framework. GHRSST products include data from microwave and infrared satellite instruments with accompanying uncertainty estimates. The system also uses in situ SST data available over the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) and a sea-ice concentration product from the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Applications Facility (OSI-SAF). The SST analysis is a multi-scale optimal interpolation that is designed for applications in numerical weather prediction and ocean forecasting systems. The background error covariance matrix is specified using ocean model data and the analysis uses correlation length scales of 10 km and 100 km. The OSTIA system produces a foundation SST estimate (SSTfnd, which is the SST free of diurnal variability) at an output grid resolution of 1/20 degrees (similar to 6 km) although the smallest analysis feature resolution is based on the correlation length scale of 10 km. All satellite SST data are adjusted for bias errors based on a combination of ENVISAT Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) SST data and in situ SST measurements from drifting buoys. Data are filtered (based on surface wind speed data) to remove diurnal variability and AATSR data are adjusted to represent the SST at the same depth as drifting buoy measurements (0.2-1 m) before bias adjustments are made. Global coverage outputs are provided each day in GHRSST L4 netCDF format. A variety of secondary products are also provided including weekly and monthly mean data sets. OSTIA products are continuously monitored and validation/verification activities demonstrate that SST products have zero mean bias and an accuracy of similar to 0.57 K compared to in situ measurements. OSTIA is now used operationally as a boundary condition for all weather forecast models at the Met Office and at European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF). OSTIA is produced by the Met Office as part of the European Union Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) MyOcean project. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.

The algorithm is based on the structure of the SPARC cloud detection scheme developed at CCRS for AVHRR data, then modified, calibrated and validated for AATSR data. It uses a series of weighted tests to calculate per-pixel cloud presence probability, and also produces an estimate of cloud top height and a cloud shadow flag. Algorithm parameters have been optimized for daytime use in Canada, and evaluation shows good performance with a mean daytime kappa coefficient of 0.76 for the \'cloud\'/\'clear\' classification when compared to independent validation data. Performance is independent of season, and is a dramatic improvement over the existing AATSR L1B cloud flag for Canada.

Site-specific irrigation applies irrigation water to match the needs of individual management zones within a field, significantly reducing water consumption, runoff, and nutrient leaching in ground water. Remote sensing for real-time and continuous soil moisture measurements at specific depths is essential for success of site-specific irrigation system.   The overall objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of utilizing a GPS-based sensor technology to determine site-specific information such as the soil moisture condition by recording the GPS signal reflected from the earth\'s surface. A modified GPS Delay Mapping Receiver (DMR) tracks and measures the direct, line-of-sight, Right-Hand-Circularly Polarized signal of a GPS satellite. It also simultaneously measures the delayed, earth-reflected, near-specular, Left-Hand-Circularly Polarized GPS signal. These measurements can be used to estimate the surface scattering coefficient and path delays between the direct and reflected GPS signals. Over land, scattering coefficients can be used to estimate changes in soil moisture contents. Our results showed that the space-based technology has a great potential for determining soil volumetric moisture contents in the pursuit of site-specific irrigation management. There were strong correlations between the GPS reflectivity measurements and soil moisture contents. The GPS reflectivity increased as the soil moisture contents increased. Careful analysis of the test data showed very conclusively that the sensitivity of L-Band signal (1.575 GHz) to soil moisture contents changed with soil type and sampling depth. The sensitivity decreased with sampling depth in light soils and increased in heavy soils. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Massachusetts, Bartlett Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, and Howland Experimental Forest, Maine, in July 2007. Effective LAI values retrieved by four methods, which ranged from 3.42 to 5.25 depending on the site and method, were not significantly different (beta<0.1 among four methods). The LAI values also matched published values well. Foliage profiles (leaf area with height) retrieved from the lidar scans, although not independently validated, were consistent with stand structure as observed and as measured by conventional methods. Canopy mean top height, as determined from the foliage profiles, deviated from mean RH100 values obtained from the Lidar Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) airborne large-footprint lidar system at 27 plots by -0.91 m with RMSE = 2.04 m, documenting the ability of the EVI to retrieve stand height.

At present, the increasing availability of multisensor acquisitions over the same areas, offers the possibility to combine data from different sensors (e.g., optical, RADAR, LiDAR). This paper presents an analysis on the fusion of airborne LiDAR and satellite multispectral data (IRS 1C LISS III), for the prediction of forest stem volume at plot level in a complex mountain area (Province of Trento, Southern Italian Alps), characterized by different tree species, complex morphology (i.e. altitude ranges from 65 m to 3700 m above sea level), and a range of different climates (from the sub-Mediterranean to Alpine type). 799 sample plots were randomly distributed over the 3000 km(2) of the forested areas of the Trento Province. From each plot, a set of variables were extracted from both LiDAR and multispectral data. A regression analysis was carried out considering two data sources (LiDAR and multispectral) and their combination, and dividing the plot areas into groups according to their species composition, altitude and slope. Experimental results show that the combination of LiDAR and IRS 1C LISS III data, for the estimation of stem volume, is effective in all the experiments considered. The best developed models comprise variables extracted from both of these data sources. The RMSE% on an independent validation set for the stem volume estimation models ranges between 17.2% and 26.5%, considering macro sets of tree species (deciduous, evergreen and mixed), between 17.5% and 29.0%, considering dominant species plots, and between 15.5% and 213% considering altitude and slope sets.

A time-varying annual signal explains 61% of the variance of the data, in good agreement with two independent estimates of the same quantity from hydrological models. Water mass content variations across Australia are linked to Pacific and Indian Ocean variability, associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), respectively. From 1989, positive (negative) IOD phases were related to anomalously low (high) precipitation in southeastern Australia, associated with a reduced (enhanced) tropical moisture flux. In particular, the sustained water mass content reduction over central and southern regions of Australia during the period 2006-2008 is associated with three consecutive positive IOD events.

At the first location, a subsidence trough of about 4 cm in the satellite line-of-sight direction following the headrace tunnel axes has been measured between August 1995 and August 1996. Similar values from SAR data of ascending and descending orbits indicate displacements in the vertical direction of the movement. In the second case, a symmetric cone of depression with a maximum displacement of about 4 cm between 1995 and 1997 has been observed above the tunnel. Differences in the results from satellite SAR data of ascending and descending orbits indicate that the direction of displacement in this second case was not entirely vertical. Large-scale consolidation associated with pore-pressure reduction in the rock mass arising from tunnel drainage at about 200-400 m depth beneath the topographical surface is believed to be the contributing mechanism (Zangerl et al., 2008a, 2008b). Evidence for this process is based on pore pressure recordings in nearby deep wells. In both areas, the subsidence was followed by a small uplift of about one centimeter between 1997 and 1999, after the tunnel was cased with permeable concrete segments. This partial recovery is also visible in pore pressure records and can be related to the elastic components of rock mass deformation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This prominent patch was not observed in the historical ocean color satellite imageries in late 1970s to early 1980s, and a location corresponding to this patch has been used as a Korean dump site since 1988. At the same time, MODIS chlorophyll-a concentrations derived using the shortwave infrared (SWIR) atmospheric correction algorithm developed for the ocean color satellite data in turbid coastal or high-productive ocean waters were significantly reduced.   Comparison between in situ and MODIS chlorophyll-a measurements shows that the chlorophyll-a from the MODIS-Aqua products using the standard-NIR atmospheric correction algorithm is significantly overestimated. The images of the MODIS-derived normalized water-leaving radiance spectra and water diffuse attenuation coefficient data using the NIR-SWIR-based atmospheric correction approach show that absorption and scattering by organic and inorganic matter dumped in the Korean dump site have strongly influenced the satellite-derived chlorophyll-a data. Therefore, the biased high chlorophyll-a patch in the region is in fact an overestimation of chlorophyll-a values due to large errors from the standard-NIR atmospheric correction algorithm. Using the NIR-SWIR algorithm for MODIS-Aqua ocean color data processing, ocean color products from 2002 to 2008 for the Korean dump site region have been generated and used for characterizing the ocean optical and biological properties. Results show that there have been some important changes in the seasonal and interannual variations of phytoplankton biomass and other water optical and biological properties induced by colored dissolved organic matters, as well as suspended sediments.

In the first approach, image intensities are interpolated to a desired sub-pixel resolution using a bi-cubic interpolation scheme prior to the actual displacement matching. In the second approach, the image pairs are correlated at the original image resolution and the peaks of the correlation coefficient surface are then located at the desired sub-pixel resolution using three techniques, namely bi-cubic interpolation, parabola fitting and Gaussian fitting. Both principal approaches are applied to three typical mass movement types: rockglacier creep, glacier flow and land sliding. In addition, the influence of pixel resolution on the accuracies of displacement measurement using image matching is evaluated using repeat images resampled to different spatial resolutions. Our results show that bi-cubic interpolation of image intensity performs best followed by bi-cubic interpolation of the correlation surface. Both Gaussian and parabolic peak locating turn out less accurate. By increasing the spatial resolution (i.e. reducing the ground pixel size) of the matched images by 2 to 16 times using intensity interpolation, 40% to 80% reduction in mean error in reference to the same resolution original image could be achieved.

Remote sensing techniques in this context are very advantageous and potentially allow overcoming the spatial limitations of traditional in situ point observations, providing new opportunities for a better understanding of the relevant bio-geomorphological processes and for the calibration and validation of spatially-distributed hydrodynamic and transport models. Remote sensing of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration in shallow waters must, however, overcome the difficulties associated with i) the influence of bottom reflection, which may interfere with an accurate retrieval; ii) the necessity of accurately knowing the optical properties of the suspended matter, and iii) the importance of providing an assessment of the uncertainty associated with the estimates produced. This work presents a method to estimate SPM concentration in lagoon/estuarine waters by use of a simplified radiative transfer model. We use a calibration/validation method based on cross-validation and bootstrap techniques to provide a statistically sound determination of model parameters and an evaluation of the uncertainty induced by their inaccurate determination as well as by the uncertain knowledge of the bottom sediment reflectance. The method is applied to the Venice lagoon, using observations from a network of turbidity sensors and from several multispectral satellite sensors (LANDSAT, ASTER and ALOS AVNIR). The bootstrap and cross-validation procedures employed show that consistent estimates of SPM concentration can indeed be retrieved from satellite remote sensing, provided that sufficient in situ ancillary information for appropriate calibration is available. The quantification of the estimation uncertainty shows that retrievals obtained from remote sensing are accurate, robust and repeatable. The SPM concentration maps produced show a general coherence with known features in the Venice lagoon and, together with suitable biological information, point to the role played by benthic vegetation in the stabilization of the bottom sediment.

These data sets allowed a detailed assessment of the impact of measurement geometry as represented by the solar zenith angle theta(s), sensor view zenith angle theta(v) and azimuth view angle in the estimation of LCF values by means of the spectral unmixing model (SUM). The bidirectional distribution function (BRDF) was fitted to the reflectance data and then used to produce reflectance at various measurement geometries. LCFs from these reflectance data for a given combination of theta(s), theta(v), and phi were compared with visually determined LCFs. It was found that theta(s) in the range of 30-45 degrees produced a better agreement of LCFs. For theta(v) the agreement is not very sensitive to the choice of angle for the range 30-70 degrees, although theta(v) = 50 degrees showed a slightly better performance. The azimuth view angle does not have strong influences to the LCF estimation, except for the case of phi = 180 degrees (view toward the sun), which does not allow precise fitting of BRDF function over a tall vegetation site. Overall, this study verified the results of earlier studies obtained mostly for the American continents that SUM is capable of producing LCF estimates accurately and also found that its accuracy was, in general, much better than that by the more traditional approach of the supervised classification method (SCM) applied to images of a digital camera.

In addition to quantifying changes to the spatial and temporal patterns of burned areas, observing variations in severity is the key to studying the impact of changes to the fire regime on carbon cycling, energy budgets, and post-fire succession. Remote sensing indices of fire severity have not consistently been well-correlated with in situ observations of important severity characteristics in Alaskan black spruce stands, including depth of burning of the surface organic layer. The incorporation of ancillary data such as in situ observations and GIS layers with spectral data from Landsat TM/ETM+ greatly improved efforts to map the reduction of the organic layer in burned black spruce stands. Using a regression tree approach, the R-2 of the organic layer depth reduction models was 0.60 and 0.55 (p<0.01) for relative and absolute depth reduction, respectively. All of the independent variables used by the regression tree to estimate burn depth can be obtained independently of field observations. Implementation of a gradient boosting algorithm improved the R-2 to 0.80 and 0.79 (p<0.01) for absolute and relative organic layer depth reduction, respectively. Independent variables used in the regression tree model of burn depth included topographic position, remote sensing indices related to soil and vegetation characteristics, timing of the fire event, and meteorological data. Post-fire organic layer depth characteristics are determined for a large (>200,000 ha) fire to identify areas that are potentially vulnerable to a shift in post-fire succession. This application showed that 12% of this fire event experienced fire severe enough to support a change in post-fire succession. We conclude that non-parametric models and ancillary data are useful in the modeling of the surface organic layer fire depth. Because quantitative differences in post-fire surface characteristics do not directly influence spectral properties, these modeling techniques provide better information than the use of remote sensing data alone.

These data are then compared with ACID from two Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) ground-based sun photometer measurement sites for nearly six years (2000-2005). These two sites include Capo Verde (CV) (16 degrees N, 24 degrees W) near the Saharan dust source region and La Paguera (LP) (18 degrees N, 67 degrees W) that is downwind of the dust source regions. The AOD is two to three times higher during spring and summer months over CV when compared to LP and the surrounding regions. For a unit ACID value, the instantaneous TOA shortwave direct radiative effect (DRE) defined as the change in shortwave flux between clear and aerosol skies for CV and LP are -53 and -68 Wm(-2) respectively. DIRE for LP is likely more negative due to fall out of larger particles during transport from CV to LP. However, separating the CERES-derived DIRE by MODIS aerosol effective radii was difficult. Satellite and ground-based dust aerosol data sets continue to be useful to understand dust processes related to the surface and the atmosphere. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The albedo was significantly smaller than those reported in earlier studies in the PAS for the same region because of an overall decrease in ice concentration.

Remote sensing can reveal spatio-temporal growth trajectories of cities, which again allow a thorough understanding of the impacts of urbanization on ecosystems and ecosystem services. However, the mapping of urban areas remains one of the most challenging tasks of remote sensing data analysis. This paper presents an approach to map urban growth from multi-sensoral data, exemplified for the Dhaka megacity region in Bangladesh between 1990 and 2006. The approach is globally applicable and can facilitate regional urban growth maps in arbitrary complex and dynamic environments.   Dhaka\'s densified urban landscape, its deltaic locality and the highly dynamic monsoon-related phenology call for a sophisticated analysis approach that is able to separate intra-annual land-cover variations from actual urbanization. Imagery from the Landsat series of satellites is a great asset for such an analysis due to its synoptic coverage of large urban areas as well as its unique historical archives. In our approach, we solve problems of spectral ambiguities and seasonal phenological dynamics through incorporating multi-temporal imagery for each monitoring year (1990, 2000, and 2006) and by extending the spectral feature space with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The resulting datasets are heterogeneous and comprise measurements of unequal scaling. Non-parametric classification algorithms are required to delineate multi-modal and non-Gaussian class distributions of heterogeneous as well as temporally and spectrally complex land-cover classes of interest in such an extended feature space. We therefore used a support vector machine (SVM) classifier and post classification comparison to reveal spatio-temporal patterns of urban land-use and land-cover changes. An SVM based forward feature selection procedure allowed deriving in-depth information about the individual contribution of different input bands.   Our methodology delineated relevant land-cover classes and resulted in overall accuracies better than 83% for all years considered. Change analysis unveiled a profound expansion of urban areas at the expense of prime agricultural areas and wetlands. During the 1990s, change was primarily characterized by a densification of urban fabric, whereas more recent changes included vast in-filling of low lying land and an extensive industrial sprawl into Dhaka\'s peri-urban areas. Our multi-sensoral and multi-temporal mapping approach allowed for delineating temporally dynamic LULCC, which again allowed for an insightful characterization of land system changes in the megacity region of Dhaka.

Regional expert knowledge was used to train passive optical remotely sensed imagery of the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors, JERS-1 active radar L-band imagery, and topographical indices derived from 3 arc sec elevation data of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). All data inputs were resampled to a common 57 m resolution grid. A classification tree bagging procedure was employed to produce a final map of per-grid cell wetland probability. Thirty bagged trees were ranked and the median result was selected to produce the final wetland probability map. Thresholding the probability map at <0.5 yielded a proportion of wetland cover for the study area of 32%, equivalent to 360.000 km(2). Wetlands predominate in the CARPE Lake Tele-Lake Tumba landscape located in the western part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the south-eastern Republic of Congo, where they constitute 56% of the landscape. Local topography depicting relative elevation for sub-catchments proved to be the most valuable discriminator of wetland cover. However, all sources of information (i.e. optical, radar and topography) featured prominently in contributing to the classification tree procedure, reinforcing the idea that multi-source data are useful in the characterization of wetland land cover. The method employed freely available data and a fully automated process, except for training data collection. Comparisons to existing maps and in situ field observations indicate improvements compared to previous efforts. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This method brings together knowledge of the intrinsic biophysical properties of a measurement site, and the surrounding landscape to produce a number of geostatistical attributes that describe the overall variability, spatial extent, strength of the spatial correlation, and spatial structure of surface albedo patterns at separate seasonal periods throughout the year. Variogram functions extracted from Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) retrievals of surface albedo using multiple spatial and temporal thresholds were used to assess the degree to which a given point (tower) measurement is able to capture the intrinsic variability of the immediate landscape extending to a satellite pixel. A validation scheme was implemented over a wide range of forested landscapes, looking at both deciduous and coniferous sites, from tropical to boreal ecosystems. The experiment focused on comparisons between tower measurements of surface albedo acquired at local solar noon and matching retrievals from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Collection V005) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)/albedo algorithm. Assessments over a select group of field stations with comparable landscape features and daily retrieval scenarios further demonstrate the ability of this technique to identify measurement sites that contain the intrinsic spatial and seasonal features of surface albedo over sufficiently large enough footprints for use in modeling and remote sensing studies. This approach, therefore, improves our understanding of product uncertainty both in terms of the representativeness of the field data and its relationship to the larger satellite pixel.

Today, passive RS of F is feasible with different prototypes and commercial ground-based, airborne, and even spaceborne instruments under certain conditions. This interest is generating an increasing number of research projects linking F and RS, such as the development of new F remote retrieval techniques, the understanding of the link between the F signal and vegetation physiology and the feasibility of a satellite mission specifically designed for F monitoring. This paper reviews the main issues to be addressed for estimating F from RS observations. Scattered information about F estimation exists in the literature. Here, more than 40 scientific papers dealing with F estimation are reviewed and major differences are found in approaches, instruments and experimental setups. Different approaches are grouped into major categories according to RS data requirements (i.e. radiance or reflectance, multispectral or hyperspectral) and techniques used to extract F from the remote signal. Theoretical assumptions. advantages and drawbacks of each method are outlined and provide perspectives for future research. Finally, applications of the measured F signal at the three scales of observation (ground, aircraft and satellite) are presented and discussed to provide the state of the art in F estimation.

The high temporal and spatial variability of the atmospheric emissions combined with the lack of a proven methodology to monitor LSEDs at the global scale make the timing, location and extent of vegetation disturbance a significant uncertainty in understanding the global carbon cycle. The MODIS Global Disturbance Index (MGDI) algorithm is designed for large-scale, regular, disturbance mapping using Aqua/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Aqua/MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data. The MGDI uses annual maximum composite LST data to detect fundamental changes in land-surface energy partitioning, while avoiding the high natural variability associated with tracking LST at daily, weekly, or seasonal time frames. Here we apply the full Aqua/MODIS dataset through 2006 to the improved MGDI algorithm across the woody ecosystems of North America and test the algorithm by comparison with confirmed, historical wildfire events and the windfall areas of documented major hurricanes. The MGDI accurately detects the location and extent of wildfire throughout North America and detects high and moderate severity impacts in the windfall area of major hurricanes. We also find detections associated with clear-cut logging and land-clearing on the forest-agricultural interface. The MGDI indicates that 1.5% (195,580 km(2)) of the woody ecosystems within North America was disturbed in 2005 and 0.5% (67,451 km(2)) was disturbed in 2006.

In a pixel containing green and/or dry vegetation the depth of the AlOH feature at 2.20 mu m is decreased. Since the depth of the feature at 2.20 mu m is an indicator of the AlOH content it is desirable to correct the depth of the 2.20 mu m feature in such a manner as to remove, or negate, the obscuring effect of the vegetation. This is achieved by using a multiple linear regression model where the coefficients of the linear model are produced via forward modeling, and where the independent variables are continuum removed band depth (CRBD) that are used to detect the presence of green and dry vegetation and the uncorrected AlOH CRBD. The proposed vegetation corrected continuum depth (VCCD) method was tested with synthetic datasets as well as hyperspectral data (HyMap) collected at Mount Isa in Queensland, Australia. The results of using the VCCD method on the uncorrected HyMap data were validated with vegetation free samples collected from the Mount Isa region. Improvements in the R squared statistics of the corrected 2.20 mu m CRBD to the vegetation free CRBD, after application of the VCCD, were found to be 2-4 times greater than the uncorrected 2.20 mu m CRBD. Visual inspection of large survey areas demonstrated that the uncorrected CRBD in vegetated areas were lower, and did not match adjacent vegetation free areas, and also produced false positives of high AlOH content.

In these wavelengths, reflectance decreases dramatically as the snow grains evolve and grow, whereas in the visible spectrum snow reflectance is degraded by contaminants such as dust, algae, and soot. From imaging spectrometer data, we can estimate the grain size of the snow in the surface layer, and thereby derive spectral and broadband albedo. We can also estimate the fraction of each pixel that is covered by snow, the liquid water content in the surface layer, and the amount of radiative forcing caused by absorbing impurities. Estimates of fractional snow-covered area and albedo dramatically improve the performance of spatially distributed snowmelt models that include net solar radiation as an input value, most significantly in locations and at times where incident solar radiation is high and temperatures low. Experience with imaging spectrometer data has allowed extension of the fractional snow-cover and albedo estimates to multispectral sensors, particularly MODIS, the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer.

PROSAIL has also been used to develop new methods for retrieval of vegetation biophysical properties. It links the spectral variation of canopy reflectance, which is mainly related to leaf biochemical contents, with its directional variation, which is primarily related to canopy architecture and soil/vegetation contrast. This link is key to simultaneous estimation of canopy biophysical/structural variables for applications in agriculture, plant physiology, or ecology, at different scales. PROSAIL has become one of the most popular radiative transfer tools due to its ease of use, general robustness, and consistent validation by lab/field/space experiments over the years. However, PROSPECT and SAIL are still evolving: they have undergone recent improvements both at the leaf and the plant levels. This paper provides an extensive review of the PROSAIL developments in the context of canopy biophysics and radiative transfer modeling. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Results of this study indicated that the MODIS products captured the seasonal variation in GPP, LAI and fPAR well. Using the index of agreement (IOA), it was found that Collections 4.5 and 4.8 (IOA 0.89 respectively) agreed reasonably well with flux tower measurements between 2001 and 2006. It was also found that MODIS Collection 4.5 predicted the dry season GPP well (Relative Predictive Error (RPE) 4.17%, IOA 0.72 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.05 g C m(-2) day(-1)), whilst Collection 4.8 performed better in capturing wet season dynamics (RPE 1.11%, IOA 0.80 and RMSE of 0.91 g C m(-2) day(-1)). Although the wet season magnitude of GPP was predicted well by Collection 4.8, an examination of the inputs to the GPP algorithm revealed that MODIS fPAR was too high, but this was compensated by PAR and WE that was too low. Although LAI and fPAR estimated by Collection 5 were more accurate. GPP for this Collection resulted in a much lower value (RPE 25%) due to errors in other factors. Recalculation of MODIS GPP using site specific input parameters indicated that MODIS fPAR was the main reason for the differences between MODIS and tower derived GPP followed by WE and meteorological inputs. GPP calculated using all site specific values agreed very well with tower data on an annual basis (IOA 0.94, RPE 6.06% and RMSE 0.83 g C m(-2) day(-1)) but the early initiation of the growing season calculated by the MODIS algorithm was improved when the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) function was replaced with a soil water deficit function. The results of this study however, reinforce previous findings in water limited regions, like Australia, and incorporation of soil moisture in a LUE model is needed to accurately estimate the productivity.

This interest has been motivated by the important role that these substances play in physiological processes such as photosynthesis, their relationships with ecosystem processes such as litter decomposition and nutrient cycling, and their use in identifying key plant species and functional groups. This paper reviews three areas of research to improve the application of imaging spectrometers to quantify non-pigment biochemical constituents of plants. First, we examine recent empirical and modeling studies that have advanced our understanding of leaf and canopy reflectance spectra in relation to plant biochemistry. Next, we present recent examples of how spectroscopic remote sensing methods are applied to characterize vegetation canopies, communities and ecosystems. Third, we highlight the latest developments in using imaging spectrometer data to quantify net primary production (NPP) over large geographic areas.

Photosynthetic systems evolved early in Earth history and have been stable for 2.5 billion years, providing prima facie evidence for the significance of pigments in plant functions. Photosynthetic pigments fill multiple roles from increasing the range of energy captured for photosynthesis to protective functions. Given the importance of pigments to leaf functioning, greater effort is needed to determine whether individual pigments can be identified and quantified in vivo using high fidelity spectroscopy. We review recent advances in detecting plant pigments at the leaf level and discuss successes and reasons why challenges remain for robust remote observation and quantification. New methods to identify and quantify individual pigments in the presence of overlapping absorption features would provide a major advance in understanding their biological functions, quantifying net carbon exchange, and identifying plant stresses.

Remote sensing is an established method for the detection and mapping of dust events, and has recently been used to identify dust source locations with varying degrees of success. This paper compares and evaluates five principal methods, using MODIS Level 1B and MODIS Level 2 aerosol data, to: (a) differentiate dust (mineral aerosol) from nondust, and (2) determine the extent to which they enable the source of the dust to be discerned. The five MODIS LIB methods used here are: (1) un-processed false colour composite (FCC), (2) brightness temperature difference, (3) Ackerman\'s (1997: J.Geophys. Res., 102, 17069-17080) procedure, (4) Miller\'s (2003:Geophys. Res. Lett. 30, 20, art.no.2071) dust enhancement algorithm and (5) Roskovensky and Liou\'s (2005: Geophys. Res. Lett. 32, L12809) dust differentiation algorithm; the aerosol product is MODIS Deep Blue (Hsu et al., 2004: IEEE Trans. Geosci. Rem. Sensing, 42, 557-569), which is optimised for use over bright surfaces (i.e. deserts). These are applied to four significant dust events from the Lake Eyre Basin, Australia. OMl Al was also examined for each event to provide an independent assessment of dust presence and plume location. All of the techniques were successful in detecting dust when compared to FCCs, but the most effective technique for source determination varied from event to event depending on factors such as cloud cover, dust plume mineralogy and surface reflectance. Significantly, to optimise dust detection using the MODIS L1B approaches, the recommended dust/non-dust thresholds had to be considerably adjusted on an event by event basis. MODIS L2 aerosol data retrievals were also found to vary in quality significantly between events; being affected in particular by cloud masking difficulties. In general, we find that OMI AI and MODIS AQUA L7 B and L2 data are complementary; the former are ideal for initial dust detection, the latter can be used to both identify plumes and sources at high spatial resolution. Overall, approaches using brightness temperature difference (BT10-11) are the most consistently reliable technique for dust source identification in the Lake Eyre Basin. One reason for this is that this enclosed basin contains multiple dust sources with contrasting geochemical signatures. In this instance, BTD data are not affected significantly by perturbations in dust mineralogy. However, the other algorithms tested (including MODIS Deep Blue) were all influenced by ground surface reflectance or dust mineralogy; making it impossible to use one single MODIS LIB or L2 data type for all events (or even for a single multiple-plume event). There is, however, considerable potential to exploit this anomaly, and to use dust detection algorithms to obtain information about dust mineralogy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Satellite images provide a synoptic view of land cover patterns, but the use of such imagery requires careful consideration of sensor type, resolution, extent, and the metrics used to quantify ecologically significant change. We examined these factors for landscape monitoring applications in four small National Parks near Washington, DC: Antietam National Battlefield, Catoctin Mountain Park, Prince William Forest Park and Rock Creek Park. Using 4 m Ikonos, 10 m SPOT, 15 m pan-sharpened Landsat ETM+ and 30 m Landsat ETM+ imagery, the parks and surrounding areas were mapped to National Land Cover system classes. For each park, we examined four methods for defining map extent, including park administrative boundaries, two variable buffer widths, and watershed boundaries, and then analyzed patterns of forest habitat for the maps using a graph theoretic approach (critical dispersal threshold distance) and common landscape metrics (number of patches, percent forest, forest edge density, and forest area-weighted mean patch size). As expected, landscape metrics for maps derived at differing resolutions varied significantly, but map extent often yielded even larger differences. We found that for most applications, coarser scale data (e.g., 30 m Landsat) are adequate for characterizing landscape pattern, although ultimately data from multiple sensors may be appropriate or necessary based on different objectives of landscape monitoring (e.g., mapping single trees vs. forest stands) and the scale at which a resource of interest interacts with the larger landscape (e.g., birds vs. herptiles).

Because such areas may be large, not easily accessible, subject to change, and sensitive to the surrounding landscape, remote sensing can be a valuable tool in establishing and managing protected areas. We describe three case studies to illustrate how remote sensing can contribute to setting priorities for conservation actions, monitoring the status of conservation targets, and evaluating the effectiveness of conservation strategies. In the Connecticut River watershed, remote sensing has been used to assess flood regimes and identify key areas of floodplain forests and their context for conservation planning. At Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, remote sensing has provided information to assess the effectiveness of management strategies to restore fire to the longleaf pine sandhills ecosystem, control invasive species, and prioritize annual prescribed burns. In eastern US forests, remote sensing is being used to evaluate the ecological condition and changes at properties where direct access would be difficult.   As the resolution and capacities of remote-sensing technology continue to develop, however, several issues are becoming increasingly important. It is essential that the spatial and temporal resolution of remotesensing data be matched to the relevant scales of biodiversity, major threats, and management actions. Data layers must be compatible, both in scale and in measurement properties, and key patterns must be distinguished from irrelevant detail, especially at the finer scales of application in local management. Combining remote sensing with ground surveys can expand the array of information used in management and contribute to the ecological interpretation of remote-sensing data. Because conservation funds are always limited, remote sensing also must be cost effective. This requires balancing the wealth of detail afforded by ever-finer resolution of remote-sensing data with what is actually needed to implement sound conservation and management. Remote sensing is a valuable tool, but it is not a panacea for all of the challenges of conservation monitoring and management.

In this study, the first land cover classification for the entire Lena Delta based on Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) images was conducted and used for the quantification of methane emissions from the delta ecosystems on the regional scale. Nine land cover classes of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in the wetland dominated (72%) Lena Delta could be defined by this classification approach. The mean daily methane emission of the entire Lena Delta was calculated with 10.35 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1).

Airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) was used to estimate spatial and temporal variations of gross primary production (GPP) across a jack pine chronosequence of four sites in Saskatchewan, Canada for comparison with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP product. This study utilizes high resolution canopy structural information obtained from airborne lidar to bridge gaps in spatial representation between plot, eddy covariance (EC), and MODIS estimates of vegetation GPP. First we investigate linkages between canopy structure obtained from measurements and light response curves at a jack pine chronosequence during the growing season of 2004. Second, we use the measured canopy height and foliage cover inputs to create a structure-based GPP model (GPP(Landsberg)) which was tested in 2005. The GPP model is then run using lidar data (GPP(Lidar)) and compared with eight-day cumulative MODIS GPP (GPP(MODIS)) and EC observations (GPP(EC)). Finally, we apply the lidar GPP model at spatial resolutions of 1 m to 1000 m to examine the influence of within-pixel heterogeneity and scaling (or pixel aggregation) on GPP(Lidar). When compared over eight-day cumulative periods throughout the 2005 growing season, the standard deviation of differences between GPP(lidar) and GPPMODIS were less than differences between either of them and GPP(EC) at all sites. As might be expected, the differences between pixel aggregated GPP estimates are most pronounced at sites with the highest levels of spatial canopy heterogeneity. The results of this study demonstrate one method for using lidar to scale between eddy covariance flux towers and coarse resolution remote sensing pixels using a structure-based Landsberg light curve model.

The benefits of using near-infrared observations have already been documented extensively in the literature, notably in the context of applications based on vegetation indices. These include, for instance, a degree of normalization with respect to undesirable perturbing factors. Our intent here is twofold: provide the theoretical basis to justify using measurements outside the main absorption band of vegetation for the purpose of retrieving canopy properties, and uncover the implications of doing so. On the basis of simple radiation transfer considerations, we conclude that near-infrared observations are critical to ensure the accurate retrieval of absorption estimates in the visible domain, and that observations within the absorption band help control the perturbing effect of the soil background.   The analytical approach implemented here is conceptually similar to a scale analysis which permits us assessing the most significant contributions to the absorption and scattering processes in the vast majority of geophysical situations. Our final conclusions derived from a series of intermediate steps that need to be performed first. To this end, we illustrate in Section 2 the fact that a suitably-defined one-dimensional radiation transfer model can always be setup to represent accurately the reflected, transmitted and absorbed fraction of vertical fluxes in any vegetation volume at medium spatial resolutions (100 m or lower), and this irrespective of the local variability exhibited by the canopy attributes. This finding is exploited throughout the paper to show that 1) measurements performed in the near-infrared band are needed to ensure a large dynamic range in albedo for dense canopy conditions, by contrast to the visible domain, 2) measurements in the visible domain are effective to remove the contribution due to the background below vegetation for low to intermediate LAI conditions. This is made possible thanks to the soil line concept and the spectral invariance of the interception process, and 3) the estimation of visible light absorption in a canopy on the basis of combinations of spectral bands (as implemented in traditional vegetation indices) hinges on spectral correlations between variables, most notably those controlling the absorbing and scattering properties of the soil and leaves. A series of implications and consequences is drawn from our analysis and, in particular. the suggestion to adopt modern interpretation techniques, superseding the commonly used vegetation index approaches. These advances allow us to improve on current approaches, in particular by lifting some of the hypotheses associated with approaches based on combinations of spectral bands. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

More recently, algorithms have been developed to quantify the pigment phycocyanin (PC), which is characteristic of cyanobacteria, a phytoplankton group of relative importance to inland water management due to their negative impact on water quality in response to eutrophication.   We evaluated the accuracy of three published algorithms for the remote sensing of PC in inland waters, using an extensive database of field radiometric and pigment data obtained in the Netherlands and Spain in the period 2001-2005. The three algorithms (a baseline, single band ratio, and a nested band ratio approach) all target the PC absorption effect observed in reflectance spectra in the 620 nm region. We evaluated the sensitivity of the algorithms to errors in reflectance measurements and investigated their performance in cyanobacteria-dominated water bodies as well as in the presence of other phytoplankton pigments.   All algorithms performed best in moderate to high PC concentrations (50-200 mg m(-3)) and showed the most linear response to increasing PC in cyanobacteria-dominated waters. The highest errors showed at PC<50 mg m(-3). In eutrophic waters, the presence of other pigments explained a tendency to overestimate the PC concentration. In oligotrophic waters, negative PC predictions were observed. At very high concentrations (PC>200 mg m(-3)), PC underestimations by the baseline and single band ratio algorithms were attributed to a non-linear relationship between PC and absorption in the 620 nm region. The nested band ratio gave the overall best fit between predicted and measured PC. For the Spanish dataset, a stable ratio of PC over cyanobacterial Chl a was observed, suggesting that PC is indeed a good proxy for cyanobacterial biomass.

Successful mitigation of the hydrological impacts on societies as well as assessing glacier-related hazards require large-scale monitoring of glacier dynamics. However, detailed glaciological data from the Asian highlands are lacking, due to its size and difficult accessibility. We have applied a novel technique for precise ortho rectification, co-registration, and sub-pixel correlation of Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite imagery to derive surface velocities of Himalayan glaciers. Our approach allows for the correction of offsets due to attitude effects and sensor distortions, as well as elevation errors if a digital elevation model (DEM) from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was used for orthorectification. After post-processing, the error on the displacements is on the order of 2-4 m per correlation. Translated into annual velocities, this error is reduced (increased) when the correlated images are more (less) than a year apart. Through application of a filtering procedure and several quality tests, the consistency of the results is validated to provide confidence in the remotely sensed velocity measurements, despite the lack of ground control. This novel approach allows fast, easy, and economically viable acquisition of detailed glaciological data in areas of difficult access and provides a means for large-scale monitoring of glaciers in high mountainous terrain.

A spatio-temporal correlation analysis of the two MODIS fire products stratified globally for pre-fire leaf area index (LAI) and percent tree cover ranges indicate that for low percent tree cover and LAI. the MODIS burned area product defines a greater proportion of the landscape as burned than the active fire product; and with increasing tree cover (>60%) and LAI (>5) the MODIS active fire product defines a relatively greater proportion. This pattern is generally observed in product comparisons stratified with respect to land cover. Globally, the burned area product reports a smaller amount of area burned than the active fire product in croplands and evergreen forest and deciduous needleleaf forest classes, comparable areas for mixed and deciduous broadleaf forest classes, and a greater amount of area burned for the non-forest classes. The reasons for these product differences are discussed in terms of environmental spatio-temporal fire characteristics and remote sensing factors, and highlight the planning needs for MODIS burned area product validation.

This study evaluates the biases in top-of-atmosphere (TOA) brightness temperatures (BT) modeled with the moderate resolution transmission (MODTRAN4.2) band RTM, bounded by a Fresnel\'s reflective flat sea surface. This model is used to simulate global clear-sky Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) nighttime BTs from NOAA-15 through 18 and MetOp-A platforms for one full day of IS February 2007. Inputs to RTM (SST fields and vertical profiles of atmospheric relative humidity, temperature, pressure, and geopotential height) are specified from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction\'s (NCEP) Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) data. Model BTs in AVHRR channels 3B (3.7 mu m), 4 (11 mu m), and 5 (12 mu m) are then compared with their respective measured counterparts, available in the NESDIS operational SST files. Ideally, the RTM should match the observations, but in fact, the modeled BTs are biased high with respect to the AVHRR BTs. The \"Model minus Observation\" (M - O) bias ranges from about 0 to 2 K, depending upon spectral band, view zenith angle, and sea and atmosphere state at the retrieval point. The bias asymptotically decreases towards confidently clear-sky conditions, but it never vanishes and invariably shows channel-specific dependencies on view zenith angle and geophysical conditions (e.g., column water vapor and sea-air temperature difference). Fuller exploration of the potential of the current RTM (e.g., adding global vertical aerosol profiles) or improvements to its input (NCEP SST and atmospheric profiles) may reduce this bias, but they cannot fully reconcile its spectral and angular structure. The fact that the M-O biases are closely reproducible for five AVHRR sensors flown onboard different platforms adds confidence in the validation approach employed in this study. We emphasize the need for establishing a globally adequate forward RTM for the use in SST modeling and retrievals. A first test of the RTM adequacy is its ability, when used in conjunction with the global fields from the numerical weather prediction models, to reproduce the TOA clear-sky radiances measured by satellite sensors.

We investigated the degree to which floristically and structurally defined Costa Rican lowland rain forest types can be accurately discriminated by a non-parametric k nearest neighbors (k-nn) classifier or linear discriminant analysis. Pixel values of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation model extracted from segments or from 5 x 5 pixel windows were employed in the classifications. 104 field plots were classified into three floristic and one structural type of forest (regrowth forest). Three floristically defined forest types were formed through clustering the old-growth forest plots (n=52) by their species specific importance values. An error assessment of the image classification was conducted via cross-validation and error matrices, and overall percent accuracy and Kappa scores were used as measures of accuracy. Image classification of the four forest types did not adequately distinguish two old-growth forest classes, so they were merged into a single forest class. The resulting three forest classes were most accurately classified by the k-nn classifier using segmented image data (overall accuracy 91 %). The second best method, with respect to accuracy, was the k-nn with 5 x 5 pixel windows data (89% accuracy), followed by the canonical discriminant analysis using the 5 x 5 pixel window data (86%) and the segment data (82%). We conclude the k-nn classifier can accurately distinguish floristically and structurally different rain forest types. The classification accuracies were higher for the k-nn classifier than for the canonical discriminant analysis, but the differences in Kappa scores were not statistically significant. The segmentation did not increase classification accuracy in this study. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Since these data are often not available at the same spatial scale as the remote sensing imagery, they can introduce substantial errors into the carbon exchange estimates. Here we present further development of a gross primary production (GPP) model based entirely on remote sensing data. In contrast to an earlier model based only on the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), this model, termed the Temperature and Greenness (TG) model, also includes the land surface temperature (LST) product from MODIS. In addition to its obvious relationship to vegetation temperature, LST was correlated with vapor pressure deficit and photosynthetically active radiation. Combination of EVI and LST in the model substantially improved the correlation between predicted and measured GPP at 11 eddy correlation flux towers in a wide range of vegetation types across North America. In many cases, the TG model provided substantially better predictions of GPP than did the MODIS GPP product. However, both models resulted in poor predictions for sparse shrub habitats where solar angle effects on remote sensing indices were large. Although it may be possible to improve the MODIS GPP product through improved parameterization, our results suggest that simpler models based entirely on remote sensing can provide equally good predictions of GPP.

Most conventional SWE retrieval algorithms depend on the difference between the brightness temperatures (T-b\'s) at these frequencies. The effect of atmospheric absorption is generally assumed to be insignificant, and thus often not taken into account in such estimation. In this paper this effect is closely examined with the aid of AMSR-E and radiosonde data sets over two widely separated regions in the continental U.S.A. Results of the analysis show that even under a clear sky the atmospheric absorption could account for as much as similar to 25-50% to the estimation of SWE. For example, the AMSR-E estimated SWE of 10 cm would become about 13.6 cm when measured at the ground level under the same atmospheric condition; the estimation based on surface emission alone (i.e., no atmosphere) would be about 15.2 cm. There is some regional dependence of this atmospheric absorption effect, but the effect of seasonal variation is negligibly small. Under cloudy conditions, the impact of liquid cloud absorption is significant and it appears necessary to perform either cloud screening or quantify the cloud effects on SWE estimation from 19 to 37 GHz radiometric measurements at ground level or satellite altitudes.

Biomass derived from remote sensing data is often compromised by the presence of both photosynthetically active (PV) and non-photosynthetically active (NPV) vegetation. Here, we explicitly quantify PV and NPV biomass using HyMap hyperspectral imagery. Biomass quality, defined as plant C:N ratio, was also estimated using a previously published algorithm. These independent algorithms for forage quantity and quality (both PV and NPV) were evaluated in two northern mixed-grass prairie ecoregions, one in the Northwestern Glaciated Plains (NGGP) and one in the Northwestern Great Plains (NGP). Total biomass (kg ha (-1)) and C:N ratios were mapped with 18% and 8% relative error, respectively. Outputs from both models were combined to quantify crude protein (kg ha(-1)) on a pasture scale. Results suggest synoptic maps of rangeland vegetation mass (both PV and NPV) and quality may be derived from hyperspectral aerial imagery with greater than 80% accuracy. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The shape, position and magnitude of the specular lobe, which is a characteristic of many leaves in the forward direction, is investigated for beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and laurel (Prunus laurocerasits L.) using a leaf BRDF model. The width of the specular peak is very variable according to the species and the illumination angle, as well as its contribution to the directional -hemispherical reflectance.

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and the greenness and wetness components of the Tasseled Cap Transformation were tested. Landscape variables (topography, accessibility and structural vegetation) were also included as predictors in models development. Although fire fisk is closely related to weather and vegetation status at a given time, it is also strongly linked to fire history, and changes in predictor values in years previous to the fire were events also considered. The models generated correctly classified about 70% of the validation data set. The inclusion of pre-fire spectral indices improved models ability to predict fire occurrence. Although the NBR-based model was the most accurate, TCWetness and NDVI-based models showed similar results, while TCGreenness performed worst. Models with no spectral indices described the fire-proneness of the landscape structure, while the inclusion of spectral indices improved the recognition of particular spatial conditions. Slope and distance to the nearest path were also identified as valuable predictors. All the models identified the main fire risk zones in the study area. Their integration into a single, integrated model properly described fire-proneness and is suggested to be a valuable tool for the identification and management of fire risk. The method used is simple, describes the key variables and spatial pattern of the fire regime and is suited to operational use in Mediterranean ecosystems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Microclimates in urbanized settings can vary tremendously in very short distances, making adequate climate interpolations across a large metropolitan area difficult, at best. This study links the coarse scale of satellite (ASTER) images to the fine scale of hand-held thermography as part of an in-depth suburban neighborhood climate study to determine if ASTER imaging can be used to adequately estimate neighborhood climate conditions in an urbanized area. The study utilizes day and night remotely-sensed and ground data from June, 2004 for Phoenix, Arizona. Microclimate conditions of three urban fringe neighborhoods with varying amounts of natural vegetation and development density were studied, along with ASTER remote sensing data, mobile climate transects, and spot infrared thermographic images.   These neighborhoods, though variable, showed only minor differences, and the study indicates that daytime images (11:20 am) do not adequately rank observed conditions within these neighborhoods - the highest ASTER surface temperatures were recorded for the least-dense neighborhood with a natural desert landscaping, though lowest ambient temperatures were measured there. Daytime mean surface temperatures versus air temperatures were 50.4 degrees C (30.8 degrees C air temp); 53.5 degrees C (29.7 degrees C) and 50.6 degrees C (31.9 degrees C). It was found that nighttime (10:40 pm LST) differences among neighborhoods of surface and air temperatures were relatively consistent, with the most densely developed neighborhood having the highest ASTER surface temperatures (29.0 degrees C) and transect-derived air temperatures (30.0 degrees C). Issues of view angle, shadowing, emissivity, resolution, and wind conditions for daytime results with their relatively small mean differences observed across the neighborhoods may explain why the rank of ASTER thermal conditions versus observed ambient conditions was poor.

Satellite data from MODIS, NOAA-AVHRR (14,15, and 16) and Landsat-ETM were used and recorded during June and July 2002 in parallel to the BUBBLE field campaign. MODIS and NOAA-AVHRR data represent day and nighttime surface radiation temperatures in 930 m and I 100 m grid size. Landsat-ETM offers a unique resolution on 60 m, but with only daytime imagery at about the same time of MODIS overpass is available. This enables the validation of satellite measurements from different sensors with ground measurements at locations with various degrees of spatial homogeneity/heterogeneity (urban/rural land use). Several different algorithms for NOAA-AVHRR data were compared with in-situ measurements. The results show a very high correlation of the long wave emissions measured by the satellite with the in-situ measurements showing an accuracy of +/- 3% to 5% on average, even in urban environments.

The spatial distribution of vegetation patches and soil nutrients coupled with wind and water erosion as well as biotic processes are believed to have an influence on land degradation. A geostatistical measure of spatial \"connectivity\" is presented to directly measure the size of patches in the landscape from a raster data set. Connectivity is defined as the probability that adjacent pixels belong to the same type of patch. Connectivity allows the size distribution of erodible patches to be quantified from a remote sensing image or field measurement, or specified for the purposes of modeling.   Applied to high-resolution remote sensing imagery in the Jornada del Muerto Basin in New Mexico, the spatial distribution of plants indicates the current state of grassland-to-shrubland transition in addition to processes of degradation in this former grassland. Shrub encroachment is clearly evident from decreased intershrub patch size in coppice dunes of 27.8 m relative to shrublands of 65.2 m and grassland spacing of 118.9 m. Shrub patches remain a consistent 2-4m diameter regardless of the development of bush encroachment. A strong SW-NE duneland orientation correlates with the prevailing wind direction and suggests a strong aeolian control of surface geomorphology.   With appropriate data sets and classification, potential applications of the connectivity method extend beyond vegetation dynamics, including mineralogy mapping, preserve planning, habitat fragmentation, pore spacing in surface hydrology, and microbial community dynamics.

Developing techniques to combine effectively the multiple streams of information required for a water budget assessment provides a difficult challenge, particularly given the disparities in spatial and temporal scales between measurements and predictions. Two research groups, the Naval Research Laboratory Monterey (NRL) and the University of Arizona (UA), are using a combination of geostationary infrared and polar-orbiting microwave satellite data to derive 6-hourly precipitation estimates over a global 0.25 degrees grid. We examine the performance of these two algorithms for estimating the 24-h rainfall accumulation over India and Sri Lanka for the years 2002 and 2003. The derived values are compared with observations from a network of 39 national weather stations. In addition, two locations, Minicoy in the Laccadive Islands and Port Blair in the Andaman Islands were selected as being representative of the ocean environment to compare these satellite rainfall products against measurements from local rain gauges and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite data.

The EDVI values represent physical properties of crown vegetation such as vegetation water content of crown canopies. The collocated land surface turbulent and radiative fluxes were empirically linked together by the EDVI values.

It is based on the fact that the same geographic area (e.g., a 3 x 3 pixel window) on two dates of imagery will tend to be highly correlated if little change has occurred, and uncorrelated when change occurs. Computing the piecewise correlation between two data sets provides valuable information regarding the location and numeric change value derived using contextual information within the specified neighborhood. Various neighborhood configurations (i.e., multi-level NCIs) were explored in the study using high spatial resolution multispectral imagery: smaller neighborhood sizes provided some detailed change information (such as a new patios added to an existing building) at the cost of introducing some noise (such as changes in shadows). Larger neighborhood sizes were useful for removing this noise but introduced some inaccurate change information (such as removing some linear feature changes). When combined with image classification using a machine learning decision tree (C5.0), classifications based on multi-level NCIs yielded superior results (e.g., using a 3-pixel circular radius neighborhood had a Kappa of 0.94), compared to the classification that did not incorporate NCIs (Kappa=0.86).

The extent to which spatial variability in these parameters related to plant species richness also was investigated. A 224 channel hyperspectral data cube acquired in June 2000 by the Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) provided complete coverage of the 400-2500 nm range at approximately 10 run per channel. After band deletions accounted for detector overlap and strong atmospheric attenuation features, 176 bands were retained for analysis and spanned the 404-2400 nm range. Prairie reflectance was estimated via radiative transfer modeling and scaling to a library spectrum of highway construction material. Data were sampled from pixels having a 19 m ground sample distance (GSD) to represent each of 93 vegetation sampling transects. Reflectance and radiance at mid-infrared wavelengths (e.g., 1553 nm), and band ratios that were based on atmospheric windows in the red, near-infrared and mid-infrared spectra estimated species richness to within 6 to 7 species per transect. The 856 to 780 nm radiance or reflectance ratio yielded maximum adjusted coefficients of determination (r(2)) of approximately 0.4 in regressions with richness when data from bison-grazed and ungrazed areas were combined. These regressions remained significant (p <= 0.001) when only ungrazed areas were assessed although r(2) reduced to approximately 0.2. Richness was related significantly also to the 433 to 674 nm reflectance ratio for grazed-plus-ungrazed and ungrazed-only areas. In contrast, the effectiveness of the 433 to 674 nm radiance ratio was reduced by atmospheric backscatter. Species richness did not correlate strongly or consistently with transect spatial variability (coefficient of variation or range) in radiance, reflectance or band ratio value, apparently as a consequence of the relatively small area sampled for each transect (approximately 0.5 ha). Relationships between richness and prairie spectral features were explained by the influence of soil exposure on both parameters. Richness and estimated soil exposure tended to increase from ungrazed lowlands, to ungrazed slopes, to ungrazed uplands to grazed areas. Remotely sensed estimates of soil exposure may be particularly useful in addressing plant species richness on grazed grasslands owing to an overall similarity in spectral reflectance among dominant plant species.

The method (SCAmod) is based on a semi-empirical model, where three reflectance contributors (wet snow, snow-free ground and forest canopy), interconnected by an effective canopy transmissivity and SCA, constitute the observed reflectance from the target area. Given the reflectance observation, SCA is solved from the model. The predetermined values for the reflectance contributors can be adjusted to an optional wavelength region, which makes SCAmod adaptable to various optical sensors. The effective forest canopy transmissivity specifies the effect of forests on the local reflectance observation; it is estimated using Earth observation data similar to that employed in the actual SCA estimation. This approach enables operationl snow mapping for extensive areas, as auxiliary forest data are not needed.   Our study area covers 404 000 km(2), comprising all drainage basins of Finland (with an average area of 60 km(2)) and some transboundary drainage basins common with Russia, Norway and Sweden. Applying SCAmod to NOAA/AVHRR cloud-free data acquired during melting periods 2001-2003, we estimated the areal fraction of snow cover for all the 5845 basins. The validation against in situ SCA from the Finnish snow course network indicates that with SCAmod, 15% (absolute SCA-units) accuracy for SCA is gained. Good results were also obtained from the validation against snow cover information provided by the Finnish weather station network, for example, 94% of snow-free and fully snow-covered basins were recognized. A general formula for deriving the statistical accuracy of SCA estimates provided by SCAmod is presented, complemented by the results when the AVHRR data are employed. Snow melting in Finland has been operatively monitored with SCAmod in Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE) since year 2001. The SCA estimates have been assimilated to the Finnish national hydrological modelling and forecasting system since 2003, showing a substantial improvement in forecasts. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The radiance values were converted into surface reflectance images by a MODTRAN4-based technique. To discriminate varieties with similar reflectance values, multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) was applied over the data. To obtain an adequate discriminant function, a stepwise method was used to select the best variables among surface reflectance values, ratios of reflectance, and several spectral indices potentially sensitive to changes in chlorophyll content, leaf water, and lignin-cellulose. Results showed that the five Brazilian sugarcane varieties were discriminated using EO-I Hyperion data. Differences in canopy architecture affected sunlight penetration and reflectance, resulting in a higher reflectance for planophile (e.g., SP81-3250) than erectophile (e.g., SP80-1842) sugarcane plants. The variety SP80-1842 presented lower reflectance values, deeper lignin-cellulose absorption bands at 2103 nm and 2304 nm, shallower leaf liquid water absorption bands at 983 nm and 1205 rim, and lower leaf liquid water content than the other sugarcane varieties. To discriminate this cultivar, a single near-infrared (NIR) band threshold was used. To discriminate the other four sugarcane varieties with similar reflectance values, MDA was used producing a classification accuracy of 87.5% for a hold-out set of pixels. The comparison between the ground truth data and the MDA-derived classification image confirmed the model\' capacity to differentiate the varieties accurately. The best results were obtained for the cultivar SP87-365 that presented the lowest spectral variability in the discriminant space. Some misclassified areas were associated with the cultivars SP80-1816 and SP81-3250 that showed the highest spectral variability. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The study area consists of high elevation glaciers draining through the rough topography of the Bhutan Himalayas. It turns out that the ASTER-derived and SRTM3 DEMs have similar accuracy over the study area, but the SRTM3 DEM contains less gross errors. However, for rough topography large sections of the SRTM3 DEM contain no data. We therefore compile a combined SRTM3-ASTER DEM. From this final composite-master DEM, we produce repeat ASTER orthoimages from which we evaluate the DEM quality and derive glacier surface velocities through image matching. The glacier tongues north of the Himalayan main ridge, which enter the Tibet plateau, show maximum surface velocities in the order of 100-200 in year(-1). In contrast, the ice within the glacier tongues south of the main ridge flows with a few tens of meters per year. These findings have a number of implications, among others for glacier dynamics, glacier response to climate change, glacier lake development, or glacial erosion. The study indicates that space-based remote sensing can provide new insights into the magnitude of selected surface processes and feedback mechanisms that govern mountain geodynamics.

In this paper, we use two different criteria to evaluate the quality of existing and new temporal composite products in SPOT-VEGETATION imagery. The first criterion, based on variograms, analyses the spatial characteristics of composite images, and the second one evaluates the quality of the time series based on the analysis of simultaneous imagery from VEGETATION 1 and VEGETATION 2. Thanks to these criteria, we show that the standard deviation of the errors that affect the surface reflectances of current composite products can be reduced by a factor greater than 2 using improved algorithms detailed in this paper. Finally, we produce multi-instrument composites by integrating images from both VEGETATION instruments to further improve the composite products. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Prior to the SAR data analysis, a number of pre-processing procedures were carried out. Noise was eliminated by adaptive texture preserving filtering. A specific algorithm for the geocoding of SAR images, based on a range-Doppler approach, enabled precise geocoding of the SAR data by means of a single very accurate ground control point. A novel incidence-angle-normalization for SAR imagery was applied to analyze the backscatter coefficient to a given incidence angles. Further, a backscatter coefficient analysis was performed according to the slope on forested areas and fire disturbed areas. A qualitative and quantitative investigation of the backscattering as related to the slope angle and time changes was performed. As a result of this analysis, the scenes that allowed maximizing the discrimination of burnt areas were selected as the input for the neural network classification. The investigation on the effect of the SAR incidence angle in burnt area discrimination determined that low incidence angles are required for discriminating burnt areas in hilly regions. It was also demonstrated that topography influences the level of discrimination of burnt areas since areas affected by forest fires on face-slopes presents higher backscatter coefficient than those back-slopes. Therefore, SAR data can play a significant role for burnt area mapping in Europe in those areas where optical data cannot be used due to persistent cloud cover. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In GYE, the MODIS land cover was very successful at mapping extensive cover types (e.g. coniferous forest and grasslands) and far less successful at mapping smaller habitats (e.g. wetlands, deciduous tree cover) that typically occur in patches that are smaller than the MODIS pixels, but are reported to be very important to biodiversity conservation. The MODIS classification for Para State was successful at producing a regional forest/non-forest product which is useful for monitoring the extreme human impacts such as deforestation. The ability of MODIS data to map secondary forest remains to be tested, since regrowth typically harbors reduced levels of biodiversity. The two case studies showed the value of using multi-date 250 m data with only two spectral bands, as well as single day 500 in data with seven spectral bands, thus illustrating the versatile use of MODIS data in two contrasting environments. MODIS data provide new options for regional land cover mapping that are less labor-intensive than Landsat and have higher resolution than previous 1 km AVHRR or the current 1 km global land cover product. The usefulness of the MODTS data in addressing biodiversity conservation questions will ultimately depend upon the patch sizes of important habitats and the land cover transformations that threaten them.

In this context, leaf and canopy radiative transfer models are Valuable for modeling and understanding the behavior Of Such indices. In the present work, PROSPECT and SAILH models have been used to Simulate a wide range of crop canopy reflectances in an attempt to study the sensitivity of a set of vegetation indices to green leaf area index (LAI), and to modify some of them in order to enhance their responsivity to LAI variations. The aim of the paper was to present a method for minimizing the effect of leaf chlorophyll content oil the prediction of green LAI, and to develop new algorithms that adequately predict the LAI of crop canopies. Analyses based on both simulated and real hyperspectral data were carried out to compare performances of existing vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI], Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index [RDVI], Modified Simple Ratio [MSR], Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index [SAVI], Soil and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index [SARVI], MSAVI, Triangular Vegetation Index [TVI], and Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index [MCARI]) and to design new ones (MTVI1, MCARI 1, MTV12, and MCAR12) that are both less sensitive to chlorophyll content variations and linearly related to green LAI. Thorough analyses showed that the above existing vegetation indices were either sensitive to chlorophyll concentration changes or affected by saturation at high LAI levels. Conversely, two of the spectral indices developed as a part of this study, a modified triangular vegetation index (MTV12) and a modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index (MCAR12), proved to be the best predictors of green LAI. Related predictive algorithms were tested on CASI (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager) hyperspectral images and, then, validated using ground truth measurements. The latter were collected simultaneously with image acquisition for different crop types (soybean, corn, and wheat), at different growth stages, and under various fertilization treatments. Prediction power analysis of proposed algorithms based on MCAR12 and MTV12 resulted in agreements between modeled and ground measurement of non-destructive LAI, with coefficients of determination (r(2)) being 0.98 for soybean, 0.89 for corn, and 0.74 for wheat. The corresponding RMSE for LAI were estimated at 0.28, 0.46, and 0.85, respectively. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', 'York Univ, Ctr Res Earth & Space Sci, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.

This is particularly the case with the data from some of the highly potential satellite sensors such as the Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM-on board the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite, IRS-P4) and the SeaWiFS. Two main tests conventionally used for cloud screening of data from such satellite sensors are the threshold method applied to visible and near-IR bands and the visible to near-IR channel ratio method. These methods do not have the potential to eliminate the pixels with small cloud fractions, leading to overestimation of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) derived from satellite data, and might also identify the pixels with high values of AOD as cloudy. The purpose of this paper is to study the potential of Spatial Coherence Test (SCT) applied to the data from the near-IR bands for cloud screening of satellite data over the oceanic environment. We use here the data from IRS-P4 OCM. Though more computationally intensive, the SCT does not suffer from the serious limitations of the threshold and channel ratio methods and is found to be superior in identifying the clear sky pixels that are not affected by clouds. Although the SCT applied to near-IR channel data may be overestimating the number of cloud affected pixels, it neither leads to overestimation of AOD nor identifies the pixels with high AOD values as cloudy.

Their reflectance was measured between 400 and 800 nm with a 1-nm,step, and their chlorophyll content determined by extraction. A larger simulated database (11,583 spectra) was built using the PROSPECT model, in order to test, calibrate, and obtain universal indices, i.e., indices applicable to a wide range of species and leaf structure. To our knowledge, almost all leaf chlorophyll indices published in the literature since 1973 have been tested on both databases. Fourteen canonical types of indices (published ones and new ones) were identified, and their wavelengths calibrated on the simulated database as well as on the experimental database to determine the best wavelengths and, hence, the best performances in chlorophyll estimation for each index types. These indices go from simple reflectance ratios to more sophisticated indices Using reflectance first derivatives (using the Savitzky and Golay method). We also tested other nondestructive methods to obtain total chlorophyll concentration: SPAD (Minolta Camera, Osaka, Japan) and neural networks. The validity of the actual PROSPECT model is challenged by our results: Important discordances are found when the indices are calculated with PROSPECT compared to experimental data, especially for some indices and wavelengths. The discordance is even greater when the indices are determined with PROSPECT and applied on the experimental database. A new calibration of PROSPECT is therefore necessary for any study aiming at using simulated spectra to determine or to calibrate indices. The \"peak jump\" and the multiple-peak feature observed on the first derivative of the reflectances (e.g., in the Red-Edge Inflection Point [REIP] index) has been investigated. It was shown that chlorophyll absorption alone can explain this feature. The peak jump disqualifies\' the REIP to be a valuable chlorophyll index. A simple modified difference ratio gave the best results among all published indices (cross-validated RMSE = 2.1 mug/cm(2) on the experimental database). After calibration on the experimental database, modified Simple Ratio (mSR) and modified Normalized Difference (mND) indices gave the best 2 performances (RMSECV = 1.8 mug/cm(2) on the experimental database). The new Double Difference (DD) index, although not the best on the 2), 2 experimental database (RMSECV 2.9 mug/cm(2)), has the best results on the larger simulated database (RMSE = 3.7 mug/cm(2)) and is expected to give good results on larger experimental databases. The best reflectance-based indices give better performances than the current commercial nondestructive device SPAD (RMSECV = 4.5 mug/cm(2)). In This leaf-level study, the best indices are very near from each other, so that complex methods are useless: REIP-like, neural networks, and derivative-based indices are not necessary and give worst results than simpler properly chosen indices. These conclusions will certainly be different for. a canopy-level study, where the derivative-based indices may perform significantly better than the other ones. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Estimation of BRDF model parameters can be deteriorated by various factors; contamination of the observations by undetected subresolution clouds or snow patches, inconsistent atmospheric correction in multiangular time series due to uncertainties in the atmospheric parameters, slight variations of the surface condition during a period of observation, for example due to soil moisture changes, diurnal effects on vegetation structure, and geolocation errors [Lucht and Roujean, 2000]. In the present paper, parameter estimation robustness is examined using Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF) data measured for paddy fields in Japan. We compare both the M-estimator and the least median of squares (LMedS) methods for robust parameter estimation to the ordinary least squares method (LSM). In experiments, simulated data that were produced by adding noises to the data measured on the ground surface were used. Experimental results demonstrate that if a robust estimation is sought, the LMedS method can be adopted for the robust estimation of a BRDF model parameter. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The unmixing is based on a linear spectral mixture model, which includes endmembers for snow, conifer, branches of leafless deciduous trees and snow-free ground. Model input consists of a land-cover fraction map and endmember spectra. The land-cover fraction map is applied in the unmixing procedure to identify the number and types of endmembers for every pixel, but also to set constraints on the area fractions of the forest endmembers. SnowFrac was applied on two Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images with different snow conditions covering a forested area in southern Norway.

Results are presented for non-forested areas, deciduous forests, coniferous forests and mixed deciduous/coniferous forests.

Eleven landcover and land-use classes are interpreted from Landsat imagery for five sampling dates. Because of the high cost and potential effect of classification error associated with developing change estimates from wall-to-wall land-cover maps, a probability sampling approach is employed. The basic sampling unit is a 20 X 20 kin area, and land cover is obtained for each 60 X 60 in pixel within the sampling unit. The sampling design is stratified based on ecoregions, and land-cover change estimates are constructed for each stratum. The sampling design and analyses are documented, and estimates of change accompanied by standard errors are presented to demonstrate the methodology. Analyses of the completed strata suggest that the sampling unit should be reduced to a 10 X 10 kin block, and poststratified estimation and regression estimation are viable options to improve precision of estimated change.

Increasing evidence indicates that these changes have impacted mesoscale weather patterns, biodiversity and water resources. Since the Southeast has one of the highest rates of land productivity in the nation, it is important to monitor the effects of such changes regularly. Here, we propose a remote sensing based methodology to estimate regional impacts of urban land development on ecosystem structure and function. As an indicator of ecosystem functioning, we chose net primary productivity (NPP), which is now routinely estimated from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. We used the MODIS data, a 1992 Landsat-based land cover map and nighttime data derived from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program\'s Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) for the years 1992/1993 and 2000 to estimate the extent of urban development and its impact on NPP. The analysis based on the nighttime data indicated that in 1992/1993, urban areas amounted to 4.5% of the total land surface of the region. In the year 2000, the nighttime data showed an increase in urban development for the southeastern United States of 1.9%. Estimates derived from the MODIS data indicated that land cover changes due to urban development that took place during the 1992-2000 period reduced annual NPP of the southeastern United States by 0.4%. Despite the uncertainties in sensor fusion and the coarse resolution of the data used in this study, results show that the combination of MODIS products such as NPP with nighttime data could provide rapid assessment of urban land cover changes and their impacts on regional ecosystem resources.

Cloud cover further reduces the number of useable observations of surface conditions resulting in high-resolution satellite imagery of a region typically being available once a month, which is not very useful for routine ET monitoring. Radiometric surface temperature observations at similar to 1- to 5-km pixel resolution are available multiple times per day from several weather satellites. However, this spatial resolution is too coarse for estimating ET from individual agricultural fields or for defining variations in ET due to land cover changes. Satellite data in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths, used for computing vegetation indices, are available at resolutions an order of magnitude smaller than in the thermal-infrared, and hence provide higher resolution information on vegetation cover conditions. A number of studies have exploited the relationship between vegetation indices and radiometric surface temperature for estimating model parameters used in computing spatially distributed fluxes and available moisture. In this paper, the vegetation index - radiometric surface temperature relationship is utilized in a disaggregation procedure for estimating subpixel variation in surface temperature with aircraft imagery collected over the US Southern Great Plains. The disaggregated surface temperatures estimated by this procedure are compared to actual observations at this subpixel resolution. In addition, a remote sensing-based energy balance model is used to compare output using actual versus estimated surface temperatures over a range of pixel resolutions. From these comparisons, the utility of the surface temperature disaggregation technique appears to be most useful for estimating subpixel surface temperatures at resolutions corresponding to length scales defining agricultural field boundaries across the landscape.

These modelled estimates were compared with remotely sensed estimates of total phytomass (I-NDVI) and rainfall-use efficiency (I-NDVI/annual rainfall; referred to as RUEN) using data from NOAA satellites.   There was good agreement between ground-based and remotely sensed estimates of total phytomass but less agreement between estimates of rainfall-use efficiency. Partitioning the landscape on the basis of landscape resilience did not improve the amount of variance accounted for in RUEp or RUEN and there were conflicting relationships between landscape-scale indicators of landscape function and RUEN. There was, however, evidence to suggest that temporal change in RUEN may provide a useful broad-scale indicator of landscape degradation or recovery over decadal time intervals. Recommendations are made for broad-scale application of this indicator based on temporal trends in RUEN. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

The contribution of remote sensing and modeling holds the potential to predict these components and map them spatially and temporally. This has obvious utility to quantify carbon sink and source relationships and to identify improved land management strategies for optimizing carbon sequestration. The objective of our study was to evaluate prediction of 14-day average daytime CO2 fluxes (F-day) and nighttime CO2 fluxes (R-n) using remote sensing and other data. F-day and R-n were measured with a Bowen ratio-energy balance (BREB) technique in a sagebrush (Artemisia spp.)-steppe ecosystem in northeast Idaho, USA, during 1996-1999. Micrometeorological variables aggregated across 14-day periods and time-integrated Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (iNDVI) were determined during four growing seasons (1996 - 1999) and used to predict F-day and R-n. We found that iNDVI was a strong predictor of F-day (R-2=0.79, n=66, P<0.0001). Inclusion of evapotranspiration in the predictive equation led to improved predictions of F-day (R-2=0.82, n = 66, P < 0.0001). Crossvalidation indicated that regression tree predictions of F-day were prone to overfitting and that linear regression models were more robust. Multiple regression and regression tree models predicted R-n quite well (R-2 = 0.75 - 0.77, n = 66) with the regression tree model being slightly more robust in crossvalidation. Temporal mapping of F-day and R-n is possible with these techniques and would allow the assessment of NEE in sagebrush -steppe ecosystems. Simulations of periodic F-day measurements, as might be provided by a mobile flux tower, indicated that such measurements could be used in combination with iNDVI to accurately predict Fday. These periodic measurements could maximize the utility of expensive flux towers for evaluating various carbon management strategies, carbon certification, and validation and calibration of carbon flux models.

Snow-field measurements coinciding with the RADARSAT SAR overpasses are used to explore and set out optimal conditions for wet snow detection, as a function of the sensor incidence angles. The conditions concern wet snow surface characteristics, mainly the roughness represented by the surface slope m and the volumetric liquid water content, snwc (vol.%). Based on the 3-dB threshold value used in several wet snow detection algorithms, the results show that in order to be discriminated from dry snow covers, wet snow surfaces must be characterized as: (a) m less than or equal to 0.058 and snwc less than or equal to 1.1, if the sensor operates in the S 1 mode (20-27degrees incidence angle range), and (b) m less than or equal to 0.082 and snwc less than or equal to 3.0, if the observations are made in the S7 mode (45 -49degrees incidence angle range). For the identification of a very wet snow, it is also shown that the S7 mode of RADARSAT SAR sensor is more suitable than the S I mode. The latter, however, provides better discrimination for low values of the snow liquid water content. Furthermore, for wet snow detection based on modeling, the present paper demonstrates the importance of using the appropriate methodology to assess the dielectric constant of the background medium.

This study focuses on the use of prior information to reduce the uncertainties associated to the estimation of canopy biophysical variables in the radiative transfer model inversion process. For this purpose, lookup table (LUT), quasi-Newton algorithm (QNT), and neural network (NNT) inversion techniques were adapted to account for prior information. Results were evaluated over simulated reflectance data sets that allow a detailed analysis of the effect of measurement and model uncertainties. Results demonstrate that the use of prior information significantly improves canopy biophysical variables estimation. LUT and QNT are sensitive to model uncertainties. Conversely, NNT techniques are generally less accurate. However, in our conditions, its accuracy is little dependent significantly on modeling or measurement error. We also observed that bias in the reflectance measurements due to miscalibration did not impact very much the accuracy of biophysical estimation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The NDVI method utilized non-normalized (raw) imagery data, while the MID method required normalized imagery. Image normalization techniques included both automatic scattergram-controlled regression (ASCR) and localized relative radiometric normalization (LRRN) techniques. Change/no-change thresholds for each method were optimized using calibration curves developed from reference data and a series of method-specific binary change masks. Cover class-specific thresholds were derived for each of the four methods using a previously developed NRB-LC classification (1998-1999) to support data stratification. An independent set of accuracy assessment points was selected using a disproportionate stratified sampling strategy to support the development of error matrices. Area-weighted conditional probability accuracy statistics were calculated based on the areal extent of change and no change for each cover class. All methods tested exhibited acceptable accuracies, ranging between 80% and 91%. However, change omission errors for woody cover types were unacceptably high, with values ranging between 60% and 79%. Overall commission errors in the change category were also high (42-51%) and strongly affected by the agriculture class. There were no significant differences in the Kappa coefficient between the NDVI, MID ASCR, and LRRN normalization methods. The MID non-normalized method was inferior to both the NDVI and MID ASCR methods. Stratification by major LC type had no effect on overall accuracies, regardless of method.

It often forms dense stands that displace native vegetation and useful forage plants on rangelands and in riparian habitats. Leafy spurge is a good candidate for detection via remote sensing because the distinctive yellow-green color of its bracts is spectrally unique when compared to co-occurring green vegetation. During 1999, Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery was acquired in northeastern Wyoming and ground cover data were collected. Mixture tuned matched filtering (MTMF), a specialized type of spectral mixture analysis, was used to estimate leafy spurge canopy cover and map leafy spurge distribution. Overall performance of MTMF for estimating percent cover of leafy spurge for all sites was good (r(2) = 0.69) with better performance in prairie areas (r(2) = 0.79) and poorer performance occurring on wooded sites (r(2) = 0.57). However, results demonstrated that in open canopies with leafy spurge in the understory, the spectral signature is sufficiently distinct to be detectable. The techniques presented here could be used for constructing leafy spurge distribution and abundance maps with satellite hyperspectral data for larger regional areas. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The blooms emerged at 100 km from both coasts in the Gulf of Oman (60.5degreesE, 24.5degreesN) where the depth is about 3000 m. The Chl-a concentrations patch first appeared on November 2 and decayed after about 4 weeks (December 3, 1996). The high Chl-a concentrations patch was about 100 km in diameter and it was located at 60.3-61.3degreesE, 23.5-24.5degreesN. The bloom, having a mean Chl-a concentration of 6.8 mg m(-3) on November 6, was located in a cold SST eddy, which was accompanied by another feature, an anticyclone eddy (of 100 km in diameter) with high SST and low Chl-a concentrations to the southwest (61.5degreesE, 22.5degreesN). An SST drop occurred around November 14, which coincides with a peak of the vertical pumping velocity derived from NSCAT-derived wind stress. Two SeaWiFS-derived Chl-a images obtained in November 1998 and 1999 show good agreement in terms of the locations and features with those described above through the OCTS observations.

Further, scaling relationships are derived to link the value of the variance of data aggregated at different scales, allowing the deteremination of data variability at course resolution on the basis of ground measurements. The comparison between the theoretical, upscaled, values of standard deviation and those computed from remote sensing data shows a good agreement supporting the derived relations.

The gains determined from the reflectance-based method are all lower than the prelaunch values for bands 1-5 and the values for band 7 exceed the prelaunch gains.

However, then is an increasing need to include soil reflectance values in spectral unmixing algorithms or in classification approaches. Zn most cases, the impact of soil moisture on the reflectance is unknown and therefore ignored. The objective of this study was to model reflectance changes due to soil moisture in a real field situation using multiresolution airborne Spot data. As the direct observation of soils is only possible in the absence of vegetation, the effective remote sensing of soil moisture is limited to a few days each year. III such a favorable time window, modeling the soil moisture-reflectance relationships was found possible. The proposed exponential model was not valid when all soil categories were considered together. However, when fitted to each category, the RMS error on moisture estimates ranged from 2.0% to 3.5% except for silty soils with crusting problems (6%). Results also indicated that, when the soils have similar colors (i.e. same hue), soil categories can be partly grouped and the model can be simplified, using the same intercept coefficients. This study has potential application for;he definition of a more generalized model of the soil reflectance. It shows that the impact of soil moisture on reflectance could be higher than differences in reflectance due to the soil categories. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

The relatively short (2.14 cm) K-u-band of the space-borne NASA scatterometer (NSCAT) is sensitive to changes in dielectric properties, associated with large-scale shifts in the relative abundance and phase (frozen or thawed) of canopy and surface water. We used a temporal change detection analysis of NSCAT daily radar backscatter measurements to classify surface freeze/thaw state across a 1.4 million km(2) region of Alaska from January to June 1997. In the spring, radar backscatter measurements showed pronounced decreases (1.6-4.9 dB) relative to reference frozen state conditions, which corresponded with sustained maximum daily air temperature measurements above 0.0 degreesC and total decreases in measured snow depths from 28% to 61% of seasonal maximum values. We classified the daily frozen and nonfrozen area for the region based on the sign (+/-) of the radar backscatter temporal difference relative to frozen and nonfrozen reference conditions. These results compared favorably (e.g., r(2) = 0.881; p less than or equal to 0.0001) with frozen area estimates derived from the regional weather station network. NSCAT-derived estimates of the timing and spatial variation in regional thaw during spring were also generally consistent with seasonal increases in river discharge for five major Alaska basins. The NSCAT sensor appears to be responsive to changes in dielectric properties associated with surface freeze/thaw transitions over broad boreal and arctic landscapes. Further study involving longer time-series information, alternative radar wavelengths, and finer spatial scales is needed, however, to resolve the various components (i.e., soil, vegetation, snow) of the regional radar freeze/thaw signature for improved monitoring of the circumpolar high latitudes.

This has an impact on the Earth\'s radiation budget, the magnitude of which has not yet been well quantified. Satellite remote sensing is well suited to assessing the area of biomass burning, a prerequisite for estimating emissions at regional and global scales. Commonly used satellite-based techniques for measuring burned areas include thermal hotspot detection and multitemporal NDVI analysis, each having several limitations. Here we present a new, hybrid approach for boreal burned area mapping called HANDS, or hotspot and NDVI differencing synergy. The automated technique was tested using satellite data covering Canada for the 1995 and 1996 fire seasons, and comparing results with official burned area statistics and conventional fire surveys. HANDS computed a national burned forest area of 6.8 million ha in 1995 and 2.0 million ha in 1996, corresponding favorably to Canadian Forest Service estimates of 7.1 million ha and 1.9 million ha, respectively. Moreover, in most cases, the technique accurately delineated the boundaries of individual burns and identified some burns that were missed with conventional mapping. When employed in conjunction with NOAA-AVHRR imagery, HANDS provides a consistent means of mapping large burns (>10 km(2)), which are characteristic for the boreal forest. New generation sensors (e.g., SPOT VEGETATION, Terra MODIS) should enable its successful application to a wider range of environments.

Using this type of imagery, it can also be shown that soil organic matter is positively correlated to growth conditions for cereal crops in dryland agriculture. Strong correlations with qualitative erosion indicators that can be derived through spectral unmixing approaches demonstrate that soil organic matter is an important indicator for assessing land degradation processes in dry ecosystems from space.

The total impact of these events (ENSO) on societies is estimated in billions of dollars and consequences include famine, human health problems, loss of life, property damage, and destruction of the environment. Areas sensitive to ENSO have been identified in some world areas from climatic historical records and recently from the normalized difference vegetation index. This paper examines the last 15-year association between monthly sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical Pacific and vegetation health (condition) index for the entire world. The vegetation health (condition) index, derived from a combination of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer-based normalized difference vegetation index and 10-mum to 11-mum thermal radiances, was designed for monitoring moisture and thermal impacts on vegetation health (greenness and vigor). Two types of responses were identified. In boreal winter, ecosystems of northern South America, southern Africa, and Southeast Asia experienced severe moisture and thermal stress during El Nino and favorable conditions during La Nina years. In Argentina and southwestern United States/Mexico regions, the response was the opposite. World ecosystems are less sensitive to SSTs during boreal summer, except for the areas in northern Brazil and Southeast Asia, where vegetation conditions deteriorate/improve during the warm/cold water cycle in the tropical Pacific. In some areas, ENSO impacts on ecosystems are clearly identified from satellites and not from in situ data (or vice versa). During the boreal winter, these discrepancies occurred in Central America, northern Brazil, and southeastern United States; during the boreal summer, the discrepancies occurred in the sub-Sahara Africa and in the northern part of South America. In the course of the 1997-1999 ENSOs, world vegetation generally responded in accordance with the vegetation health/SST teleconnection patterns. However, in southern Africa, January-March 1998 vegetation stress was not as severe and widespread as in other El Nino years. Similarly, no stress was recorded in Argentina during the 1998-1999 La Nina.

Results are considered in terms of commission error (falsely indicated trees) and omission error (missed trees). Tree isolation accuracy is also considered as a function of tree crown size. The success of LM filtering in locating trees depends on the size and distribution of trees in relation to the image spatial resolution. A static-sized 3x3 pixel LM filter provides an indication of the maximum number of trees that may be found in the imagery, yet high errors of commission reduce the integrity of the results. Variable window-size techniques may be applied to reduce both the errors of commission and omission, especially for larger trees. The distribution of the error by tree size is important since the large trees account for a greater proportion of the stand basal area than the smaller trees. An investigation of the success of tree identification by tree crown radius demonstrates the relationship between image spatial resolution and LM filtering success. At an image spatial resolution of 1 m, a tree crown radius of 1.5 m appears to be the minimum size for reliable identification of tree locations using LM filtering.

The problem to estimate soil moisture is to free from the effects of the space and time fluctuations of soil roughness and from the vegetation cover attenuation and scattering. The methodology presented here is based on the selection of land cover types or \"targets,\" for which the SAR signal is mainly sensitive to soil water content variations, and for which the vegetation and the roughness effects (in SAR signal) can be estimated and removed if needed. This method has been validated over an agricultural watershed in France.

Such maps can be used in conjunction with ecological data to extend locally intensive analyses to the landscape and watershed scale and beyond. In many cases, however, the field data used to produce and validate map classifications are not designed for ecological applications. The objective of this study is to present the fuzzy similarity index assessment method for evaluating the accuracy of maps of natural vegetation based upon methods in plant ecology. Using an example classification and associated data from field plots, a similarity index is employed to compare validation data against the defined composition for each map class, thereby producing a quantitative measure of the similarity of each observation to all classes. Fuzzy membership among classes is quantitatively evaluated using the differences in similarity between validation plots and all classes in the classification. The nature of the gradients in vegetation composition among the map classes can therefore be identified. Consequently, some classes are interpreted as compositionally distinct while others may share traits with many classes. Additional analyses determined the detail of field data collection necessary to produce consistent results using the fuzzy similarity index assessment method. Complete inventories of the presence and abundance of species are not required; rather, a field sampling method biased toward the 12 to 20 most important species in a given class is acceptable.

A number of methods are currently used to produce such hybrid imagery. Until note, these methods have only been evaulated independently, and have not been compared to one another to determine an optimum approach. Two different operations are involved in creating high-resolution material maps. One task is to unmix hyperspectral images into the constituent materials (endmembers). The other task is to fuse low-resolution imagery containing spectral detail with high-resolution image(s) containing fine spatial information. This research performs a quantitative test of three image fusion procedures. The first method is to fuse, then unmix. One sharpens low-resolution multispectral data using a panchromatic image, producing a set of high-resolution multispectral images. These images are then separated into a series of high-resolution endmember maps, locating the materials within the scene. The second method is to unmix, then fuse. In this approach, one first separates the low-resolution multispectral data into a series of material maps using a recently developed adaptive unmixing algorithm. These maps are fused with the panchromatic image in a stage called sharpening to produce high-resolution material maps The final method is also an unmix-then-fuse approach. Here, the low-resolution material maps are created using traditional image-wide spectral unmixing methods. The resulting images are fused with the panchromatic image to produce sharpened material maps. In this paper, the three image fusion procedures described above are evaluated for their radiometric and unmixing accuracy. The results show that the adaptive unmixing algorithm is superior to the traditional imagewide methods. Difference between quantitative and visual evaluations indicate an improved Error metric must be developed.

In this paper an alternative methodology is presented, employing airborne gamma-ray spectrometry and magnetic data. The methodology includes the selection of combinations of data channels and their transformations to enhance the discriminative power of the lithology classification. An analysis of the training set compiled from 2,795 field stations showed that the potassium, thorium, and uranium gamma-ray spectrometry and total and residual magnetic field channels provided an overall classification success rate of 65% for a total of 10 lithological units. Parametric classifications based on this training set yielded 67% coincidence with the geological map, whereas a neutral network classified provided only 23% coincidence. Exploiting the spa spatial autocorrelation of the geophysical signatures by adding averaged filtered channels slightly improved the coincidence percentage to 70% and enhanced the continuity of linear enclaves within larger lithological units. nle contribution of magnetic data to the classification depends on the extent to which the anomaly spectrum and its processed derivatives reflect surface geology. We found that both rite short and long wavelengths in the spectrum contributed to the classification performance.

SAR systems operating with high spatial resolutions and different wavelengths (i.c., X-, C-, L- and P-band) acquired data in Guyana and Colombia. Three fundamentally different information sources from the radar return signal were considered in the study: its strength or backscatter, polarization and phase, and spatial variability or texture. Radiometric, polarimetric, and textural attributes were computed from predefined image regions selected to represent five types of primary forest, selectively logged forest, secondary forest, and a mixture of nonforest cover types. Texture was found to be the most important source of information in high resolution X- and C-band images. Textural attributes computed per region made modest to good bases for automated classifications of the land cover types studied. Primary forests and logged-over forests were found to display particularly distinctive textural patterns. Backscatter values computed per region from L- and P-band radar images also made modest to good classification bases. Backscatter measurements in either a single L- or P-band channel enabled accurate classification of nonforest cover types. Reliable identification of secondary forests and logged-over forests generally asked for measurements in a minimum of two C-, L-, and/or P-band radar channels. Similarly, reliable assessment of primary forest types required observations in a minimum of three C-, L-, and/or P-band radar channels.

Emphasis was placed on exploring different smoothing and derivative algorithms to extract spectral details from spectral data sets. A modular program was created to perform interactive derivative analysis. This module calculated derivatives using either a convolution (Savitzky-Golay) or finite divided difference approximation algorithm. Spectra were smoothed using one of the three built-in smoothing algorithms (Savitzky-Golay smoothing, Kawata-Minami smoothing, and mean-filter smoothing) prior to the derivative computation procedures. Laboratory spectral data were used to test the performance of the implemented derivative analysis module. An algorithm for detecting the absorption band positions was executed on synthetic spectra and a soybean fluorescence spectrum to demonstrate the usage of the implemented modules in extracting spectral features. Issues related to smoothing and spectral deviation caused by the smoothing and spectral deviation caused by the smoothing or derivative computation algorithms were also observed and are discussed. A scaling effect, resulting from the migration of band separations when using the finite divided difference approximation derivative algorithm, can be used to enhance spectral features at the scale of specified sampling interval and remove noise or features smaller than the sampling interval.

If these complex optical relationships could be quantified, it would be possible to extract coastal information from spectral radiance data. We use data from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) in a neural network system to establish quantitative, empirical relationships between one of these parameters, depth, and remotely sensed spectral radiance. Data are analyzed for two areas: the western coast of Florida in the Tampa Bay area and the Florida Keys between Upper Matecumbe and Plantation Keys. The neural network approach results in retrieval of reasonable depths from spectral radiance in both cases over a depth range of 0 to 6 m. Retrieved depths for Tampa Bay are accurate to a RMS error of 0.84 m relative to depths in the National Ocean Survey (NOS) Hydrographic Database, and the Keys retrievals have an RMS error of 0.39 m relative to a bathymetric survey conducted to support this study. A neural network trained on a combination of the two data sets results in a combined RMS error of 0.48 m, nearly the same performance as neural networks trained individually. The ability of the neural network to generalize, producing algorithms with some degree of universality among diverse coastal environments is, thereby, demonstrated. The result of the generalization analysis is of practical importance because it indicates that the neural network may not require an extensive training set of water depth data in order to the \"tuned\" for each location where depth retrievals are desired. While empirical the neural network is in some sense a model of the inversion of the radiative transfer problem within the marine environment. The neural network approach, therefore, operates on a higher level than more traditional statistical curve fitting solutions for retrieval of remotely sensed information.

In order to develop an insight into the problem of assessing hemispheric emission from directional measurements, we formulate the directional (monochromatic) greenhouse factor g(d), specified as the ratio of a longwave radiance measured above the atmosphere to that emitted from the surface at the same zenith angle theta(r). The explicit expressions for g(d) involve two atmospheric parameters, the optical thickness and the temperature-profile parameter. Oar analysis indicates that under clear conditions a narrow-band radiance, if measured at theta(v) approximate to 57 degrees in atmospheric windows (low values of optical thickness) and at theta(v) approximate to 47 degrees in absorption bands, determines the hemispheric-average radiance to within about 1%. For broad spectral bands, whether under clear or cloudy (solid cover, or \'\'randomly scattered\'\' clouds) conditions, the same finding applies at theta(v) approximate to 50 degrees. Thus, the zenith angle of equivalence theta(eq) varies by about +/-5 degrees for different values of the optical thickness; it varies only slightly for different temperature profiles (even though different temperature profiles produce quite different patterns of radiance us. theta(v), that is, different ADMs apply). Measurements at or near theta(eq) therefore constitute direct assessment of OLR, without resorting to ADMs to adjust for the variations of emission with view angle (anisotropy). The existing OLR data should be reexamined accepting measurements only within the range 45-60 degrees of view zenith angles. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.', 'UNIV ARIZONA,TUCSON,AZ.

Such estimates are especially useful in documenting effusive volcanic activity occurring in remote regions, where ground observations may be sparse or completely lacking. We use a time-series ATSR dataset to document the 1995 eruption of Fernandina Volcano, an important but isolated volcanic island in the Galapagos archipelago. We estimate that in 1995 Fernandina produced a 6 km(2) lava flow field with a volume of around 20 million m(3), a similar magnitude to previously studied Fernandina eruptions. This is the first time-series analysis of art active Galapagos lava flow produced using remotely sensed data. Previous Fernandina flows have been investigated many months or years after the activity had ceased. The current and future availability of frequent, low-spatial resolution infrared radiance data from spaceborne sensors such as the Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) should ensure that adaptations of these techniques can be used to document future volcanic eruptions occurring in similarly isolated regions.

Of particular interest were land pixels partially contaminated by clouds, smoke, or other atmospheric aerosols, as well as pixels with partial snow or ice cover. The method developed for this purpose, dubbed CECANT (cloud elimination from composites using Albedo and NDVI trend), uses Channel 1 surface reflectance to identify fully cloud-, snow-, and ice-covered pixels; and two parameters (R, Z) to distinguish bright (in Channel 1), clear-sky pixels from intrinsically darker but partly contaminated pixels. R and Z are based on the seasonal NDVI trajectory. Three thresholds are required to apply this approach; they are obtained from the histograms of Channel 1, R and Z. The thresholds are adjusted separately for each compositing period. Tests with multidate histograms and single-date images indicated the consistency and robustness of the method in an area where most seasonal NDVI trajectories have a single peak. An application of the CECANT procedure to AVHRR composites over Canada for 1993 showed that an average 51% of the land pixels were fully or partly contaminated (37% +/- 5% in June to August period), with a range from 31% (midsummer) to 91% (October).

The sahelian grassland ecosystem STEP model developed for that purpose was also described and validated. In order to fulfill a prerequisite for using coarse resolution optical satellite data with the STEP model, the present paper presents i) a modeling of the reflectance which is adapted to the sahelian landscape and ii) a study based on the coupled ecosystem-reflectance modeling to assess the potential of vegetation indices for inferring vegetation. parameters. The modeling of the landscape reflectance is based on existing soil and canopy reflectance models, and considers area-weighted contributions from green and dry vegetation, and bare soil components. The ecosystem model provides the landscape reflectance models with inputs like vegetation cover fraction. (f(v)) and leaf area index (LAI) to characterize the vegetation present. Atmospheric effects are also accounted for using an existing simplified radiative transfer model. Simulated top of the atmosphere reflectances confronted to real satellite data during a growing season indicate that the modeling is adequate to reproduce temporal profiles of vegetation indices when atmospheric conditions are not prohibitive. Simulated vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, GEMI, SR) compared to vegetation characteristics show that a good tracking of the evolution of LAI and f(v) during the growing season is possible before maturation. A sensitivity study of the four VIs to green biomass, soil brightness, and atmospheric water vapor is carried out for the specific case of the Sahel. The SAVI and NDVI are both found to be adequate if atmospheric effects are minimized. NDVI integrated over the growing season is compared to net primary productivity (NPP) for different sites, regions, and growing seasons. A near-linear relationship is found, but the same relationship may not be applicable to different regions or growing seasons, On the whole, the results suggest that vegetation indices contain information which are useful for the ecosystem model, despite the fact that perturbating factors make the retrieval of these informations difficult.

In an experiment with miniature canopies of 1-m-tall Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) seedlings, we modified leaf area index, light absorption capacity, and photosynthetic potential by altering the concentration of chlorophyll in foliage and by controlling the density of seedlings. We measured canopy photosynthesis and light transmission in controlled-environment chambers and then transferred seedlings to a hemispheric illumination system where we measured canopy reflectance. We found that altering the visible band used for computation of a normalized vegetation index substantially changed the correlations between the index and canopy properties. For example, the normalized index was best correlated to light absorption capacity when we used a narrow red band (671-674 nm; R2 = 0.71), and least correlated when we used a narrow green band (565-575 nm; R2 = 0.27). On the other hand, the index computed with the 565-575 nm band was best correlated with the photosynthetic potential of canopies grown in sunlight (R2 = 0.84), and the correlation was lower when a narrow red band was used (R2 = 0.37). The cause of these differences is chlorophyll. The green regions of reflectance spectra were much more sensitive to changes in chlorophyll concentration compared with the red or near-infrared regions. Increased chlorophyll concentration was also related to increased photosynthetic potential when canopies had been grown under full sunlight. However, we found no statistically significant relationship between leaf chlorophyll concentration and canopy light absorption.RP YODER, BJ (通讯作者)，OREGON STATE UNIV, DEPT FOREST SCI, CORVALLIS, OR 97331 USA.RI Waring, Richared H/C-4796-2014', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Waring, Richared H/0000-0003-2533-3664', NULL, NULL, 47, 136, 140, 0, 16, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

The POLDER instrument was flown for the first time on 17 June 1990 over the \'\'La Crau\'\' site, in southern France and the results are presented in this article. The POLDER instrument is scheduled for launch in 1995 on the Japanese ADEOS (ADvanced Earth Observing System) platform. Surface based atmospheric optic measurements (spectral optical thickness, sky radiance) are used to estimate the aerosol refractive index and size distribution. The corresponding aerosol model is then used in a radiative transfer model to simulate POLDER polarized measurements. The correlation between the observations and the simulations is good for the 550 nm and 650 nm wavelengths, but the simulation is biased for the 850 nm wavelength. These results indicate that, compared with the atmospheric contribution to the polarized reflectance, the surface contribution can be neglected at shorter wavelengths, but not so in near infrared wavelengths. The POLDER instrument allows multidirectional reflectance measurements. A surface target bidirectional reflectance, therefore, can be sampled at various viewing angles. In this article, we investigate the angular variations of the surface reflectance of various surface covers. The main observed variations are: i) a limb brightening, ii) a larger reflectance in the backscattering direction; iii) a local maximum in the forward direction for the shorter wavelengths, indicating specular reflection by the leaves.

Landsat data were used to map the monthly and seasonal changes in the boundaries of the lakes and the drainage canals in the sand dune areas. Landsat images for Al-Hassa Oasis during summer and winter months between 1972 and 1987 were produced from Landsat Multispectral Scanner and Thematic Mapper data. The images show that the drainage water has formed large water courses in the sand dunes and is being wasted by flowing into the Arabian Gulf during winter season. They also show that the water ceases to flow into the Gulf, and that the water courses dry up during the summer, This information is new, and has changed the previous concept that used to indicate that the drainage water remains in the lakes for the purpose of aquifer recharge and cattle drinking.

The assumed Channel 6 emittance model only permits emissivity values to be derived from five of the six TIMS channels. Second, both techniques are less susceptible to noise than the assumed Channel 6 emittance model. The disadvantage of both techniques is that laboratory data must be converted to thermal log residuals or alpha residuals to facilitate comparison with similarly processed image data.

NPV plays an essential role in terrestrial ecosystem processes, and is an important indicator of drought severity, ecosystem disturbance, agricultural resilience, and wildfire danger. Current moderate spatial resolution multispectral satellite systems (e.g., Landsat and Sentinel-2) have only a single band in the 2000-2500 nm shortwave infrared \"SWIR2\" range where non-pigment biochemical constituents of NPV, including cellulose and lignin, have important spectral absorption features. Thus, these current systems have suboptimal capabilities for characterizing NPV cover. This research used simulated spectral mixtures accounting for variability among NPV and soils to evaluate globally-appropriate hyperspectral and multispectral indices for estimation of fractional NPV cover. The Continuum Interpolated NPV Depth Index (CINDI), a weighted ratio index measuring lignocellulose absorption near 2100 nm, was found to produce the lowest error in estimating NPV cover. CINDI was less sensitive to variability in soil spectra and green vegetation cover than competing indices. While CINDI was sensitive to the relative water content of soil and NPV, this sensitivity allowed for correcting error in estimated NPV cover as water content increased. CINDI bands were less capable than Dual Absorption NPV Index (DANI) bands for maintaining continuity with the heritage Landsat SWIR2 band, but combining multiple CINDI bands demonstrated adequate continuity. Three SWIR2 bands with band centers at 2038, 2108, and 2211 nm can provide superior capabilities for future moderate resolution multispectral/superspectral systems targeting NPV monitoring, including the next generation Landsat mission (Landsat Next). These bands and the associated CINDI index provide potential for global NPV monitoring using a constellation of future superspectral sensors and imaging spectrometers, with applications including improving soil management, preventing land degradation, evaluating impacts of drought, mapping ecosystem disturbance, and assessing wildfire danger.', '[Dennison, Philip E.; Campbell, Michael J.] Univ Utah, Dept Geog, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.

In Canada\'s North, where freshwater lakes and wetlands cover 15 to 40% of the landscape, monitoring ice phenology is vital to understand its impacts on climate, socio-economic, ecological, and hydrological systems. The rapid and dynamic nature of ice phenology events has restricted monitoring efforts to the use of satellite sensors with frequent revisit times (e.g., MODIS, AVHRR), but their low resolution (e.g., > 500 m) limits observations to larger water bodies. However, the increased abundance of highresolution open-access satellite imagery combined with the rise of cloud-computing technologies has provided opportunities to reduce the trade-off between temporal (i.e., revisit time) and spatial (i.e., pixel size) resolution allowing for lake ice monitoring over broad scales. In this study, we present the Open Pixel-based Earth eNgine Ice (OPEN-ICE) algorithm implemented in Google Earth Engine (GEE), which classifies imagery from multiple open-access optical sensors, then combines them to construct dense annual time series of ice-water observations and estimate pixel spring breakup dates at a 30-m resolution. Using Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI, and Sentinel-2 MSI scenes over lakes spanning northern latitudes, we build reference datasets to train decision trees that discriminate between ice, water, and clouds. We combine ice-water classifications from each sensor into annual time series and remove misclassifications with a temporal filter applied using a pixel-wise logistic regression. We then detect the sequence of transition from ice to water in each pixel\'s time series to estimate the occurrence of breakup each year. We deploy the OPEN-ICE algorithm over all freshwater pixels of Canada for the period of 2013 to 2021. Spring ice phenology events estimated by OPEN-ICE show high accuracy when compared to whole-lake breakup dates measured by the Canadian Ice Service in 105 lakes across 9 years, with mean bias errors of -1.10 and - 0.69 days for breakup start and end, respectively. We apply the OPEN-ICE algorithm to 4000 lakes across Canada and evaluate differences in breakup dates across ecozones and lake sizes. Our new OPEN-ICE tool provides accurate estimates of annual spring breakup events applicable across all boreal and arctic regions to monitor the rapid changes taking place in these vulnerable ecosystems.', '[Giroux-Bougard, Xavier; Cardille, Jeffrey A.] Dept Nat Resource Sci, 21111 Lakeshore Rd,Ste Anne Bellevue, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.

Oil palm height enables the quantitative estimation for carbon stock or palm oil yield. Nevertheless, there are still no accurate characterization of oil palm height providing information for the tradeoff between forest damage and carbon stock of oil palm in Southeast Asia. The new generation of spaceborne LiDAR provides large-extent canopy height samples, offering an opportunity for mapping the oil palm height at the regional scale yet with challenge to extrapolate the footprint heights to spatially coherent maps. Here, we proposed a new method by combining Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) footprint data with stand age that is closely related to tree height. We first developed a semi-automatic filtering algorithm to filter the low-quality ICESat-2 data, and used a change detection algorithm to optimize the planting year map of oil palm. Then, an empirical age-height model was derived by linking ICESat-2 footprint canopy height with oil palm age that was used to estimate spatially and temporally oil palm height for the whole Peninsular Malaysia. A validation with inde-pendent ICESat-2 footprint data suggests a high agreement for the height estimates in 2020 from the age-height model (R2 = 0.63; RMSE = 1.64 m) with a bias within & PLUSMN;3 m for >90% of the height estimates. Using the age-height model and planting year map of oil palm, we produced the first comprehensive wall-to-wall maps of long-term yearly oil palm height at a spatial resolution of 30 m in Peninsular Malaysia during 2001 through 2020. Our results suggest that the mean height of oil palm in all and regionally-disturbed areas have increased by 10.82 m and 9.29 m respectively during the last two decades in Peninsular Malaysia. Our results indicate that combining stand age and ICESat-2 footprint data has great potential in spatially-explicit mapping regional oil palm height that contributes to a better quantification for regional plantation carbon stock.', '[Zang, Jinlong; Zhang, Yongguang] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Resou, Nanjing, Peoples R China.

However, the retrieval of SSA from satellite platforms is limited because most existing passive satellite sensors such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) only provide the measurements of reflected solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), which are only capable of retrieving aerosol optical depth (AOD) on the basis of assumed SSA. In this study, we develop a machine learning based algorithm to retrieve SSA using joint surface visibility and satellite radiation measurements. With ancillary information such as meteorological condition, surface visibility can be regarded as a proxy of column AOD. By combining MODIS measured TOA apparent reflectance with ground visibility as well as other auxiliary parameters, we retrieve SSA at over 6000 visibility stations worldwide.

Remote sensing is a convenient approach providing frequent, near-real-time information with fine resolution over wide areas. According to the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH), spectral diversity (SD) is an effective proxy of environmental heterogeneity, which ultimately relates to plant diversity. So far, studies testing the relationship between SD and biodiversity have reported contradictory findings, calling for a thorough investigation of the key factors (i.e., metrics applied, habitat type, scale, and temporal effects) and conditions under which such a relationship exists. This study investigates the applicability of the SVH for monitoring plant diversity at the landscape scale by comparing the performance of three types of SD metrics. Species richness and functional diversity were calculated for >2000 grid cells of 5 \' x 3 \' covering the Czech Republic. Within each cell, we quantified SD using a Landsat-8 \"greenest pixel\" composite by applying (i) the standard deviation of NDVI, (ii) Rao\'s Q entropy index and (iii) the richness of \"spectral communities\". Habitat type (i.e., land cover) was included in the models of the relationship between SD and ground biodiversity. Both species richness and functional diversity showed positive and significant relationships with each SD metric tested. However, SD alone accounted for a small fraction of the deviance explained by the models. Furthermore, the strength of the relationship depended significantly on habitat type and was highest in natural areas with transitional bushy and herbaceous vegetation. Our results underline that despite the stability of the significance of the relationship between SD and plant diversity at this scale, the applicability of SD for biodiversity monitoring is contextdependent and the factors mediating such a relationship must be carefully considered to avoid misleading conclusions.', '[Perrone, Michela; Conti, Luisa; Keil, Petr; Rocchini, Duccio; Moudry, Vitezslav; Simova, Petra; Prajzlerova, Dominika; Wild, Jan] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Spatial Sci, Kamycka 129, Praha Suchdol 16500, Czech Republic.

Recent infrared satellite measurements have revealed that NH3 emitted by industries are an important and underestimated emission source. Yet, to assess these emissions, current satellite sounders are severely limited by their spatial resolution. In this paper, we analyse measurement data recorded in a series of imaging surveys that were conducted over industries in the Greater Berlin area (Germany). On board the aircraft were the Telops Hyper-Cam LW, targeting NH3 measurements in the longwave infrared at a resolution of 4 m and the SWING+ spectrometer targeting NO2 measurements in the UV-Vis at a resolution of 180 m.Two flights were carried out over German\'s largest production facility of synthetic NH3, urea and other fertilizers. In both cases, a large NH3 plume was observed originating from the factory. Using a Gaussian plume model to take into account plume rise and dispersion, coupled with well-established radiative transfer and inverse methods, we retrieve vertical column densities. From these, we calculate NH3 emission fluxes using the integrated mass enhancement and cross-sectional flux methods, yielding consistent emissions of the order of 2200 t yr-1 for both flights, assuming constant fluxes across the year. These estimates are about five times larger than those reported in the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) for this plant. In the second campaign, a co-emitted NO2 plume was measured, likely related to the production of nitric acid at the plant.A third flight was carried out over an area comprising the cities of Stassfurt and Bernburg. Several small NH3 plumes were seen, one over a production facility of mineral wool insulation, one over a sugar factory and two over the soda ash plants in Stassfurt and Bernburg. A fifth and much larger plume was seen to originate from the sedimentation basins associated with the soda ash plant in Stassfurt, indicating rapid volatilization of ammonium rich effluents. We use the different measurement campaigns to simulate measurements of Nitrosat, a potential future satellite sounder dedicated to the sounding of reactive nitrogen at a resolution of 500 m. We demonstrate that such measurements would allow accurately constraining emissions in a single overpass, overcoming a number of important drawbacks of current satellite sounders.', '[Noppen, Lara; Clarisse, Lieven; Van Damme, Martin; Coheur, Pierre] Univ libre Bruxelles ULB, Spect, Quantum Chem & Atmospher Remote Sensing SQUARES, Brussels, Belgium.

While soil moisture inversion from time series data can utilize more independent observations, the value of further constraints on the inversion process are widely acknowledged. However, how to constrain a time series retrieval for global soil moisture mapping is still unresolved. In this study, three kinds of time series constraints were further developed and evaluated, including the use of 1) temporal behavior of soil moisture and soil moisture bounds; 2) temporal behavior of vegetation or time-invariant vegetation; and 3) time series ensemble skill. The effect of these constraints was investigated using 4 years (2016-2019) C-band Sentinel-1 data collected over 547 worldwide stations from 17 networks available on the international soil moisture network (ISMN) and intensive ground samples collected during the Fifth Soil Moisture Active and Passive Experiment (SMAPEx-5). While the effect of these temporal retrieval skills varies in time and space, the global validation yielded four general suggestions: 1) the assumption of time-invariant vegetation contributed negatively even for a short retrieval period of <= 12 days; 2) reliable soil moisture bounds of each retrieval period can substantially improve the retrieval statistics at the cost of an underestimated soil moisture range; 3) the temporal constraints of soil moisture and vegetation need to be used together with the soil moisture bounds for reliable estimation; 4) the use of an ensemble retrieval could partly remove the retrieval uncertainties at the expense of underestimating soil moisture variation. The use of these constraints resulted in a competitive correlation coefficient (R: 0.64), root mean square error (RMSE: 0.072 m3/ m3) and unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE: 0.052 m3/m3) at a spatial grid of 100 m, with similar performance achieved across a retrieval window up to 132 days.', '[Zhu, Liujun; Yuan, Shanshui] Hohai Univ, Yangtze Inst Conservat & Dev, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing plays an important role in the continuous monitoring and mapping of rice cultivation in cloudy regions since it is not affected by weather conditions. To date, most SAR imagery-based rice mapping methods rely on prior knowledge (e.g., the planting date) and empirical thresholds for specific regions, which limits their applications in large spatial scales. To tackle this limitation, this study proposed a new SAR-based Paddy Rice Index (SPRI) to quantify the probability of land patches planted paddy rice. SPRI fully uses unique features of paddy rice during the transplanting-vegetative period in the Sentinel-1 VH backscatter time series. With the assistance of cloud-free Sentinel-2 images, SPRI can be calculated for each cropland object with adaptive parameters. Then, SPRI values of cropland objects can be converted to paddy rice maps using the binary-classification threshold. The proposed SPRI method was tested at five sites with diverse climate conditions, landscape complexity and cropping systems. Results show that the SPRI was able to produce an accurate classification map with an overall accuracy of over 88% and an F1 score of over 0.86 at all sites. Compared with the existing SAR-based rice mapping methods, our method performed much better in heterogeneous agricultural areas where rice is mosaiced with other crops. As SPRI does not need any prior knowledge, reference samples and many predefined parameters, it has high flexibility and applicability to support paddy rice mapping in large areas, especially for cloudy regions where optical remote sensing data is often not available.', '[Xu, Shuai; Zhu, Xiaolin; Duan, Mingjie; Wan, Luoma; Tan, Xiaoyue; Xu, Yi Nam] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

This subsidence has caused extensive damage to buildings and other infrastructures. By exploiting 1650 images from 33 ALOS-1 paths during 2007-2011 using multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture (InSAR) techniques, we have constructed, for the first time, a deformation map over 500,000 km2 of the 1900-km-long GC, with an RMSE of <10 mm/yr. The GC is generally stable, but numerous land deformation zones have been discovered, including at least 30 subsidence patterns and 14 uplift features. The maximum rate of subsidence measured is about 56 mm/yr at Stratton Ridge Oil Field, Texas. Most of the identified ground instabilities are newly discovered as a result of this study. The land deformation along GC is caused by both regional geological conditions and human activities that have influenced natural surroundings and consequentially exacerbated ground instability. Depressurization of petroleum reservoirs and aquifer compaction related to groundwater withdrawal are the principal impactors on observed subsidence. Other processes, including wastewater injection, sulfur/salt mining, dewatering, oxidation, and construction work, also contributed to the InSAR-mapped ground instability. Our large-scale deformation mapping will help the scientific community and relevant agencies better understand land deformation rates and extents, identify the processes responsible for the coastal deformation, and provide a critical dataset for hazard prediction and mitigation in the GC.', '[Qu, Feifei; Lu, Zhong; Kim, Jinwoo] Southern Methodist Univ, Roy M Huffington Dept Earth Sci, Dallas, TX 75025 USA.

The diurnal variation in photosynthesis provides key information on the responses of ecosystems to environmental drivers, but there is a critical gap in the large-scale estimation of diurnal photosynthesis. In the last decade, satellite estimates of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) have been found to mimic the seasonality of photosynthesis. Recently, the deployment of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) on the International Space Station has provided the opportunity to retrieve SIF at different times of the day. Here we utilized OCO-3 measurements to estimate and analyze diurnal cycles of SIF and gross primary production (GPP) at the global scale. We first mitigated the sun-sensor geometry effects on nadir-mode OCO-3 SIF (SIFnadir) at the sub-diurnal scale (hourly) by deriving the total canopy SIF emission (SIFtotal) using radiative transfer theory. Next, we generated the spatially and temporally continuous hourly SIFnadir and SIFtotal using artificial neural networks under clear-sky conditions, whose extrapolation ability was evaluated using the data from independent years. Compared with SIFnadir, the diurnal relationship between clear-sky SIFtotal and GPP from 38 homogeneous flux sites had smaller variations in the slope (the coefficient of variation was 0.07 vs 0.19). In addition, a correction to account for the bias between clear-sky and overcast conditions was used to estimate all-sky GPP from clear-sky SIFtotal and the resulting GPP was strongly correlated with tower GPP (R2 = 0.75; RMSE = 3.53 mu mol/m2/s). Our results demonstrated that the new OCO-3 SIF trained GPP product (GPPSIF) was able to depict the diurnal pattern of photosynthesis globally, capturing also the physiologically hysteresis or afternoon depression of photosynthesis. By doing so, hourly GPPSIF has the potential to improve the modeling of terrestrial photosynthesis and the projection of the global carbon cycle under climate change.', '[Zhang, Zhaoying; Zhang, Yongguang] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Resou, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

In effect, finite resources can be better optimized to support the needs of often extensively affected areas. However, the derivation of SAR-based flood information is not without its challenges and inaccurate flood detection can result in poor decision-making and non-trivial, adverse consequences. Reliable uncertainty quantification of flood extent estimates addresses this risk. In this context, our study presents the results of two probabilistic convolutional neural networks (CNNs) adapted for SAR-based water segmentation with freely available Sentinel-1 interferometric wide (IW) swath ground range detected (GRD) data. In particular, the performance of a variational inference-based Bayesian convolutional neural network (BCNN) is evaluated against that of a Monte Carlo dropout network (MCDN). In previous studies where uncertainty information has been generated along with segmentation results, MCDN has been more commonly applied as an approximation of Bayesian deep learning. Differences between the two approaches are highlighted with the application of a set of extended performance metrics. Both segmentation and uncertainty outputs are evaluated at data-, model-, tile-and scene-levels. The methods are demonstrated on the binary segmentation of a reference water dataset. We show that while different probabilistic techniques return comparable segmentation accuracies, they are differentiated based on their performance in assigning reliable probabilities. In particular, MCDNs characterized by more restrictive architectures generally lead to over-confident prediction intervals, whereas BCNNs have greater flexibility to learn the mean and the spread of the parameter posterior. Furthermore, we demonstrate that examining the (inaccurate, certain) metric is a better indicator of reliable uncertainty quantification and the BCNN is recommended to quantify uncertainties asso-ciated with SAR-based segmentation outputs. This information is especially valuable where the cost of inaccurate detections (false-positive and false-negative) is high. These preliminary findings highlight how the manner in which probabilities are properly assigned and their inclusion are instrumental and complementary to the pro-duction of flood masks and should be considered as a standard in the natural hazards domain.', '[Hertel, Victor; Chow, Candace; Wieland, Marc; Martinis, Sandro] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, German Remote Sensing Data Ctr DFD, Munchener Str 20, D-82234 Wessling Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany.

Several algorithms have been developed to estimate clear-sky NSR in mountains, but none have estimated NSR in mountainous terrain under all-sky (i.e., both clear and cloudy) conditions. Moreover, surface heterogeneity is considerable in mountains, and coarse-spatial -resolution satellites may not provide sufficient details for fine-scale applications. In this study, to address these challenges, we developed a method for fine-spatial-resolution (i.e., from 20 m to 30 m resolution) all-sky NSR estimation in mountains directly from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 top-of-atmosphere (TOA) observations with mountainous radiative transfer scheme (herein denoted \'TOPO\'). For comparison, we also created the model neglecting topography (herein called \'FLAT\'). The validation of the TOPO model in complex terrain against Chengde ground-based pyrometers in China was good, with an R2 of 0.91 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 80.9 W/m2, which was an improvement of 46.1% (reduction of RMSE) against the FLAT model. Meanwhile, the consistency of NSR generated from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 using TOPO model was satisfactory. Time-series comparisons of NSR derived from TOPO and FLAT models showed that topographic effects were substantial both in clear sky (maximum deviation of 643.4 W/m2) and cloudy sky (270.2 W/m2) when NSR estimates from the two models were compared. The evaluation of the FLAT model with a dataset simulated from the mountainous radiative transfer (created for the TOPO model) showed that neglecting topographic effects over mountainous terrain could lead to RMSEs of 541.7 W/m2 (relative RMSE = 159.5%) and 201.4 W/m2 (relative RMSE = 217.1%) for NSR estimation under clear and cloudy skies, respectively. This study provides a straightforward method of deriving fine-spatial-resolution all-sky NSR with topographic consideration, which can be further extended to the global mapping of NSR over mountainous terrain.', '[Ma, Yichuan; He, Tao; Liu, Tong] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Hubei Key Lab Quantitat Remote Sensing Land & Atmo, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

Despite vast previous efforts to assess satellite SSM products based on in situ data, the performance of L-band SSM products remains still little known over the tropical areas including the rainforests. To close this knowledge gap, a comprehensive evaluation of five L-band SSM products from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellites, including SMOS-IC, SMAP SCA-V, DCA, and MTDCA, as well as the recently developed SMAP INRAEBORDEAUX (SMAP-IB) was conducted in tropical areas from 2015 to 2020. The investigation was implemented by using in situ observations, and expanded by the Triple Collocation Analysis (TCA) and double instrumental variable (IVd) methods. The results revealed that all the five L-band SSM products show a good capacity to estimate SSM in most moderately vegetated areas of the tropical areas while they exhibit some uncertainties in dense vegetation (e.g., rainforests). The SSM climatology of the five L-band products in rainforests agreed generally well with that of in situ measurements especially for SMOS-IC (R = 0.75), followed by SMAP-IB (R = 0.72). Notably, the newly developed SMAP-IB shows satisfactory performance in the tropics with the highest R of 0.73 and the smallest unbiased root mean square difference (ubRMSD) of 0.041 m(3)/m(3) from the study based on in situ SM data, and R of >0.81 from the combined TCA/IVd method in most vegetation conditions. SMAP-DCA SSM demonstrates comparable performance to SMAP-SCA-V (R = 0.66) from the in situ based analysis. This study is expected to deepen our understanding on the skill of L-band SSM products in tropical areas and further promote possible upgrades in algorithms and applications in these regions.', '[Ma, Hongliang; Chen, Nengcheng] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

Then, Aquarius V5 L2 observation data and hybrid coordinate ocean model SSS (HYCOM SSS) data are used to train the model, and the grid search and 10-fold cross-validation method is used to obtain optimal model parameters. After screening, a DNN model with three hidden layers and 30, 40, and 50 neurons in each layer is constructed. The performance of the proposed DNN model is then estimated and analyzed using independent testing data. We compared the SSS retrieval results with different types of salinity data sources. Compared to in-situ SSS, the retrieved SSS root mean squares error (RMSE) is 0.35 and the mean bias (MB) is 0.01. The RMSE and MB of retrieved SSS are reduced by 0.14 and 0.03 than those of the Aquarius Remote Sensing Systems (Aquarius RSS) SSS, and 0.31 and 0.03 than those of the Aquarius Combined Active-Passive (Aquarius CAP) SSS.

Unfortu-nately, the dEWH data consist of stripes or noise. Numerous de-noising approaches have been studied. However, the following issues exist, possible overly smoothed results, two-step (de-striping and Gaussian-based smoothing) procedures introducing additional uncertainty and error propagation, requiring multi-temporal datasets or prior knowledge, and possible computational inefficiency. Thus, after analyzing the spectrum of the dEWH data, a novel low-pass-filtering algorithm is proposed to remove the noise and resolve the issues. Furthermore, without the global in situ measurements, an alternative assessment method is studied based on the additive character-istics of the signal and noise in the GRACE data. The method consists of the residual analysis and root mean square (RMS) value of the de-noised signal. Then, the proposed algorithm was applied to de-noising the dEWH datasets between 2002 and 2015. De-noised results are satisfactory qualitatively and quantitatively. Compared with well-known two-step de-noising methods, data blurring does not occur after the proposed algorithm.

Spectral classification of satellite Rrs(lambda) data allows for the distinguishing and grouping of waters with characteristic bio-optical/biogeochemical features that may influence the produc-tivity of a given water body. This study reports new satellite water class products (Level-2 and Level-3) from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). We developed and implemented a hyperspectral scheme that accounts for the Rrs(lambda) spectral shapes and globally resolves oceanic, coastal, and inland waters into 23 water classes. We characterized the light absorption and scattering coefficients, chlorophyll-a concentration, diffuse attenuation coefficient, and suspended particulate matter for individual water classes. It is shown that the water classes are separable by their distinct bio-optical and biogeochemical properties. Furthermore, validation result suggests that the VIIRS water class products are accurate globally. Finally, we examined the spatial and temporal variability of the water classes in case studies for a demonstration of applications. The water class data in open oceans reveal that the subtropical ocean gyres have experienced dramatic expansion over the last decade. In addition, the water class data appear to be a valuable (and qualitative) indicator for water quality in coastal and inland waters with compelling evidence.

However, to date very few studies considered merging SMOS and SMAP for both SM and VOD retrievals simultaneously. This study presents the first global long-term and continuous SM and L-band VOD (L-VOD) dataset retrieved after merging the SMOS and SMAP brightness temperature (TB) observations, called the SMOS-SMAP-INRAE-BORDEAUX or SMOSMAP-IB product. We first developed a fitted SMOS TB dataset at a fixed incidence angle of 40 degrees, and next applied a monthly linear rescaling of SMAP TB to SMOS TB for each polarization to produce a merged SMOS/SMAP TB (theta = 40 degrees) dataset. The retrievals were then based on a mono-angular retrieval algorithm sharing a similar forward model with the SMOS-IC and the official SMOS retrieval algo-rithms. Results showed that the inter-calibration approach we used here could effectively remove the bias be-tween the SMAP TB and fitted SMOS TB, with bias values reduced to 0.01 K (-0.02 K) compared to 3.45 K (1.65 K) for V (H) polarization before inter-calibration. The SMOSMAP-IB SM and L-VOD retrievals based on this new inter-calibrated SMOS/SMAP TB led to metrics that were equally good or better than those of other products (i.e., ESA CCI, SMOS-IC and the official SMAP products). When considering only long duration products, SMOSMAP-IB SM retrievals exhibited (i) the highest overall median R value of 0.72 with in-situ data from ISMN (International Soil Moisture Network) during 2013-2018, followed by SMOS-IC (R = 0.68) and CCI (R = 0.67), and (ii) the same smallest ubRMSD values as CCI (ubRMSD = 0.057 m3/m3 vs 0.061 m3/m3 for SMOS-IC). L-VOD retrievals from SMOSMAP-IB were found to have comparable spatial and temporal skills to SMOS-IC. Spatially, they both correlated well with aboveground biomass (R = 0.87), and temporally, they both showed a good representation of the short vegetation NDVI signal and of the forest area loss in the Brazilian Amazon from 2011 to 2019. Developing SMOSMAP-IB is a step forward towards building a time-continuous L-band SM and VOD products in response to the possible failure of one of the SMOS or SMAP sensors in the future.', '[Li, Xiaojun; Wigneron, Jean-Pierre; Frappart, Frederic; Liu, Xiangzhuo; Wang, Huan; Moisy, Christophe] Univ Bordeaux, INRAE, UMR 1391 ISPA, F-33140 Villenave Dornon, France.

In order to characterize the seasonal variation in relatively pure or homogenous vegetation types, fine spatial resolution satellite data (<= 30 m), such as Landsat, Sentinel-2, PlanetScope, or Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS), have been increasingly applied to detect land surface phenology (LSP). However, the most critical challenge in LSP detections is the gaps in temporal satellite observations caused by noise and persistent cloud/snow cover. Therefore, this study presented a novel algorithm for generating synthetic gap-free time series at the field scale (30 m) for LSP detections. Specifically, we first developed a framework to establish a large collection of temporal shapes of vegetation growth with as many as 100 grid-based Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) time series in a single PhenoCam site. For a given HLS pixel, the two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) time series was matched and fused with the most comparable temporal GCC shape selected from the collection of PhenoCam GCC time series to generate a synthetic gap-free HLS-PhenoCam EVI2 time series, which was used to detect the 30 m phenometrics. The detected phenometrics were evaluated using manually selected and spatially matched GCC observations as well as phenology detections from HLS alone. The result indicates that the HLS-PhenoCam phenometrics are very close to the observations from PhenoCam network with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.82-0.97, a mean absolute difference (MAD) of 2.8-3.5 days, a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.5-4.0 days, and a mean systematic bias (MSB) of 0.1-2.2 days. The HLS-PhenoCam detections are significantly improved relative to the HLS phenometrics that have a statistic accuracy of R = 0.57-0.78, MAD = 6.4-9.3 days, RMSE = 8.8-13.9 days, MSB =-5.2-5.9 days. The difference between HLS-PhenoCam and HLS alone LSP detections over a HLS tile could be on average larger than two weeks if high-quality observation (HQO) proportion in the annual HLS time series is <10%, which exponentially reduces with the increase of HQO in HLS observations. The an-alyses in this study suggest that the gap-free HLS-PhenoCam time series is able to be generated for producing high-quality phenology datasets across a local and regional scale, to bridge near-surface PhenoCam observations with satellite observations data at various scales, and to be used as a scalable phenology dataset for the validation of global MODIS and VIIRS LSP products.', '[Tran, Khuong H.; Zhang, Xiaoyang; Ketchpaw, Alexander R.; Wang, Jianmin; Ye, Yongchang; Shen, Yu] South Dakota State Univ, Geospatial Sci Ctr Excellence, Dept Geog & Geospatial Sci, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.', 'South Dakota State UniversityRP Zhang, XY (通讯作者)，South Dakota State Univ, Geospatial Sci Ctr Excellence, Dept Geog & Geospatial Sci, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.', 'xiaoyang.zhang@sdstate.eduRI Tran, Khuong/GZG-6396-2022; Shen, Yu/ITV-0173-2023', 'Tran, Khuong/0000-0001-9738-6832; Shen, Yu/0000-0001-7987-8139', 'NASA [80NSSC18K0626, 80NSSC21K1962]; Northeastern States Research   Cooperative; NSF\'s Macrosystems Biology program [EF-1065029,   EF-1702697]; DOE\'s Regional and Global Climate Modeling program   [DESC0016011]; US National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring   Program; USA National Phenology Network from the United States   Geological Survey [G10AP00129]; USA National Phenology Network and North   Central Climate Science Center from the United States Geological Survey   [G16AC00224]; National Science Foundation [DEB-1237491, DEB-1114804]', 'This work was supported by NASA grants 80NSSC18K0626 and 80NSSC21K1962.

Altered fire regimes resulting from changes in land use and climate may jeopardize their resilience to fire and induce changes in forest composition. Disentangling forest cover composition is therefore critical for understanding post-fire forest recovery dynamics. In this study, we demonstrate how fractional time series of different woody-vegetation types support the analysis of post-fire vegetation recovery in relation to the pre-fire situation for two burned areas in Mediterranean pine forests in Spain. We separately estimated tree, shrub and background (combining herbaceous, soil and rock) cover fractions on an annual basis (1990-2020) using Landsat Spectral-Temporal Metrics (STMs) and a regression-based unmixing approach. Our regression models effectively estimated fractions of the three cover types with Mean Absolute Errors ranging from 8.6% to 13.4% when comparing to a reference dataset derived from high-resolution orthophotos across 6 different years. Slightly overestimations of low cover fractions where found in tree and shrub cover fractions across the study sites. Despite these minor errors, time series of cover fractions revealed characteristic spatio-temporal patterns of different woody-vegetation types for burned and unburned areas. Based on the fractional cover estimates, we derived a Normalized Difference Tree-Shrub Fraction index (NDTSF) to contrast tree cover fraction relative to the shrub cover and map post-fire shifts in composition. Annual maps of NDTSF revealed a high spatial and temporal variability and a general dynamic towards the pre-fire cover composition in 79-80% of burned areas but a shift from tree to shrub dominance in 12.3-15.4% 26 years after fire. Our regression-based unmixing approach advances the analysis of post-fire recovery dynamics, unravelling shifts in forest composition that are of major concern to forest management.', '[Viana-Soto, Alba; Garcia, Mariano; Aguado, Inmaculada] Univ Alcala, Dept Geol Geog & Environm, Environm Remote Sensing Res Grp, Colegios 2, Alcala De Henares 28801, Spain.

This study presents an operationally applicable scheme for SMC retrieval over meadows from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter (sigma(0)) observations. We parameterized the vegetation scattering and absorption model developed at the Tor Vergata University of Rome (TV) and the integral equation method (IEM) surface scattering model for grass-covered soil surfaces. Leaf area index (LAI) estimates from a Sentinel-2 product provide field-scale vegetation information, as is demonstrated by validation against in situ measurements. The SMC retrieval scheme is applied with field-averaged Sentinel-1 sigma(0) observations from November 2015 to November 2018 and evaluated on 21 meadows against adjacent in situ station measurements, without (IEM) and with a vegetation correction (TV-IEM). Masking the IEM and TV-IEM SMC retrievals for dense vegetation conditions improves their performance, but this is a trade-off with the number of retrievals. By setting the SMC retrievals that exceed the upper retrieval limit of 0.75 m(3) m(-3) during the wet period to the maximum SMC, the performance metrics improve to mean Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.55 for IEM and 0.64 for TV-IEM, root mean square deviations (RMSD) of 0.14 m(3) m(-3) for IEM and 0.13 m(3) m(-3) for TV-IEM, and RMSDs relative to the range of the SMC references of 24 % for both IEM and TV-IEM. The slightly better SMC retrieval performance with TV-IEM is caused by invalid SMC retrievals under dense vegetation conditions, and the performance metrics for IEM and TV-IEM are practically equal by considering the same retrieval-reference pairs. The IEM and TV-IEM retrieval performances are also similar to the performances of two other Sentinel-1 based products at field scale. They are, on average, outperformed by NASA\'s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) 9 km and 36 km products evaluated at field scale, but these products are expected to deviate if larger regional differences are present and in field-specific situations.', '[Benninga, Harm-Jan F.; Van Der Velde, Rogier; Su, Zhongbo] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, Dept Water Resources, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.

However, most of the current remote sensing methods retrieve only F at top-of-canopy level, therefore making the link with physiological processes occurring at photosystem level not trivial. In this study, we develop a novel machine learning Fourier (phasor)-based algo-rithm to retrieve F both at canopy level and after considering the reabsorption (i.e. photosystem level), consistently with relevant biophysical variables, exploiting the canopy apparent reflectance spectra (Rapp). In particular, Rapp is divided in consecutive spectral windows, where the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is computed. Then, the DFT results in each window are exploited to estimate the fluorescence spectra and bio-physical parameters, together with their uncertainties, by means of a supervised machine learning algorithm coupled to a statistical-based retrieval pipeline. The algorithm has been trained through synthetic Rapp spectra, obtained from simulations based on a Radiative Transfer (RT) model. As a proof of concept, the theoretical approach is then applied to experimental data, acquired both from crops and forests, at close and high soil-sensor distance respectively, to evaluate the retrieval accuracy of biophysical and F parameters. In particular, for the first time Rapp is used to extract the temporal evolution of F at canopy and photosystem levels and its quantum efficiency together with different biophysical variables, during the growing season of two agricultural crops. Furthermore, tower-based solar-induced fluorescence measurements in a deciduous forest are exploited to evaluate the performance of our algorithm when the atmospheric reabsorption and scattering are not negligible. The reliability of the proposed method is evaluated through a comparison with F spectra extracted from the state of the art SpecFit retrieval algorithm. This work promises a substantial advance toward a new accurate retrieval method for fluorescence signals and biophysical parameters at canopy and photosystem levels.', '[Scodellaro, R.; D\' Alfonsa, L.; Bouzin, M.; Collini, M.; Chirico, G.; Sironi, L.] Univ Milano Bicocca, Phys Dept GOcchialini, Lab Adv Biospect, Piazza Sci 3, I-20126 Milan, Italy.

We calibrated an established index by comparing snow algal field spectroradiometer measurements with direct counts of algal cell abundance in British Columbia, Canada. We applied the field calibrated index to Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and MODIS/Terra images to monitor snow algae on the Vowell and Catamount Glaciers (Purcells, British Columbia) in summer 2020. The maximum extent of snow algal bloom cover was 1.4 and 2.0 km2 respectively, about one third of the total surface area of the two glaciers, making these among the largest contiguous bloom areas yet reported. Blooms were first detected following the onset of above-freezing temperatures in early July and persisted for about two months. Algal abundance increased through July, after which the red snow algal bloom area decreased due to snow cover loss. At their peak in late July the blooms reduced albedo by 0.04 +/- 0.01 on average. Snow algae caused an additional 5.25 & PLUSMN; 1.0 x 10(7) J/m2 of solar energy to be absorbed by the snowpack in July-August, which is enough energy to melt 31.5 cm of snow. This is equivalent to an average snow algal radiative forcing of 8.25 +/- 1.6 W/m2 through July and August.

However, the evolution of the mass change of lake-terminating glaciers is still unclear, and accurate penetration depth estimates of C-band and X-band radar in glacierized areas are unknown, which greatly hinders the monitoring and understanding of the glacier evolution. Hence, in this study, taking the largest lake-terminating glacier in HMA (the Yanong Glacier) as the study object, we first evaluated the X-band penetration depth using Ple \' iades and TanDEM-X data, and further combined the penetration depth difference between the C-band and X-band radar (1.14 +/- 0.14 m) to estimate the C-band penetration depth based on a newly proposed area-weighted strategy, according to surface categories. The results indicate a region-wide average penetration depth of 1.84 +/- 0.59 m and 2.98 +/- 0.61 m for the X-band and C-band radar, respectively, demonstrating either an underestimation of 60% or an overestimation of 202% for the previous C-band penetration corrections. On this basis, we determined the multi-temporal glacier mass balance for the Yanong Glacier, using KH-9, SRTM DEM, SPOT-7, and multi-orbit TanDEM-X data. The results show that the Yanong Glacier has been in a state of serious mass loss (at a rate of -0.73 +/- 0.13 m w.e./a) during 1974-2015, and the rate of mass loss has doubled since 2000 (i.e., -0.48 +/- 0.20 (1974-2000), -0.95 +/- 0.20 (2000-2012), and - 1.02 +/- 0.53 m w.e./a (2012-2015)). Moreover, the interannual mass change has shown a highly volatile and accelerating trend during 2012-2015 (i.e., -0.47 +/- 0.85 (2011-2012), -0.87 +/- 0.66 (2012-2013), -1.26 +/- 0.72 (2013-2014), and - 1.58 +/- 0.44 m w.e./a (2014-2015)). By further analyzing the ERA5 reanalysis data and the changes in the proglacial lake and glacier dynamics, we can conclude that, qualitatively: 1) the long-term acceleration of mass loss at the Yanong Glacier has mainly been controlled by climate change, but has also been affected by the glacier dynamics to a limited extent; and 2) the inter-annual acceleration of mass loss has, to some extent, been affected by subglacial/englacial melting.

The Snow CCI+ SWE Version 1 (CCIv1) product is built on the GlobSnow algorithm, which combines passive microwave (PMW) data with in situ snow depth (SD) measurements to estimate SWE. While CCIv1 remains algorithmically similar to the most recent GlobSnow product (GlobSnow Version 3), Snow CCI+ SWE Version 2 (CCIv2) incorporates two notable differences. CCIv2 uses updated PMW data from the NASA MEaSUREs Calibrated Passive Microwave Daily EASE-Grid 2.0 Earth Science Data Record and is generated in EASE-Grid 2.0 with 12.5 km grid spacing. It also adjusts SWE retrievals in post-processing by incorporating spatially and temporally varying snow density information. Due to the phased product development framework CCI+ employs, proposed changes between CCIv1 and CCIv2 were implemented in a series of step-wise developmental datasets. Using these developmental datasets, we analyze how changes to input PMW and SD data and the snow density parameterization affect the resulting SWE product. Using in situ snow courses as reference data, we demonstrate that the correlation and RMSE of the CCIv2 developmental product improved 18% (0.10) and 12% (5 mm), respectively, relative to CCIv1.

In this study, we explored structure-function relationships across a variety of degradation levels in the southern Brazilian Amazon by 1) investigating how forest structural properties vary as a function of degradation history using airborne lidar data; 2) assessing the effects of degradation on solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) seasonality using TROPOMI data; and 3) quantifying the contribution of structural variables to SIF using multiple regression models with stepwise se-lection of lidar metrics. Forest degradation history was obtained through Landsat time-series classification. We found that fire, logging, and time since disturbance were major determinants of forest structure, and that forests affected by fires experienced larger variability in leaf area index (LAI), canopy height and vertical structure relative to logged and intact forests. Moreover, only recently burned forests showed significantly depressed SIF during the dry season compared to intact forests. Canopy height and the vertical distribution of foliage were the best predictors of SIF. Unexpectedly, we found that wet-season SIF was higher in active regenerating forests (~ 4 years after fires or logging) compared with intact forests, despite lower LAI. Our findings help to elucidate the mechanisms of carbon accumulation in anthropogenically disturbed tropical forests and indicate that they can capture large amounts of carbon while recovering.', '[Pinage, Ekena Rangel; Huete, Alfredo] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Life Sci, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.

To achieve global estimations, traditional ML models need sufficient ground measurements covering various atmospheric and surface conditions globally, which is difficult to accomplish. Training on the simulated data of a radiative transfer model (RTM) is a possible solution, but widely used RTMs ignore some complex cloud conditions which brings bias to simulations. In this study, a neural network applied with the transfer-learning (TL) concept is introduced to utilize both radiative transfer simulations and ground measurement data, achieving global DSR estimation with only top-of-atmosphere and surface albedo at local solar noon as inputs. The proposed method estimates both instantaneous and daily DSR from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data at 750-m resolution, and both the estimates are validated by 40 independent stations globally. The root mean-square error and relative root mean square error of instantaneous DSR validation over 25 Baseline Surface Radiation Network, seven Surface Radiation Network, and eight Greenland Climate Network stations in 2013 were 91.2 (16.1%), 106.3 (18.3%), 75.0 (24.2%) W/m2, respectively, and the daily validation achieved 30.8 (15.5%), 33.5 (17.6%), and 31.3 (14.4) W/m2, respectively. The proposed method presents significant high accuracy over polar regions and similar performances over other areas compared with traditional ML models, physics models (e.g., look-up tables and direct estimations), and existing DSR products. The algorithm is also applied to VIIRS swath data to test its global efficacy. Instantaneous mapping captures the spatial pattern of the cloud-mask product, and daily mapping shows spatial patterns similar to the Clouds and the Earth\'s Radiant Energy System Synoptic TOA and surface fluxes and clouds product, but with more detail. Further analysis indicates that model performance is less sensitive to the quantity of training data after TL has been incorporated. This study demonstrates the advantages of TL on boosting both the generality and accuracy of DSR estimation, which can potentially be applied to other variable retrievals.', '[Wang, Dongdong; Li, Ruohan; Liang, Shunlin; Jia, Aolin; Wang, Zhihao] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

Variations in surface albedo can be used as a diagnostic tool for local climate change. This is particularly true in urban areas, where the impacts of land cover conversion due to increasing anthropogenic demands can be examined using surface albedo changes. Most of the previous studies of albedo in cities have relied on coarse-resolution datasets with short time spans and have disregarded continuous monitoring. In addition, it is still unclear which urbanization processes are involved and what effects they have on surface albedo over long time periods. This study aimed to identify the contribution of increasing urbanization to the regional climate by analyzing spatial and temporal changes in surface albedo. Assigning albedo values to land cover types is useful for determining the level of transformation and their impacts in various Chinese cities that underwent specific evolutions between 1986 and 2018. The Direct Estimation (DE) approach was modified to estimate the daily mean surface albedo at 30 m based on Landsat observations. It resulted root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of less than 0.044 and bias about 0.006 between observations and model estimations. Such accuracy obtained after correcting the orbital drift of the Landsat satellite, was deemed satisfactory for detecting potential changes in albedo. Major findings are: 1) A notable trend was found over the past 33 years of 11 major Chinese cities, i.e. population about 10 million and more, with a general albedo increase from satellite observations. The higher resolution Landsat dataset showed a trend 3 times larger than the Global Land Surface Satellites (GLASS) product, which outlines the need for analyzing high resolution imagery in priority for reliable estimate of albedo over heterogeneous urban landscapes. 2) An increase in albedo infers a negative radiative forcing at an average rate of -2.771 W/m2 per decade, thereby indicating a cooling effect for most Chinese cities. 3) Changes in surface albedo were also closely linked to landscape transformation, clearly observed using the 30 m resolution of the Landsat data. 4) Throughout the study period, surface albedo exhibited a temporal U-shaped curve in built-up areas under development, with albedo peaks in old and newly built districts and a decrease in albedo between the two eras.', '[Guo, Tianci; He, Tao; Huang, Xin] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.

Consequently, much research has focused in the past on negative consequences of groundwater abstraction, but somewhat less has been documented about the impacts of adequate management practices to address water shortages. Here, using an integrated analysis of InSAR displacement data, groundwater, and geophysical modeling we show how combined management provisions and inter-basin water transfer project has affected the aquifer system in Taiyuan basin in North China. Following groundwater recovery, the alleviation of land subsidence was found with rates being reduced by up to similar to 70% in the period 2017-2020 with respect to the period 2007-2010. The increase in pore pressure caused by rising groundwater in Taiyuan city, north of the basin, turned four subsidence centers with rates exceeding 110 mm/yr in the 1980 to uplift centers with rates up to +25 mm/yr between 2017 and 2020. A simple linear elastic model for homogenous subsurface properties can explain InSAR-measured surface displacements well. In the central basin, we found a significant seasonal displacement with annual amplitude up to 43 mm (negative peak in autumn and positive peak in spring) related to the groundwater recharge and discharge due to agricultural pumping irrigation. Using cross-wavelet method, we showed a relatively short time lags (less than one month) between surface deformation and water level changes in the central basin, indicating the low-permeability clayey units have a limited influence in delaying the compaction of aquifer system. Quantifying the effects of adequate groundwater management measures and large-scale engineering approaches like inter-basin water transfer to recharge pumped aquifers provide insight for local governments and decision-makers to properly evaluate the impacts of their policy in recovering the sustainability and efficiency of aquifers in water-deficient basins.', '[Tang, Wei; Zhao, Xiangjun; Li, Jing; Chen, Mingjie] China Univ Min & Technol, Coll Geosci & Surveying Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.

Understanding its phenological responses to climate change is vital, particularly in Arctic regions that are experiencing warming faster than the global average. Ocean color remote sensing is a powerful tool that provides the global distribution and spatial extent of coccolithophore blooms. However, remotely observing coccolithophore blooms in Arctic regions is challenged by severe conditions, such as heavy cloud cover. In this work, an ocean color index (CI)-based approach is developed to detect coccolithophore blooms in the Arctic Sea by using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. The optical properties of clouds and coccolithophore blooms are characterized by employing the band difference of Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (rho R) at 412 and 469 nm (CI412-469) and 555 and 645 nm (CI555-645), respectively. A hybrid threshold is further determined to classify coccolithophore bloom and nonbloom waters. Results show that the algorithm can reduce the negative effects of heavy clouds and persistent fog on detecting coccolithophore blooms and increase the coverage of satellite observation. Compared with the traditional particulate inorganic carbon concentrationbased approach, the algorithm yields more coverage and frequency of coccolithophore blooms. Global evaluation reveals that the CI-based algorithm has great potential applications in global oceans and different ocean color sensors.', '[He, Shuo; Le, Chengfeng] Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

Daytime fire radiative power (FRP) detected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was nearly evenly split (54% vs. 46%) between inside and outside wildfires from 2003 to 2020. In contrast, 94% of nighttime FRP was detected within wildfires, of which 95% was detected within large wildfires (> 2023 ha). Nighttime proportions (i.e., the proportion of total summed FRP detected by MODIS at night) were lowest (3%) outside wildfires when coincident 1000-hr fuel moistures were highest and vegetation fires were smaller and less intense. As 1000-hr fuel moistures decreased, MODIS active fire pixels shifted out of agricultural and prescribed fires and into wildfires with higher nighttime per-pixel values of FRP such that nighttime proportions peaked at 29% for the largest wildfires. Increases in nighttime proportions within larger wildfires were attributed to increases in nighttime persistence whereby under the driest conditions, daytime fire activity detected by MODIS was more likely to continue burning with sufficient vigour to be detected again at night. From 2003-2020, MODIS detected significant (p < 0.01) increasing trends in nighttime wildfire fire activity, with a +54%, +42% and +21% increase in the annual nighttime sum of FRP, annual nighttime active fire pixel counts and annual mean nighttime per-pixel values of FRP, respectively, detected in the latter half of the study period. Nighttime trends were corroborated using observations from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) as well annual wildfire statistics reported by U.S. federal, state and local agencies. Moreover, MODIS detected a significant positive trend in the nighttime proportion of FRP emitted from wildfires, indicating that in the absence of diurnal differences in detection biases, increases in nighttime fire activity since 2003 have outpaced daytime increases. However an analysis of MODIS omission rates revealed that increasing nighttime proportions were at least partially attributed to a relatively greater improvement in nighttime detection performance compared to the daytime for larger wildfires burning during drier conditions. Nighttime fire activity already poses additional risks to firefighters and communities, and this work suggests that projected increases in the frequency of large wildfires will be accompanied by increases in the extent and intensity of nighttime fire activity.', '[Freeborn, Patrick H.; Jolly, W.

Existence of leaf surface reflectance and anisotropic property could be the main issues that constrain the applicability of the PROSPECT inversion to assess leaf biochemical traits from leaf BRF spectra. This study presents an inversion method by integrating the PROSPECT model with spectral derivatives and similarity metrics (SDM), called PROSDM, to remove the difference between leaf BRF and DHRF spectra and retrieve leaf biochemical traits from leaf BRF spectra. Leaf BRF spectra and the corresponding contents of chlorophyll (Cab), carotenoid (Cxc), water (Cw), and dry matter (Cm) were obtained from ten datasets across a wide variety of plant species with varied growth stages, nutrition status, and planting regions. The datasets showed that the significant difference existed between leaf BRF and DHRF spectra, which varied with spectral wavelengths and plant species, and affected the accuracies of retrieving Cab, Cxc, Cw, and Cm. To eliminate the difference between leaf BRF and DHRF spectra independent on wavelengths, spectral derivatives were applied. When the difference between BRF and DHRF spectra varied with wavelengths, spectral derivatives only removed part of the difference, and implementation of the Manhattan distance compensated the limitation of the spectral derivatives to further reduce the difference. As a result, the PROSDM outperformed the PROSPECT and PROCOSINE inversions as well as PROCWT to retrieve Cab, Cxc, Cw, and Cm from leaf BRF spectra with the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 7.64 mu g/cm2 , 2.77 mu g/cm2 , 0.0041 g/cm2 , and 0.0024 g/cm2 , respectively. Significant improvements in the retrievals of Cab, Cxc, Cw, and Cm were obtained with the RMSEs reduced by 20.33%, 29.34%, 25.45%, and 44.19% compared to the PROSPECT inversion, respectively. It was further found that the model inversions were affected by the spectral saturation, PROSPECT versions, spectral subdomains, and the range of model parameters. The retrieval results by different inversion methods may be improved with the suitable spectral subdomains and range of model parameters. Importantly, the proposed PROSDM showed the great potential to alleviate these negative effects on the retrievals of Cab, Cxc, Cw, and Cm. The performance assessment of PROSDM demonstrates a promising potential for its applications in remote sensing aiming at retrievals of leaf biochemical traits from leaf BRF spectra', '[Wan, Liang; Zhang, Jiafei; He, Yong; Cen, Haiyan] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Biosyst Engn & Food Sci, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China.

Radiative transfer (RT) models have the potential to provide a better understanding of the canopy structural effects on the SIF emission and RS signals. Here, we used the DART model to assess the daily influence, from morning to evening, of forest 3D architecture on SIF nadir radiance, emission, escape factor and nadir yield of eight 100 m x 100 m forest study plots established in a temperate deciduous forest of the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (Edgewater, MD, USA). The 3D architecture of each plot was derived from airborne LiDAR. DART simulations of these 3D forest plots and their 1D (i.e., vertical profile of sun-adapted and shade-adapted leaves) and 0D (i.e., homogeneous layer of sun-adapted leaves above an homogeneous layer of shade-adapted leaves) abstractions were compared to assess the relative errors (epsilon(1D-3D) and epsilon(0D-3D)) associated with horizontal and vertical structural heterogeneity, respectively. Forest 3D structure, especially horizontal heterogeneity, had a great influence on forest nadir SIF radiance, resulting in epsilon(1D-3D) up to 55% at 8:00 and 18:00 (i.e., for oblique sun directions). The key indicators of this impact, in the descending order of importance, were the SIF escape factor (epsilon(1D-3D) up to 40%), the attenuation of incident photosynthetically active radiation (epsilon(1D-3D) less than 5%), and the SIF emission yield (epsilon(1D-3D) less than 2%). The influence of forest architecture on the nadir SIF escape factor and SIF yield (epsilon(1D-3D) up to 40%) varied over time, with differences in forest stand structure, and per spectral domain, being always larger between 640 and 700 nm than between 700 and 850 nm. In addition, woody elements demonstrated a large influence on forest SIF radiance due to their \"shading\" effect (epsilon up to 17%) and their \"blocking\" effect (epsilon approximate to 10%), both of them higher for far-red than for red SIF. These results underline the importance of 3D forest canopy architecture, especially 2D heterogeneity, and inclusion of woody elements in RT modeling used for interpretation of the RS SIF signal, and subsequently for the estimation of gross primary production and detection of vegetation stress.', '[Regaieg, Omar; Gastellu-Etchegorry, Jean-Philippe] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, IRD, CNES,Ctr Etud Spatiales Biosphere UT3, F-31401 Toulouse 9, France.

The study was conducted for a boreal forest area (approx. 1.4 Mha) in Norway where bi-temporal national forest inventory (NFI), Sentinel-2, and Landsat data were available. Biomass change was modelled based on a direct approach. The precision of estimates using only the NFI data in a basic expansion estimator was compared to four different alternative model-assisted estimates using 1) Sentinel-2 or Landsat data, and 2) using bi- or uni-temporal remotely sensed data. We found that spaceborne optical data improved the precision of the purely field-based estimates by a factor of up to three. The most precise estimates were found for the model-assisted estimation using bi-temporal Sentinel-2 (standard error; SE = 1.7 Gg). However, the decrease in precision when using Landsat data was small (SE = 1.92 Gg). We also found that Delta AGB could be precisely estimated when remotely sensed data were available only at the end of the monitoring period. We conclude that satellite optical data can considerably improve Delta AGB estimates, when repeated and coincident field data are available.

To evaluate the current potential of space-based quantification techniques, we present the first attempt to monitor long-term changes in CO(2ff )emissions based on the OCO-2 satellite measurements of column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CO2 (X-CO2) over a fast-growing Asian metropolitan area: Lahore, Pakistan. We first examined the OCO-2 data availability at global scale. About 17% of OCO-2soundings over the global 70 most populated cities from 2014 to 2019 are marked as high-quality. Cloud blockage and aerosol contamination are the two main causes of data loss. As an attempt to recover additional soundings, we evaluated the effectiveness of OCO-2 quality flags at the city level by comparing three flux quantification methods (WRF-Chem, X-STILT, and the flux cross-sectional integration method). The satellite/bottom-up emissions (OCO-2/ODIAC) ratios of the high-quality tracks with reduced uncertainties in emissions are better agreed across the three methods compared to the all-data tracks. This demonstrates that OCO-2 quality flags are useful filters of low-quality OCO-2 retrievals at local scales. All three methods consistently suggested that the ratio medians are greater than 1, implying that the ODIAC slightly underestimated CO2ff emissions over Lahore. Additionally, our estimation of the a posteriori CO2ff emission trend was about 734 kt C/year (i.e., an annual 6.7% increase). 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations of the Mann-Kendall upward trend test showed that less than 10% prior uncertainty for 8 tracks (or less than 20% prior uncertainty for 25 tracks) is required to achieve a greater-than-50% trend significant possibility at a 95% confidence level. It implies that the trend is driven by the prior and not due to the assimilation of OCO-2 retrievals. The key to improving the role of satellite data in CO2 emission trend detection lies in collecting more frequent high-quality tracks near metropolitan areas to achieve significant constraints from X-CO2 retrievals.', '[Lei, Ruixue; Feng, Sha; Lauvaux, Thomas] Penn State Univ, Dept Meteorol & Atmospher Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.

The NASA contribution to the campaign was conducted in 2016 with the NASA LVIS (Land Vegetation and Ice Sensor) Lidar, the NASA L-band UAVSAR (Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar). A central motivation for the AfriSAR deployment was the common AGBD estimation requirement for the three future spaceborne missions, the lack of sufficient airborne and ground calibration data covering the full range of ABGD in tropical forest systems, and the intercomparison and fusion of the technologies. During the campaign, over 7000 km2 of waveform Lidar data from LVIS and 30,000 km2 of UAVSAR data were collected over 10 key sites and transects. In addition, field measurements of forest structure and biomass were collected in sixteen 1-hectare sized plots.

Many indices and models have been proposed to illustrate the reflectance features changing with SMC, and to estimate SMC from the reflectance of narrow bands and broadbands, using lab, field, airborne and satellite data. These methods/indices were mostly developed for all levels of SMCs, from saturated to air-dry; however, we found that a single relationship mapping saturated to air-dry can lead to a false impression of accurate estimation. The inconsistency of a regression relationship between spectral reflectance features and SMCs over the whole drying process results in a low estimation accuracy for relatively low SMCs. In this study, a segmentation method is proposed with the goal of a more accurate SMC estimate. The whole drying process of three soil samples, representing varied soil characteristics, is monitored, and the transition points are determined by evaporation rate change (as stage-1 drying with high SMC and stage-2 drying with low SMC). An index, the shortwave normalized index (SNI), is built for SMC estimation, and the SNI index trend during drying is supported by a radiative transfer-based model. As validated, the SNI index is capable of SMC estimates, and the segmentation method improves estimation accuracy astonishingly compared with current methods.', '[Tian, Jia; Yue, Jibo; Dong, Xinyu; Tian, Qingjiu] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.

In reality, such error is often non-stationary, which may undermine applications based on a stationary assumption. Here, we introduce a dual time-space (2D) SM merging approach that considers a class of inferred error that is non-stationary and undetectable in time (or space) but stationary and detectable in space (or time). Such 2D merging is realized in a least-squares framework where spatial and temporal error variances for each product are estimated via a triple collocation (TC) analysis. As a test case, a 2D-merged SM product is obtained by combining three independent SM products - including two RS SM products and one modeled SM product. Results show that the 2D merging method can effectively handle non-stationary errors and, as a result, produces a superior merged SM product than classical 1D merging methods. The spatial and temporal correlations with in-situ observations are 0.62 and 0.63 [-1 on average for 2D merging methods, and 0.58 and 0.59 [-1 on average for classical 1D merging methods.

These images were then gap-filled to capture upwelling in the Mid Atlantic Bight (MAB), a critical process that impacts ecosystems and atmospheric processes in the region and is important to coastal regions around the world. During the 2019 upwelling season, the default Quality Filter (QF) provided to identify and remove clouds from GOES SST consistently removed upwelling pixels, resulting in similar to 15% MAB coastal SST coverage. The Spike Filter (SF) method increased MAB coastal SST coverage to 30% and maintained overall accuracy. GOES SF DINEOF SST approximately doubled the number of detected upwelling days compared to MUR SST. The longest upwelling event detected in GOES SF DINEOF persisted for over 17 days, which is longer than upwelling events previously observed in the MAB (Glenn et al., 2004).This suggests that the MAB can have persistent, rather than episodic upwelling as previously thought. Clear detection of the timing and duration of upwelling events is important as it provides estimates for ecological and physical responses in the MAB and coastal regions around the world.

Using geodetic benchmarks as reference elevation on those areas covered by LiDAR (A(LiDAR)=370,200 km(2), n(bench)=24,175), it was found that LiDAR has the best vertical accuracy of all DSMs considered (MAE(LiDAR) = 1.96), which is why it was used as reference elevation to develop seven DEMs of Difference (DoDs) with the remainder DSMs. Using n(cells) = 350 x 10(6) for the aforementioned comparisons, it was found that the vertical accuracy of AW3D30 V2 and V3 is similar (MAE=2.5 m), followed by NASADEM, SRTM, CEM, ASTER GDEM3 and ASTER GDEM 2, with MAE values of 3.1, 3.8, 4.6, 6.0 and 7.2 m respectively. The previously mentioned values vary according to slope and slope orientation (i.e. aspect): for flat areas (slope <= 5 degrees), the NASADEM exhibits the lowest MAE (with MAE values of 1.6 for slope <= 1 degrees and MAE = 2.0 m when 1 degrees<slope <= 5 degrees), whereas MAE(AW3D30V3)=1.9 and 2.2 m for the previously mentioned slopes. With the use of radial boxplots developed on slope groups of 5 degrees, it was found that both MAE and bias are increasingly affected by aspect as slope increases on all the DSMs. In the case of both AW3D30 DSMs, on flat terrain a difference of only 0.1 m in bias (i.e. median of differences with respect to LiDAR) is found between SE and NW slopes; however, this difference increases according to slope: 0.6 m for 5 degrees<slope <= 10 degrees, 1.2 m for 10 degrees<slope <= 15 degrees, and 1.9 m for 15 degrees<slope <= 20 degrees. Through the analyses undertaken, it is shown that slope-and not vegetation cover-is the factor that has the largest impact on the error of DSMs, and that the effect of aspect on error increases as terrain steepens. This work shows that all DSMs present errors and that an adequate accuracy assessment of DSMs needs to consider the spatial distribution of GCPs, Difference of DSMs (DoDs) and derivatives of DSMs (i.e., slope and aspect) as the use of DoDs provide information on DSM errors (i.e. interpolation artefacts) that can not be assessed through the use of geodetic benchmarks and because DSM errors depend on both slope and aspect.', '[Carrera-Hernandez, J.

MISR AOD showed good agreement against AERONET AOD with 68.68% of the retrievals falling within the expected error and high Pearson?s correlation coefficient (R = 0.83). The 20 years geometric mean of MAIAC and MISR AOD revealed higher loading of aerosols over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and Eastern coast of India by 30% to 44% compared to the mean AOD over the entire SA. The highest mean AOD under cloud-free conditions was noted during monsoon season, followed by pre-monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter. The high contribution of coarsemode AOD (cAOD) mainly from natural aerosol emission and small-mode AOD (sAOD) from local anthropogenic emissions are the main driver to high AOD in monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons. Besides, the presence of high humidity during the monsoon season favors the hygroscopic growth of the particles and leads to higher AOD values over SA. The high spatial resolutions of MODIS/MAIAC and MISR aerosol products enabled the identification of previously unobserved aerosol hotspots over Bihar, West Bengal, and the eastern Indian coastal state of Odisha, which is mainly dominated by small aerosol particles. The contributions of smaller aerosol particles to the total aerosol loading were found to be higher during post-monsoon and winter over most states in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. In contrast, the contribution of coarser particles was higher over Pakistan during premonsoon and monsoon seasons. Smaller particles were predominantly retrieved over the Indian states dominated by mining industries, including Jharkhand and Odisha. A typical dominance of absorbing carbonaceous aerosols was also noted over the northwestern region of IGP during post-monsoon, which otherwise was mainly affected by mixed dust aerosols and carbonaceous aerosols in pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. A statistically significant positive temporal trend in AOD was observed for the whole study period, over most of the SA region, which was influenced by the increase in small particles over India and Bangladesh. Urban/industrial weakly absorbing aerosols were found to be the main contributor to a similarly positive trend over Central India and East coast Indian states. Overall, recent advancements in high spatial resolution satellite-based aerosol optical properties showed good potential to identify the aerosol hotspots and constrain aerosol types across a highly polluted SA region.', '[Mhawish, Alaa; Sorek-Hamer, Meytar] Univ Space Res Assoc USRA, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA.

However, accurately characterizing the urban thermal anisotropy at the satellite pixel scale is still challenging. In this paper, comparing the simultaneous airborne observations and the temporal-aggregated signal from MODIS LST, we further investigate the seasonal and diurnal patterns of thermal anisotropy in urban areas with various simulation scenarios. The anisotropy was defined as the difference between off-nadir and nadir temperatures. First, a realistic morphological representation of urban surfaces as well as urban component temperatures measured by infrared thermometers (IRTs) were input into the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model to simulate MODIS-scale anisotropy for Toulouse, France in summer. Extending this \'IRT-DART\' method to other seasons was restricted because the IRTs\' radiative source areas are affected by shadows when the sun elevation is low, meaning that measured sunlit temperatures are not reliably available. An energy balance model, TUF3D, and a sensor view model, SUM, for simplified urban geometry were coupled to replace \'IRT-DART\' in winter. The cross-comparison shows that \'TUF-SUM\' can simulate MODIS-scale anisotropy if urban structure and materials are relatively homogeneous, which provides a basis for assessing anisotropy when IRT sunlit temperatures are unavailable. The MODIS anisotropy is subject to a strong diurnal yet a discernable seasonal variation. For example, for a mid-latitude city, the anisotropy over all MODIS view angles reaches up to 6.6 K for Terra-Day (around 11:00 local time) and 4.9 K for Aqua-Day (around 13:00) in summer, and 6.1 K for Terra-Day and 4.0 K for Aqua-Day in winter. Nocturnal anisotropy is weak with values less than 0.2 K. The modeling methods can be used to quantify anisotropy of satellite LST in a broad range of urban environments and facilitate the use of multi-angular MODIS LST for a better assessment of urban thermal environments in the future.', '[Wang, Dandan] China Univ Geosci, Sch Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.

We develop a system (termed as UVISRdl) in this study, based on deep learning, to estimate remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) at 360, 380, and 400 nm (collectively termed as near-blue UV bands, nbUV) from R-rs in the visible bands that are obtained by ocean color satellites. This system is tested using both synthetic and field-measured data that cover a wide range and large number of values, with the resulted coefficient of determination close to 1.0 and bias close to 0 between UVISRdl estimated and known R-rs(nbUV). These results indicate excellent predictability of R-rs(nbUV) from Rrs(visible) via UVISRdl. The system was further applied to VIIRS (the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) data with the estimated R-rs(nbUV) evaluated using matchup field measurements, and obtained a mean absolute relative difference (MARD) at 360 nm of similar to 14% for oceanic waters and similar to 50% for coastal waters. These results are equivalent to those reported in the literature for satellite R-rs(visible) in oceanic and coastal waters. Examples of the global distribution of R-rs(nbUV), and subsequently the diffuse attenuation coefficient at the nbUV bands (K-d(nbUV)), are generated after applying UVISRdl to R-rs(visible) from the VIIRS data. The system lays the groundwork to generate decade-long R-rs(nbUV) and K-d(nbUV) from satellite ocean color data, which will be useful and important for both ocean color remote sensing and biogeochemical studies.', '[Wang, Yongchao; Shang, Shaoling; Lai, Wendian] Xiamen Univ, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China.

In recent years, several SM products have been developed based on remote sensing (RS), land surface model (LSM) or land data assimilation system (LDAS). However, little knowledge is available in understanding spatial patterns of the uncertainty of different SM products and potential regional drivers over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), a complex environment for accurate SM estimation. This paper investigates the sensitivity of the SM uncertainties based on the three-cornered hat (TCH) method and a generalized additive model (GAM) in terms of underlying surface characteristics (sand fraction, soil organic matter, vegetation, land surface temperature, and topography) and near-ground meteorology (precipitation and air temperature) in the third pole environment over the 2015-2018 period. Eleven SM products are involved in this work, including Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity INRA-CESBIO (SMOS-IC), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), Land Surface Parameter Model (LPRM), Climate Change Initiative - Active/Combined (CCI_A/CCI_C), Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim), Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model product a/b (GLEAM_a/GLEAM_b), and Random Forest Soil Moisture (RFSM). Results show that most of the SM products perform well across QTP, while SMOS-IC is strongly affected by radio-frequency interference in this region, JAXA has a relatively higher noise level over QTP, and LPRM has larger relative uncertainties (RUs) in the southeast of QTP. Nonlinear regression analysis demonstrates that variations of RUs in SMOS-IC and JAXA are driven by topography, while LPRM\'s are mainly controlled by vegetation. In addition, two groups of opposite (positive/negative) effects from topography and vegetation, topography and precipitation, and precipitation and land surface temperature affect the spatial variations of RUs in CCI_A, RFSM, and ERA-Interim, respectively. Meanwhile, more complex relationships are found between multiple surface factors and RUs of different products. In general, the underlying surface factors explain on average 39.41% and 28.34% of the variations in RS and LSM/LDAS SM RUs, respectively. Comparatively, the near-ground meteorology factors have a slightly larger effect on LSM/LDAS products than that on RS products.', '[Liu, Jin; Chai, Linna; Liu, Shaomin; Xu, Tongren; Yang, Shiqi; Lu, Zheng] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China.

Accurate mapping of river networks from remote-sensing images is important for the study of these systems. Unfortunately, the delineation of river networks is challenging due to the meandering nature of river channels, the often complex and variable features of the surrounding landscape, and the spatial heterogeneity of the river networks. Here, we present an adaptive, multi-scale region growth method (AMRGM) to delineate river networks from sentinel-2A/B MSI images. The method can handle variable river heterogeneous surroundings, multiple spatial scales, and variable curvatures of the river channels. The method includes four steps: (1) a water index (NDWI) is used to provide initial detection of river water pixels in the image; (2) a bias-corrected fuzzy C-means (BCFCM) method alleviates the effects of the variable surrounding landscape; (3) a scale-enhancement algorithm based on the hessian matrix makes full use of scale and direction information to enhance river morphology characteristics (multiple dimensions and variable curvatures), and (4) a regional growth criterion facilitates handling of various river dimensions. Fast-growing and fine-screening strategies are also included in the AMRGM. The method is applied to eight river networks to evaluate its accuracy and reliability with various river morphologies and hydrological conditions. The AMRGM is more widely applicable than four commonly used river-detection methods (i.e., K-means method, maximum likelihood method, iterative self-organizing data analysis technique algorithm, and support vector machine) and outperform these methods when detecting multi-scale river branches. The mean overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficients (KC) of the AMRGM exceed 97% and 0.92 across the eight river networks. The most accurate river extractions are obtained for large rivers such as the Amazon River, Mackenzie River, and Ganges River Delta, which have more discernable scale and direction characteristics. Relatively high omission and commission errors are observed in river networks with complex and heterogeneous zonations, such as the river Welland, UK, and the Zagya Zangbo River in the Tibet plateau. The complex geomorphic features of the river Welland reduce OA and KC to 93.8% and 0.86, respectively', '[Jin, Song; Liu, Yongxue; Xu, Wenxuan; Liu, Yongchao; Zhao, Bingxue] Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

Clarifying urban park cooling effect can improve climate change adaptability and urban sustainability. However, park cooling effects were mainly explored in maximum perspective in previous studies, without considering the cumulative impact resulting from spatial continuity. Therefore, focusing on 24 urban parks in the main city zone of Shenzhen, China, such cumulative indexes as park cooling intensity and park cooling gradient, were proposed in this study and integrated with maximum indexes of park cooling area and park cooling efficiency, so as to explore park cooling effects comprehensively. The results showed that the park areas and cold spot areas of land surface temperature overlapped spatially by 64.40%. The partial correlation analysis showed that, park perimeter, area and shape index were significantly and positively correlated with park cooling area, with significantly negative correlation for park cooling efficiency. The vegetation index was significantly and positively correlated with park cooling intensity and park cooling gradient, and the impact of water body area ratio to all the four park cooling indexes was not significant. Then cooling effects of 24 urban parks were classified into four cooling capacity bundles, which showed that parks designed to serve different social functions behaved different cooling effects. The cooling effect of comprehensive parks was more efficient, with the same low value of all four cooling indexes for theme parks, high cooling intensity and cooling gradient for small ecological parks, and the highest cooling area for large ecological parks. This study proposed a comprehensive approach to measuring park cooling effects with both maximum and accumulation perspectives, which can guide urban park planning and design to maximize the ecological benefits.', '[Peng, Jian; Dong, Jianquan] Peking Univ, Lab Earth Surface Proc, Minist Educ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.

Data Assimilation (DA) has been recognized as an effective means to incorporate such observations into hydrologic models to better predict and forecast hydroclimatic variables. In this study, we use a recently developed Evolutionary Particle Filter with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (EPFM) approach to assimilate Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture data into Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model to provide more reliable topsoil layer moisture (0 similar to-5 cm) over the entire Continental United States (CONUS). The EPFM outperformed an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) in terms of correlations and the unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) with in situ mea-surements from the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) and the United States Climate Reference Network (USCRN). Also, we used a multivariate probability distribution based on a Copula function to integrate the posterior soil moisture, precipitation (from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS)) and evapotranspiration (from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) information to develop a new integrated drought index, i.e. SPESMI. To validate the usefulness of the developed integrated drought index, we compared the drought events detected by this index with those reported by the United States Drought Monitor (USDM). The results indicated a strong temporal consistency of the drought areas detected by our approach and the USDM over the entire period of study (April 2015 to June 2018). In addition to such promising results, we noticed that our approach could capture the flash drought in 2017 in the U.S. Northern Plains earlier than the USDM, and could identify some severe to extreme drought events that had been underestimated by the USDM. Moreover, the SPESMI has a high correlation with the yield loss of spring and winter wheat in the United States.

The FREM approach links satellite observations of fire radiative power (FRP) to emission rates of total particulate matter (TPM) via spatially varying smoke emissions coefficients (g.MJ(-1)) - each derived from matchups of FRP and smoke plume aerosol optical depth (AOD). In the original FREMv1 approach, FRP data came from the geostationary Meteosat satellite and AOD data from the 10 km spatial resolution MODIS MOD04 aerosol product. However, the latter often performs quite poorly close to biomass burning sources due to its large 10 km pixels, bias at high MODIS view zenith angles, and saturation and/or removal of areas of high AOD limitations introducing bias and uncertainty into the final FREM-derived smoke emissions estimates. We address each of these issues through a series of significant methodological and input data improvements, including exploitation of the 1 km MODIS MAIAC AOD product that performs far better close to fire sources. We use our FREMv2 methodology to generate a new pan-African fire emissions inventory for TPM and the carbonaceous gases CO2, CO and CH4, and our annual mean TPM emissions are within 11% of those of the MODIS-based FEER top-down approach, but significantly higher than those of GFASv1.2 and GFEDv4.1s (by 114% and 69% respectively) agreeing with independent assessments that aerosol emissions of GFASv1.2 require upscaling by a factor of 2 to 3.4 to deliver matching magnitudes between modelled and observed AODs. From our carbonaceous emissions totals we map dry matter consumed (DMC) across Africa, and dividing this by the FireCCISFD11 20 m burned area product we provide one of the first data-driven pan-African maps of fuel consumption per unit area (kg.m(-2)) which in many areas is higher than in GFEDv4.1s. Our estimates represent the highest spatio-temporal resolution biomass burning emissions data yet available over Africa, and significantly advance the aim of a pan-tropical and mid-latitude inventory based on FRP from the global geostationary satellite network (Meteosat, Meteosat IOD, GOES and Himawari).', '[Nguyen, Hannah M.; Wooster, Martin J.] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London WC2B 4BG, England.

Previous work in the field has shown the ability of GNSS-R to observe the global surface water distribution by generating dynamic maps of wetlands and other inundated areas. These maps can be generated by leveraging the large difference in received power of the GNSS signals as they reflect from water surfaces compared to land. In this paper, we utilize a full-forward scattering model approach to evaluate the accuracy of these maps. The CYGNSS End-to-End Simulator (E2ES) was extended to include the contributions from coherent surface scattering in heterogeneous regions where the area around the specular point contains both water and land in complex geometries. The simulator is then used to analyze the accuracy of a current approach to estimate the surface water content in the first Fresnel zone from a single measurement, called a fractional water in footprint approach. We find that contributions to the total received power by the scattering from outside the first Fresnel zone as well as CYGNSS instrument effects impact the accuracy of this approach. Furthermore, the measured signal from calibration scattering targets is compared to the results of simulation to validate the scattering model.

Live fuel moisture content (LFMC) - the mass of water per unit dry biomass in vegetation - exerts a direct control on fuel ignitability, fuel availability and fire spread, and is thus an important parameter in assessing wildfire risk. Current estimates of LFMC from optical remote sensing or meteorological indices are insufficient to accurately map LFMC at landscape scale. In this study, we present a physics-assisted recurrent neural network model for mapping LFMC every 15 days at 250 m resolution over the western US using microwave backscatter (from Sentinel-1) and optical reflectance (from Landsat-8). The model was physics-assisted by adding handcrafted inputs representing radiative transfer processes and related parameters. Field data from the National Fuel Moisture Database was used to train the deep learning model. The model had a satisfactory overall predictability of R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 25.0% and bias = 1.9% when cross-validated at 125 sites. The model was substantially better at predicting site-means (R-2 = 0.71 and RMSE = 14.3%) as compared to site-anomalies (R-2 = 0.55 and RMSE = 21.3%). Of the 6 land cover types tested, the model was most accurate in predicting LFMC in shrub-lands (R-2 = 0.69), while closed broadleaf deciduous sites had the least accuracy (R-2 = 0.49). Incorporating microwave backscatter as a model input significantly enhanced performance (R-2 increasing from 0.44 to 0.63, and RMSE decreasing from 31.8% to 25.0%). Microwave backscatter therefore presents a complementary source of information to optical remote sensing metrics for LFMC mapping. The high resolution dynamic LFMC maps presented here may assist in improved wildfire risk characterization and also have potential applications in quantifying plant drought stress at large scales.', '[Rao, Krishna; Konings, Alexandra G.] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.

By combining imagery from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and the MultiSpectral Instrument on-board Sentinel-2A and -2B, the remote sensing community now has access to moderate (10-30 m) spatial resolution imagery with repeat periods of similar to 3 days in the mid-latitudes. At the same time, the large combined data volume from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 introduce substantial new challenges for users. Land surface phenology (LSP) algorithms, which estimate the timing of phenophase transitions and quantify the nature and magnitude of seasonality in remotely sensed land surface conditions, provide an intuitive way to reduce data volumes and redundancy, while also furnishing data sets that are useful for a wide range of applications including monitoring ecosystem response to climate variability and extreme events, ecosystem modelling, crop-type discrimination, and land cover, land use, and land cover change mapping, among others. To support the need for operational LSP data sets, here we describe a continental-scale land surface phenology algorithm and data product based on harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) imagery. The algorithm creates high quality times series of vegetation indices from HLS imagery, which are then used to estimate the timing of vegetation phenophase transitions at 30 m spatial resolution. We present results from assessment efforts evaluating LSP retrievals, and provide examples illustrating the character and quality of information related to land cover and terrestrial ecosystem properties provided by the continental LSP dataset that we have developed. The algorithm is highly successful in ecosystems with strong seasonal variation in leaf area (e.g., deciduous forests).

Previous studies were generally conducted at relatively coarse temporal intervals, which hardly captured detailed coastal dynamics, especially in rapidly developing islands. In this study, we developed a new method to map the monthly changes in coastlines and tidal flats in the Zhoushan Archipelago during 1985-2017 using the full time series of Landsat images based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. First, we built the full time series of the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI). Second, we derived temporal segments of MNDWI using a binary segmentation algorithm. Third, we classified the corresponding coastal cover types (i.e., water, tidal flats, and land) for each temporal segment based on the features of MNDWI and regional tidal heights. Finally, we identified the change information including conversion types, and turning years and months. Results indicate that the proposed method can well identify turning years with an overall accuracy of 90% and map coastal cover types with overall accuracies of 89-94% in 1985 and 87-92% in 2017. Significant coastline expansions and declines in tidal flats were found in the study area. The areas of water and tidal flats decreased by 6% and 10% during 1985-2017, respectively, while the land area increased by 18%. The land reclamation was accelerated in the recent decade, and mainly occurred on the medium-large islands, their surrounding small islands, and the islands close to the mainland. The proposed framework based on the GEE platform is transferable to investigate coastal dynamics in other areas. The derived information of changes in coastlines and tidal flats is of great use for sustainable management and ecological studies in coastal areas.', '[Cao, Wenting; Li, Rui] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Earth Sci, 38 Zheda Rd, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

Several parameterizations of the Community Microwave Emission Modelling Platform (CMEM) are used to simulate L-band Brightness Temperatures (TBs) and compared to the SMOS TBs for 2010-2011. We show that simulated TBs are primarily sensitive, by order of importance, to the soil roughness model, the vegetation opacity and the soil dielectric model. In particular, best CMEM results are obtained with the simple Wigneron soil roughness model and the Wigneron model for the vegetation opacity. For the soil dielectric model, performances of the Wang and Schmugge and the Mironov models are shown to be similar and better than the Dobson model. The Wang and Schmugge model is then used in the next steps of this paper combined with the Wigneron roughness and vegetation models. The paper describes a multi-angular multi-polarised bias correction method based on a linear resealing (mean and variance) computed at the monthly scale using SMOS observations and ECMWF-CMEM re-analysed TBs for a four year period (2010-2013). Results show that for 2010-2013 the seasonal multi-angular multi-polarisation bias correction approach reduces global RMSE to 7.91 K, compared to 16.7 K before bias correction, whereas the mean absolute bias is reduced to 1.39 K, compared to 11.04 K before bias correction. The consistency between the seasonality of simulated and the observed TBs is also improved by using a monthly bias correction, leading to correlation values improvement to 0.62 after bias correction compared to 0.56 before. The 2010-2013 bias correction applied to the 2014-2016 period at 40 degrees incidence reduces the global RMSE from 15.56 K to 8.19 K, and the mean absolute bias from 10.16 K to 2.51 K, with no impact on the correlation values that remain at 0.61 in both cases. Long term monitoring of SMOS TB is presented covering a 7-year period (2010-2016) at both polarisations, at 40 incidence angle. Results show that the consistency between SMOS and ECMWF reanalysis based TBs progressively improved between 2010 and 2016, pointing out improvements of level 1 SMOS TB products quality through the SMOS lifetime.', '[de Rosnay, Patricia; Munoz-Sabater, Joaquin; Albergel, Clement; Isaksen, Lars; English, Stephen] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF, Shinfield Pk, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England.

In order to evaluate the ice sheet\'s present and future response to global climate change, detailed information about spatial and temporal ice mass dynamics is required. While ice sheet surface mass balance can be estimated from regional climate models, ice discharge is often determined from spaceborne measurements of ice thickness and ice motion at selected flux gates. The retrieval of ice motion is not only critical for analysing the rate of ice transport into the ocean but also for investigating the spatial and temporal pattern or the driving forcings of Antarctic ice flow dynamics.   This study provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art spaceborne ice velocity measurements in Antarctica. Based on 201 scientific papers, published over the last three decades, our analysis revealed a dominant interest in local and regional scale investigations. Yet, the launch of the ERS-1/-2 and RADARSAT-1 SAR satellites in the 1990s dramatically increased data coverage over the Antarctic continent and enabled the first circum-antarctic velocity product to be published in the late 2000s. In recent years, the improved imaging capabilities of Landsat 8 led to a shift towards using mainly optical satellite data and enabled great advances in circum-antarctic velocity mapping. Data from the currently operating Sentinel-1/-2 missions was applied in fewer studies but will play a crucial role in future ice motion studies e.g. as part of ESA CCI projects. In addition, we found a growing interest in high temporal resolution velocity change analyses. Based on the reviewed studies, we moreover summarized the highly dynamic and locally variable flow pattern over the Antarctic continent being in accordance with varying local and regional driving mechanisms.   Despite the great advances in spaceborne ice velocity mapping in Antarctica, we report some major drawbacks and discuss future challenges and requirements. To start with, our study uncovered strong variations regarding the spatial availability of investigations. While we found an aggregation of studies over selected glaciers, we report a major lack of studies in all three Antarctic sectors. Additionally, many velocity datasets were created with strongly heterogeneous output parameters and were provided at coarse temporal resolution or at point-based measurement locations only. Future studies should consequently aim at creating more uniform ice motion products at defined spatial and temporal coverage and resolution standards and at analysing particularly the least studied glaciers.', '[Dirscherl, Mariel; Dietz, Andreas J.; Dech, Stefan; Kuenzer, Claudia] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, German Remote Sensing Data Ctr DFD, Munchener Str 20, D-82234 Wessling, Germany.

In this paper, deep learning models are investigated for restoring SRTM data. To this end, we explore generative adversarial nets, which represent one state-of-the-art family of deep learning models. A conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) is introduced as the baseline method for filling voids in incomplete SRTM data. The problem regarding shadow violation that possibly arises from the CGAN restored data is investigated. To address this deficiency, shadow geometric constraints based on shadow maps of satellite images are devised. In addition, a shadow constrained conditional generative adversarial network (SCGAN), which incorporates the shadow geometric constraints into the CGAN, is developed. Training the SCGAN model requires both the remote sensing observations (i.e., the original incomplete SRTM data and satellite images) and the ground truth data (i.e., the complete SRTM data, which are manually refined from the incomplete SRTM data with the reference of in-situ measurements). The integration of the multi-source training data enables the SCGAN model to be characterized by comprehensive information including both mountain shape variation and mountain shadow geometry. Experimental results validate the superiority of the SCGAN over the comparison methods, i.e., the interpolation, the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the baseline CGAN, in SRTM data restoration.', '[Dong, Guoshuai; Ren, Peng] China Univ Petr East China, Coll Oceanog & Space Informat, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R China.

In the USA pushbroom imagery can be dramatically less expensive than frame-camera imagery in part because of a nationwide collection program.

This study compares point clouds generated from 40 cm pushbroom DAP with point clouds from lidar and 7.5 cm, 15 cm, and 30 cm frame-based DAP. Differences in point clouds from these data sources are readily apparent in visual inspections; e.g. DAP tends to measure canopy gaps poorly, omit individual trees in openings, is typically unable to represent the ground beneath canopy, and is susceptible to commission errors manifested as points above the canopy surface. Frame-based DAP provides greater canopy detail than pushbroom DAP, which becomes more apparent with higher image resolution. Our results indicated that DAP height metrics generally have a strong linear relationship with lidar metrics, with R-2 values ranging from 83 - 90% for cover, and 47-80% for height quantiles. Similarly, lidar auxiliary variables explain the greatest variation in forest attributes, e.g., volume (84%), followed closely by 30 cm frame-based DAP (81%), with the poorest results from pushbroom DAP (75%). While DAP resolution had a visible effect on canopy definition, it did not appreciably affect point cloud metrics or model performances. Although pushbroom DAP explained the least variation in forest attributes, it still had sufficient explanatory power to provide good value when frame-based DAP and lidar are not available.', '[Strunk, Jacob L.] USDA, Forest Serv, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, 3625 93rd Ave SW, Olympia, WA 98512 USA.

This variability can in turn affect local meteorological processes and geodetic techniques to measure ground surface motion. We demonstrate this general problem with the specific issues of a small tropical island, Montserrat. Over a period of 17 days in December 2014 we made observations using InSAR and GPS techniques, together with concurrent atmospheric models using the WRF code. Comparative studies of water vapour distribution and its effect on refractivity were made at high spatial resolution (300 m) over short distances (similar to 10 km). Our results show that model simulations of the observed differences in water vapour distribution using WRF is insufficiently accurate. We suggest that better use could be made of the knowledge and observations of local water vapour conditions at different scales, specifically the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), the trade wind fields and the mountain flow (similar to 30 m) perhaps using eddy simulation. The annual perturbations of the ITCZ show that the range of humidity is approximately the same expressed as the differential phase of InSAR imaging (similar to 100 mm). Trade wind direction and speed are particularly important at high wind speeds driving vigorous asymmetrical convection over the island\'s mountains. We also show that the slant angles of radar can follow distinct separate paths through the water vapour field. Our study is novel in demonstrating how synoptic-scale features and climate can advise the modelling of mesoscale systems and sub-seasonal InSAR imaging on tropical islands.', '[Webb, T.

The retrieval algorithm was used to generate a climate data record (CDR) of passive microwave (PMW) SST from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and its follow-on instrument AMSR2 for the period June 2002-October 2017. Multisensor Matchup Datasets (MMDs), which includes satellite orbital data collocated with in situ and auxiliary data, was used to derive consistent algorithms for AMSR-E and AMSR2. The retrieval algorithms consist of wind speed (WS) retrievals and SST retrievals, with corresponding uncertainty retrievals. The WS retrieval consists of a two-step regression model, where the second step is a localized algorithm, trained to perform well over restricted WS intervals. A two-step multiple linear regression retrieval with localized algorithms is used to retrieve SST. The first-stage algorithm is trained to perform well over restricted latitude intervals for ascending and descending orbit, respectively, whereas the second-stage retrieval uses localized SST and WS algorithms. Furthermore, a new and effective method for detecting and screening for Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) was developed.   Validation of the PMW SSTs against drifter in situ SSTs shows an overall bias of - 0.02 K for quality level (QL) 4 and 5 AMSR-E retrievals with a standard deviation of 0.46 K. Validation results for QL 4 and 5 AMSR2 retrievals against drifter in situ SSTs give a bias of 0.002 K and a standard deviation of 0.45 K. The corresponding mean modelled SST uncertainties, including in situ and sampling uncertainties, are estimated to 0.45 K for QL 4 and 5 AMSR-E retrievals and 0.44 K for QL 4 and 5 AMSR2 retrievals. Validation against near-surface temperature measurements from Argo floats yielded comparable results, confirming the drifting-buoy validation.

With the rapid growth in data volume, extracting more accurate dune displacement time series and rates from optical observations has become possible; however, the method is not yet fully fledged. To address this issue, we propose an extended algorithm for the mature optical imagery cross-correlation (OICC) technique based on Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) acquisitions. The main innovative points of this algorithm are: 1) the proposed pairing strategy for the OICC processing; 2) the modularized post-processing procedures for noise removal; and 3) the introduction of singular value decomposition (SVD) time-series inversion of the redundant optical observations to quantify the dune migration. To test the effectiveness of this algorithm, it was applied in the study of dune migration near Minqin Oasis in northwestern China, using enriched L8 and S2 images collected between April 2013 and April 2018. Compared with the original OICC results in stable areas, the post-processing and inversion of the proposed algorithm reduce the uncertainty by around 22-35% and 3-5% for L8, 29-48% and 5-12% for S2, respectively. The cross-comparison between the L8- and S2-derived displacement time series shows high consistency, and presents a lower uncertainty than the result of the traditional no-inversion method. Furthermore, the derived displacement rates show spatial patterns that are similar to those of the manually digitized results obtained with historical Google (TM) Earth (GE) images. These comparisons show the advantage of the proposed algorithm in automatically and accurately quantifying dune migration. Taking into account these measurements, the spatio-temporal evolution patterns of dune migration in the study area were analyzed. From the spatial perspective, the sand dunes move along a northwest-southeast axis with four detected transport pathways. Our research also shows that around 1087.7 km(2) of dune fields present an active status. The active sand dunes are currently encroaching on around 155.5 km(2) and 4.4 km(2) of land each year outside and inside the oasis, respectively, representing a problem of rapid desertification. Temporally, the displacement time series along the dominant migration direction appears as seasonal variations that are seemly consistent with the changes in local atmospheric conditions. The proposed algorithm provides a new perspective to investigate the spatio-temporal evolution of dune migration with medium-resolution L8 and S2 optical datasets.', '[Ding, Chao; Zhang, Lu; Liao, Mingsheng; Ao, Meng; Yu, Yanghai] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.

Satellite remote sensing is a cost-effective method for estimating burn severity, providing a comprehensive spatially explicit view of whole landscapes. However, the proportion of tree canopy cover (TCC) affects the reflectance signal, obscuring background char and ash. Consequently, traditional optical satellite remote sensing methods that do not account for variation in TCC misclassify burn severity, especially in areas with extremely low or high TCC. In this study, TCC data served to parameterize and constrain the inversion of the Forest Reflectance and Transmittance (FRT) radiative transfer model (RTM) to alleviate spectral confusion when retrieving burn severity. The methodology was evaluated using field measurements of burn severity for a series of wildfires in the fire-prone tropical savannas of northern Australia and the western United States. Burn severity classes were used for Australia while the Composite Burn Index (CBI) for US. Reflectance data from Sentinel-2A Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) corresponding to post-fire field survey dates were used to retrieve burn severity using FRT RTM (with and without using TCC information in its parameterization and inversion) and two standard empirical burn indices, dNBR and RdNBR, for comparison. Using FRT RIM without TCC constraint produced an overestimation for low burn severity in regions with low TCC and an underestimation for moderate and high burn severity in regions with high TCC. Burn severity estimation accuracy significantly improved by integrating TCC in the parameterization and inversion of FRT RTM. The overall accuracy in northern Australia increased from 65% to 81%, and the kappa coefficient increased from 0.35 to 0.55. In the western United States, R-2 between estimated and observed CBI, increased from 0.33 to 0.54, root mean square error (RMSE) reduced from 0.53 to 0.43, and in all instances, the method performed better than dNBR and RdNBR.

The spatial resolution of soil moisture products from microwave remote sensing is relatively coarse (e.g., similar to 40 km x 40 km), whereas SSM of higher spatiotemporal resolutions (e.g., 1 km x 1 km and daily continuous) is more useful in water resources management. In this study, first, to improve the spatiotemporal completeness of SSM estimates, we downscaled land surface temperature (LST) output from the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS, 0.0625 degrees x 0.0625 degrees) using a data fusion approach and MODIS LST acquired on clear-sky days to generate spatially complete and temporally continuous LST maps across the North China Plain. Second, spatially complete and daily continuous 1 km x 1 km SSM was generated based on random forest models combined with quality LST maps, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), surface albedo, precipitation, soil texture, SSM background fields from the European Space Agency Soil Moisture Climate Change Initiative (CCI, 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) and CLDAS land surface model (LSM) SSM output (0.0625 degrees x 0.0625 degrees) to be downscaled, and in situ SSM measurements. Third, the importance of different input variables to the downscaled SSM was quantified. Compared with the original CCI and CLDAS SSM, both the accuracy and spatial resolution of the downscaled SSM were largely improved, in terms of a bias (root mean square error) of -0.001 cm(3)/cm(3) (0.041 cm(3)/cm(3)) and a correlation coefficient of 0.72. These results are generally comparable and even better than those in published studies, with our SSM maps featuring spatiotemporal completeness and relatively high spatial resolution. The downscaled SSM maps are valuable for monitoring agricultural drought and optimizing irrigation scheduling, bridging the gaps between microwave-based and LSM-based SSM estimates of coarse spatial resolution and thermal infrared-based LST at a 1 km x 1 km resolution.', '[Long, Di; Bai, Liangliang; Yan, La; Zhang, Caijin; Yang, Wenting; Lei, Huimin] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.

In particular, free and open data access from the European Sentinel-1 constellation and the future NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) mission is encouraging the global community to move towards automated, cloud-based processing that can accommodate these rapidly growing data volumes and facilitate the use of a suite of corrections to the data. A key challenge is related to path delays introduced when the radar signal propagates through the troposphere. Tropospheric corrections estimated from empirical, phase-based methods and those using independent data from weather models, GPS, and radiometers have been included in open-source packages such as TRAIN, PyAPS and GACOS. Users within the InSAR community have reported varying degrees of success using these methods in a range of areas around the world. However, the various statistical metrics used to evaluate the reliability of tropospheric corrections are not consistently applied and often depend on the area and the spatial scale over which they are evaluated. Examination of a simple metric such as the overall reduction in phase variability within an interferogram does not allow the user to determine whether the improvement was at large or short length scales. We present a review of existing tropospheric correction methods and statistical performance metrics, providing guidelines for global assessment and verification of the efficacy of tropospheric correction methods. We summarize the assumptions and limitations for each correction method as well as each statistical performance metric. We examine two regions with different atmospheric characteristics - one Sentinel-1 swath covering the central United States and one swath covering south central Mexico, including part of the Pacific coast. As the SAR community moves towards reliance on global and automated InSAR processing platforms that incorporate tropospheric corrections, approaches such as those examined here can aid researchers in their efforts to evaluate such corrections and include their uncertainties in derived products such as surface displacement time series, coseismic offsets, processes that correlate with topography, and signals with smaller magnitude or larger spatial scales such as those associated with small earthquakes, aseismic creep and slow slip events. We found that the GACOS products (leveraging the operational high resolution ECMWF weather model) outperform the other correction methods explored here on average, but this result is highly dependent on location, acquisition time, and data availability. We found spatial structure functions to be most useful for performance assessment because of their ability to convey information about performance at discrete spatial scales.', '[Murray, Kyle D.; Lohman, Rowena B.] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.

To evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of the autumn freeze in northeastern Canada boreal forest, a network of compact and self-recording temperature sensors (iButton) along transects averaging 10 km was deployed on the soil surface at two different sites. Results show important spatial variability in soil freezing timing with maximums, for the two sites, spanning from 7.5 to 9.5 weeks to reach a frozen state. It is known that L-band radiometry such as Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) can monitor freeze/thaw (Fro seasonality at low spatial resolution (similar to 40 km). However, the possible strong surface variability within a 40 km x 40 km pixel can lead to spatial delay in fall freezing. Simulations of brightness temperature (TB) weighted by spatially distributed iButton F/T records and using the omega-tau vegetation model show good agreement with SMAP satellite observations during the fall transition period with an average RMSE of 3.5 K. A new intra-pixel frozen soil percentage retrieval algorithm using only SMAP observations and air temperature is proposed.

The goal of this study is to validate one satellite-based and two model-based soil moisture datasets with in situ data across the United States. Soil moisture information from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) enhanced level 3 (L3) (SMAP L3) and modeled level 4 (L4) (SMAP L4) data at 9-km resolution and Short-term Prediction Research and Transition-Land Information System (SPORT-LIS) modeled at 3-km resolution were selected for evaluation. SPoRT-LIS is a near real-time, high resolution operational land analysis data. Ground-based data were obtained from the North American Soil Moisture Database (NASMD) for 362 stations. Seven statistical indicators including anomaly, Spearman, and Pearson correlation coefficients, the systematic error (Bias), root mean square error (RMSE), unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE), and normalized standard deviation (SDV) were used to evaluate the satellite- and model-derived soil moisture data. In addition, the triple collocation (TC) error model was used to measure the error among SMAP L4, SPORT-LIS and ground-based data. This study assesses which satellite or modeled dataset is most appropriate for specific times and locations to use as a surrogate for in situ observations. Temporal and spatial analysis demonstrated that, overall, SMAP L4 performed better than SMAP L3 and SPORT-LIS. Strong agreement was observed between SMAP L4 and in situ observations (p = 0.53, Bias = 0.006) in all seasons and most regions with various land covers, especially in winter and in the central regions of the United States.

This study developed a scale-independent and semi-automatic image processing technique to map the upwelling areas along the 4500 km south-eastern coast of Australia from 14-year monthly MODIS Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data. The results show that there is significant spatial variability in the mapped upwelling areas, month to month, season to season and year to year. There is also strong temporal (month to month, seasonal and inter-annual) variability of the upwelling characteristics in area of influence, SST anomaly, chlorophyll-a concentrations and upwelling speed. This study identifies two prominent upwelling systems, the NSW system along the coast of New South Wales and the WVIC/SA system along the coast of western Victoria and adjacent South Australia. The NSW coastal upwelling system occurs more or less continuously from austral spring to autumn. The WVIC/SA coastal upwelling system is a seasonal upwelling system occurring in the austral summer. The NSW coastal upwelling system has a stronger upwelling intensity than the WVIC/SA system, in terms of area of influence, SST anomaly, chlorophyll-a concentrations and upwelling speed. We believe that the NSW coastal upwelling system, especially the northern and central parts, is mainly driven by the East Australian Current (EAC) and its eddies; while, the WVIC/SA coastal upwelling is a typical wind-driven system. In addition, the results indicate that the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events are likely to have a low-to-moderate impact on both the NSW and the WVIC/SA coastal upwelling systems.

As the major constituent of China\'s water towers, the headwater region of the Yangtze River (HRYR) provides water to hundreds of millions of people downstream. Therefore, accurately simulating snowmelt is critical to developing a better understanding of the hydrological processes, which would, in turn, benefit water supply management, irrigation, hydropower generation, and ecological integrity over the HRYR and its lower reaches. However, it is a considerable challenge to conduct hydrological modeling for ungauged and poorly gauged headwater regions, owing to a lack of in situ measurements to appropriately constrain the model and evaluate its results. Satellite remote sensing provides an unprecedented opportunity to capture hydrological state variables globally, such as snow cover area (SCA) based on optical remote sensing and snow water equivalent (SWE) based on passive microwave remote sensing. This study simulates snow and glacier meltwater of the HRYR (above the Zhimenda gauging station), and quantifies proportional meltwater contributions to total runoff using multisource remote sensing data and a distributed hydrological model. We, for the first time ever, evaluate the snowmelt simulations based on the hydrological consistency among precipitation, air and land surface temperatures, and remotely sensed SWE/SCA. Results show that the snowmelt simulations using either SWE or SCA as a reference for calibrating parameters of the hydrological model are highly consistent, with snow and glacier meltwater contributing similar to 7% and similar to 5%, respectively, to the total runoff during 2003-2014.

Based on their proximity to the adjacent infrastructure, their size, and their flow dynamics, FDLs represent potential geohazards. Eight FDLs (FDL-A, -B, -C, -D, -4, -5, -7, -11) within the Dalton Highway corridor in the Brooks Range, Alaska, USA are the subject of this paper. We examined temporal and spatial variation of FDL displacement using medium-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and differential SAR Interferometry (dInSAR) techniques. European Remote Sensing satellite 1/2 (ERS 1/2) and Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) acquisitions were used to generate coherent interferograms to study the displacement history of FDLs for 1995-1996 and 2006-2010. We conducted an initial assessment of the capability of satellite InSAR to monitor FDL movement depending on data resolution, season, and vegetation coverage, which also helped us to select useful interferograms. With multi-temporal interferometric displacement maps, we found that seven investigated FDLs (FDL-7 was excluded from this sub experiment due to limited data coverage) demonstrated strong spatial and seasonal variations in their movement patterns, with maximum displacement rates typically occurring in October and minimum displacement rates during February or March, which is consistent with previously published field study results. Overall, through this study we: (1) delineated the active FDLs during the winter period using a wrapped PALSAR interferogram; (2) analyzed the spatial variation of the deformation field within each FDL body; (3) modeled the seasonal changes of FDL deformation rates through the analysis of multi-temporal ERS tandem interferograms; and (4) integrated InSAR-derived deformation rates with those obtained through historical imagery analysis to determine long-term deformation rates. Results from this study fill the gaps left in the historical imagery analysis and provide important seasonal and spatial deformation data, which are essential in the development of a mitigation plan as these features approach infrastructure.

However, our understanding of the spatial distribution, temporal trends, and seasonal timing of episodic landscape deformation events triggered by permafrost degradation is hampered by the limited spatial and temporal coverage of high-resolution optical, RADAR, LIDAR, and hyperspectral remote sensing products. Here we present an automated approach for detecting permafrost degradation (thermoerosion), using meso-scale high-frequency remote sensing products (i.e., Landsat image archive). This approach was developed, tested, and applied in the ice-rich lowlands of the Noatak National Preserve (NOAT; 12,369 km(2)) in northwestern Alaska. We identified thermoerosion (TE) by capturing the spectral signal associated with episodic sediment plumes in adjacent water bodies following TE. We characterized and extracted this episodic turbidity signal within lakes during the snow-free period (June 15-October 1) for 1986-2016 (continuous data limited to 1999-2016), using the cloud-based geospatial parallel processing platform, Google Earth Engine (TM). Thermoerosional detection accuracy was calculated using seven consecutive years of sub-meter high-resolution imagery (2009-2015) covering 798 (similar to 33%) of the 2456 lakes in the NOAT lowlands. Our automated TE detection algorithm had an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 86% and 0.47 +/- 0.043, indicating that episodic sediment pulses had a \"moderate agreement\" with landscape deformation associated with permafrost degradation. We estimate that lake shoreline erosion, thaw slumps, catastrophic lake drainage, and gully formation accounted for 62, 23, 13, and 2%, respectively, of active TE across the NOAT lowlands. TE was identified in similar to 5% of all lakes annually in the lowlands between 1999 and 2016, with a wide range of inter-annual variation (ranging from 0.2% in 2001 to 22% in 2004). Inter-annual variability in TE occurrence and spatial patterns of TE probability were correlated with annual snow cover duration and snow persistence, respectively, suggesting that earlier snowmelt accelerates permafrost degradation (e.g. TE) in this region.

We used annual and seasonal spectral-temporal metrics and environmental features to map 12 land cover and land use classes across Europe. The spectral-temporal metrics provided an efficient means to capture seasonal variations of land surface spectra and to reduce the impact of clouds and cloud-shadows by relaxing the otherwise strong cloud cover limitations imposed by image-based classification methods. The best classification model was based on Landsat-8 data from three years (2014-2016) and achieved an accuracy of 75.1%, nearly 2 percentage points higher than the classification model based on a single year of Landsat data (2015). Our results indicate that annual pan-European land cover maps are feasible, but that temporally dynamic classes like artificial land, cropland, and grassland still benefit from more frequent satellite observations. The produced pan-European land cover map compared favorably to the existing CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) 2012 land cover dataset. The mapped country-wide area proportions strongly correlated with LUCAS-estimated area proportions (r = 0.98). Differences between mapped and LUCAS sample-based area estimates were highest for broadleaved forest (map area was 9% higher). Grassland and seasonal cropland areas were 7% higher than the LUCAS estimate, respectively. In comparison, the correlation between LUCAS and CORINE area proportions was weaker (r = 0.84) and varied strongly by country. CORINE substantially overestimated seasonal croplands by 63% and underestimated grassland proportions by 37%. Our study shows that combining current state-of-the-art remote sensing methods with the large LUCAS database improves pan-European land cover mapping.

Acacia mearnsii is considered a highly invasive species that is replacing native species and Eucalyptus spp. are known to consume high amounts of groundwater with suspected effects on native flora. Mapping the occurrence of these species in the Taita Hills, Kenya (part of the Eastern Arc Mountains Biodiversity Hotspot) is important as there is lack of knowledge on their occurrence and ecological impact in the area. Mapping methods that require a lot of fieldwork are impractical in areas like the Taita Hills, where the terrain is rugged and the infrastructure is poor. Our aim was hence to map the occurrence of these tree species in a 100 km(2) area using airborne imaging spectroscopy and laser scanning. We used a one class biased support vector machine (BSVM) classifier as it needs labeled training data only for the positive classes (A. mearnsii and Eucalyptus spp.), which potentially reduces the amount of required fieldwork. We also introduce a new approach for parameterizing and setting the threshold level simultaneously for the BSVM classifier. The second aim was to link the occurrence of these species to selected environmental variables. The results showed that the BSVM classifier is suitable for mapping Acacia mearnsii and Eucalyptus spp., holding the potential to improve the efficiency of field data collection. The introduced parametrization/threshold selection method performed better than other commonly used approaches. The crown level Fl-score was 0.76 for Eucalyptus spp. and 0.78 for A. mearnsii. We show that Eucalyptus spp. and A. mearnsii trees cover 0.8% and 1.6% of the study area, respectively. Both species are particularly located on steeper slopes and higher altitudes. Both species have significant occurrences in areas close to the biggest remaining native forest patch (Ngangao) in the study area.

The integration of accurate forward models in both regions can play an important role in supporting these fusion approaches. Because of the different imaging mechanisms used in optical and microwave wavelength domains, the forward models in the two domains have been generally developed separately based on the different specifications of the scene. The inconsistencies between optical and microwave models, such as confusing input/output parameter definitions, different scattering theories and discrepant model complexity, make the data fusion difficult to conduct and lead to different results in terms of accuracy and computer time. Therefore, it is of great interest to develop a unified three-dimensional (3D) model using one scattering theory, identical input and similar complexity. To our knowledge, there are very few 3D models that can accomplish this task. By extending the Radiosity Applicable to Porous IndiviDual Objects (RAPID) model for the optical region, a general radiosity model (RAPID2) was proposed in this paper for the microwave region. This is the first time radiosity theory has been applied in microwave remote sensing, which invents a new way to solve the radar multiple scattering more efficiently. RAPID2 has four new functions: projecting translucent objects, tracking specular scattering, separating polarization components and imaging radar signals. The relationship between the radar cross section (RCS) and the bi-directional reflectance factor (BRF) is bridged. The modified Stokes vector and Mueller matrix are integrated into radiosity formulas to unify the scattering process between the optical and microwave regions. RAPID2 can simulate double-bouncing and multiple scattering effects over vegetated 3D scenes containing topography. The simulated radar images can well reflect the distinct radar geometric features, including layover, foreshortening and shadows. Validation over two forest sites shows good agreement with AIRSAR backscattering data (errors < 3.4 dB). The demonstrated results show the importance of the incident azimuth angle (variation up to 2 dB), slope (variation up to 5 dB), and multiple scattering effects (contribution up to 2 dB), which should be considered in forest parameter inversion.', '[Huang, Huaguo] Beijing Forestry Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Silviculture & Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.

Thus, a remote sensing algorithm to identify diatoms has great potential to describe ecological and biogeochemical trends and fluctuations in the surface ocean. Despite the importance of detecting diatoms from remote sensing and the demand for reliable methods of diatom identification, there has not been a systematic evaluation of algorithms that are being applied to this end. The efficacy of these models remains difficult to constrain in part due to limited datasets for validation. In this study, we test a bio-optical algorithm developed by Sathyendranath et al. (2004) to identify diatom dominance from the relationship between ratios of remote sensing reflectance and chlorophyll concentration. We evaluate and refine the original model with data collected at the Martha\'s Vineyard Coastal Observatory (MVCO), a near-shore location on the New England shelf. We then validated the refined model with data collected in Harpswell Sound, Maine, a site with greater optical complexity than MVCO. At both sites, despite relatively large changes in diatom fraction (0.8-82% of chlorophyll concentration), the magnitude of variability in optical properties due to the dominance or non-dominance of diatoms is less than the variability induced by other absorbing and scattering constituents of the water. While the original model performance was improved through successive re-parameterizations and re-formulations of the absorption and backscattering coefficients, we show that even a model originally parameterized for the Northwest Atlantic and re-parameterized for sites such as MVCO and Harpswell Sound performs poorly in discriminating diatom-dominance from optical properties.', '[Kramer, Sasha J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Interdept Grad Program Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.

Extraction of a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) using LiDAR data is a challenging topic, especially in steep and complex terrains with forest canopy. This paper presents some approaches for ground filtering and interpolating the point cloud to generate DTM in forested terrains. Interpolating the points in dense forests that have high attitude variation is very difficult and make the popular interpolation methods unsatisfactory. This paper proposed a modified Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO) method for finding the optimized coefficients of the polynomial interpolation method. This method had a good performance with 0.210 mm RMSE value in the forested terrains. The interpolated point cloud was used as the input of the proposed ground filtering method for detecting the non-ground pixels. The proposed ground filtering method was structured with two main sections including, iterative geodesic morphology and scan labeling. In the iterative geodesic morphology, some geometric and structural parameters were introduced to investigate the quality of extracted points in each iteration. The scan labeling searched the data pixel by pixel in four directions and labeled the pixels with the high slope value in all directions. The non-ground pixels were obtained by integrating the result of iterative geodesic and scan labeling. Assessment of the ground filtering results using the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) showed 3.92% total error compared to the other reported algorithms. This demonstrated the ability of the proposed approach in recognition of the non-ground pixels. The extracted pixels were removed and the DTM was generated by filling the gaps using the proposed IWO and polynomial interpolation. Some forested regions with various characteristics such as sparse and dense trees on the hills and steep slopes were utilized to evaluate the accuracy of the generated DTM. The computed RMSE in the test areas was 0.463 m, on average, which was acceptable for the complex and forested terrains.', '[Bigdeli, Behnaz] Shahrood Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Shahrood, Iran.

To identify crop growth conditions and hence improve food security, accurate assessment of local crop production is key. However, production estimates in heterogeneous smallholder farming systems often rely on labor-intensive surveys that are not easily scalable, nor exhaustive. Recent advances in high-resolution earth observation (EO) open up new possibilities to work in heterogeneous smallholder systems. This paper develops a method to estimate individual crop production at farm-to-community scales using high-resolution Sentinel-2 time series and ground data in the commune of Koningue, Mali. Our estimation of agricultural production relies on (i) a supervised, pixel-based crop type classification inside an existing cropland mask, (ii) a comparison of yield estimators based on spectral indices and derived leaf area index (LAI), and (iii) a Monte Carlo approach combining the resulting unbiased crop area estimate and the uncertainty on the associated yield estimate. Results show that crop types can be mapped from Sentinel-2 data with 80% overall accuracy (OA), with best performances observed for cotton (Fscore 94%), maize (88%) and millet (83%), while peanut (71%) and sorghum (46%) achieve less. Incorporation of parcel limits extracted from very high-resolution imagery is shown to increase OA to 85%. Obtained through inverse radiative transfer modeling, Sen2-Agri estimates of LAI achieve better prediction of final grain yield than various vegetation indices, reaching R-2 of 0.68, 0.62, 0.8 and 0.48 for cotton, maize, millet and sorghum respectively.

To address this issue, a RS-based two-leaf Jarvis-type G(c) model, RST-G(c), was optimized and validated for C-3 and C-4 crops using 19 crop flux sites across Europe, North America, and China. RST-G(c) included restrictive functions for air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and soil water deficit, and it used satellite-retrieved NDVI to formulate the temporal variation of g(smax) defined at a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 2000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (g(sm, 2000)). Results showed that the parameters of RST-G(c) differed between C-3 and C-4 crops. RST-G(c) successfully simulated variations in Penman-Monteith (PM)-derived daytime G(c) with R-2 = 0.57 for both C-3 and C-4 crops. RST-G(c) was incorporated into a revised evapotranspiration (ET) model and a new gross primary productivity (GPP) model. The two models were validated at 19 crop flux sites. Daily mean inputs were generally incorporated into a PM approach to model daily transpiration. This is inappropriate because available energy and stomatal conductance vary significantly on a diurnal basis, with both non-linearly regulating transpiration rate. The PM approach with daily mean inputs produced unreasonable transpiration rate estimates. Efforts were made in the revised ET model (denoted as RS-WBPM2), which was modified from the water balance based RS-PM (RS-WBPM) model of Bai et al. (2017), to address this issue by calculating transpiration using daytime inputs. The photosynthesis-based stomatal conductance model, developed by Ball et al. (1987a) and improved by Leuning (1995) (BBL model), was inverted to calculate GPP using canopy conductance; the inverted model was denoted as IBBL. Cross validation showed good agreement between flux tower measurements and modeled ET (R-2 = 0.79, RMSE (root mean standard error) = 20.66 W m(-2) for daily ET and R-2 = 0.87, RMSE = 15.32 W m(-2) for 16-day ET) and GPP (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 2.49 gC m(-2) d(-1) for daily GPP and R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 1.96 gC m(-2) d(-1) for 16-day GPP) for the two models. Within-site validations demonstrated the successful performance of the two models at 18 sites (albeit with one outlier). Inter-site variations in ET and GPP were also successfully reproduced by the models. NDVI-derived g(sm, 2000) outperformed the fixed g(sm, 2000) in both ET and GPP estimates.

The Landsat and Sentinel series, as well other satellites are currently covering significant parts of this observational trade space. It can be expected that growing demands and budget constraints will require new capabilities in orbit that can address as many observables as possible with a single instrument. Recent optical performance improvements of imaging spectrometers make them true alternatives to traditional multispectral imagers. However, they are much more adaptable to a wide range of Earth observation needs due to the combination of continuous high spectral sampling with spatial sampling consistent with previous sensors (e.g., Landsat). Unfortunately, there is a knowledge gap in demonstrating that imaging spectroscopy data can substitute for multi-spectral data while sustaining the long-term record. Thus, the objective of this analysis is to test the hypothesis that imaging spectroscopy data compare radiometrically with multi-spectral data to within 5%. Using a coincident Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) flight with over-passing Operational Land Imager (OLI) data on Landsat 8, we document a procedure for simulating OLI multi-spectral bands from AVIRIS data, evaluate influencing factors on the observed radiance, and assess the difference in top-of-atmosphere radiance as compared to OLI. The procedure for simulating OLI data include spectral convolution, accounting for the minimal atmospheric effects between the two sensors, and spatial resampling. The remaining differences between the simulated and the real OLI data result mainly from differences in sensor calibration, surface bi-directional reflectance, and spatial sampling. The median relative radiometric difference for each band ranges from - 8.3% to 0.6%. After bias-correction to minimize potential calibration discrepancies, we find no more than a 1.2% relative difference. This analysis therefore successfully demonstrates that imaging spectrometer data can contribute to Landsat-type or other multi-spectral data records. It also shows that cross-calibration from a spectrometer to a radiometer can be easily performed as a result of the imaging spectrometer high spectral sampling and its ability to recreate multi-spectral response functions.', '[Seidel, Felix C.; Stavros, E.

In previous work, spaceborne single-pass InSAR phase-center height has been shown to have the capability of accurately monitoring the subtle height change due to forest growth and degradation (with meter or even sub-meter level RMSE about the regression curve fit to time). In this paper, a new approach using spaceborne SAR interferometry has been developed to detect and quantify selective logging events. In particular, a quantitative indicator of forest disturbance is first defined, namely disturbance index (DI; from 0 \"no disturbance\" to 1 \"deforestation\"). A numerical field data-based InSAR simulation is then performed to study the functional relationship between the field-measured DI and InSAR relative phase-center height change from a modeled perspective. A selective logging event (October 2015 through January 2016) over the Tapajos National Forest in Brazil is used for experimental validation. The InSAR-inverted DI estimates derived from DLR\'s TanDEM-X time-series data were compared with those measured from a field work over 32 quarter hectare stands at Tapajos with relative RMSE of 30% for DI up to 0.3 and the disturbance epoch can be determined with an average accuracy of 13 days (constrained by the satellite repeat interval usually on the order of 2 weeks). As a comparison, the repeat-pass InSAR coherences from the concurrent JAXA\'s ALOS-2 data are shown to qualitatively correspond to the TanDEM-X results, confirming both the location and the epoch of the disturbance event. This new method is anticipated to contribute to the range of tools being developed for large-scale forest disturbance assessment and monitoring (for UN\'s REDD + programme) through using spaceborne single-pass InSAR missions (e.g., DLR\'s TanDEM-X and in the future, TanDEM-L).', '[Lei, Yang; Treuhaft, Robert; Keller, Michael] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.

In this study, a practical and effective method is proposed to derive high-accuracy AIRS LSE data and continuous emissivity spectra in the TIR range of 8-14.5 mu m. The AIRS LSE is first rescaled to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LSE using cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching, and then the emissivity spectra are recovered from the rescaled AIRS LSE using principal component analysis (PCA) regression. The results show that resealing the AIRS LSE significantly reduced the bias and root mean square (RMS) error in the study area of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and PCA regression successfully recovered the emissivity spectra in the 8-14.5 mu m range from the resealed AIRS LSE. At two validation sites in the Namib and Kalahari deserts of southern Africa, the biases of the resealed AIRS LSE at three hinge points are 0.62% and 0.61%, respectively, and the biases of the recovered AIRS LSE spectra in the 8-12 mu m TIR range are 0.53% and 0.56%, respectively.

We assemble a sample of isolated light sources around the globe and discover that blurring is governed by a symmetric Gaussian point-spread function (PSF), but that the brightness of sources widens the PSF. To make sense of this, we recreate step-by-step the satellite\'s data collection and storage process, and discover an important fact: any pixel containing a light source will tend to be lit at least as often as its neighbors. This regularity provides a second filter on the data that allows us to calibrate the dimensions of the PSF to each part of the globe, each satellite, and each year.

The airborne portion of this field experiment was based out of St. John\'s airport, Newfoundland, Canada with the focus of this paper being on the deployment in May June 2016. RSP was onboard the NASA C-130 aircraft together with an array of in situ and other remote sensing instrumentation. The RSP is an along-track scanner measuring the polarized and total reflectance in 9 spectral channels. Its uniquely high angular resolution allows for characterization of liquid water droplet sizes using the rainbow structure observed in the polarized reflectance over the scattering angle range from 135 to 165. The rainbow is dominated by single scattering of light by cloud droplets, so its structure is characteristic specifically of the droplet sizes at cloud top (within unit optical depth into the cloud, equivalent to approximately 50 m). A parametric fitting algorithm applied to the polarized reflectance provides retrievals of the droplet effective radius and variance assuming a prescribed size distribution shape (gamma distribution). In addition to this, we use a non parametric method, the Rainbow Fourier Transform (RFT), which allows us to retrieve the droplet size distribution itself. The latter is important in the case of clouds with complex microphysical structure, or multiple layers of cloud, which result in multi-modal DSDs. During NAAMES the aircraft performed a number of flight patterns specifically designed for comparisons between remote sensing retrievals and in situ measurements. These patterns consisted of two flight segments above the same straight ground track. One of these segments was flown above clouds allowing for remote sensing measurements, while the other was near the cloud top where cloud droplets were sampled. We compare the DSDs retrieved from the RSP data with in situ measurements made by the Cloud Droplet Probe (CDP). The comparisons generally show good agreement (better than 1 pm for effective radius and in most cases better than 0.02 for effective variance) with deviations explainable by the position of the aircraft within the cloud, or by the presence of additional cloud layers between the cloud being sampled by the in situ instrumentation and the altitude of the remote sensing segment. In the latter case, the multi-modal DSDs retrieved from the RSP data were consistent with the multi-layer cloud structures observed in the correlative High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) profiles. The results of these comparisons provide a rare validation of polarimetric droplet size retrieval techniques, demonstrating their accuracy and robustness and the potential of satellite data of this kind on a global scale.', '[Alexandrov, Mikhail D.] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, 2880 Broadway, New York, NY 10025 USA.

However, because of non-volume decorrelation and other unavoidable errors, the robustness of retrieval heights is sensitive to the spatial baseline of the selected InSAR pairs, which relates forest parameters to measured coherence. Within the context of the random volume over ground (RVoO) model and the three-stage inversion method, we aimed to quantify the influence of spatial baseline on the inversions at P-band, which are distinct from the inversions at higher frequency due to the non-negligible ground contributions. This information assists in optimal baseline selection and the development of robust inversion schemes. Assumptions about the extinction coefficient and additional DTM or DEM were used to reduce the influence of ground contribution on CHM and DTM inversion, respectively. Inversions from published airborne repeat-pass P-band PoIInSAR data with four different spatial baselines were validated against LiDAR-derived DTM and CHM data. The results show that a longer spatial baseline performed better in DTM inversion. The longest baseline produced the best R-2 of 0.995 and RMSE of 0.555 m, much better than the smallest baseline with an R-2 of 0.794 and RMSE of 174 m. A threshold height could be identified that determines the overestimation and underestimation of CHM inversion due to the non volume decorrelation. Different baselines produced different threshold heights, making CHM inversion only accurate for a limited range of forest height around the threshold. The optimal baseline produced a CHM with R-2 of 0.605 and RMSE of 2.67 m. Additionally, we found that using multiple baselines has the potential to improve CHM inversion, improving the R-2 to 0.827 and RMSE to 0.876 m in our study.', '[Liao, Zhanmang; He, Binbin; Quan, Xingwen] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Resources & Environm, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.

To date, there have been many studies of glacier mass balance across the QTP. However, given that most of the previous studies have focused on a short observation period (2000-2015), and that long-term mass change measurements are available only for some local regions, we utilized declassified KH-9 images and 1 arc-second Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation models (DEMs) to provide the region-wide mass balance (from the mid-1970s to 2000) for a larger scale (including 11 sample regions) across the QTP and its surroundings. The final results indicate that the glaciers in the northwest of the QTP have shown a less negative or near-zero mass balance, ranging from-0.11 +/- 0.13 m w.e. a(-1) to 0.02 +/- 0.10 m w.e. a(-1), compared to those in the southeast part, with a mass balance range of-0.30 +/- 0.12 m w.e. a(-1) to-0.11 +/- 0.14 m w.e. a(-1). The most serious mass loss has emerged in the central eastern Himalaya. Integrating our results with the observations after 2000 suggests that, over the past four decades (mid-1970s to the mid-2010s), the glaciers in the Himalaya, Nyaingentanglha, and Tanggula mountains, as a whole, have exhibited accelerated mass loss, and the most significant acceleration has occurred in the eastern Nyaincientanglha. Moreover, the Hindu Raj glaciers have shown a stable rate of continuous mass loss, while a nearly stable or slight mass gain state in the western Kunlun region can be dated back to at least as far as the mid-1970s.', '[Zhou, Yushan; Li, Zhiwei; Li, Jia; Zhao, Rong] Cent S Univ, Sch Geosci & Infophys, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China.

Our main objective is to analyse the link between spatial and temporal variability of surface water temperature and algal concentration in a large lake by means of remote sensing and hydrodynamic modelling. We compare ten years of satellite images showing chlorophyll concentrations and surface water temperature of Lake Geneva. Our observations suggest different correlations depending on the season. Elevated chlorophyll concentrations in spring are correlated with warmer zones. But, in summer, higher chlorophyll concentrations are observed in colder zones. We show with a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model that the spatial variability of the surface water temperature reflects the upwelling and downwelling zones resulting from wind forcing. In springtime, nearshore downwellings induce locally increased surface temperature and stratification, which are associated with high chlorophyll concentration. In summertime, colder surface temperature area, often interpreted as transient upwellings, represents the thermal surface signature of wind-induced basin-scale internal waves, bringing either nutrients or phytoplankton from deeper layers to the surface. Our study suggests the latter to be the dominant process, with the basin-scale internal wave activity and associated transient summertime upwellings and downwellings having little net effects on the algal concentration.

To better investigate the calving process, a high accurate surface Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with accurate date marker over MG is urgently required for numerical modeling, especially over the ice tongue. However it is quite challenging to generate an accurate DEM over high relief and steep slope regions. To solve this problem, a new method for accurate coastal DEM production by merging ASTER GDEM and ICESat/GLAS data is designed, which can effectively discriminate accurate elevation data from ASTER GDEM. Then, a DEM corresponding to the end of 2002 over MG is generated, which has an accuracy of 0.99 +/- 17.50 m. This DEM is several times better in accuracy than the original ASTER GDEM (accuracy: -8.17 +/- 54.31 m) and two new characteristics of ASTER GDEM have been found through analysis. First, ASTER GDEM has elevation bias (varying from 23 m to 28 m), spatially correlated to ASTER ground tracks, which was most probably caused by uncertainty of attitude measurements of ASTER. Second, ASTER GDEM grids with stacking number >= 4 can be effectively adjusted by ground control points so as to improve elevation accuracy. Additionally, this DEM has the best accuracy by comparing with other DEMs (RAMP DEM: 47.71 +/- 91.61 m, ICESat/GLAS DEM: -1.01 +/- 30.33, Bamber DEM: -1.07 +/- 33.04 m, Bedmap-2 DEM: 9.19 +/- 48.34 m, and Cryosat-2 DEM: -5.42 +/- 32.02 m).

Remote sensing is a promising tool for exposure assessment, but its utility for health studies is limited because most products measure pollutants in the total column of the atmosphere, and not the surface concentrations most relevant to population health. Information about the vertical distribution of smoke is vital for addressing this limitation. The CALIPSO satellite can provide such information but it cannot cover all smoke events due to its narrow ground track. In this study, we developed a random forests model to predict the minimum height of the smoke layer observed by CALIPSO at high temporal and spatial resolution, using information about fire activity in the vicinity, geographic location, and meteorological conditions. These pieces of information are typically available in near-real-time, ensuring that the resulting model can be easily operationalized. A total of 15,617 CALIPSO data blocks were identified as impacted by smoke within the province of British Columbia, Canada from 2006 to 2015, and 52.1% had smoke within the boundary layer, where the population might be exposed. The final model explained 82.1% of the variance in the observations with a root mean squared error of 560 m. The most important variables in the model were wind patterns, the month of smoke observation, and fire intensity within 500 km. Predictions from this model can be 1) directly applied to smoke detection from the existing remote sensing products to provide another dimension of information; 2) incorporated into statistical smoke models with inputs from remote sensing products; or 3) used to inform estimates of vertical dispersion in deterministic smoke models. These potential applications are expected to improve the assessment of ground-level population exposure to forest fire smoke.', '[Yao, Jiayun; Brauer, Michael; Henderson, Sarah B.] Univ British Columbia, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, 2206 East Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.

Drawing upon a large network of stations (the Reseau Hydrique) measuring LFMC for operational fire danger assessment in the south-eastern region of France, this study assesses the ability of several long-term passive microwave remote sensing indices to capture the LFMC temporal dynamic of various Mediterranean shrub species. Microwave remote sensing has a high potential for monitoring LFMC independently of several constraints (e.g., atmospheric and cloud contamination effects) associated with optical-infrared and thermal remote sensing observations. The following four microwave-derived indices are considered: (1) the Essential Climate Variable near-surface soil moisture (ECV_SM); (2) the root-zone soil moisture (ECV_RZSM) derived from ECV_SM; (3) the microwave polarization difference index (MPDI) computed from five microwave frequencies (C, X, Ku, K and Ka-band corresponding to 6.9, 10.7, 18.7, 23.8 and 36.5 GHz respectively); and (4) the vegetation optical depth (VOD) at C- and X-band (from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth observing system, AMSR-E). Firstly, an evaluation of the root-zone soil moisture ECV_RZSM against a network of soil moisture measurements (SMOSMANIA in southern France) gave satisfactory results. For most of the Reseau Hydrique sites, the present study found good agreement between LFMC and individual microwave indices, including root-zone soil moisture, VOD at X-band, and MPDI at X and Ku-bands, all averaged over the 15 days preceding the in-situ LFMC measurements. VOD at X-band showed the best agreement with the in situ LFMC data (median of correlation coefficients over all in situ sites = 0.43). Further comparisons between LFMC data and several optical indices computed from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), visible atmospheric resistant index (VARI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), normalized difference infrared index 6 (NDII6), normalized difference infrared index 7 (NDII7) and global vegetation moisture index (GVMI) were made. The comparisons showed that VARI and SAVI, as optical greenness indices, outperform the microwave indices and other optical indices with median of correlation coefficients of 0.66 and 0.65, respectively. Overall, this study shows that passive microwave indices, particularly VOD, are efficient proxies for LFMC of Mediterranean shrub species and could be used along with optical indices to evaluate fire risks in the Mediterranean region.', '[Fan, Lei; Xiao, Qing; Wen, Jianguang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

The increasing spatial and temporal resolution of globally available satellite images, such as those provided by Sentinel-2, creates new possibilities for generating accurate datasets on available crop types, in ready-to-use vector data format. Existing solutions dedicated to cropland mapping, based on high resolution remote sensing data, are mainly focused on pixel-based analysis of time series data. This paper evaluates how a time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) method that uses Sentinel-2 time series performs when applied to pixel-based and object-based classifications of various crop types in three different study areas (in Romania, Italy and the USA). The classification outputs were compared to those produced by Random Forest (RF) for both pixel- and object-based image analysis units. The sensitivity of these two methods to the training samples was also evaluated. Object-based TWDTW outperformed pixel-based TWDTW in all three study areas, with overall accuracies ranging between 78.05% and 96.19%; it also proved to be more efficient in terms of computational time. TWDTW achieved comparable classification results to RF in Romania and Italy, but RF achieved better results in the USA, where the classified crops present high intra-class spectral variability. Additionally, TWDTW proved to be less sensitive in relation to the training samples. This is an important asset in areas where inputs for training samples are limited.', '[Belgiu, Mariana] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.

Surface radiance measure at sensor from airborne instruments, such as the AisaDUAL and HyMap sensors, show an apparent noise and shift that limit the information content and even impair the collected data (after removing the atmospheric attenuation). The drift from actual radiance is contributed by various sources; e.g., atmospheric gases and aerosols, and sensor stability. Yet one of the major contributors to it during nadir scanning is the directional effect of target reflectance at variable illumination geometry, also known as Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). The SVC method, which is based on ground dark nets of varying densities, was able to correct for the above factors and recalibrate the sensor\'s radiance during data acquisition. The main assumption of the SVC method is that the net targets are a Lambertian surface. In this paper, the BRDF measurements of the SVC net targets were carried out using a goniometer and controlled laboratory conditions. These measurements revealed anisotropic properties of the nets targets, which were further introduced to the radiometric calibration process are significant, especially with the high density nets ( > 50% black net cover). The paper presents a look-up-table of the BRDF correction coefficient factors for each net target (identified and separated by its density and mixing level once placed over a bright background) at various zenith (from 10 to 30) and azimuth (from 0 degrees to 360 at intervals of 10) angles. The coefficients were calculated for the near infrared spectral region (at 981 nm), and should be applied to the full-reflected spectral range across visible, near and shortwave-infrared wavelengths (400-2500 nm). The acquired results in this empirical study showed that the SVC calibration nets targets are characterized by incoherent BRDF effect. The darker and denser calibration targets absorb the down welling radiance, and thus, reduce the amount of intermediate multiple scattering, normally accrued in all other (less dense) examined targets. The impact of target density on the BRDF correction coefficient and its dependence with illumination zenith and azimuth angles is studied and presented. The correction coefficient factors obtained in the laboratory were implemented in two real airborne hyperspectral campaigns of two different sensors: AisaDUAL and HyMAP over the same calibration site. The proposed BRDF SVC net corrections enables fine-tuning of the vicarious calibration procedure, while increasing the quality of the radiometric data. Thus, it is recommended to use the BRDF coefficients obtained in this paper for any airborne hyperspectral sensor that uses the SVC method in order to achieve better calibration accuracy.', '[Brook, Anna; Polinova, Maria] Univ Haifa, Dept Social Sci, Ctr Spatial Anal Res UHCSISR, Spect & Remote Sensing Lab, IL-3498838 Har Hakarmel, Israel.

Ground cover is widely recognised as an important factor for controlling soil erosion by wind and water. Consequently, maintaining ground cover (e.g., vegetation, crop canopy, crop residue) is a recommended management practice which is widely adopted by farmers and land owners. Wind erosion is a lateral or horizontal process and the amount of ground cover needed to maintain lateral cover (L-c = nbh/S where n roughness elements occupy ground area S and have b and h mean breadth and height, respectively) is not well established. Soil may be removed from beneath or between crop and natural vegetation canopies depending on the width, height and distribution of cover types relative to wind direction and strength. Monitoring by repeated measurement or estimation of ground cover provides information to develop an understanding of its spatial and temporal variation. Fractional cover (f(c)) retrieved from optical satellite remote sensing (e.g., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer; MODIS) provides a consistent and repeatable measure of ground cover when viewed from above. Therefore, f(c) provides an areal assessment of components of ground cover. Fractional cover is consequently not the most appropriate approximation of the protection of the soil from wind erosion. Extant wind erosion model parameterisations of L-c already benefit from the use of satellite-derived cover data (L-fc). However, the parameterisations are not well developed. Here, we address the need for a dynamic (multi temporal), moderate resolution and global metric for wind erosion assessment and modelling. We demonstrate the benefits of using L-c within the context of monitoring ground cover for the assessment of wind erosion and review the basis for estimating ground cover using L-c. We describe a new method for an albedo-based approximation of aerodynamic sheltering (L-omega). We use ray-casting of rough surfaces from an existing wind tunnel study to establish a relation between measured L, and directional hemispherical reflectance omega(dir)(0(center dot), lambda), the so-called \'black-sky albedo\' and its inverse to estimate shadow. The relation is confirmed to be dependent on the solar zenith angle (theta) and spectral (lambda) confounding factors (e.g., soil moisture, soil mineralogy). We reduced the A. dependency of omega(dir)(0(center dot), lambda) by normalising with the MODIS (MCD43A1) BRDF parameter A to estimate albedo-based lateral cover (L-omega) globally over space (500 m pixels) and time (every 8 days). We compared L-omega with f(c) and L-fc over time for selected locations in Australia and examined L-omega across Australia and the USA using national biogeographic regions. Consistent with current approaches to estimating L-c our results were not field validated due to the dearth of ground-based measurements. However, our results demonstrate that L-omega will improve wind erosion models particularly over large areas and L-omega, is likely to be a valuable source of decision-support information to guide policy makers and land managers on where, when and how to reduce wind erosion.', '[Chappell, Adrian; Guerschman, Juan Pablo] Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff CF10 3XQ, S Glam, Wales.

While uncertainties in climate models and observational references have been assessed thoroughly, it has remained difficult to integrate these, partly because of the lack of formal concepts on how to consider observational uncertainties in model-observation comparison. One of the difficulties dealing with observational uncertainty is its propagation to the space-time scales represented by the models. This is a challenge due to the correlation of observational errors in space and time. Here we present an approximation which allows to derive propagation factors to different model scales and apply these to uncertainty estimates provided by the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) sea-surface temperature (SST) data set. The propagated uncertainty in SST observations is found to systematically lower seasonal forecast skill and to increase the uncertainty in verification of seasonal forecasts, an aspect that remains currently overlooked. Uncertainty in forecast quality assessment is dominated by the shortness of the satellite record. Expanding the record length of these data sets might hence reduce the verification uncertainties more than the efforts to reduce the observational uncertainties. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

By exploiting six stacks of medium resolution ERS-1/2 SAR images acquired between 1992 and 2000 over four regions of interest in the UK, this paper demonstrates the performance of the recently developed processing method Intermittent SBAS (ISBAS). This approach builds upon the conventional low-resolution SEAS method and, by relaxing the approach to selecting image pixels to process and accounting for the intermittent nature of non-urban targets, is capable to extend the coverage of motion results across the full range of land cover types, even those typically unfavourable for InSAR. On average, the new ISBAS implementation provides 4 to 26 times more coverage than SBAS for the processed regions, with the spatial coverage of ground motion solutions increasing from only 4-12% land pixels with SBAS, to 39-99% with ISBAS. Despite relying only on temporal subsets of the networks of small baseline interferograms, intermittently coherent pixels show velocity standard errors of 0.8-1.4 mm/year on average, hence retain sub-millimetre to millimetre precision. The empirical relationships between intermittent coherence and standard errors in the estimated ground motion velocity are computed for each of the six datasets, and confirm that errors are controlled by the number of independent observations used for each image pixel to extract the ISBAS solution. In particular, velocity standard errors epsilon(vel) for the intermittently coherent pixels are inversely proportional to the square root of the number of best coherence interferograms used, n(i), and can be modelled as epsilon(vel) = 11 / root n(i) mm/year on average for the six datasets. The established empirical relationship also allows informed decisions on the ISBAS threshold for n(i) to be made. This is achieved by setting the maximum acceptable error in the velocity estimate epsilon(MAX), and then computing the corresponding minimum n(i) to accept an intermittently coherent pixel that will guarantee the desired precision. In the present era of \'big SAR data\' and their derived \'big InSAR data\', we discuss perspectives on the use of huge datasets of thousands or even millions of ground deformation time series - such as those produced using ISBAS, with a particular focus on the veracity of big data and the need for a quality assessment check-point in the \'big InSAR data\' cycle.

This study expands on this methodology by applying a \'multiple-point-to-pixel\' method and examination of spatial autocorrelation (here using semivariogram analysis) by using in situ observations, high-resolution World View-2 (WV-2) surface reflectances, and MODIS Collection V006 daily blue-sky albedo over a spatially heterogeneous surfaces in the lower ablation zone in southwest Greenland. Our results using 232 ground based samples within two MODIS pixels, one being more spatial heterogeneous than the other, show little difference in accuracy among narrow and broad band albedos (except for Band 2). Within the more homogenous pixel area, in situ and MODIS albedos were very close (error varied from -4% to +7%) and within the range of ASD standard errors. The semivariogram analysis revealed that the minimum observational footprint needed for a spatially representative sample is 30 m. In contrast, over the more spatially heterogeneous surface pixel, a minimum footprint size was not quantifiable due to spatial autocorrelation, and far exceeds the effective resolution of the MODIS retrievals. Over the high spatial heterogeneity surface pixel, MODIS is lower than ground measurements by 4-7%, partly due to a known in situ undersampling of darker surfaces that often are impassable by foot (e.g., meltwater features and shadowing effects over crevasses). Despite the sampling issue, our analysis errors are very close to the stated general accuracy of the MODIS product of 5%. Thus, our study suggests that the MODIS albedo product performs well in a very heterogeneous, low-albedo, area of the ice sheet ablation zone. Furthermore, we demonstrate that single \'point-to-pixel\' methods alone are insufficient in characterizing and validating the variation of surface albedo displayed in the lower ablation area. This is true because the distribution of in situ data deviations from MODIS albedo show a substantial range, with the average values for the 10th and 90th percentiles being -0.30 and 0.43 across all bands. Thus, if only single point is taken for ground validation, and is randomly selected from either distribution tails, the error would appear to be considerable. Given the need for multiple in-situ points, concurrent albedo measurements derived from existing AWSs, (low-flying vehicles (airborne or unmanned) and high-resolution imagery (WV-2)) are needed to resolve high sub-pixel variability in the ablation zone, and thus, further improve our characterization of Greenland\'s surface albedo.

Large mammals are especially affected because they require large tracts of intact habitat and functioning corridors between core habitat areas. Accurate land-cover data is critical to identify core habitat areas and corridors, and medium resolution sensors such as Landsat 8 provide opportunities to map land cover for conservation planning. Here, we used all available Landsat 8 imagery from launch through December 2014 to identify large mammal corridors and assess their quality across the Caucasus Mountains (>700,000 km(2)). Specifically, we tested the usefulness of seasonal image composites (spring, summer, fall, and winter) and a range of image metrics (e.g., mean and median reflectance across all clear observations) to map nine land-cover classes with a Random Forest classifier. Using image composites from all four seasons yielded markedly higher overall accuracy than using single-season composites (8% increase) and the inclusion of image metrics further improved the classification significantly. Our final land-cover map had an overall accuracy of 85%. Using our land-cover map, we parameterized connectivity models for three generic large mammal groups and identified wildlife corridors and bottlenecks within corridors with cost-distance modeling and circuit theory. Corridors were numerous (in total, 85, 131, and 132 corridors for our three mammal groups, respectively), but often had bottlenecks or high average cost along the least-cost path, indicating limited functioning. Our findings highlight the potential of Landsat 8 composites to support connectivity analyses across large areas, and thus to contribute to conservation planning, and serve as an early warning system for biodiversity loss in areas where on-the-ground monitoring is challenging, such as in the Caucasus.

We analyzed water extent dynamics within wetland habitats at a globally important shorebird stopover site for a 1983-2015 Landsat time series, and evaluated the effect of climate on water extent. A range of methods can detect open water from imagery, including supervised classification approaches and thresholds for spectral bands and indices. Thresholds provide a time advantage; however, there is no universally superior index, nor single best threshold for all instances. We used random forest to model the presence or absence of water from >6200 reference pixels, and derived an optimal water probability threshold for our study area using receiver operating characteristic curves. An optimized mid-infrared (1.5-1.7 mu m) threshold identified open water in the Sacramento Valley of California at 30-m resolution with an average of 90% producer\'s accuracy, comparable to approaches that require more intensive user input. SLC-off Landsat 7 imagery was integrated by applying a customized interpolation that mapped water in missing data gaps with 99% user\'s accuracy. On average we detected open water on-26000 ha (similar to 3% of the study area) in early April at the peak of shorebird migration, while water extent increased five-fold after the migration rush. Over the last three decades, late March water extent declined by similar to 1300 ha per year, primarily due to changes in the extent and timing of agricultural flood-irrigation. Water within shorebird habitats was significantly associated with an index of water availability at the peak of migration. Our approach can be used to optimize thresholds for time series analysis and near-realtime mapping in other regions, and requires only marginally more time than generating a confusion matrix.

The Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) has been shown to exhibit superior performance to the sensors on Landsats 4-7 with respect to radiometric calibration, signal to noise, and geolocation. However, improvements to the positioning of the spectral response functions on the OLI have resulted in known biases for commonly used spectral indices because the new band responses integrate absorption features differently from previous Landsat sensors. The objective of this analysis is to quantify the impact of these changes on linear spectral mixture models that use imagery collected by different Landsat sensors. The 2013 underflight of Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 provides an opportunity to cross calibrate the spectral mixing spaces of the ETM+ and OLI sensors using near-simultaneous acquisitions of radiance measurements from a wide variety of land cover types worldwide. We use 80,910,343 pairs of OLI and ETM+ spectra to characterize the Landsat 8 OLI spectral mixing space and perform a cross-calibration with Landsat 7 ETM+. This new global collection of Landsat spectra spans a greater spectral diversity than those used in prior studies and the resulting Substrate, Vegetation, and Dark (SVD) spectral endmembers (EMs) supplant prior global Landsat EMs. We find only minor (-0.01 <mu < 0.01) differences between SVD fractions for coregistered pairs of spectra unmixed using the new sensor-specific endmembers identified in this analysis. Root mean square (RMS) misfit fractions are also shown to be small (< 98% of pixels with < 5% RMS), in accord with previous studies using standardized global endmembers. Finally, vegetation is used as an example to illustrate the empirical and theoretical relationship between commonly used spectral indices and subpixel fractions. We include the new global ETM+ and OLI EMs as Supplementary Materials. SVD fractions unmixed using global EMs thus provide easily computable, linearly scalable, physically based measures of subpixel land cover area which can be compared accurately across the entire Landsat 4-8 archive without introducing any additional cross-sensor corrections.

Vegetation covers are often described using Leaf Area Index (LAI) or Plant Area Index (PAI) for monitoring or modeling purposes. Characterizing vegetation 3D structure at fine scale is increasingly required, notably in order to be able to apply radiative transfer simulations at scales consistent with the spatial resolution of recent remote sensing sensors. To assess 3D PAI of a vegetation plot, this paper evaluates the potential of a voxelization method using Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) data, based on the Beer-Lambert transmittance computation law. The theoretical validation was performed using a simulation framework based on a radiative transfer model (DART). The framework allowed simulating TLS acquisition on a theoretical distribution of leaves and a realistic representation (single tree), for which all characteristics are well known. Hence, a sensitivity analysis was performed to study the influence of instrument parameters (i.e. single- or multi-echo, beam divergence), scanning configuration (scan angle step), vegetation characteristics (leaf size and density, leaf angle distribution), and voxel parameters (cubic versus spherical geometry, at different resolutions, with and without occlusion) on the estimation of PAI. For a theoretical distribution of leaves, results showed good accuracy of the voxelization method (R-2 = 0.91 and RMSE = 20% for a mean case, at voxel level) with a high resolution multi-echo TLS scan, cubic voxels over 0.5-m resolution, low inter-voxel occlusion, small leaves, and up to a surface density of 2 m(2).m(-3). Error increased with a larger scan angle resolution, single echo TLS systems, and vegetation density. Also, without clumping, error increased with smaller voxels or larger leaves. Best results were obtained with multi-echo TLS scans (angular resolution of 0.05), cubic voxels at 1-m resolution when occlusion is low (voxel sampling higher than 50% of maximum sampling at 15 m) and small leaves (e.g. 10 cm(2)), which provided very good agreement (RMSD = 7.6%, R-2 = 0.98, p = 0.99). On a realistic isolated tree, PAI was correctly assessed with cubic voxels at 0.25 m resolution. A method to merge voxelized scans was proposed to deal with inter-voxel occlusion effects.

Special attention is paid to steady woody areas. During the last decade, 0.31% of the land surface of France has been identified as being affected by a sudden albedo shift due to land cover changes (LCC). Excluding these sudden changes in land cover, we show a significant (decreasing) albedo trends over 3.5% of France (p-value < 0.01). In most cases (84%), trends were identified in non-vegetated and non-steady vegetated covers; however, gradual albedo trends were observed in steady woody covers in over 0.1% of the surface area of France. The majority (59.9%) of these woody covers were broadleaved tree covers; the remainder was divided between needle-leaved and mixed tree covers and shrub cover. On average, in the steady woody covers affected by gradual albedo trends, the visible albedo shift was 0.0088 between 2001 and 2013, i.e., a loss of 20.1-29.8% depending on the woody cover type. This decrease in albedo was supported by a significant gradual increase (p-value < 0.05) in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This increase in greenness appears to be linked to the under-use of woody areas in France, leading to denser forests. The impact of these gradual albedo trends on the radiative forcing (RF) was estimated and compared to the impact of LCCs. During the 21st century in France, the impact on the radiative forcing of steady woody covers could reach + 0.2 W.m(-2). This value is 2.5 times larger than IPCC estimates based on past vegetation changes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

For that purpose, six bio-optical algorithms already documented and based on different approaches have been tested over a large in situ data set collected at different seasons and locations along the Vietnamese coast. The 005 algorithm (Gohin, Druon, and Lampert, 2002) presents the best performances and has been selected to assess Chla in the studied region. The notion of optimal bio-optical environment associated with the best performance of 005 has been introduced. For suspended particulate matter concentration, SPM, lower than 100 g.m(-3), and colored dissolved organic matter, a(cdom)(443), lower than 0.5 m(-1), Chla is estimated with an uncertainty of 36% and a bias of 5%. A Chla climatology has been generated and the temporal patterns (seasonal variability, long term trend, and irregular component) have been described using the Census-X-11 time series decomposition method. Three-dimensional hydrodynamical numerical simulations have been used to analyze the spatio-temporal patterns of Chla. The seasonal contribution dominates the variance of the signal, in good relationship with the dynamic of the mixed layer depth as well as with the occurrence of a seasonal upwelling induced by the summer monsoon. The irregular variability of Chla which may reach up to 35% of the total variance in the central part of the Vietnamese coast, can be explained through the surface kinetic energy and its standard deviation which is associated with small scales processes. A long term monotonic trend from about 2 to > 5%.yr(-1) (that is 20 to >50% from 2002 to 2012) have been noticed in different coastal areas where aquaculture activities exhibit a concurrence increase, ranging from 31% to 113% (in production weight) over the same time period. In situ measurements, and especially of nutrients, are however necessary to confirm the link between aquaculture activities and phytoplankton biomass long term evolutions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The airborne lidar is used to link ground observations of AGB to space lidar measurements. Two sets of models are generated, the first relating ground estimates of AGB to airborne laser scanning (ALS) measurements and the second set relating ALS estimates of AGB (generated using the first model set) to GLAS measurements. GLAS then, is used as a sampling tool within a hybrid estimation framework to generate stratum-, state-, and national-level AGB estimates. A two-phase variance estimator is employed to quantify GLAS sampling variability and, additively, ALS-GLAS model variability in this current, three-phase (ground-ALS-space lidar) study. The model variance component characterizes the variability of the regression coefficients used to predict ALS-based estimates of biomass as a function of GLAS measurements. Three different types of predictive models are considered in CONUS to determine which produced biomass totals closest to ground-based national forest inventory estimates - (1) linear (LIN), (2) linear-no-intercept (LNI), and (3) log-linear. For CONUS at the national level, the GLAS LNI model estimate (23.95 +/- 0.45 Gt AGB), agreed most closely with the US national forest inventory ground estimate, 24.17 +/- 0.06 Gt, i.e., within 1%. The national biomass total based on linear ground-ALS and ALS-GLAS models (25.87 +/- 0.49 Gt) overestimated the national ground-based estimate by 7.5%. The comparable log -linear model result (63.29 +/- 1.36 Gt) overestimated ground results by 261%. All three national biomass GLAS estimates, LIN, LNI, and log -linear, are based on 241,718 pulses collected on 230 orbits. The US national forest inventory (ground) estimates are based on 119,414 ground plots. At the US state level, the average absolute value of the deviation of LNI GLAS estimates from the comparable ground estimate of total biomass was 18.8% (range: Oregon, -40.8% to North Dakota, 128.6%). Log-linear models produced gross overestimates in the continental US, i.e., >2.6x, and the use of this model to predict regional biomass using GLAS data in temperate, western hemisphere forests is not appropriate. The best model form, LNI, is used to produce biomass estimates in Mexico. The average biomass density in Mexican forests is 53.10 +/- 0.88 t/ha, and the total biomass for the country, given a total forest area of 688,096 km(2), is 3.65 +/- 0.06 Gt. In Mexico, our GLAS biomass total underestimated a 2005 FAO estimate (4.152 Gt) by 12% and overestimated a 2007/8 radar study\'s figure (3.06 Gt) by 19%.

Remote sensing has indicated anomalous behaviour of glaciers in the Karakoram during the past two decades, attracting scientists\' attention to the region. In this context, this study has made detailed estimates of changes in thickness and area of two glaciers (the Sachen in the western Himalaya and the Burche in the Karakoram) to facilitate understanding of recent glacier changes and their potential impacts on water resources. This study used several datasets, including Landsat, the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM), the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat), and differential Global Positioning System (dGPS) in-situ measurements, from the period 1972 through 2015. The extent of debris cover increased significantly between 1972 and 2014, while the total glacierized area decreased slightly. Further, our study estimated thickness changes after removing recognizable biases and seasonal variations, computed through comparisons of ICESat data with dGPS. A thinning trend occurred between 2000 and 2015, suggesting that the glaciers in the western part of the Karakoram and Himalaya regions have not recently gained mass. This study also found non-uniform variations within different zones of the glaciers. Avalanches have fed most of the Karakoram glaciers, providing spatially heterogeneous thickness changes. The frequency of observations, data quality, acquisition time, and local weather affect our observations of temporal changes. Careful assessment of regularly acquired remote-sensing and ground-based observations should reduce uncertainty regarding estimates of glacier changes for management of water resources and associated hazards.

These new data are of great interest to map land cover thanks to the combination of the three high resolutions that will allow a depiction of scene dynamics. However, their efficient exploitation involves new challenges, especially for adapting traditional classification schemes to data complexity. More specifically, it requires: (1) to determine which classifier algorithms can handle the amount and the variability of data; (2) to evaluate the stability of classifier parameters; (3) to select the best feature set used as input data in order to find the good trade-off between classification accuracy and computational time; and (4) to establish the classifier accuracy over large areas.   This work aims at studying these different issues, and more especially at demonstrating the ability of state-of-the-art classifiers, such as Random Forests (RF) or Support Vector Machines (SVM), to classify HR-SITS. For this purpose, several studies are carried out by using SPOT-4 and Landsat-8 HR-SITS in the south of France. Firstly, the choice of the classifier is discussed by comparing RF and SVM algorithms on HR-SITS. Both classifiers show their ability to tackle the classification problem with an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 83.3 % for RF and 77.1 % for SVM. But RF have some advantages such as a small training time, and an easy parameterization. Secondly, the stability of RF parameters is appraised. RF parameters appear to cause little influence on the classification accuracy, about 1% OA difference between the worst and the best parameter configuration. Thirdly, different input data - composed of spectral bands with or without spectral and/or temporal features - are proposed in order to enhance the characterization of land cover. The addition of features improves the classification accuracy, but the gain in OA is weak compared with the increase in the computational cost.

Quantification of actual evapotranspiration is an essential part of this accounting and is frequently derived from surface energy balance (SEB) models that combine satellite remote sensing and on-ground measurements of meteorological data. However, many of the world\'s major water supply catchments are highly heterogeneous with land types, vegetation communities, and topography varying spatially. We compared the performance of seven meteorological interpolation methods and three SEB algorithms (the Simplified Surface Energy Balance Index (S-SEBI), the Hybrid Dual-Source Scheme and Trapezoid Framework-Based Evapotranspiration Model (HTEM), and the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS)), testing their sensitivity to meteorological and remotely sensed inputs in a heterogeneous environment. Under a two dimensional framework, accuracy of interpolation methods varied among SEB meteorological inputs, suggesting that combining methods could improve overall accuracy. SEB algorithms were influenced by the density, type, and variability of meteorological inputs and sensitivity analysis showed that wind speed and air temperature were almost as influential as surface temperature for HTEM and SEBS. SEBS was the most sensitive to meteorological variability caused by choice of interpolation method when analysed globally, while HTEM was the most sensitive to local meteorological variation at flux towers. S-SEBI\'s simple structure made it the least sensitive to meteorological inputs and interpolation methods. Continued improvement in spatially explicit interpolation methods, combined with increased densities of meteorological stations, will increase accuracy and confidence in remotely sensed SEB fluxes, contributing to improved water accounting in heterogeneous catchments.

One potential tool receiving growing interest is the use of thermal imagery for identifying hotspots, however this relies on the assumption that patterns in land surface temperature (LST) coincide with patterns in air temperature. This study explores the capacity of very high resolution (VHR), airborne thermal infrared (TIR) remotely sensed data to identify hotspots at a neighbourhood and street scale resolution. As such it assesses whether VHR TIR remote sensing is an appropriate tool for urban planning and urban greening decision making. In partnership with a local municipality in Melbourne, Australia, VHR (0.5 m) daytime and night time TIR images were captured during warm summertime conditions in February 2012. We found that VHR TIR data certainly identified locations of high LST that could be prioritized for urban greening, however at very high resolutions, VHRTIR data could not identify hotspots because patterns in LST did not strongly correlate with patterns of high air temperature. When VHR TIR data was aggregated to a coarser resolution, it could be used at the neighbourhood-scale to identify hotspots due to greater confidence that areas of high LST do represent air temperature hotspots. Increased vegetation proportion was associated with a reduction in LST for both the day and night meaning urban greening can be used to mitigate hotspots and should be prioritized in wide, open streets where building shade is less. While VHR TIR remote sensing may be an attractive option, this study shows it is not a suitable tool to help inform urban planning and urban greening decision making as the capture, post-processing and interpretation requirements and costs of delivering a high quality product are prohibitive for many end users. We suggest that those seeking to use thermal imagery to identify hotspots in the urban landscape, strongly consider more accessible and cheaper satellite remote sensing products (such as Landsat). VHR TIR derived LST may be useful in designing urban spaces for improved human thermal comfort and focusing on a small region of interest, but the numerous complexities and limitations of the data must be recognized.

Several design enhancements have been made in the OLI instrument relative to prior Landsat instruments: pushbroom imaging which provides substantially improved Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), spectral bandpasses refinement to avoid atmospheric absorption features, 12 bit data resolution to provide a larger dynamic range that limits the saturation level and increases SNR, a set of well-designed onboard calibrators to monitor the stability of the sensor. Some of these changes, such as refinements in spectral bandpasses compared to earlier Landsats and a well-designed on-board calibrator have a direct impact on the improved radiometric calibration performance of the instrument from both the stability of the response and the ability to track the changes. The on-board calibrator lamps and diffusers indicate that the instrument drift is generally <0.1% per year across the bands. The refined bandpasses of the OLI indicate that temporal uncertainty of better than 0.5% is possible when the instrument is trended over vicarious targets such as Pseudo Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS), a level of precision that was never achieved with the earlier Landsat instruments. With three years of data available, the stability measurements indicated by on-board calibrators and PICS agree to 0.5%, which is much better compared to the earlier Landsats, which is very encouraging and bodes well for the future Landsat missions too.

This paper proposes a new method for consistent estimation of multiple land surface parameters and aerosol optical depth (ACID) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) TOA reflectance data. Soil, vegetation canopy, and atmospheric radiative transfer models were coupled, and a global sensitivity analysis of the coupled model was performed to identify the influential parameters from satellite observations. The most influential parameters, including leaf area index (LAI) and aerosol optical depth (AOD), were simultaneously retrieved from MODIS TOA reflectance data and then provided as input to the coupled soil-canopy-atmosphere radiative transfer model to calculate land surface reflectance, incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), land surface albedo, and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR). The retrieved land surface parameters and AOD were compared with the corresponding MODIS, Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS), GEOV1, and Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) products and validated by ground measurements from seven sites with different vegetation types. The results demonstrate that the new inversion method can effectively produce multiple physically consistent parameters with accuracy comparable to that of existing satellite products over the select sites.

Following the \'big dry\', one of the largest La Nina events in the past century, in conjunction with an extreme positive excursion of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), resulted in dramatic increased precipitation from 2010 to 2011 (termed the \'big wet\'), causing widespread flooding and a recorded sea level drop. Despite these extreme hydroclimatic impacts, the spatial partitioning and temporal evolution of total water storage across Australia remains unknown. In this study we investigated the spatial-temporal impacts of the recent \'big dry\' and \'big wet\' events on Australia\'s water storage dynamics using the total water storage anomaly (TWSA) data derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites.   Results showed widespread, continental-scale decreases in TWS during the \'big dry\', resulting in a net loss of 3.89 +/- 0.47 cm (299 km(3)) total water, while the \'big wet\' induced a sharp increase in TWS, equivalent to 11.68 +/- 0.52 cm (898 km(3)) of water, or three times the total water loss during the \'big dry\'. We found highly variable continental patterns in water resources, involving differences in the direction, magnitude, and duration of TWS responses to drought and wet periods. These responses clustered into three distinct geographic zones that correlated well with the influences from multiple large-scale climate modes. Specifically, a persistent increasing trend in TWS was recorded over northern and northeastern Australia, where the climate is strongly influenced by El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). By contrast, western Australia, a region predominantly controlled by the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), exhibited a continuous decline in TWS during the \'big dry\' and only a subtle increase during the \'big wet\', indicating a weak recovery of water storage. Southeastern Australia, influenced by combined ENSO, IOD and SAM interactions, exhibited a pronounced TWS drying trend during the \'big dry\' followed by rapid TWS increases during the \'big wet\', with complete water storage recoveries. A spatial intensification of the water cycle was further identified, with a wetting trend over wetter regions (northern and northeastern Australia) and a drying trend over drier regions (western Australia). Our results highlight the value of GRACE derived TWSA as an important indicator of hydrological system performance for improved water impact assessments and management of water resources across space and time.

Because of differences in satellite platforms and instruments design, calibration, and retrieval algorithms, however, significant cross-mission biases are observed between multiple sensor TCO observations in the common time-space domain. To attain a coherent TCO record, observed cross-mission biases should be accurately addressed prior to the data-merging scheme. In this study, a modified statistical bias correction method was proposed based on the quantile-quantile adjustment to remove apparent cross-mission TCO biases between the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS). To evaluate the effectiveness of this modified algorithm, the overall inconsistency (OI), a unique time-series similarity measure, was proposed to quantify the improvements of consistency (or similarity) between cross-mission TCO time series data before and after bias correction. Common observations during the overlapped time period of 2012-2015 were used to characterize the systematic bias between OMPS and OMI through the modified bias correction method. TCO observations from OMI during 2004-2015 were then projected to the OMPS level by removing associated cross-mission biases. This modified bias correction scheme significantly improved the overall consistency, with an average improvement of 90% during the overlapped time period at the global scale. In addition to the evaluation of consistency improvements before and after bias correction, impacts of cross-mission biases on long-term trend estimations were also investigated. Comparisons of derived trends from the merged TCO time series before and after bias correction across 38 ground-based stations indicate that cross-mission biases not only affect magnitudes of estimated trends, but also result in different phases of trends. Further comparisons of estimated seasonal TCO trends before and after bias correction at the global scale suggest that trends derived from the bias-corrected time series are more accurate than those without bias correction. Overall, the bias correction scheme developed in this study is essential for preparing an accurate long-term TCO record representative of trend analysis to support future assessment of ozone recovery at the global scale.

Drought-induced tree mortality can have significant ecological impacts and is expected to increase in many locations with climate change. This disturbance is unique because it often is limited to only subtle and diffuse changes in forest cover. Thus we developed new methods to quantify drought-driven canopy loss using remotely sensed imagery, across a Landsat scene in central Texas (>30,000 km(2)). First, fine-scale canopy loss maps were created by classifying 17 1-m orthophotos (each similar to 50 km(2)) from the US National Agriculture Imagery Program. These classifications were highly correlated (R-2 = 0.90) with field estimates of canopy cover loss measured in 21 plots at 4 sites across central Texas. These fine-scale canopy loss maps were then used to calibrate and validate coarser-scale Landsat imagery. In scaling up to create regional canopy loss maps, we assembled a Landsat time-series and separated mortality pixels experiencing persistent canopy loss from pixels with only background noise by applying the Landtrendr algorithm. We then estimated percent tree canopy loss within each of these mortality pixels by comparing two models capable of handling zero-inflated continuous proportions: random forest and a zero-or-one inflated beta (ZOIB) regression model. We found that the ZOIB regression model had the highest accuracy in predicting canopy loss (mean absolute error = 5.16%, root mean square error = 8.01%). The 2011 drought caused a decrease in canopy cover within the study area, equivalent to 1124 km(2) of canopy loss, similar to 10% of the 10,850 km(2) area of live canopy present before the drought. Our methods address the need to detect drought-induced tree mortality as extreme droughts are predicted to increase with climate change. More detailed canopy loss maps could then be used (1) to quantify potential impacts to carbon cycling, biophysics, and species compositions and (2) to understand the factors controlling tree mortality, now and in the future.

This instrument measures the cross-correlations of the signals between many pairs of receivers distributed in a Y-shaped array. After de-normalization and image reconstruction, these cross-correlations yield brightness temperature images whose usable portion extends over a swath nearly 1000 km across. Geophysical retrieval algorithms are applied to these images to yield soil moisture (SM) over land and sea surface salinity (SSS) over the ocean. This paper examines the impact of sun glint on these images, focusing on the open ocean, where sun glint is shown to have a major impact on the images in descending passes from December through January. The consistency between the sun glint present in the data and that predicted by the model developed prior to launch is assessed in terms of both spatial variation across the swath and temporal variation from June 2010 to February 2014.

The measurement of LST is however prone to directional anisotropy which may severely affect the interpretation of the measurements if it is not corrected.   This study aims at determining and describing the impact of various factors on anisotropy of continuous crops at mid-latitudes.   The SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes) model is used as a data generator of directional anisotropy since it enables exploring a very large range of meteorological, biochemical and geometrical conditions. An original indicator, the standard deviation of anisotropy in principal plane, is used in order to investigate the impact of the tested variables and parameters.   We found that anisotropy is, at first order, related to seasonal trends, in relation to the amount of incident radiation and the solar zenith angle. Then the geometrical structure of the canopy modifies the anisotropy (LAI, LADF, hot spot parameter) followed by the coupling between the water status of the soil and the stress of canopy. Wind speed which is known for having a significant impact on temperature level has a very limited influence on anisotropy.   An analysis of the amplitude of anisotropy in the principal and perpendicular planes (from -50 degrees to 50 degrees zenith) showed that anisotropy can reach up to 11 degrees C and similar to 3.5 degrees C respectively.   The impact of satellite orbit on anisotropy is also discussed and it is found that, given the latitudes and the season, the anisotropy can severely affect measurements. This is particularly true when the satellite measurements are acquired in a configuration close to the solar principal plane, which often occur at low latitude.   These results are of great help in the context of developing simple methods which could then be integrated into satellite data processing algorithms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We developed hot target detection algorithms for both daytime and nighttime imagery using Landsat 8 data. Performance was compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for daytime detection using a global database of active wildfires. The new approach was able to detect 80% of hot pixels (i.e. compared to 50 to 80% detected by the previous approaches) with a low false alarm rate (i.e. <10%) and fast processing speed (i.e. orders of magnitude faster than one of the previous approaches).

Remote sensing is a viable monitoring tool for spatially extensive meadows but most current approaches are limited by the requirement for in situ calibration data or provide categorical level maps rather than quantitative estimates of direct physiological significance. In this paper we present a method for mapping water depth and the leaf area index (LAI, ratio of leaf area to substrate area) of Thalassia testudinum meadows, based on radiative transfer model inversion using an embedded three-dimensional aquatic canopy model. Variations in reflectance due to leaf length, leaf position, sediment coverage on leaves, water depth and solar zenith angle were included in the model to parameterise uncertainty propagation. The model revealed canopy reflectance as a function of LAI decreases exponentially at all wavelengths up to an LAI around four, beyond which increasing canopy density cannot be determined from reflectance. In addition, sediment coverage on leaves has surprisingly little effect on the reflectance of sparse canopies because shading is also a contributor to darkening. The capability of the method for image based mapping was assessed through sensitivity analyses and by application to hyperspectral airborne imagery of Florida Bay collected by the Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer (PRISM), with the uncertainty propagation providing per-pixel confidence intervals on all the estimated parameters. Results were consistent across the sensitivity and image analyses and the agreement with field data was good, given the challenges in validation of submerged pixels at metre scale. Uncertainties were high for LAIs greater than two in water of depth 8 m, but lower for sparse canopies and shallower water. For water depths approaching 10 in the pixel-to-pixel variation arising from processes at the water surface upwards was greater than the uncertainties arising from the canopy or water column.   The physics-based model inversion approach is readily adaptable to any sensor configuration and to different seagrass species and canopy morphologies. No site-specific in situ data is required and the uncertainty estimates can provide an objective basis for interpreting apparent changes in the distribution of seagrasses over time and space, as revealed by remote sensing techniques.

The analyses were performed by comparing the spatial and temporal behaviour of tau(SMOS) relative to four MODIS-based VI\'s, with that of the vegetation optical depth from a similar sensor, AMSR-E (tau(AMSR-E)). 16-day and annual average values of the passive microwave optical depth (tau) for the year 2010 were obtained from SMOS (1.4 GHz) and AMSR-E (6.9 GHz) observations. The VI\'s chosen for this study were the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI).   The highest global-scale, annual correlation was found between tau(SMOS) and tau(AMSR-E) from ascending orbits (Spearman\'s R = 0.80). On global, annual scales, tau(SMOS) showed higher correlations with tau(AMSR-E) than with the VI\'s, while tau(AMSR-E) was more highly correlated with VI\'s than with tau(SMOS). Timeseries of both tau and the VI\'s were made per landcover class, for the northern hemisphere, tropics and southern hemisphere. Although the large-scale spatial and spatio-temporal behaviour of tau(SMOS) and tau(AMSR-E) is generally similar, the results highlight some notable differences in observing vegetation with optical vs. passive microwave sensors, and certain crucial differences between the two passive microwave sensors themselves. Overall, the results found in this study give a good first confidence in the SMOS L3 tau product and its potential use in vegetation studies. These results provide an essential general reference for future (global-scale) vegetation monitoring with passive microwaves, for the future inclusion of tau(SMOS) in long-term, multi-sensor datasets, and for passive microwave algorithm development.

They are also sensitive to the vegetation scattering albedo and soil moisture. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm to retrieve VOD and soil moisture from time series of dual-polarized L-band radiometric observations along with time-invariant scattering albedo. The method takes advantage of the relatively slow temporal dynamics of early morning vegetation water content and combines a number of consecutive observations to estimate a single VOD. It is termed the multi-temporal dual channel algorithm (MT-DCA). The soil dielectric constant (directly related to soil moisture) of each observation is also retrieved simultaneously. Additionally, the method retrieves a constant albedo, thereby providing for the first time information on global single-scattering albedo variations. The algorithm is tested using three years of L-band passive observations from the NASA Aquarius sensor. The global VOD distribution follows expected gradients of climate and canopy biomass conditions. Its seasonal dynamics follow expected behavior based on precipitation and land cover. The retrieved VOD is closely related to coincident cross-polarized backscatter coefficients. The VOD and dielectric retrievals from MT-DCA are compared to those obtained from implementing the commonly used Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) algorithm and shown to have less high-frequency noise. There is almost as much variation in MT-DCA retrieved albedo between pixels of a given land cover class than between land cover classes, suggesting the common approach of assigning albedo based on land cover class may not capture its spatial variability. Globally, albedo appears to be primarily sensitive to woody biomass. The proposed algorithm allows for a more accurate accounting of the effects of vegetation on radiometric soil moisture retrievals, and generates new observations of L-band VOD and effective single-scattering albedo. These new datasets are complementary to existing remotely sensed vegetation measurements such as fluorescence and optical-infrared indices.

A large set of in situ near-surface measurements, comprising phytoplankton pigment determinations and hyperspectral optical data of phytoplankton absorption coefficient, aph(X), and remote-sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda), are used in the analysis. Measurements were collected in different ecological provinces in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans with chlorophyll-alpha concentrations ranging from about 0.02 to 1.5 mg m(-3). Hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to measured spectra of a(ph)(lambda) and R-rs(lambda) and the second-derivative spectra of these optical variables. The resulting optical-based classifications of the examined stations compared favorably (similarity index >= 0.73) with a classification of phytoplankton community composition calculated from pigment measurements. Similarities between pigmentbased and optically-based classifications were better for the optical data of a(ph)(lambda) than R-rs(lambda), with only slight improvements resulting from the use of the second derivative spectra as opposed to the non-differentiated spectra. An Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis was applied to the optical spectra to examine the correlation of dominant modes of variability with several bio-optical and biogeochemical properties. This analysis supports the notion that the performance of the optical approach is strongly associated with the effects of differences in pigment composition, cell size, and intracellular pigment concentration among different phytoplanIcton communities on the optical properties of the ocean.

However, it is challenged by the spatial scaling errors between satellite and field measurements. This study aims at evaluating the forthcoming MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Collection V006) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)/albedo product MCD43D over a Mediterranean agricultural area. Here, we present the results from the accuracy assessment of the MODIS blue-sky albedo. The analysis is based on collocated comparisons with higher spatial resolution estimates from Formosat-2 that were first evaluated against local in situ measurements. The intersensor comparison is achieved by taking into account the effective point spread function (PSF) for MODIS albedo, modeled as Gaussian functions in the North-South and East-West directions.   The equivalent PSF is estimated by correlation analysis between MODIS albedo and Formosat-2 convolved albedo. Results show that it is 1.2 to 2.0 times larger in the East-West direction as compared to the North-South direction. We characterized the equivalent PSF by a full width at half maximum size of 1920 m in East-West, 1200 m in North-South. This provided a very good correlation between the products, showing absolute (relative) Root Mean Square Errors from 0.004 to 0.013 (2% to 7%), and almost no bias. By inspecting 1-km plots homogeneous in land cover type, we found poorer performances over rice and marshes (i.e., relative Root Mean Square Error of about 11% and 7%, and accuracy of 0.011 and -0.008, respectively), and higher accuracy over dry and irrigated pastures, as well as orchards (i.e., relative uncertainty <3.8% and accuracy <0.003). The study demonstrates that neglecting the MODIS PSF when comparing the Formosat-2 albedo against the MODIS one induces an additional uncertainty up to 0.02 (10%) in albedo. The consistency between fine and coarse spatial resolution albedo estimates indicates the ability of the daily MCD43D product to reproduce reasonably well the dynamics of albedo.

Thus, it is important to obtain the information on urban scenes automatically from high-resolution remote sensing images. Previous studies have focused solely on obtaining qualitative labels of scenes (i.e., scene classification) as opposed to quantitative measurements on scenes (Le., scene decomposition). However, scene classification alone cannot satisfy the demands of practical applications, as most scenes are mixed and composed of many categories. This study aims at 1) developing a decomposition model for quantifying mixed semantics of urban scenes, and 2) applying the proposed model to analyze urban functional zonings. For the first target, a Linear Dirichlet Mixture Model (LDMM) is proposed to quantify the relationships between pure scenes (including one single category) and mixed ones (including multiple categories). Since both mixed and pure scenes are characterized by frequency features (e.g., gray histograms of shapes), the variations in the quantization levels of frequency features could lead to different decomposition results. Accordingly, the stationary Markov process is further introduced to estimate the convergent decomposition results. For the second target, the LDMM was applied to obtain the qualitative categories and their quantitative proportions of urban scenes in Beijing and Zhuhai and to assess their spatial arrangements and temporal changes. Our methods were experimentally verified to be reliable and more effective in performance than the Linear Mixture Model and scene classification techniques. The case studies also suggested that Beijing and Zhuhai significantly differ in urban functional zonings and the functional zonings in Beijing have changed much over time, indicating an important transition in the city\'s economic structure.

The occurrence and dynamics of light-absorbing impurities affect ice surface characteristics and strongly influence glacier melt processes. However, our understanding of the spatial distribution of impurities and their impact on ice surface characteristics and the glacier\'s energy budget is still limited. We use imaging spectroscopy in combination with in-situ experiments to assess the composition of ice surface materials and their respective impact on surface albedo and glacier melt rates. Spectroscopy data were acquired in August 2013 using the Airborne Prism EXperiment (APEX) imaging spectrometer and were used to map the abundances of six predominant surface materials on Glacier de la Plaine Morte, Swiss Alps. A pixel-based classification revealed that about 10% of the ice surface is covered with snow, water or debris. The remaining 90% of the surface can be divided into three types of glacier ice, namely similar to 7% dirty ice, similar to 43% pure ice and similar to 39% bright ice. Spatially distributed spectral albedo derived from APEX reflectance data in combination with in-situ multi-angular spectroscopic measurements was used to analyse albedo patterns present on the glacier surface. About 85% of all pixels exhibit a low albedo between 0.1 and 0.4 (mean albedo 029 +/- 0.12), indicating that Glacier de la Plaine Morte is covered with a significant amount of light-absorbing impurities, resulting in a strong ice-albedo feedback during the ablation season. Using a pixel-based albedo map instead of a constant albedo for ice (0.34) as input for a mass balance model revealed that the glacier-wide total ablation remained similar (10% difference). However, the large local variations in mass balance can only be reproduced using the pixel-based albedo derived from APEX, emphasizing the need to quantify spatial albedo differences as an important input for glacier mass balance models.

Here, spectral measurements from the airborne Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer (PRISM) imagery at 1-m resolution and experimental mesocosms were used to assess the hyperspectral properties of the macroalgae Sargassum and aggregations of the seagrass Syringodium filiforme wrack in Greater Florida Bay. A simple Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) effectively discriminated the presence of vegetation floating on the sea surface. The Sargassum Index derived from reflectance ratios at 650 and 630 nm was used to effectively discriminate Sargassum from Syringodium wrack. Mesocosm spectral measurements revealed an initial lowering of wrack reflectance over the first 3 days followed by a subsequent increase in reflectance over the next 8 days. The age of the wrack estimated from 2 to 5 days was best characterized using narrowband indices of the water absorption feature at 930 and 990 nm potentially from increasing water content in wrack leaves over time. Hyperspectral imagery (<10 nm) was necessary to differentiate between these two types of floating vegetation and assess age of the wrack. PRISM imagery revealed seagrass wrack organized in 5-35 m spaced windrows caused by Langmuir circulation. Wrack was only detectable at 60 m pixel resolution when densities were high and individual windrows were in close proximity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Dierssen, H.

Rather, the agent causing the change must also be determined. Here, we describe and test a method of change agent attribution built on four tenets: agents operate on patches rather than pixels; temporal context can provide insight into the agent of change; human interpretation is critical because agent labels are inherently human-defined; and statistical modeling must be flexible and non-parametric. In the Puget Sound, USA, we used LandTrendr Landsat time-series-based algorithms to identify abrupt disturbances, and then applied spatial rules to aggregate these to patches. We then derived a suite of spectral, patch-shape, and landscape position variables for each patch. These were then linked to patch-level training labels determined by interpreters at 1198 training patches, and modeled statistically using the Random Forest machine-learning algorithm. Labeled agents of change included urbanization, forest management, and natural change (largely fire), as well as labels associated with spectral change that was non-informative (false change). The success of the method was evaluated using both out-of-bag (OOB) error and a small, fully-independent validation interpretation dataset. Overall OOB accuracy was above 80%, but most successful in the numerically well-represented forest management class. Validation with the independent data was generally lower than that estimated with the OOB approach, but comparable when either first or second voting scores were used for prediction. Spatial and temporal patterns within the study area followed expectations well, with most urbanization occurring in the lower elevation regions around Seattle Tacoma, most forest management occurring in mid-slope managed forests, and most natural disturbance occurring in protected areas. Temporal patterns of change agent aggregated to the watershed level suggest substantial year-over-year variability that could be used to examine year-over-year variability in fish species populations.

This method, which is based on the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) technique, was used to exploit narrow spectral structures resulting from the filling-in of the Fraunhofer Fe I line, which originates from fluorescence. The reference spectra for chlorophyll fluorescence were calculated by the coupled ocean atmosphere radiative transfer model SCIATRAN. We compared our results on marine chlorophyll fluorescence observations with the MODIS Terra normalized Fluorescence Line Height (nFLH) product for the average of years 2003-2011 and year 2009. Our method also enables the retrieval of chlorophyll fluorescence above land vegetation scenes. The results for the fluorescence observed above terrestrial vegetation for July and December 2009 were compared to MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). The comparisons show good spatial agreement between different retrievals providing evidence for the good performance of our algorithm. The method presented is generic and can be applied to other hyperspectral instruments in the future. Having established the retrieval technique, extensive studies of chlorophyll fluorescence will improve global knowledge on physiology and photosynthetic efficiency, in both the marine and terrestrial realms, and its dependence on environmental factors.

Here, we used Landsat time-series data (1985-2010) to detect high-severity fires in the Boreal Shield West ecozone of Canada, and assessed post-fire structure for >600 burned patches (>13,000 ha) using airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) data acquired in 2010. We stratified burned areas into patches of dense (>50% canopy cover) and open (20-50% canopy cover) forests based on a classification of pre-fire Landsat imagery, and used these patches to establish 25-year chronosequence of structural development for each class. While structural attributes were similar between dense and open patches during the first ten years since fire (YSF), canopy cover (cover above 2 in) and stand height (75th height percentile) were significantly higher (p < 0.001) for dense patches by the end of the chronosequence (20-25 YSF), suggesting that differences in site productivity were driving patches towards pre-disturbance structure. Our results suggest that growing space remained in stands at the end of the chronosequence, and therefore stem exclusion was not yet reached, as canopy cover was significantly lower (p < 0.001) for patches at 20-25 YSF (mean = 41.9% for dense, 18.6% for open) compared to patches with no recorded burns (mean = 633% for dense, 38.6% for open). The lasting impact of high-severity fire on structure was further confirmed by estimates of stand height, which were approximately half as tall for patches 20-25 YSF (4.9 m for dense, 4.2 m for open) compared to patches with no recorded burns (9.8 m for dense, 7.7 m for open). Additionally, we assessed the structural complexity of burned stands using measures of canopy roughness (i.e., rumple) and the distribution shape of lidar returns (i.e., skewness and kurtosis), which provided evidence of young, even-aged structure once a new overstory was formed. As forest inventories are not routinely conducted across Canada\'s northern boreal, the fusion of Landsat time-series and airborne lidar data provides powerful means for assessing changes in forest structure following disturbance over this large forested area.

This study evaluates the normalized water-leaving radiance nL(w)(lambda) and Chl-a in the eastern Bering Sea that are derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the satellite Aqua by comparing them to in situ data. MODIS-Aqua ocean color products were derived using the NOAA Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (MSL12) ocean color data processing system. The MODIS-derived nL(w)(lambda) showed good agreement with in situ-measured nL(w)(lambda). The mean ratios between them for wavelengths 412, 443, 488, and 551 nm ranged from 1.097 to 1280, with reasonably accurate blue-green radiance ratios in nL(w)(lambda) that were used as input for deriving Chl-a. However, compared to in situ data, existing global and regional Chl-a algorithms either overestimate or underestimate Chl-a in the eastern Bering Sea. Therefore, we propose a new algorithm for estimating Chl-a using a blended approach that was tested and applied to MODIS-Aqua images. The histogram distributions of MODIS-Aqua-derived and in situ-measured Chl-a data show that Chl-a data derived using the new algorithm agree reasonably well to in situ measurements. Annual, seasonal, and monthly composite nL(w)(lambda) and Chl-a images are produced for the period of 2003 to 2013 in order to interpret the long-term spatial and temporal patterns of nL(w)(lambda) and Chl-a. The nL(w)(lambda) spectra show strong spectral dependence on seasonal variability with distinct spatial patterns. Although strong seasonal and interannual variability has been observed in Chl-a, there is no apparent trend of either increase or decrease in phytoplankton biomass associated with variability in the physical environment for the 11 years of the study period.

Prior research has shown an association between this cross-shelf flow of water and materials and the adjacent rotation of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. Satellite remote sensing data were used here to identify such an eddy-driven plume and to detect and characterize both the mechanisms driving the plume and its biogeochemical impacts. Satellite imagery included chlorophyll (CHL), fluorescence line height (FLH) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) measurements from SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua, sea surface temperatures from MODIS-Terra, QuikSCAT wind fields and a merged multi-platform sea surface height product (SSHa). In early June 2007 images, a prominent high-CHL plume (HCP) was seen extending from the continental shelf of the NGMx. A comparison of the CHL and SSHa fields revealed that the HCP was coincident with a cyclone-anticyclone pair, thus linked to an apparent cross-shelf transport. Nearest to the shelf, the CHL values associated with the transport fell within the usual CHL temporal and magnitude range for the summer CHL maximum. Further offshore, the HCP-associated CHL increase was temporally offset, occurring several weeks earlier than expected seasonal CHL peaks. Within the HCP, the relationship of CHL:CDOM:FLH notably diverged from the climatological status, supporting the hypothesis that the HCP composition includes modified shelf waters. Estimates of primary productivity across the study region revealed significant increases in productivity within the HCP\'s boundaries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of our study was to investigate whether it is feasible to estimate different lake carbon fractions (CDOM, DOC, TOC, DIC, TIC and pCO(2)) from space using sensors like OLCI on future Sentinel 3. In situ measurements were carried out in eight measuring stations in two Swedish lakes within 2 days of MERIS overpass. The results suggest that the MERIS CDOM product was not suitable for estimating CDOM in lakes Malaren and Tamnaren and was not a good proxy for mapping lake DOC and TOC from space. However, a simple green to red band ratio and some other MERIS products like the total absorption coefficient, turbidity index, suspended matter and chlorophyll-a were correlated with different carbon fractions and could potentially be used as proxies to map these lake carbon fractions (CDOM, DOC, TOC, DIC, TIC and pCO2) from space.

Estimation of error in land-cover change detection currently relies heavily on external, post hoc validation i.e., comparison of estimated cover to independent values that are assumed to be true. However, reference data are themselves uncertain, and acquiring observations coincident with historical data is often impossible. Complementarily, modeling the transmission, or propagation, of error through the processes of classification and change detection provides an internal means to estimate classification and change-detection error at the scale of pixels. Modeling uncertainty around the estimate of fractional, \"continuous-field\" cover as a standard Normal distribution in each pixel at each of two times, we derive a method for propagating this uncertainty to categorical land cover-classification and change detection. We demonstrate the approach for mapping forest-cover change and its uncertainty based on bi-temporal estimates of percent-tree cover and their associated root-mean-square errors (RMSE). The method described here propagates only the imprecision component of error and not bias, so neither the resulting categorical estimates of cover nor the detection of change (e.g., forest loss) are affected by the transmission of uncertainty. However, propagating the RMSE of input estimates into probabilities of forest cover and change enables mapping and visualization of the spatial distribution of the imprecision resulting from model-based estimation of tree cover and from selection of the threshold of tree cover to define \"forest\". When compared to reference data with a fixed definition of forest (e.g., -30% tree cover) the threshold effect is an importance source of apparent error. in forest-cover and -change estimates. The approach described here provides a useful description of classification and change-detection certainty and can accommodate any definition of forest based on tree cover an especially important consideration given the variety of institutional definitions of forest cover based on remotely sensible structural characteristics.

Though certain metrics have been derived in an effort to characterize the effects of vegetation, some are restricted to certain vegetation types, while others are difficult to measure over the large scales at which spacebome PM measurements are made. In this study, we examine PM measurements made at multiple observation scales in Colorado and Wyoming, and found that spatial variations of airborne T-b data and temporal variation of spacebome T-b data are both highly correlated with a globally available remotely-sensed vegetation dataset, specifically the Leaf Area Index (LAI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. The effective vegetation transmissivity, a physical variable used in existing simple radiative transfer models, is derived from a conservative assumption based on the variability in the measured T-b. We validate our transmissivity estimates over multiple snow seasons and geographic domains. Lastly, based on the variability in the measured T-b with respect to LAI, we define microwave-retrievable areas for PM-based retrieval methods of snow water equivalent (SWE). Over the spatial domain used in this study, over 96% of the area is microwave retrievable at airborne microwave resolutions, which corresponds to 865% of the total SWE. Alternatively at spacebome PM resolution, 52.8% of the land area and 35.5% of the SWE are microwave retrievable. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Meanwhile, agriculture is a highly dynamic process, with significant changes in crop biomass and condition often occurring within roughly a week. The Group on Earth Observations Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM) Initiative represents international efforts to improve the satellite-based monitoring of agricultural processes at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Within this context, it is necessary to understand how cloud cover impacts the probability of securing reasonably clear views of croplands using passive optical Earth observations as the agricultural growing season progresses. To this end, we employ 10-13 years of twice daily 0.05 degrees MODIS Terra (AM) and Aqua (PM) surface reflectance quality assessment cloud flags to investigate diurnal, geographical, and seasonal (early, mid, late, and non-agricultural growing season) characteristics of cloud cover presence frequency and pervasiveness (amount) over global agricultural areas. To provide insight into the ability of hypothetical missions with two modeled revisit frequencies (f = 2, 4 days) to return reasonably clear views at a rate sufficient to track changes in crop biomass and condition, we show the percentage of 8 day compositing periods throughout the agricultural growing season for which a given clarity requirement (at least 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100% cloud-free) could be met.   This research shows that the early and mid-agricultural growing season, which are important periods for crop type area identification and crop yield forecasting, are characterized by both frequent and pervasive cloud extent. Many important agricultural areas during this and other portions of the agricultural growing season are so persistently and pervasively occluded by clouds that less than half of their 8 day composites would be even 70% clear, suggesting that in these areas/time periods, optical, polar-orbiting imaging is not likely to be a viable option for operational monitoring and alternatives (e.g. microwave synthetic aperture radar, SAR) ought to be considered. Further, for most agricultural areas of the world, regardless of seasonality, morning acquisitions are more likely to return reasonably clear views, an important consideration in the planning of future optical, polar-orbiting Earth observing missions with agricultural monitoring science objectives. These results are an important contribution toward the articulation of Earth observation data requirements for global agricultural monitoring. (C)2014 Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, comparisons are made of forest/non-forest (F/NF) extent derived from independent classification of ALOS PALSAR and RADARSAT-2 data acquired over Tasmania. Focussing on a temperate forest landscape, it was demonstrated that C-band SAR data can be used interchangeably with L-band data to produce a comparable estimate of forest/non-forest cover. Only partial interoperability is achieved however, given the limitations of dual polarisation C-band SAR in discerning forests of different growth stage and biomass.   Ambiguities in F/NF status were more prevalent in the C-band classification, despite inclusion of topographic (surface elevation and slope) and textural features in the training dataset, with the key observations as follows: (i) Reduced dynamic range and greater overlap amongst F/NF classes; (ii) Similarities in volume scattering from harvested/regrowth eucalyptus areas and background native forest; (iii) Confusion between young pine plantation and harvested/regrowth areas due to comparable roughness; (iv) Less variation in backscatter and poorer separation of intact and managed eucalyptus forest; and (v) Reduced capacity for discrimination of forest types. In almost every case, the use of L-band data was preferable. The one exception was the limited separation of young pine plantation and harvested/regrowth areas in both C- and L-band data. A similar level of performance was achieved in the discrimination of mature pine plantation, and between young eucalyptus plantation and harvested/regrowth.   The findings were restricted to single-date classification of C- and L- band data. The potential to extend a time-series of L-band observations over forest using dense time-series (i.e., intra-annual) C-band observations acquired in dual or quad polarisation mode, warrants further investigation. Where a positive trade-off exists between the benefits and costs of integrating these data, multi-frequency (e.g., C- and L-band) and multi-sensor approaches (e.g., SAR and optical) are a viable way forward for operational forest monitoring and carbon accounting.

The growth potential of a forest stand is an important parameter in forest management and planning, so that accurate prediction of growth is needed. The present study looked into applying gamma-ray data in combination with DEM-derived attributes for improving the existing individual-tree growth model. To adapt the national model to local conditions, the data of 1118 sample trees and 9987 tally located within 197 sample plots in Southeastern Finland were used. Trees were distributed subjectively to reflect the stands\' composition and structure. The main aim was to test the suitability of airborne gamma-ray in combination with DEM-derived attributes for localizing a general parametric prediction model for the trees\' growth (diameter at breast height increment for the period of five years). Linear mixed effect procedures were used to fit models derived from the gamma-ray and DEM. Of the various models constructed for comparison purposes, the best result was obtained with broadleaved trees, followed by Scot pine (Pinus sylvestris L) while Norway spruce (Picea abies L) revealed little improvement. The improvement was found to be more accurate in less fertile site types (Vaccinum type (VT) and Calluna type (CT)) as well as on mineral soils. The result was found to be effective in reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) and the bias. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

These changes can also impact the essential ecosystem goods and services derived from these ecosystems. Following disturbances, remote-sensing datasets have been used to monitor the disturbance and describe antecedent conditions as a means of understanding vulnerability to change. To a lesser extent, they have also been used to predict when desired ecosystems are vulnerable to degradation or loss. In this paper, we review studies that have applied remote sensing imagery to characterize vegetation vulnerability in both retrospective and prospective modes. We first review vulnerability research in natural terrestrial ecosystems including temperate forests, tropical forests, boreal forests, semi-arid lands, coastal areas, and the arctic. We then evaluate whether remote sensing can evaluate vulnerability sufficiently in advance of future events in order to allow the implementation of mitigation strategies, or whether it can only describe antecedent conditions a posteriori. The majority of existing research has evaluated vulnerability retrospectively, but key studies highlight the considerable potential for the development of early warnings of future vulnerability. We conclude that future research needs to focus on the development of a greater number of remotely sensed metrics to be used in a prospective mode in assessing vulnerability of terrestrial vegetation under change.

The Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) algorithm has been developed to do this. However, its effectiveness in semi-arid regions, where vegetation response is typically aseasonal, has yet to be assessed.   In this research the BFAST algorithm was assessed for a semi-arid study area in the Paroo catchment of far northwestern New South Wales, Australia. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) EVI time series were decomposed using BFAST for 270 sample pixels to assess the algorithm\'s ability to detect abrupt changes in vegetation response caused by known fires and floods. The algorithm was also applied across the study area to examine regional patterns in the timing and magnitude of abrupt changes and the direction and magnitude of the long term trends.   The timing of breaks detected by BFAST corresponded with the timing of known floods in the study region for between 68% and 79% of breaks detected across the sample pixels, depending on the parameters used in the decomposition. BEAST was not, however, able to accurately detect fires in the Paroo region, with agreement between the timing of breaks and fires occurring in only 3% of breaks detected. This most likely reflects the low EVI values present before a fire event, which would be typical of semi-arid zones. Spatial patterns in the timing of abrupt changes and greening and browning trends across the study area were a function of land cover and vegetation type. These results indicate that BEAST is able to detect abrupt changes in vegetation greening caused by known floods in semi-arid regions. The presence of spatial patterns in the results also indicates that the algorithm is sensitive to vegetation cover type. BFAST is therefore able to detect abrupt trend changes in regions where vegetation response is not expected to show strong seasonal patterns and could be used in further applications such as classification or regional vegetation modelling in semi-arid environments.

By comparing model estimates with Landsat observations for the three spectral bands, the Tmask algorithm is capable of detecting any remaining clouds, cloud shadows, and snow for an entire stack of Landsat images. Generally, this algorithm will not falsely identify land cover changes as clouds, cloud shadows, or snow, as it is capable of modeling land cover change. The multitemporal images also provide extra information for better discrimination of cloud and snow, which is difficult for single-date algorithm. A snow threshold is derived for Band 5 TOA reflectance for each pixel at each specific time based on a modified Norwegian Linear Reflectance-to-Snow-Cover (NLR) algorithm. By comparing the results of Tmask with a single-date algorithm (Fmask) for multitemporal Landsat images located at Path 12 Row 31, significant improvements are observed for identification of clouds, cloud shadows, and snow. The most significant improvement is observed for cloud shadow detection. Many of the errors in cloud, cloud shadow, and snow detection observed in Fmask are corrected by the Tmask algorithm. The goal is development of a cloud, cloud shadow, and snow detection algorithm that results in a multitemporal stack of images that is free of \"noise\" factors and thus suitable for detection of land cover change.

However, many of these approaches have severe data requirements in the form of long time series of remotely sensed data and/or large numbers of observations of land cover change to train classifiers and assess the accuracy of classifications. In particular, when rates of change are small and equal probability sampling is used, observations of change may be scarce. For these situations, post-classification approaches may be the only viable alternative. The study focused on model-assisted and model-based approaches to inference for post-classification estimation of gross afforestation, gross deforestation, and net deforestation using Landsat imagery as auxiliary data. Emphasis was placed on estimation of variances to support construction of statistical confidence intervals for estimates. Both analytical and bootstrap approaches to variance estimation were used. For a study area in Minnesota, USA, estimates of net deforestation were not statistically significantly different from zero.

Adaptive restoration and management of the Everglades requires the best information possible regarding wetland hydrology. We developed a new and innovative approach to quantify spatial and temporal variations in wetland water levels within the Everglades, Florida. We observed high correlations between water level measured at in situ gages and L-band SAR backscatter coefficients in the freshwater marsh, though C-band SAR backscatter has no close relationship with water level. Here we illustrate the complementarity of SAR backscatter coefficient differencing and interferometry (InSAR) for improved estimation of high spatial resolution water level variations in the Everglades. This technique has a certain limitation in applying to swamp forests with dense vegetation cover, but we conclude that this new method is promising in future applications to wetland hydrology research.

In this study, a comparative analysis of this Level 3 product (referred to as SMOSL3) along with another Surface SM (SSM) product derived from the observations of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) at C-band is presented (this latter product is referred to as AMSRM). SM-DAS-2, a SSM product produced by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Land Data Assimilation System (LDAS) was used to monitor both SMOSL3 and AMSRM qualities. The present study was carried out from 03/2010 to 09/2011, a period during which both SMOS and AMSR-E products were available at global scale. Three statistical metrics were used for the evaluation; the correlation coefficient (R), the Root Mean Squared Difference (RMSD), and the bias. Results were analysed using maps of biomes and Leaf Area Index (LAI). It is shown that both SMOSL3 and AMSRM captured well the spatio-temporal variability of SM-DAS-2 for most of the biomes. In terms of correlation values, the SMOSL3 product was found to better capture the SSM temporal dynamics in highly vegetated biomes (\"tropical humid\", \"temperate humid\", etc.) while best results for AMSRM were obtained over arid and semi-arid biomes (\"desert temperate\", \"desert tropical\", etc.). Finally, we showed that the accuracy of the remotely sensed SSM products is strongly related to LAI. Both the SMOSL3 and AMSRM (marginally better) SSM products correlated well with the SM-DAS-2 product over regions with sparse vegetation for values of LAI <= 1 (these regions represent almost 50% of the pixels considered in this global study). In regions where LAI>1, SMOSL3 showed better correlations with SM-DAS-2 than AMSRM: SMOSL3 had a consistent performance up to LAI = 6, whereas the AMSRM performance deteriorated with increasing values of LAI. This study reveals that SMOS and AMSR-E complement one another in monitoring SSM over a wide range in conditions of vegetation density and that there are valuable satellite observed SSM data records over more than 10 years, which can be used to study land atmosphere processes.

Some researchers have demonstrated the potential for mapping forest height using aerial or spaceborne stereo imagery with very high spatial resolutions. For stereo images with global coverage but coarse resolution new analysis methods need to be used. Unlike most research based on digital surface models, this study concentrated on analyzing the features of point cloud data generated from stereo imagery. The synthesizing of point cloud data from multi-view stereo imagery increased the point density of the data. The point cloud data over forested areas were analyzed and compared to small footprint LiDAR data and large-footprint LiDAR waveform data. The results showed that the synthesized point cloud data from ALOS/PRISM triplets produce vertical distributions similar to LiDAR data and detected the vertical structure of sparse and non-closed forests at 30 m resolution. For dense forest canopies, the canopy could be captured but the ground surface could not be seen, so surface elevations from other sources would be needed to calculate the height of the canopy. A canopy height map with 30 m pixels was produced by subtracting national elevation dataset (NED) from the averaged elevation of synthesized point clouds, which exhibited spatial features of roads, forest edges and patches. The linear regression showed that the canopy height map had a good correlation with RHSO of LVIS data with a slope of 1.04 and R-2 of 0.74 indicating that the canopy height derived from PRISM triplets can be used to estimate forest biomass at 30 m resolution.

Its main purpose is to allow inversions of net flux estimates of CO2 on regional to continental scales using the total column CO2 retrieved using high-resolution spectra in the 0.76, 1.6, and 2.0 mu m ranges. Recently, it was shown that solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIP), a proxy for gross primary production (GPP, carbon uptake through photosynthesis), can be accurately retrieved from space using high spectral resolution radiances in the 750 nm range from the Japanese GOSAT and European GOME-2 instruments. Here, we use real OCO-2 thermal vacuum test data as well as a full repeat cycle (16 days) of simulated OCO-2 spectra under realistic conditions to evaluate the potential of OCO-2 for retrievals of chlorophyll fluorescence and also its dependence on clouds and aerosols. We find that the single-measurement precision is 03-0.5 Wm(-2)sr(-1) mu m(-1) (15-25% of typical peak values), better than current measurements from space but still difficult to interpret on a single-sounding basis. The most significant advancement will come from smaller ground-pixel sizes and increased measurement frequency, with a 100-fold increase compared to GOSAT (and about 8 times higher than GOME-2). This will largely decrease the need for coarse spatial and temporal averaging in data analysis and pave the way to accurate local studies. We also find that the lack of full global mapping from the OCO-2 only incurs small representativeness errors on regional averages. Eventually, the combination of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) derived from CO2 source/sink inversions and SIF as proxy for GPP from the same satellite will provide a more process-based understanding of the global carbon cycle.

Model results confirm that large-scale IWs can be generated every tidal cycle and are able to cross the entire sea. As suggested, the source of these packets is governed by the intense dynamics of the frontal zone in the tidal cycle over local complex bottom.

To assure immediate response to large-scale harvest failure in crop exporting regions, as was the case during the severe U.S. drought in 2012, and to enhance global food security, a practical crop growth monitoring system based on satellite data is required. This study developed a practical method for near real-time prediction of U.S. corn yields using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) taken 7 days before the corn silking stage. We incorporated two algorithms into the MODIS-based corn yield prediction method; namely, (1) a MODIS-based crop classification algorithm in consideration of differences in emergence dates between corn and soybean, and (2) a simple bias correction algorithm for correcting region-dependent yield prediction errors. The method is able to predict the annual variation of national and state level corn grain yields with high accuracy in early August and detect corn yield reductions and poor-harvest regions due to drought damage, as in 2002 and 2012, on a near real-time basis in advance of those provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture\'s National Agricultural Statistics Service. The method also predicted a national-level U.S. corn grain yield for 2013, which was 3.8% lower than the NASS-statistical data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The ability to measure slope displacements remotely over large regions can have many uses, although the limitations of the most commonplace technique, differential InSAR (D-InSAR), must be considered prior to interpreting the final results. One such limitation is the assumption that different rates of movement over a given distance cannot exceed a threshold value, dependent upon the pixel spacing of the SAR images and the radar wavelength. Characteristic features of landslides (Le. the sharp boundary between stable/active ground and the range of temporally-variable velocities) can exhibit high spatial displacement gradients, breaking a fundamental assumption for reliable D-InSAR analysis. Areas of low coherence are also known to hinder the exploitation of InSAR data. This study assesses the capability of TerraSAR-X Spotlight TerraSAR-X Stripmap and Envisat Stripmap images for monitoring the slow-moving Shuping landslide in the densely vegetated Three Gorges region, China. In this case study, the episodic nature of movement is shown to exceed the measurable limit for regular D-InSAR analysis even for the highest resolution 11-day TSX Spotlight interferograms. A Sub-Pixel Offset Time-series technique applied to corner reflectors (SPOT-CR) using only the SAR amplitude information is applied as a robust method of resolving time-varying displacements, with verifiable offset measurements presented from TSX Spotlight and TSX Stripmap imagery. Care should be exercised when measuring potentially episodic landslide movements in densely vegetated areas such as the Three Gorges region and corner reflectors are shown to be highly useful for SPOT techniques even when the assumptions for valid D-InSAR analysis are broken. Finally the capability to derive two-dimensional movements from sub-pixel offsets (in range and along-track directions) can be used to derive estimates of the vertical and northwards movements to help infer the landslide failure mechanism.

One season of winter ECs of 2012-2013 is considered in which 33 most intensive ECs are selected for the study. ASCAT Level 2 operational coastal wind vector product is used for the comparison, whereas AMSR2 SWS values are calculated with newly developed algorithms. Two algorithms for SWS retrieval from AMSR2 are based on numerical simulation of AMSR2 brightness temperatures (T-B) over the oceans and their following inversion with Neural Networks. The first algorithm uses T-B measurements at higher frequency AMSR2 channels (HF algorithm), the second one uses T-B measurements at lower frequency channels (LF algorithm). It is demonstrated that both AMSR2 SWS estimates are highly correlated with ASCAT SWS for the range of low and moderate wind speeds which opens new potential for possible merging of active and passive microwave SWS products. It is shown also that LF AMSR2 algorithm overestimates ASCAT winds greater than 15 m/s. To support the comparison results SWS estimates by AMSR2 are validated against in-situ wind speed measurements from platform weather stations in the North Sea and Norwegian Sea, including high wind events.

The estuary is one of the world\'s most turbid areas with high concentration of suspended sediment (SSC). As a result, an atmospheric correction algorithm is required for TM/ETM + when applied to monitor SSC in the estuary. Remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) at TM/ETM + bands is retrieved using the air molecule and aerosol scattering information provided by MODIS aboard Terra satellite, which has highly improved radiometric calibration, sensitivity, and spectral bands designed for estimating aerosol radiance. Rrs at the red band is used for retrieving SSC by means of the model developed from in-situ data. TM/ETM + measured water color products (Rrs and SSC) are cross validated with MODIS measurements, which are validated by contemporaneous in-situ data. The cross validation shows that, with the proper atmospheric correction algorithm and retrieval model, TM/ETM+ data can be used to quantify the SSC in Yellow River estuary.   Interannual and seasonal variations, as well as spatial distribution, of SSC in Yellow River estuary are studied and assessed using TM/ETM + measurements from 2000 to 2010. Results show that the SSC is generally increasing from 2000 to the maximum in 2003 and then decreasing and is highly correlated with the annual total sediment discharge from Yellow River. The correlation is not so high for the SSC in Bohai and Laizhou bays. In addition, the SSC in the estuary is generally increasing from June to the maximum in Nov. and then decreasing to the minimum in April. The seasonal variation pattern results from Yellow River sediment discharge, which is higher in JuneNov., corresponding to the flood season than in other months. The SSC in Laizhou and Bohai bays generally follow the same seasonal variation pattern that is higher in Nov.-Apr. than in other months. The higher SSC mainly results from the wind-driven resuspension of bottom sediment (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Dead component of grasslands, including litter and standing dead material as the accumulated phytomass of grassland productivity from previous years, is a primary connection in nutrient cycles in grasslands, and also conserves soil moisture and redistributes the grassland surface temperature. However, unlike green vegetation, it is hard to estimate the dead component with remote sensing approaches because the spectral signal of dead materials is similar to that of bare soil or soil crust (moss and lichen), with the only difference in the shortwave infrared region near 2000 nm. In the literature, the Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI), an index based on hyperspectral imagery, is the most popular index for assessing dead cover or dead biomass. However, hyperspectral imagery is still not available for most grasslands worldwide. Therefore, a method to assess dead component using multispectral band imagery (e.g. Landsat imagery in this study) is needed. Grasslands National Park (GNP) in the southern part of Saskatchewan, Canada, has a large amount of accumulated dead vegetation because of long term conservation actions, which makes it a good study area for this project. This study aims to explore the relation between NDVI and dead cover, to investigate how different amounts of dead material change the relation of total biomass and NDVI, and also to test the potential to estimate dead cover using multispectral images. The results show that NDVI and dead cover have positive relationship when dead cover is less than 20%, no correlation when dead cover is between 20 and 80%, and significant negative relation when dead cover is more than 80%; further, the relation of total biomass and NDVI also changes with the same thresholds. The results also indicate that the dead component can be estimated with multispectral images using Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) or Normalized Difference water index (NDWI), but the relationships are highly influenced by bare soil and soil crust.

In large parts of the boreal zone the evergreen conifers are dominant, but most available satellite-based methods for the detection of the start of the growing season have focussed on the greening-up of deciduous species. We investigated the possibility of determining spring phenological events of boreal evergreen coniferous forest from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time-series based on test sites in Finland. The beginning of the photosynthetically active period, determined from the CO2 fluxes measured with the eddy covariance (EC) method, was used as a primary reference for the onset of the growing season (growing season start date, GSSD). Furthermore, phenological observations of pine trees, such as the beginning of shoot elongation (growth of pine start date, GPSD) were included in the comparison. The corresponding indicators were derived from MODIS data and compared with in situ phenological observations. This was carried out using cloud-filtered daily MODIS time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Fractional Snow Cover (FSC) from homogenous areas around in situ sites (3 EC sites and 4 phenological sites in Finland). GSSD in coniferous forest showed correspondence with the time during snowmelt when the ground starts to be exposed, which was indicated by a decrease in FSC and the spring-rise in NDVI time-series. GPSD occurred in general after complete snow melt. Satellite-derived GSSD from NDVI (GSSD(NDVI)) and FSC (GSSD(FSC)) showed good correspondence with in situ observations for both NDVI and FSC (R-2>0.8, RMSE <7 days) including observations from two CO2 flux measurement sites in Northern Finland and one in Southern Finland. The highest site-wise correlations were obtained for the satellite indicator GSSD(FSC). Finally, the national-scale mapping of GSSD was demonstrated based on the satellite-derived indicator GSSD(FSC).

In this study, we quantify recent changes to these water reservoirs, providing estimates of glacier area in the Cordillera Blanca and sub-watersheds of the Rio Santa for the following years 1987, 1996, 2004, and 2010. We explore the effects of atmospheric and topographic corrections by comparing debris-free glacier area estimates generated using raw scenes and corrected scenes. Our results suggest that these corrections can have a significant impact on debris-free glacier area estimates when the same threshold is applied. Debris-free glacier area estimates derived from uncorrected scenes are approximately 5% less than debris-free glacier area estimates derived from atmospherically-corrected scenes. We determined that debris-free glacier area estimates are most sensitive to the choice of threshold and topographic effects. To map glacier area change, we used high-resolution satellite imagery to calibrate our selection of a single threshold for the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI). This threshold value was applied to all NDSI images, which were derived from four carefully selected and atmospherically-corrected Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes acquired at the end of the dry season. In order to calculate total glacier area, we manually mapped debris-covered glaciers, because automated methods were unsuccessful in this region. As of August 2010, the Cordillera Blanca had a total glacier area of 482 km(2), which amounts to a 25% decrease since 1987. Glaciers in the southern portions of the Cordillera Blanca, which have lower median elevations on average, lost a greater percentage of their area from 1987 to 2010, relative to their northern counterparts. Overall, glacier area change in the Cordillera Blanca appears to be accelerating. Between 2004 and 2010, glaciers in the Cordillera Blanca lost area at a rate that was approximately 3.5 times the average rate of area loss from 1970 to 2003. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Here, a new remote sensing algorithm was established to estimate TSM from MODIS observations over the Yangtze Estuary and its adjacent coastal waters. The algorithm was based on a piecewise regression between TSM and surface reflectance at 645 and 869 nm, leading to RMS uncertainties of only 20-30% for TSM between 2 mg L-1 and 1762 mg L-1. The algorithm was applied to MODIS data to derive TSM distribution maps from 2000 to 2010 at 250 m resolution, which revealed significant spatial and temporal (seasonal and inter-annual) variability. Mean TSM in the Yangtze Estuary increased from 44.4 +/- 34.1 mg L-1 in May to 96.0 +/- 58.0 mg L-1 in October, while much higher TSM was found in the nearby Hangzhou Bay (between 1003 +/- 51.6 mg L-1 in August and 290.2 +/- 120.0 mg L-1 in February). Two regions showed significantly out-of-phase seasonality: region A1 in the Yangtze Estuary driven by sediment discharge from the Yangtze River and region A2 in offshore waters and part of Hangzhou Bay driven by winds. The annual mean TSM in region A1 showed significantly decreasing trend in the 11-year period (-2.8 mgL(-1)/yr), which appeared to be caused by the construction of the TGD. The study also has established a TSM environmental data record (EDR) to assess future TSM in the ecologically and economically important Yangtze Estuary and Hangzhou Bay. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

However, current remote sensing-based ET models can generally only provide snapshots of ET at the time of a satellite overpass and do not satisfy the expectations of hydrologists, irrigation engineers, or water resource managers concerned with practical applications. Four commonly used ET upscaling schemes, namely, the constant reference evaporative fraction (EFr) method, the constant evaporative fraction (EF) method, the constant extraterrestrial solar radiation ratio (R-p) method, and the constant observed global solar radiation ratio (R-g) method, were evaluated in this study using ground-based eddy covariance (EC) measurements and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived estimates from a two-source energy balance model. Analysis was made of both closed and un-closed surface fluxes and of different assumed satellite overpass times from mid-morning to mid-afternoon. Data for the analysis were collected at the Yucheng comprehensive experimental station in Northern China, spanning the period from late April 2009 to late October 2011. The results show that all four upscaling factors from noon to mid-afternoon had a better agreement with their corresponding daily averages. Overall, the EFr (R-g) method had the best (second best) performance of the four upscaling methods. The EF method was found to significantly underestimate the daily latent heat flux (LE) and performed the worst of the four upscaling methods. With the correction of the energy imbalance of EC measurements, the R-g method\'s performance was improved and outperformed the EF, method in the morning. The presence of clouds either increased or decreased the BIAS but generally increased the root mean square error (RMSE) for all four upscaling methods. When the upscaling methods were applied to convert the instantaneous MODIS remote sensing estimates of ET to daily values, the accuracy of the extrapolated daily ET was controlled by the accuracy of both the remote sensing ET estimates and the upscaling methods themselves. With the insignificantly biased estimates of the instantaneous LE from the N95 model at 101 MODIS overpass times in this study, using the EF method underestimated the daily ET by 11%, while all the remaining three factors overestimated the daily ET by a range of 5%-18%. This study was conducted to provide a scientific basis for developing an operational and more accurate ET-upscaling method with easy access to data in future studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The eddy covariance (EC) technique provides continuous measurements of net CO2 exchange (NEE) between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. Only a few flux tower sites were run in Africa and very limited observational data of savanna woodlands in Africa are available. Although several publications have reported on the seasonal dynamics and interannual variation of GPP of savanna vegetation through partitioning the measured NEE data, current knowledge about GPP and phenology of savanna ecosystems is still limited. This study focused on two savanna woodland flux tower sites in Botswana and Zambia, representing two dominant savanna woodlands (mopane and miombo) and climate patterns (semi-arid and semi-humid) in Southern Africa. Phenology of these savanna woodlands was delineated from three vegetation indices derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and GPP estimated from eddy covariance measurements at flux tower sites (GPP(EC)). The Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), which is driven by satellite images and meteorological data, was also evaluated, and the results showed that the VPM-based GPP estimates (GPP(VPM)) were able to track the seasonal dynamics of GPP(EC). The total GPP(VPM) and GPP(EC) within the plant growing season defined by a water-related vegetation index differed within the range of +/- 6%. This study suggejts that the VPM is a valuable tool for estimating GPP of semi-arid and semi-humid savanna woodland ecosystems in Southern Africa. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, The Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME), a nonlinear geostatistical methodology, is used for blending the satellite SST datasets (SSTs) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) on EOS Aqua satellite. An error model is developed to link the MODIS SST and the AMSR-E SST at different resolutions. The AMSR-E SSTs are processed as probability soft data by this error model to take into account the uncertainty associated with coarser resolution pixels. The MODIS SSTs are taken as hard data. The soft AMSR-E SSTs and hard MODIS SSTs are then merged in the BME paradigm to produce 8-day average and spatially continuous SSTs with 4 km spatial resolution. The Merged SSTs are validated by using the drifting buoy SST records. The local variance is used to evaluate the ability of the BME method in preserving the original fine spatial structure of the 4 km resolution MODIS SSTs in the blended SSTs. The validation results show that the RMSE and Bias for the BME blended SSTs over the whole study area in 2003 are 0.653 degrees C and -0.146 degrees C, respectively. These values are a bit larger than those for AMSR-E SST (the RMSE and Bias are 0.504 degrees C and 0.0392 degrees C, respectively) and MODIS SST (the RMSE and Bias are 0.635 degrees C and -0.102 degrees C, respectively). The estimations of SST pixels where both of MODE and AMSR-E have missing data have a Bias of -0.255 degrees C and an RMSE of 0.826 degrees C. The difference in local variance between the Merged SSTs and MODIS SSTs is less than 0.01 degrees C-2, and the difference between the Merged SSTs and AMSR-E SSTs is about 0.19 degrees C-2. The blended 4-km SST data set is equal to MODIS SST in revealing the fine scale structures of SST spatial variation. In addition, the blended SST dataset has the complete spatial coverage. The results demonstrate the blending potential of BME for multiple scales satellite derived products integration. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The first step consisted in classifying the top of the atmosphere (TOA) spectra using a neuronal classifier, which provided the aerosol type and a first-guess value of the aerosol parameters that was used to initialize the variational method. The variational method was the second step, which retrieved accurate measurements of the aerosol and chlorophyll-a concentrations. The algorithm was conditioned to take into account the absorbing aerosols, such as the Saharan dusts. We used this algorithm to analyze 13 years of SeaWiFS images (September 1997-December 2009) over an area of the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of West Africa. Since our method allowed us to take Saharan dusts into account, the number of pixels processed for retrieving the chlorophyll-a concentration was an order of magnitude higher than that processed by the standard SeaWiFS algorithm. The analysis of the SeaWiFS images showed that the Saharan dust concentration was maximal in summer during the rainy season and minimal in autumn, which could be explained by the seasonal variability of dust emission triggered by mesoscale atmospheric processes (low-level jet and convection) and soil characteristics (humidity and vegetation).

A new \'hybrid\' filtering approach allowing features with periods between 37 and 410 days to pass polewards of 20 degrees north and south and features with periods between 37 and 205 days to pass within 20 degrees of the equator is found to isolate features whose speed is consistent with predictions of long planetary wave theory throughout much of the oceans. Features with wavelengths between 300 and 800 km and periods between 205 and 410 days are shown to be a significant source of temperature and chlorophyll variability between 20 degrees and 50 degrees north and south, whilst within 20 degrees of the equator, signals in the 800-1500 km and 37-205 days range are predominant. Between 15 degrees and 50 degrees north and south, observed propagation speeds are found to closely match those predicted for first-mode baroclinic Rossby waves by theory. In the equatorial Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, features with wavelengths (800-2000 km), periods (15-40 days) and phase speeds (20-50 cm s(-1)) characteristic of tropical instability waves are preferentially observed. The amplitude and phase relationship between copropagating signals in ocean colour and altimetry and sea surface temperature and altimetry is interpreted in terms of the horizontal (meridional) advection of mean temperature and chlorophyll gradients by Rossby waves, similar to what has recently been observed for non-linear eddies at shorter length scales. The observed phase relationships are in good agreement with the range of phases expected for horizontal advection throughout much of the oceans and consistent with the sign of the mean meridional gradients of temperature and chlorophyll. These results support the view that horizontal advection (be it from waves and/or eddies) is the dominant mode of covariation of temperature and chlorophyll with sea surface height throughout most of the oceans, although the agreement between predicted and observed amplitude and phase relationships is insufficient to completely rule out vertical mechanisms in a few regions. We believe that a \'one size fits all\' approach for global Rossby wave studies can no longer be considered valid, and although we have modified our technique to take this into account, we advocate future work to develop a fully latitudinally dependent filtering methodology.

The results show that OMI data overestimate ground-based EDD measurements except in stations with high surface albedo (e.g., covered by snow), in agreement with the results reported by previous studies. The average differences between satellite and ground-based data reached a maximum of similar to 25% for all-sky cases. When cloudless conditions are selected, removing intra-daily changes in cloudiness, the agreement improves; although average differences between 10 and 20% still appear for seven low-albedo stations. The influences of ozone and aerosol on the observed differences show opposite trends: viz., high ozone column values result in a decrease whereas high turbidity conditions produce an increase in the differences. A correction factor based on the aerosol absorbing optical thickness was applied to correct for this effect, which is not considered in the OMI algorithm. After applying this correction, the agreement between OMI and ground-based EDD measurements improves and the difference between them falls below 20% for more than 90% of the cases at 8 stations. A dependence on station altitude is also noted for both all-sky and clear-sky cases. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, the lack of a dense network to measure PM2.5 (particles with aerodynamic diameter<2.5 mu m) hinders health risk assessments at regional scale. Here, we utilize Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR)-retrieved columnar aerosol optical depths to estimate surface PM2.5 based on recently published conversion factors that account for the composition and vertical distribution of aerosols. We examine the space-time variability of bias-corrected (utilizing coincident in-situ observations) PM2.5 over the Indian Subcontinent for the period Mar 2000-Feb 2010. We show that 51% of the subcontinent\'s 1.4 billion people are exposed to pollution that exceed the World Health Organization\'s highest annual air quality threshold of 35 mu g m(-3), while another 13% and 18% are exposed in the ranges 25-35 and 15-25 mu g m(-3) respectively. Of the remaining population who breathe clean air, only 25% live in urban areas. In many regions, the high-levels of pollution are persistent rather than episodic. PM2.5 concentrations in the rural areas of the Indo-Gangetic Basin are higher than many urban centers in peninsular India. Five hotspots (where PM2.5 increases by > 15 mu g m(-3) over the ten-year period) are identified, which cover parts of the eleven Indian states and Bangladesh affecting similar to 23% of the population. Our results highlight the urgent need to carry out local cohort studies at these hotspots to better understand the health impacts under local conditions. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This study proposes a classification of aquatic and wetland vegetation plant functional types (PFTs) using time series remotely sensed data applicable to wetland ecosystems with large annual water level changes like Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake-wetland of China. We first developed the aquatic and wetland PFT classification scheme which included perennial C-4 grasses, perennial C-3 reed, C-3 (sedges and taller forbs), short C-3 forbs, floating aquatic macrophytes, and submerged aquatic macrophytes. Using this scheme, time series normalized difference vegetation index (time series NDVI) images and time series vegetation-water index (time series VWI) images extracted from 32-m spatial resolution Beijing-1 microsatellite data were applied to perform two PFT classifications with a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. We found that the time series NDVI-based SVM classification method mapped aquatic and wetland PFT distribution with an overall accuracy of 81.3%. However, when the information on water level fluctuation was combined with time series NDVI into a new time series index (referred to as time series VWI), the overall accuracy increased to 90.4%. Results suggest that time series VWI has a stronger capability in distinguishing wetland PFTs with different submersion times and flood tolerances than time series NDVI, and thus may be considered as a key input dataset for future PFt classifications in seasonally dynamic wetlands.

Here, we present a new method that cross-validates existing global LAI products and produces consistent uncertainty information. The method is based on a triple collocation error model (TCEM) that assumes errors among LAI products are not correlated. Global monthly absolute and relative uncertainties, in 0.05 degrees spatial resolutions, were generated for MODIS, CYCLOPES, and GLOBCARBON LAI products, with reasonable agreement in terms of spatial patterns and biome types. CYCLOPES shows the lowest absolute and relative uncertainties, followed by GLOBCARBON and MODIS. Grasses, crops, shrubs, and savannas usually have lower uncertainties than forests in association with the relatively larger forest LAI. With their densely vegetated canopies, tropical regions exhibit the highest absolute uncertainties but the lowest relative uncertainties, the latter of which tend to increase with higher latitudes. The estimated uncertainties of CYCLOPES generally meet the quality requirements (+/- 0.5) proposed by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), whereas for MODIS and GLOBCARBON only non-forest biome types have met the requirement. Nevertheless, none of the products seems to be within a relative uncertainty requirements of 20%. Further independent validation and comparative studies are expected to provide a fair assessment of uncertainties derived from TCEM. Overall, the proposed TCEM is straightforward and could be automated for the systematic processing of real time remote sensing observations to provide theoretical uncertainty information for a wider range of land products.

Unfortunately, the quality of the images filled by most of these existing methods is still not satisfactory, particularly in heterogeneous regions. Recently, a Neighborhood Similar Pixel Interpolator (NSPI) was developed that can accurately fill gaps in SLC-off images even in heterogeneous regions. However, the NSPI method is a type of deterministic interpolation approach that sets its weight parameters empirically and cannot provide statistical uncertainty of prediction. This study proposes a new gap-filling method called Geostatistical Neighborhood Similar Pixel Interpolator (GNSPI) by improving the NSPI method using geostatistical theory. The simulation study shows that: compared with previous geostatistical methods, the image filled by GNSPI has fewer striping effects: compared with NSPI, GNSPI is less empirical in its weight parameters and can provide uncertainty of prediction. More importantly, it can generate more accurate results than NSPI, especially when there is a long time interval between the input auxiliary image and the target SLC-off image. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, due to technical difficulties, to date long-term records of its dynamic inundation areas are lacking, not to mention how they are affected by climate change and/or human activities. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) medium-resolution (250-m) data collected between 2000 and 2010 and an objective water/land delineation method, we documented and studied the short- and long-term characteristics of lake inundation. Significant seasonality and inter-annual variability were found in the monthly and annual mean inundation areas. The inundation area ranged between 714.1 km(2) in October 2009 and 3162.9 km(2) in August 2010, and the inundation area during any particular year could change by a factor of 2.3-3.2. During the 11-year period, the maximum possible inundation area was 14 times the minimum possible inundation area, indicating extreme variability. Both the annual mean and minimum inundation areas showed statistically significant declining trends from 2000 to 2010 (-30.2 km(2) yr(-1) and-23.9 km(2) yr(-1), p<0.05). The changes of the inundation area were primarily driven by local precipitation during non-summer months, while during summer months of July to September when the outflow into the Yangtze River was impeded the effect of precipitation became less significant. These results provide long-term baseline data to monitor future changes in Poyang Lake\'s inundation area in a timely fashion, for example quantifying the extreme drought conditions during spring 2011.

Complementary to ground-based station data, satellite time series provide large-scale spatial capabilities. The primary disadvantage of this technique, however, is the relative brevity of records. Only AVHRR offers the opportunity to analyze more than 25 years of medium-resolution satellite imagery on a daily basis. AVHRR thereby holds a great potential to detect, map and quantify long-term environmental changes. However, to serve this purpose though, adequate algorithms and careful validation are or major significance.   Here, we describe and extensively validate snow cover retrieval from historical 1-km AVHRR data using a stable snow detection algorithm, which allows consistent snow sampling across all AVHRR sensors. As a new asset, a pixel-wise probability map based on logistic regression is provided for each snow mask. The spatial and seasonal validation includes a comparison to MOD10A1 and webcam imagery. In addition, the influence of acquisition geometry and the sensor-to-sensor consistency have been investigated using LANDSAT TM data and a snow climatology based on long-term station data.   We conclude that the snow detection algorithm tested allows for a 1-km snow extent climatology to be generated from the 25-year full-resolution AVHRR data archived at the University of Bern with favorable accuracy and stability. Given the importance of mountainous regions for climate change studies, this satellite-based data set could become an important tool for assessing environmental changes in the European Alps.

The space component, led by ESA, is in its pre-operational stage, serving users with satellite data acquired by the so called \"GMES Contributing Missions\" already available today or planned at European, national and international level. It will become operational once the dedicated space infrastructure, comprised by the \"Sentinel\" missions and their corresponding ground segments are operational. The first of these satellite series will be launched in 2013. The Sentinel missions will provide a unique set of observations utilising different techniques spanning C-band SAR, mid to medium resolution optical and thermal observations with increased spectral resolution, altimeter and dedicated spectrometers for atmospheric chemistry.   This data, combined with in-situ data, some assimilated into models, will then be turned into services for monitoring the environment, the climate and for security related issues.

An efficient raw data compression scheme on-board the satellite is therefore required to maximise the return on investment for SAR missions. The next generation of European SAR satellites, the Sentinel-1 mission, will employ the Flexible Dynamic Block Adaptive Quantization (FDBAQ) compression scheme. In order to validate the implementation of the FDBAQ, expected radar reflectivity levels for the global land surface were needed.   The paper presents the development of the Global Backscatter Model (GBM) which has been used to simulate realistic radar reflectivity acquisitions in support of performance validation of the Sentinel-1 FDBAQ implementation. The GBM consists of a parameter database and SAR image simulation software. The model parameter database characterises C-band radar reflectivity as a function of local incidence angle with a resolution of 1 km for 85% of the global land surface. The parameter database was derived from a global multi-temporal coverage of ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) data. The SAR image simulation software uses the parameter database together with orbit propagation and swath determination algorithms in order to account for the instrument acquisition geometry and the location specific backscattering characteristics. The model has the potential to simulate acquisitions for other SAR instruments. Furthermore, the parameter database could be a valuable source of information for global land cover studies.

Data covered a wide range of forest ecotypes, stand treatments, tree species, and tree species mixtures. The four forest characteristics were modeled using nonlinear regression and generalized method-of-moments estimation to avoid biased and inefficient estimates. The coefficient of determination was 68% for the basal area model and 77-78% for the volume and biomass models.

Tillage information is one of the important inputs for environmental modeling, but the availability of this information is still limited spatially and temporally. Previous studies have encountered difficulties in defining reliable correlations between crop residue cover (CRC) and Landsat-based tillage indices because they neglected the significance of the timing of tillage implementation. This study explores relationships between temporal changes of agricultural surfaces and the normalized difference tillage index (NDTI) in Central Indiana. We found that minimum NDTI (minNDTI) values extracted from multi-temporal NDTI profiles reliably indicate the surface status when tillage or planting occurred. Simple linear regression reveals a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.89 between CRC and minNDTI for calibration. In addition, a percentage change (PC) method was tested for classifying CRC into three categories (CRC<30%; 30%<CRC<70%; CRC> 70%). Both the minNDTI and PC methods resulted in overall classification accuracies of >90%, producer\'s accuracies of 83-100%, and user\'s accuracies of 75-100%. Our results indicated that both Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery are capable of mapping CRC, however, multi-temporal Landsat imagery is required. To establish a capability for crop residue mapping, designers of future remote sensing platforms should consider increasing temporal resolution. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

As a result, the requirement of the scientific community for fast and efficient methods for extracting and analyzing the thermal patterns from a vast volume of acquired data has emerged. The present paper proposes an innovative object-based image analysis procedure to extract thermal patterns for the quantitative analysis of satellite-derived Land Surface Temperature (LST) maps. The spatial and thermal attributes associated with these objects are then calculated and used for the analyses of the intensity, the position and the spatial extent of UHIs. A case study was conducted in the Greater Athens Area, Greece. More than 3000 LST images of the area acquired by MODIS sensor over a decade were analyzed. Three daytime hot-spots were identified and studied (Megara, Elefsina-Aspropyrgos and Mesogeia). They were all found to exhibit similar behavior, gradually increasing their maximum temperature during the summer season and reaching their maxima in mid-July. The hot-spots\' thermal intensities compared to a suburban area were of 9-10 degrees C and were found to be highly correlated to their areal extent. During the night-time, Athens center developed a typical UHI spatially coinciding with the dense urban fabric. The nighttime maximum LST peaked (on average) at the end of July, two weeks later than the daytime surface patterns. The mean spatial extent of UHI in Athens was 55.2 km(2), whilst its mean intensity was 5.6 degrees C. The proposed automatic extraction process can be customized for other cities and potentially used for comparison of LST patterns and UHI behavior between different cities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Enormous amounts of vegetation information have been obtained over continental to global areas based on NDVI derived from NOAA-AVHRR, Terra/Aqua-MODIS, and SPOT-VEGETATION satellite observations. In eastern Siberia, where sparse boreal forests are dominant, the lack of landscape-scale canopy-reflectance observations impedes interpretation of how NDVI seasonality is controlled by the forest canopy and floor status. We discuss the NDVI of the canopy and floor separately based on airborne spectral reflectance measurements and simultaneous airborne land surface images acquired around Yakutsk, Siberia, using a hedgehopping aircraft from spring to summer 2000. The aerial land surface images (4402 scenes) were visually classified into four types according to the forest condition: no-green canopy and snow floor (Type 1), green canopy and snow floor (Type 2), no-green canopy and no-snow floor (Type 3), and green canopy and no-snow floor (Type 4). The spectral reflectance from 350 to 1200 nm was then calculated for these four types. Type 1 had almost no difference in reflectance between the RED and NIR bands, and the resultant NDVI was slightly negative (-0.03). Although Type 2 showed a significant difference between the two bands because of canopy greenness, the resultant NDVI was rather low (0.17) because of high reflection from the snow cover on the floor. In Type 3, the significant difference between the two bands was mainly caused by the greenness of the floor, and the NDVI was relatively high (0.45). The NDVI for Type 4 was the highest (0.75) among the four types. The contributions of reflectance from the forest canopy and floor to the total reflectance were tested with a forest radiative transfer model. The reflectance difference between NIR and RED bands (NIR RED) of Type 4 (15.6%) was approximately double the differences of Type 2 (7.0%) and of Type 3 (7.9%), suggesting half-and-half contributions of forest canopy greenness and floor greenness to the total greenness. The result also suggested that the satellite-derived NDVI in the larch forest around Yakutsk reaches 85% of the maximum NDVI owing to the forest floor greenness, and only the other 15% of the increase in NDVI should be attributed to the canopy foliation. These results quantitatively reveal that the NDVI depends considerably on forest floor greenness and snow cover in addition to canopy greenness in the case of relatively sparse forest in Siberia.

The models used as input MODIS/TERRA products and ground measurements collected during the wheat and corn growth period in a subhumid climate at a measurement station in Yucheng, China. MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and leaf area index (LAI) products, corrected using ground-truth observations, were used in the three models. The TSEB model output of sensible (H) and latent (LE) heat fluxes were in good agreement with Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS)-measured H and LE derived by residual (RMSD<45 W/m(2)). Reasonable agreement was also obtained with the SEBS model output yielding RMSD for H of -40 W/m(2) and LE -55 W/m(2). However, the TVT model output resulted in poor agreement with the LAS-estimated H and LE with RMSD-values >110 W/m(2). Using the uncorrected MODIS LST and LAI products resulted in a deterioration of the agreement in H and LE with LAS-estimated values for both the TSEB and SEBS models, whereas TVT performance improved marginally. These results indicate that the TSEB model yielded the closest agreement with the LAS-estimated fluxes using either the corrected or uncorrected MODIS inputs (LST and LAI). The SEBS model also computed reasonable H and LE values but was significantly more sensitive to errors in MODIS LST and LAI inputs than the TSEB model. In the TVT model, output of H and LE was unacceptable in either scenario of MODIS input which was attributable to errors in selection of the dry edge. With the TVT method, accurate determination of the dry edge end member is critical in regional ET estimation, but for humid and subhumid regions this end member may often be quite difficult to identify or encompass within a satellite scene.

France) has been investigated and compared with tree structural ground measurements in order to identify scatterers associated with elementary scattering mechanisms in the canopy layer. Since this managed forest is constituted by different height stands, it allows to investigate mechanism change in the vertical direction during the forest growth. It has been observed that VV channel was the most elevated, which can be accounted for a maximum attenuation in the vertical direction and partially for the presence of sub-vertical branches in the top canopy layer, and that this channel was the most sensitive to the tree density in reason of an important ground reflectivity. The most pure double-bounce scattering mechanism component is received in HH-VV channel where the corresponding phase center reaches the ground level for large Diameter at Breast Height. It is also supposed that HH channel, which receives double bounce bacicscatter, was affected by the sub-horizontal primary branch development, which induces an elevation of the phase center over oldest trees while tree density diminution enhances backscatter from the ground level. Finally, the crosspolar channel appeared the less perturbed by the tree density than VV channel since it receives predominantly the canopy contribution.

The models were developed from detailed field measurements of structural and radiometric properties made at experimental burn plots with varying canopy cover in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. The models were used to simulate 400-2500 rim spectral reflectance at 10-500 m spatial scale for various viewing and solar geometry configurations. The model simulations closely matched pre-fire and post-fire ground-based, helicopter and satellite remote sensing observations (all r(2) values>0.95 except one post-fire case). The largest discrepancies between modelled and observed reflectances occurred typically at wavelengths greater than 1200 nm for the post-fire simulations. The modelling results indicate that representation of overstory and understory structure and scattering properties are required to represent the burn signal in a typical savanna system. The described 3D modelling approach enables separation of the scattering contributions of the different scene components and is suited to testing and validating fire impact assessment algorithms at locations where the difficulty of obtaining both pre- and post-fire observations is a severe constraint.

To develop appropriate conservation strategies, information on the distribution of reedbeds is required. Field surveys of these wetland environments are difficult, time consuming and expensive to execute for large areas. Remote sensing has the potential to replace or complement such field surveys, yet the specific application to reedbed habitats has not been fully investigated. In the present study, airborne hyperspectral and LiDAR imagery were acquired for two sites in Cumbria, UK. The research aimed to determine the most effective means of analysing hyperspectral data covering the visible, near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions for mapping reedbeds and to investigate the effects of incorporating image textural information and LiDAR-derived measures of canopy structure on the accuracy of reedbed delineation. Due to the high dimensionality of the hyperspectral data, three image compression algorithms were evaluated: principal component analysis (PCA), spectrally segmented PCA (SSPCA) and minimum noise fraction (MNF). The LiDAR-derived measures tested were the canopy height model (CHM), digital surface model (DSM) and the DSM-derived slope map. The SSPCA-compressed data produced the highest reedbed accuracy and processing efficiency. The optimal SSPCA dataset incorporated 12 PCs comprised of the first 3 PCs derived from each of the spectral segments: visible (392700 nm), NIR (701972 nm), SWIR-1 (9731366 nm) and SWIR-2 (15302240 nm). Incorporating image textural measures produced a significant improvement in the classification accuracy when using MNF-compressed data, but had no impact when using the SSPCA-compressed imagery. A significant improvement (+ 11%) in the accuracy of reedbed delineation was achieved when a mask generated by applying a 3 m threshold to the LiDAR-derived CHM was used to filter the reedbed map derived from the optimal SSPCA dataset. This paper demonstrates the value in combining appropriately compressed hyperspectral imagery with LiDAR data for the effective mapping of reedbed habitats. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Two continental-scale SRTM elevation data samples were extracted, along with collocated National Elevation Dataset (NED) elevations, MODIS composite forest cover percentage, and global ecoregion major habitat type codes. The larger punctual sample contained nearly 247,000 sites on a regular grid across the conterminous United States, while the smaller areal sample consisted of 37,500 45 \'\' x 45 \'\' rectangular regions on a regular grid. Sub-pixel positional mismatch was accounted for by finding and using the best local fit between the 1 arc sec horizontal resolution NED product and the 3 arc sec (3 \'\') horizontal resolution SRTM product. Slope and aspect were calculated for all samples. Using the larger point sample, we identified associations between SRTM error, defined as NED-SRTM 3 \'\' differences, with these land cover and terrain derivative variables. Using the areal sample, we developed semivariograms of elevation error for tens of thousands of small regions across the United States, as well as for sets of these regions with common slope and landcover properties. This facilitated a more comprehensive evaluation of the spatial structure of SRTM error than has previously been done. The punctual sample RMSE was 8.6 m, conforming to previous estimates of SRTM error, but many errors in excess of 50 m were identified. Nearly 90% of these large errors were positive and correlated with high forest cover percentage. Overall, SRTM elevations consistently overestimated the surface. Forest cover and slope were positively correlated with positive bias. A strong association of aspect with SRTM error was noted, with positive error magnitudes peaking for aspects oriented to the northwest and negative error magnitudes peaking for slopes facing southeast. Error bias, standard deviation, and semivariograms differed substantially across ecoregion types. These variables were incorporated in a regression model to predict SRTM error: this model explained nearly 60% of the total error variation and has the potential to substantially improve the SRTM data product worldwide using globally available datasets.

Distinctively, the assessment of wood harvesting has become even more relevant to evaluate the sustainability of forest management and to quantify forest carbon budget. This paper presents the development and testing of procedures for assessing forest harvesting in coppice forests by very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. The study area is located in central Italy over approximately 34,000 km(2). A set of SPOT5 HRG multispectral images was acquired for the study years (2002-2007). Official administrative statistics of coppice clearcuts were also acquired. More than 9500 clearcuts were mapped and dated by on-screen interpretation of the SPOT5 images. In a subset of the study area various methods for semi-automatic clearcut mapping were tested by pixel- and object-oriented approaches. The following results are presented: (i) clearcut map developed by visual interpretation of the SPOTS images resulted in high thematic (overall accuracy of 0.99) and geometric (root mean square error of clearcut boundary delineation of 5.3 m) reliability; (ii) object-oriented approach achieved significantly better accuracy than pixel-based methods for semi-automatic classification of the coppice clearcuts; (iii) comparison between mapped clearcut area and official forest harvesting statistics proved a significant underestimation by the latter (65% of the total mapped clearcut area). A sample-based procedure exploiting VHR satellite imagery is finally proposed to correct the official statistics of coppice clearcuts. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This relevant region of southwestern Europe has not been evaluated yet in detail due to the lack of continuous and well-covered ground-based TOC measurements. The data used in this study are derived from the NASA\'s Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) for the period 1978-2005. The TOC spatial behavior shows no significant longitudinal variability (smaller than 3%). In contrast, the variation in latitude changes between 3.5% and 6% depending on the calendar month. The TOC in the northern Portugal is, on average, higher than that recorded in the South. The temporal variability was analyzed for three scales: long-term, seasonal and short-term. The long-term TOC changes are analyzed between 1978 and 1999 by means of linear least squares fits. The results show an annual TOC trend of (2.65 +/- 0.70)%/decade which is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. This TOC decrease is smaller than the trends obtained in other midlatitudes regions which could be partially explained by the compensation due to the observed increase in the tropospheric ozone over the Iberian Peninsula. A trend analysis performed for each individual month shows a statistically significant TOC decline between March and October, with a maximum linear trend value of (-7.30 +/- 45)%/decade in May. The amplitude of the seasonal TOC cycle over Portugal shows a slight dependence in latitude, varying from 28.6 DU (37.5 degrees N) to 33.6 DU (41.5 degrees N). Finally, the short-term variability showed a notable seasonal behavior, with maximum day-to-day TOC changes in winter (similar to 6%) and minimum in summer (similar to 3%). In addition, the persistence (characterized by the autocorrelation coefficients) strongly decreases after a few days (except in summer months). (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The future Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission is designed to address this issue. Its main payload will be a wide swath altimeter which will provide maps of water surface elevations between 78 degrees S and 78 degrees N over a 120 km swath. This study aims to combine coupled hydrologic/hydraulic modeling of an Arctic river with virtual SWOT observations using a local ensemble Kalman smoother to characterize river water depth variations. We assumed that modeling errors are only due to uncertainties in atmospheric forcing fields (precipitation and air temperature) and different SWOT orbits were tested. First, we tested orbits that all have a three day repeat period but differ in terms of their spatial coverage of the study reach: these orbits correspond to the first three months of the mission, which will be dedicated to calibration and validation experiments. For these orbits, the mean spatial Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in modeled channel water depth decreased by between 29% and 79% compared to the modeled RMSE with no assimilation, depending on the spatial coverage. The corresponding mean temporal RMSE decrease was between 54% and 91%. We then tested the nominal orbit with a twenty two day repeat period which will be used during the remaining lifetime of the mission. Unlike the three day repeat orbits, this orbit will observe all continental surfaces (except Antartica and the northern part of Greenland) during one repeat period. The assimilation of SWOT observations computed with this nominal orbit into the hydraulic model leads to a decrease of 59% and 66% in the mean spatial and temporal RMSE in modeled channel water depth, respectively. These results show the huge potential of the future SWOT mission for land surface hydrology, especially at high latitudes which will be very well sampled during one orbit repeat period. Still, further work is needed to reduce current modeling uncertainties and to better characterize SWOT measurement errors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Biancamaria, S.; Mognard, N.

Satellite-measured land surface phenology (LSP) has been widely used to assess large scale phenological patterns and processes. However, the accuracy of LSP is rarely validated with spatially compatible field data due to the significant spatiotemporal scale mismatch. In this study, we employ intensive field observations specifically designed to address this deficiency. High density/frequency spring phenological observations were collected in a mixed seasonal forest during 2008 and 2009. A landscape up-scaling approach was used to derive landscape phenology (LP) indices from plot-level observations in order to validate Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) based LSP. Results show that the MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived start of spring season (SOS) measure was able to predict LP full bud burst date with absolute errors less than two days. In addition, LSP derived SOS captured inter-annual variations and spatial differences that agreed with ground observations. Comparison of complete time series of LP and LSP revealed that fundamental differences exist between the two observation means, e.g., LP development had increased influence on LSP during the course of spring onset. Therefore, inferring continuous LP processes directly from LSP measures could be problematic. However, using LSP derived from techniques such as logistic curve modeling for extracting seasonal markers appears more promising. This study contributes to a more explicit understanding of the linkages between remotely sensed phenology and traditionally observed (ground-based) phenology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Additionally, mean dNBR (0.56 vs. 0.29), the dNBR standard deviation (0.29 vs. 0.19) and mean optimality (0.65 vs. 0.47) were clearly higher for the initial assessment than for the extended assessment. This is due to regenerative processes that obscured first-order fire effects impacting the suitability of the dNBR to assess burn severity in this case study. This demonstrates the importance of the lag timing, i.e. time since fire, of an assessment, especially in a quickly recovering Mediterranean ecosystem. The MODIS time series was used to study intra-annual changes in index performance. The seasonal timing of an assessment highly impacts what is actually measured. This seasonality affected both the greenness of herbaceous resprouters and the productivity of the control pixels, which is land cover specific. Appropriate seasonal timing of an assessment is therefore of paramount importance to anticipate false trends (e.g. caused by senescence). Although these findings are case study specific, it can be expected that similar temporal constraints affect assessments in other ecoregions. Therefore, within the limitations of available Landsat imagery, caution is recommended for the temporal dimension when assessing post-fire effects. This is crucial, especially for studies that aim to evaluate trends in fire/burn severity across space and time. Also, clarification in associated terminology is suggested. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

For ENVISAT, GDR measurements for both Ice-1 and Ice-2 tracking algorithms were tested. For ERS-2, the Ice-2 data produced by the OSCAR project was used. Water level time series over river segments of very different width, from several kilometers to less than a hundred of meters, were studied. The water level time series that can be derived from narrow riverbeds are enhanced by off-nadir detections. Conversely, the off-nadir effect may degrade the series over large bodies if not properly accounted for. Comparison at crossovers and with in situ gauges shows that the quality of the series can be highly variable, from 12 cm in the best cases and 40 cm in most cases to several meters in the worse cases. Cautious data selection is clearly a key point to achieve high quality series. Indeed, low quality series mostly result from inclusion of outliers in the data set finally retained for the computation of the series. Ice-2 and Ice-1 tracking algorithms in the ENVISAT data perform almost equally well. ENVISAT altimetry is clearly an improvement on ERS-2 altimetry. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The red-cockaded woodpecker Picoides borealis (RCN) is a threatened bird species, endemic to the mixed conifer forests of the southeastern United States. RCW nests and forages preferentially in mature longleaf pine Pin us palustris, but also uses mature loblolly pine Pinus taeda and shortleaf pine Pinus echinata forests. In the last century, the extent of mature pine forests has been greatly reduced by logging. The RCW, in contrast to other woodpeckers, excavates nest cavities in living trees and senescence symptoms (year round leaf chlorosis and leaf mortality) have been observed in mature pine stands across the southeast. Widespread mortality of the mature pine forests would threaten the long-term survival of the RCW. We used airborne hyperspectral data across a portion of Ft. Benning Military Installation, Georgia, U.S.A., to determine if senescent trees can be identified and mapped and assess the likely persistence of mature pines in the RCW habitat. Univariate analysis of variance showed good separation between asymptomatic, senesced and dead physiological conditions with asymptomatic trees having significantly higher reflectance for all bands in the wavelength range between 0.719 and 1.1676 mu m, senescent trees having significantly lower reflectance for bands in the range between 1.1927 and 1.3122 mu m, and dead trees having significantly higher reflectance for bands in the range between 1.8151 and 1.9471 mu m. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) models achieved correct classification rates and kappa statistics above 70%. CART models selected information from wavelength regions similar to those identified from the ANOVA, which likely explains their performance. Our aggregated CART model of tree senescence estimated that 141.4 ha (3%) of the study area is affected. RCW nests occurred in areas with significantly higher tree cover, and trees within foraging and home ranges did not have significantly more senescence than areas without RCW. These results indicate that although tree senescence is widespread, mortality is yet to significantly affect RCW habitat. Results and analysis of critical habitat similar to those exemplified in this study can extend our knowledge about the stressors of these important and imperiled components of biodiversity.

To gather a proper understanding of primary production, it is necessary to consider spatial and temporal dynamics throughout the lake. In the present work, daily MODIS-AQUA satellite measurements were used to estimate chlorophyll-a concentrations and the diffuse attenuation coefficient (K490) for surface waters. The spatial regionalisation of Lake Tanganyika, based on Empirical Orthogonal Functions of the chlorophyll-a dataset (July 2002-November 2005), allowed for the separation of the lake in 11 spatially coherent and co-varying regions, with 2 delocalised coastal regions. Temporal patterns of chlorophyll-a showed significant differences between regions. Estimation of the daily primary production in each region indicates that the dry season is more productive than the wet season in all regions with few exceptions. Whole-lake daily primary productivity calculated on an annual basis (2003) was 646 +/- 142mgCm(-2)day(-1). Comparing our estimation to previous studies, photosynthetic production in Lake Tanganyika appears to be presently lower (about 15%), which is consistent with other studies which used phytoplankton biovolume and changes of delta C-13 in the lake sediments. The decrease in lake productivity in recent decades may be associated to changes in climate conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A TSM algorithm is developed here for turbid waters, suitable for any ocean colour sensor including MERIS, MODIS and SeaWiFS. Theory shows that use of a single band provides a robust and TSM-sensitive algorithm provided the band is chosen appropriately. Hyperspectral calibration is made using seaborne TSM and reflectance spectra collected in the southern North Sea. Two versions of the algorithm are considered: one which gives directly TSM from reflectance, the other uses the reflectance model of Park and Ruddick (2005) to take account of bidirectional effects.   Applying a non-linear regression analysis to the calibration data set gave relative errors in TSM estimation less than 30% in the spectral range 670-750 nm. Validation of this algorithm for MODIS and MERIS retrieved reflectances with concurrent in situ measurements gave the lowest relative errors in TSM estimates, less than 40%, for MODIS bands 667 nm and 678 nm and for MERIS bands 665 nm and 687 nm.

Eddy covariance flux towers provide continuous measurements of ecosystem-level exchange of carbon dioxide spanning diurnal, synoptic, seasonal, and interannual time scales. However, these measurements only represent the fluxes at the scale of the tower footprint. Here we used remotely sensed data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to upscale gross primary productivity (GPP) data from eddy covariance flux towers to the continental scale. We first combined GPP and MODIS data for 42 AmeriFlux towers encompassing a wide range of ecosystem and climate types to develop a predictive GPP model using a regression tree approach. The predictive model was trained using observed GPP over the period 2000-2004, and was validated using observed GPP over the period 2005-2006 and leave-one-out cross-validation. Our model predicted GPP fairly well at the site level. We then used the model to estimate GPP for each I km x I km cell across the U.S. for each 8-day interval over the period from February 2000 to December 2006 using MODIS data. Our GPP estimates provide a spatially and temporally continuous measure of gross primary production for the U.S. that is a highly constrained by eddy covariance flux data. Our study demonstrated that our empirical approach is effective for upscaling eddy flux GPP data to the continental scale and producing continuous GPP estimates across multiple biomes. With these estimates, we then examined the patterns, magnitude, and interannual variability of GPP. We estimated a gross carbon uptake between 6.91 and 7.33 Pg C yr(-1) for the conterminous U.S. Drought, fires, and hurricanes reduced annual GPP at regional scales and could have a significant impact on the U.S. net ecosystem carbon exchange. The sources of the interannual variability of U.S. GPP were dominated by these extreme climate events and disturbances. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

It is based on the integration of the temporal series of radar data within an inversion scheme and on the correction of the vegetation effects. The retrieval algorithm uses the Bayesian maximum posterior probability and assumes the existence of a relation among the soil conditions at the different times of the series. The correction of the vegetation effects models the variation, with respect to the initial time of the series, of the component of the backscattering coefficient due to the soil characteristics as function of the variations of the measured backscattering coefficient and of the biomass. The method is tested on the data acquired throughout the SMEX02 experiment. The results show that measured and estimated soil moistures are fairly well correlated and that the performances of multitemporal retrieval algorithm are better than those obtained by employing one radar acquisition, especially in terms of capability to detect soil moisture changes. Although the approach to correct the vegetation effects on radar observations needs to be further assessed on different sets of data, this finding demonstrates that the proposed method has a potential to improve the quality of the soil moisture retrievals.

Photosynthesis, light use efficiency, mass and energy exchange, and stress response are dependent on relationships among an ensemble of pigments. This ensemble also determines the visible characteristics of a leaf, which can be measured remotely and used to quantify leaf biochemistry and structure. But current remote sensing approaches are limited in their ability to resolve individual pigments. This paper focuses on the incorporation of three pigments-chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total carotenoids-into the LIBERTY leaf radiative transfer model to better understand relationships between leaf biochemical, biophysical, and spectral properties.   Pinus ponderosa and Pinus jeffreyi needles were collected from three sites in the California Sierra Nevada. Hemispheric single-leaf visible reflectance and transmittance and concentrations of chlorophylls a and b and total carotenoids of fresh needles were measured. These data were input to the enhanced LIBERTY model to estimate optical and biochemical properties of pine needles. The enhanced model successfully estimated reflectance (RMSE = 0.0255, BIAS = 0.00477, RMS%E = 16.7%), had variable success estimating transmittance (RMSE = 0.0442, BIAS = 0.0294, RMS%E = 181%), and generated very good estimates of carotenoid concentrations (RMSE = 2.48 mu g/cm(2), BIAS = 0.143 mu g/cm(2), RMS%E = 20.4%), good estimates of chlorophyll a concentrations (RMSE = 10.7 mu g/cm(2), BIAS = -0.992 mu g/cm(2), RMS%E = 21.1%), and fair estimates of chlorophyll b concentrations (RMSE = 7.49 mu g/cm(2), BIAS = -2.12 mu g/cm(2), RMS%E = 43.7%). Overall root mean squared errors of reflectance, transmittance, and pigment concentration estimates were lower for the three-pigment model than for the single-pigment model. The algorithm to estimate three in vivo specific absorption coefficients is robust, although estimated values are distorted by inconsistencies in model biophysics. The capacity to invert the model from single-leaf reflectance and transmittance was added to the model so it could be coupled with vegetation canopy models to estimate canopy biochemistry from remotely sensed data.

Coarse-resolution data from satellites are potentially useful for national and regional mapping of forest damage, but the accuracy of these methods has not been fully examined. In this study, a method was tested for the mapping of defoliation in Scots pine [Pinus silvestris] forests in southeast Norway caused by the pine sawfly [Neodiption sertifer], with the use of multi-temporal MODIS 16-day composite vegetation index data and the TIMESAT processing method. The damage mapping method used differences in summer mean values and angles of the seasonal profiles, indicating decreasing foliage density, to identify pixels that represent areas containing forest damage. In addition to 16-day NDVI the Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) was tested. Damage areas were identified by classifying data into pixels representing damaged versus undamaged forest areas using a boolean combination of thresholded parameters. Classification results were evaluated against the change in LAI estimated from airplane LIDAR measurements, as an indicator of defoliation. The damage classifications detected 71% to 82% of the pixels with damage, and had kappa coefficients varying between 0.48 and 0.63, indicating some overestimation. This was due e.g. to failure to include clear-cut areas in the evaluation data. Damage classification with WDRVI only resulted in slight improvement compared to the NDVI. Only weak relationships were found between the LIDAR-estimated defoliation and the change parameters obtained from MODIS. Consequently, mapping of the degree of defoliation from MODIS was abandoned. In conclusion, the damage detection method based on MODIS data was found to be useful for locating insect damage, but not for estimating its intensity. Control of the detected damage areas using high-resolution remote sensing data, aerial survey, or fieldwork is recommended for accurate delineation in operational applications. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

TOPS is a modeling framework that integrates operational satellite data, microclimate mapping, and ecosystem simulation models to characterize ecosystem status and trends. We have applied TOPS to investigate trends and patterns in landscape indicators using test cases at both national and park-level scales to demonstrate the potential utility of TOPS for supporting efforts by the National Park Service to develop standardized indicators for protected area monitoring. Our analysis of coarse resolution satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measurements for North America from 1982-2006 indicates that all but a few PAs are located in areas that exhibited a sustained decline in vegetation condition. We used Yosemite National Park as our park-level test case, and while no significant trends in NDVI were detected during the same period, evidence of drought-induced vegetation mortality and recovery patterns dominated the 25 year record. In our Yosemite analysis, we show that analyzing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) products (vegetation indices, absorbed radiation, land surface temperature and gross primary production) in conjunction with ground-based measurements, such as runoff, lends additional utility to satellite-based monitoring of ecosystems indicators, as together they provide a comprehensive view of ecosystem condition. Analyses of MODIS products from 2001-2006 show that year-to-year changes in the onset of spring at Yosemite were as large as 45 days, and this signal in the satellite data record is corroborated by observed changes in spring runoff patterns. Finally, we applied TOPS to assess long-term climate impacts on ecosystem condition at the scale of an individual park. When driven by projected climatic changes at Yosemite of 4-6 degrees C warming by 2100 with no changes in precipitation patterns, TOPS predicts significantly reduced winter snowpack and an earlier onset of the growing season, resulting in prolonged summer drought and reduced vegetation productivity.

We used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) calibrated radiance, snow cover extent, and vegetation index products for interpreting interannual variation in the duration and extent of snowpack, lake ice, and vegetation dynamics for southwest Alaska. The approach integrates multiple seasonal metrics across large ecological regions.   Throughout the observation period (2001-2007), snow cover duration was stable within ecoregions, with variable start and end dates. The start of the lake ice season lagged the snow season by 2 to 3 months. Within a given lake, freeze-up dates varied in timing and duration, while break-up dates were more consistent. Vegetation phenology varied less than snow and ice metrics, with start-of-season dates comparatively consistent across years. The start of growing season and snow melt were related to one another as they are both temperature dependent. Higher than average temperatures during the El Nino winter of 2002-2003 were expressed in anomalous ice and snow season patterns. We are developing a consistent, MODIS-based dataset that will be used to monitor temporal trends of each of these seasonal metrics and to map areas of change for the study area.

The methodology is robust and relatively insensitive to wind- and occlusion-induced artefacts in the 3D TLiDAR point clouds. A quantitative evaluation of structural attributes, like the vertical foliage and wood area profiles, as well as the shoot orientation distribution, was performed. Due to the difficulties of acquiring reliable and accurate estimates of these parameters in the field, an original evaluation approach was chosen that reproduces the TLiDAR scanning and subsequent tree reconstruction process in a virtual environment. In a second step the reconstructed tree models were ingested in a validated 3D radiative transfer model to simulate both their reflectance signatures (observable by space borne instruments) and directional transmission properties (measurable during field campaigns) under various spectral, illumination and tree density scenarios. The results of these evaluations confirm the appropriateness of the proposed tree reconstruction model for the generation of structurally and radiatively faithful copies of existing plant and canopy architectures.

A cloud-free Terra image is available on average every day during the summer and early fall, every other day during spring and late fall, and every third day during the winter. MODIS-derived lake SWT exhibits a cool bias (similar to-1.5 degrees C) relative to in situ temperature observations gathered from three buoys and a slowly-moving watercraft.   The dominant SWT signal is the annual cycle (with a range of 26 degrees C and peak temperature in mid-July) while the diurnal range is as large as 4 degrees C during the spring season. Year-to-year variations in SWT are largest during the fall with over 1 degrees C anomalously warm (cold) departures from the 8-year monthly medians observed during fall 2001 (2006). The MODIS imagery provides an updated SWT climatology for operational weather forecasting applications (e.g., lake-effect snow storm prediction) as well as for input into operational and research numerical weather prediction models.

The index is insensitive to physiological changes on the leaf level even under changing pheneological developmental stage. In the meantime, the index is highly sensitive for variations at the canopy level. Values of LAI estimated by means of this newly developed index, called sLAIDI (standardized LAI Determining Index), resulted in excellent agreements with in-situ measured LAI values of citrus trees, with determination coefficients (R-2) of 0.83. Based on in-situ measured data and simulated data (PROSPECT and ACRM), the newly developed sLAIDI was also found to perform outstanding at high LAI values in contrary to well-known LAI related indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Modified Chlorophyll Ratio Index 2 (MCARI2) that saturate at LAI values of 5 and 8 respectively. Moreover, the sLAIDI index was independent of changing pigment contents. Consequently, this index was regarded a valuable tool to more accurately extract biochemical parameters after normalizing the considered spectral data for LAI. By implementing sLAIDI in existing chlorophyll-related indices (e.g., GM index), the performance to estimate the leaf chlorophyll content from spectral Citrus and peach canopy level data is increased (R-2 increases from 0.68 to 0.77). Moreover, a correction factor was proposed to enable the application of sLAIDI on fields with Strong variations of water content. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Although self-shadowing is a useful attribute for forest remote-sensing classification, compensation for the topographic effects of self-shadowing has proven problematic. This study used airborne canopy LiDAR measurements of 80 Pacific Northwest, USA conifer stands ranging in development stage from pre-canopy closure to old-growth in order to model canopy self-shadowing for four solar zenith angles (SZA). The shadow data were compared to physical measurements used to characterize forest stands, and were also used to test and improve terrain compensation models for remotely sensed images of forested terrain. Canopy self-shadowing on flat terrain strongly correlates with the canopy\'s geometric complexity as measured by the rumple index (canopy surface area/ground surface area) (R-2=0.94-0.87 depending on SZA), but is less correlated with other stand measurements: 95th percentile canopy height (R-2=0.68), mean diameter at breast height (dbh) (R-2=0.65), basal area ha(-1) (R-2=0.18), and canopy stem count ha(-1) (R-2=0.18). The results in this paper support interpretation of self-shadowing as a function of canopy complexity, which is an important ecological characteristic in its own right. Modeling of canopy self-shadowing was used to assess the accuracy of the Sun-Canopy-Sensor (SCS) topographic correction, and to develop a new empirical Adaptive Shade Compensation (ASC) topographic compensation model. ASC used measured shadow (as an estimate of canopy complexity) and the SCS term (to describe the illumination geometry) as independent variables in multiple regressions to determine the topographic correction. The ASC model provided more accurate radiance corrections with limited variation in results across the full range of canopy complexities and incidence angles. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The SPOT5-HRS (High Resolution Stereoscopic) instrument covers up to 120 km by 600 km in a single pass and has the potential to accurately map the poorly known topography of most glaciers and ice caps. The acquisition of a large HRS archive over ice-covered regions is planned by the French Space Agency (CNES) and Spotimage, France during the 2007-2008 International Polar Year (IPY). Here, we report on the accuracy and value of HRS digital elevation model (DEM) over ice and snow surfaces.   A DEM is generated by combining tools available from CNES with the PCI Orthoengine(SE) software, using HRS images acquired in May 2004 over South-East Alaska (USA) and northern British Columbia (Canada). The DEM is evaluated through comparison with shuttle radar topographic mission (SRTM) DEM and ICESAT data, on and around the glaciers. A horizontal shift of 50 in is found between the HRS and SRTM DEMs and is attributed to errors in the SRTM DEM. Over ice-free areas, HRS elevations are 7 m higher than those of SRTM, with a standard deviation of 25 in for the difference between the two DEMs. The 7-m difference is partly attributed to the differential penetration of the electromagnetic waves (visible for HRS; microwave for SRTM) in snow and vegetation.   We also report on the application of sequential DEMs (SRTM DEM in February 2000 and HRS DEM in May 2004) for the monitoring of glacier elevation changes. We map the topographic changes induced by a surge of one tributary of Ferris Glacier. Maximum surface lowering of 42 (+/- 10) m and rising of 77 (+/- 10) m are observed in the 4 years time interval. Thinning rates up to 10 (+/- 2.5) m/yr are observed at low altitudes and confirm the ongoing wastage of glaciers in South-East Alaska. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Ironically, after many years of very limited availability, there are now multiple global land cover maps and it is not readily apparent (1) which is most useful for particular applications or (2) how to combine the different maps to provide an improved dataset. The existing global land cover maps at I kin spatial resolution have arisen from different initiatives and are based on different remote sensing data and employed different methodologies. Perhaps more significantly, they have different legends. As a result, comparison of the different land cover maps is difficult and information about their relative utility is limited. In an attempt to compare the datasets and assess their strengths and weaknesses we harmonized the thematic legends of four available coarse-resolution global land cover maps (IGBP DISCover, UMD, MODIS 1-km, and GLC2000) using the LCCS-based land cover legend translation protocols. Analysis of the agreement among the global land cover maps and existing validation information highlights general patterns of agreement, inconsistencies and uncertainties. The thematic classes of Evergreen broadleaf trees, Snow and Ice, and Barren show high producer and user accuracy and good agreement among the datasets, while classes of mixed tree types show high commission errors. Overall, the results show a limited ability of the four global products to discriminate mixed classes characterized by a mosaic of trees, shrubs, and herbaceous vegetation. There is a strong relationship between class accuracy, spatial agreement among the datasets, and the heterogeneity of landscapes. Suggestions for future mapping projects include careful definition of mixed unit classes, and improvement in mapping heterogeneous landscapes. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Each scrutinized pixel will ultimately be closest to one of the predefined clusters; different classification algorithms differ in the details of which cluster is considered as closest or most likely, but in general the selected algorithm will label each pixel with the label of the closest cluster. However, pixels expressing virtually identical distances to two or more clusters identify a limitation of this typical classification approach. Conditions for limitations to distance based classification algorithms include when distances are long and the pixel may not clearly belong to any single category, may represent mixed land cover, or can be easily confused spectrally between two or more categories. We propose that retention of the distance to the second closest cluster can shed light on the confidence with which label assignment proceeds and present several examples of how such additional information might enhance accuracy assessments and improve classification confidence. The method was developed with simplicity as a goal, assuming the classification has already been performed, and standard clustering reports are available. Over a test site in central British Columbia, Canada, we illustrate the described technique using classified image data from a nation-wide land cover mapping project. Calculation of multi-spectral Euclidean distances to cluster centroids, standardized by cluster variance, allows comparison of all potential class assignments within a unified framework. The variable distances provide a measure of relative confidence in the actual classification at the level of individual pixels. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

QuickBird and Hyperion satellite data are processed to characterize the areal extent and spatial structure of guava through the following approaches: (1) QuickBird data are classified through a traditional pixel-based approach (i.e., an unsupervised classification approach using the ISODATA algorithm), as well as ail Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach; (2) multiple approaches for spectral \"unmixing\" of the Hyperion hyper-spectral data are assessed to construct spectral end-members from QuickBird data using linear and non-linear mixture modeling approaches; and (3) landscape pattern metrics are calculated and compared for the pixel-based, object-based, and spectral unmixing approaches.

The main goal is to evaluate and compare the accuracy of these two approaches for estimating leaf water content by means of laboratory reflectance/transmittance measurements and for mapping leaf and canopy water content by using airborne Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer (MIVIS) data acquired over intensive poplar plantations (Ticino, Italy).   At leaf level, we tested the performance of different spectral indices to estimate leaf equivalent water thickness (EWT) and leaf gravimetric water content (GWC) by using inverse ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and reduced major axis (RMA) regression. The analysis showed that leaf reflectance is related to changes in EWT rather than GWC, with best results obtained by using RMA regression by exploiting the spectral index related to the continuum removed area of the 1200 nm water absorption feature with an explained variance of 61% and prediction error of 6.6%. Moreover, we inverted the PROSPECT leaf radiative transfer model to estimate leaf EWT and GWC and compared the results with those obtained by means of empirical models. The inversion of this model showed that leaf EWT can be successfully estimated with no prior information with mean relative errors of 14% and determination coefficient of 0.65. Inversion of the PROSPECT model showed some difficulties in the simultaneous estimation of leaf EWT and dry matter content, which led to large errors in GWC estimation.   At landscape level with MIVIS data, we tested the performance of different spectral indices to estimate canopy water per unit ground area (EWTcanopy). We found a relative error of 20% using a continuum removed spectral index around 1200 rim. Furthermore, we used a model simulation to evaluate the possibility of applying empirical models based on appositely developed MIVIS double ratios to estimate mean leaf EWT at landscape level (EWT). It is shown that combined indices (double ratios) yielded significant results in estimating leaf EWT at landscape level by using MIVIS data (with errors around 2.6%), indicating their potential in reducing the effects of LAI on the recorded signal. The accuracy of the empirical estimation of EWTcanopy and EWT was finally compared with that obtained from inversion of the PROSPECT+SAILH canopy reflectance model to evaluate the potential of both methods for practical applications. A relative error of 27% was found for EWTcanopy and an overestimation of leaf EWT with relative errors around 19%.   Results arising from this remote sensing application support the robustness of hyperspectral regression indices for estimating water content at both leaf and landscape level, with lower relative errors compared to those obtained from inversion of leaf and 1D canopy radiative transfer models.

Using a field spectrometer, ten remotely sensed measurements (i.e., two vegetation indices, four fractions of spectral mixture analysis, and four spectral absorption features) were generated for two grass species, Brachiaria brizantha and Brachiaria decumbens. These measures were compared to above ground biomass, live and senesced biomass, and grass canopy water content. The sample size was 69 samples for field grass biophysical data and grass canopy reflectance. Water absorption measures between 1 100 and 1250 nm had the highest correlations with above ground biomass, live biomass and canopy water content, while ligno-cellulose absorption measures between 2045 and 2218 nm were the best for estimating senesced biomass. These results suggest possible improvements on estimating grass measures using spectral absorption features derived from hyperspectral sensors. However, relationships were highly influenced by grass species architecture. B. decumbens, a more homogeneous, low growing species, had higher correlations between remotely sensed measures and biomass than B. brizantha, a more heterogeneous, vertically oriented species. The potential of using the Earth Observing-1 Hyperion data for pasture characterization was assessed and validated using field spectrometer and CCD camera data. Hyperion-derived NPV fraction provided better estimates of grass surface fraction compared to fractions generated from convolved ETM+/Landsat 7 data and minimized the problem of spectral ambiguity between NPV and Soil. The results suggest possible improvement of the quality of land-cover maps compared to maps made using multispectral sensors for the Amazon region. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In most locations where water can be accessed, this resource is harnessed by oases planted to date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) and other crops. So far, little is known about the site-specific conditions determining the existence, size and type of these oases. Remote sensing and image processing techniques were used to locate oases, to characterize the sites according to their topographic, hydrologic and geologic characteristics and to develop a typology of oases in nor-them Oman.   To derive oasis positions, we calculated the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of Landsat images covering all of northern Oman, subtracted a regional average NDVI, averaged the resulting grid over 3 x 3 pixels and extracted the brightest of five classes determined by a natural breaks algorithm. A buffer of six pixels was added to the oases and the vegetated area as determined by the NDVI was summarized for these polygons. The oasis detection procedure was validated using Google Earth Pro (R). Topographic information was derived from data of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), complemented by digitized Russian military maps, from which mean elevations and elevation range above the oases within a buffer of 2 km were extracted.   Water contributing upslope area and distance to streams with catchments of 10 km(2) and 100 km(2) were derived from the same elevation model. All geologic formations of northern Oman were assigned to one of 7 groups and tested for influence on vegetation surrounding them. Four such geologic settings were identified and described by categorical variables. All input parameters were used to define oasis types based on cluster analysis.   Our algorithm detected 2663 oases in northern Oman, of which 2428 had vegetated areas of more than 0.4 ha, the minimum size for reliable detection. The oases were subdivided into six groups. \'Plain Oases\' (49% of all oases) lie mostly in the plains east and west of the mountains, and are fed by groundwater flow in Quaternary sediments. \'Foothill Oases\' (46%) are scattered over the foothills, where they draw their water from groundwater flow that is channeled by rock formations. \'Mountain Oases\' (3%) and \'Kawr Oases\' (0.5%) lie in the mountains, close to an unconform boundary between limestones and confining rocks. \'Drainage Oases\' (0.3%) are the largest oases in northern Oman.

Global LAI product has been routinely produced from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Terra and Aqua satellite platforms. However, the MODIS standard LAI product is not continuous both spatially and temporally. To fill the gaps and improve the quality, we have developed a data filtering algorithm. This filter, called the temporal spatial filter (TSF), integrates both spatial and temporal characteristics for different plant functional types. The spatial gaps are first filled with the multi-year averages of the same day. If the values are missing over all years, the pixel is filled with a new estimate using the vegetation continuous field-ecosystem curve fitting method. The TSF integrates both the multi-seasonal average trend (background) and the seasonal observation. We implement this algorithm using the MODIS Collection 4 LAI product over North America. Comparison of the TSF results with the Savitzky-Golay filter indicates that the TSF performs much better in restoring the spatial and temporal distribution of seasonal LAI trends. The new LAI product has been validated by comparing with field measurements and the derived LAI maps from ETM+ data at a broadleaf forest site and an agricultural site. The validation results indicate that the new LAI product agrees better with both the field measurements and LAI values obtained from the ETM+ than does the MODIS LAI standard product, which usually shows higher LAI values.

In recent years, attention has focused on using high spatial and spectral resolution satellite imagery to map and monitor wetland plant communities in the NERRs, particularly invasive plant species. The utility of this technology for that purpose has yet to be assessed in detail. To that end, a specific high spatial resolution satellite imagery, QuickBird, was used to map plant communities and monitor invasive plants within the Hudson River NERR (HRNERR). The HRNERR contains four diverse tidal wetlands (Stockport Flats, Tivoli Bays, Iona Island, and Piermont), each with unique water chemistry (i.e., brackish, oligotrophic and fresh) and, consequently, unique assemblages of plant communities, including three invasive plants (Trapa natans, Phragmites australis, and Lythrum salicaria). A maximum-likelihood classification was used to produce 20-class land cover maps for each of the four marshes within the HRNERR. Conventional contingency tables and a fuzzy set analysis served as a basis for an accuracy assessment of these maps. The overall accuracies, as assessed by the contingency tables, were 73.6%, 68.4%, 67.9%, and 64.9% for Tivoli Bays, Stockport Flats, Piermont, and Iona Island, respectively. Fuzzy assessment tables lead to higher estimates of map accuracies of 83%, 75%, 76%, and 76%, respectively. In general, the open water/tidal channel class was the most accurately mapped class and Scirpus sp. was the least accurately mapped. These encouraging accuracies suggest that high-resolution satellite imagery offers significant potential for the mapping of invasive plant species in estuarine environments. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The investigation is conducted partly by generating synthetic data from a 3D crown map from a real mixed forest stand and partly on hypothetical high resolution multi-spectral satellite images obtained from very high resolution colour infrared aerial photographs, allowing different hypothetical spatial resolutions.

The data show, for the first time, that it is possible to discriminate subtle spectral emissivity features of leaves from the natural background emission. Under conditions of controlled measurement geometry (leaves arranged to cover a flat surface), the field emissivity spectra agreed fairly well with emissivity values calculated from laboratory directional hemispherical reflectance measurements. Spectral features associated with a variety of leaf chemical constituents, including cellulose, cutin, xylan, silica, and oleanolic acid could be identified in the field emissivity data. Structural aspects of leaf surfaces also influenced spectral behavior, notably the abundance of trichomes, as well as wax thickness and texture.   Field spectral measurements made at increasing distances from natural plant canopies showed progressive attenuation of the spectral emissivity features. This attenuation is ascribed to increased multiple scattering that superimposes an opposite-in-sign reflected component on the emittance, and to the increasing number of canopy voids within the instrument field of view. Errors associated with the removal of atmospheric features and with the non-isotropic thermal characteristics of canopies also contribute to the loss of spectral information at greater measurement distances.   In contrast to visible and short-wave infrared data, thermal infrared spectra of broad leaf plants show considerable spectral diversity, suggesting that such data eventually could be utilized to map vegetation composition. However, remotely measuring the subtle emissivity features of leaves still presents major challenges. To be successful, sensors operating in the 8-14 mu m atmospheric window must have high signal-to-noise and a small enough instantaneous field of view to allow measurements of only a few leaf surfaces. Methods for atmospheric compensation, temperature-emissivity separation, and spectral feature analysis also will need to be refined to allow the recognition, and perhaps, exploitation of leaf thermal infrared spectral properties.

The radiometers were installed on the ground being directed upwards through the canopy. In this position downwelling microwave radiation was measured during the defoliation of the forest with a time resolution of 4 h. Simultaneously we measured the air and soil temperatures.   Based on these data, the transmissivities of the forest canopy were estimated at different foliation states. Typical L-band transmissivities determined for the foliated and the defoliated states were 0.41 and 0.46, confirming the semi-transparency of the canopy at low microwave frequencies. Due to the anisotropic crown structure the L-band brightness temperatures were slightly horizontally polarized to the same degree for any state of the vegetation. From this we conclude that branches are the prevailing emitters of the canopy whereas leaves and trunks are less relevant for L-band observations. In the X-band, the canopy was opaque in the foliated state and became semi-transparent in the course of defoliation indicating that leaves are an important radiation source at this wavelength.   Our results provide the experimental evidence to quantify the radiation properties of a deciduous forest canopy. This is crucial for interpreting the microwave radiation emitted from forested areas measured from space-borne microwave sensing platforrns. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In this study we describe a series of image processing tools that can be used to extract fire propagation parameters from multispectral infrared images so that the parameters can be used to drive a fire propagation model built upon the DDDAS concept. The method is capable of automatically determining the fire perimeter, active fire line, and fire propagation direction. A multi-band image gradient calculation, the Normalized Difference vegetation Index, and the Normalized Difference Burn Ratio along with several standard image processing techniques are used to identify and constrain the fire propagation parameters.

Using a combination of spectral, angular, and texture features, each pixel is classified as land, water, cloud, aerosol, or snowlice, with the aerosol class further divided into smoke, dust, and other aerosols. The classifier was trained by MISR scientists who labeled hundreds of scenes using a custom interactive tool that showed them the results of the training in real time, making the process significantly faster. Preliminary validation shows that the accuracy of the classifier is approximately 81% globally at the 1.1-km pixel level. Applications of this classifier include global studies of cloud and aerosol distribution, as well as data mining applications such as searching for smoke plumes.

The latter create a variable environment where mosquitoes can thrive and thus contribute to diffusion and transmission of diseases such as the Rift Valley Fever (RVF, with Aedes vexans arabiensis and Culex poicilipes mosquitoes) in the Ferlo. The small size and complex distribution of ponds require the use of high-spatial resolution satellite images for adequate detection. Here the use of SPOT-5 images (10 m-resolution) allows for detailed assessment of spatio-temporal evolution of ponds, through two new indices: i.e., the Normalized Difference Pond Index (NDPI), and the Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI). Small ponds less than 0.5 ha dominate whatever the time period. For example they represent nearly 65% of the total ponds during the peak of the rainy season, up to 90% at the end of the same season. Moreover, another product is proposed: the Zone Potentially Occupied by Mosquitoes (ZPOM). During the apex of the summer monsoon, it is found that RVF mosquitoes occupy 25% of the Ferlo region, while only 0.9% of the same area is covered by ponds. Overlapping areas occupied by grazing cattle and mosquitoes, enhance RVF virus transmission. The remotely sensed operational indices and products presented here are meant to better understand the mechanisms at stake and to contribute to the development of early warning systems in a changing climate and environment.

Surface melting is easily detectable by remote sensing using passive microwave observations. The preliminary goal of this study is to extend to 26 years an existing data set of surface melting [Torinesi, O., Fily, M., Genthon, C. (2003), Interannual variability and trend of the Antarctic summer melting period from 20 years of spaceborne microwave data, J. Climate, 16(7), pp. 1047-1060] by including the most recent years of observation. These data come from 4 microwave sensors (the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and three Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I)) observing the surface at different hours of the day. Since surface melting varies throughout the day as the air temperature or the radiation, the interannual melting extent and duration time series are biased by sensor changes. Using all the sensors simultaneously available since 2002, we were able to model the diurnal variations of melting and use this hourly model to correct the long-term time series. This results in an unbiased 26-year long time series better suited for climate analysis. The cooling trend found by Torinesi et al. using uncorrected time series for the 1980-1999 period is confirmed but the decreasing rate is weaker after correction. Furthermore, extending the series up to summer 2004-2005 reveals recent changes: the last 2 summers have been particularly warmer over all the East Antarctica compared to the 10 previous years, thus ending the cold period of the 1990s. The trend over 1980-2005 is no longer toward cooling but complex climatic variations appear. The time series are available at http://www.lgge.obs.ujf-grenoble.fr/-picard/melting/.

The approach is through inversion of the non-linear simple geometric model (SGM) against 631 nm multi-angle reflectance data from the Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) flown on the European Space Agency\'s Project for On-Board Autonomy (Proba) satellite. Separation of background and upper canopy contributions was effected by a linear scaling of the parameters of the Walthall bidirectional reflectance distribution function model with the weights of a kernel-driven model. The relationship was calibrated against a small number of sample locations with highly contrasting background/upper canopy configurations, before application over an area of about 25 km(2). The results show that with some assumptions, the multi-angle remote sensing signal from CHRIS/Proba can be explained in terms of a combined soil-understory background response and woody shrub cover and exploited to map this important structural attribute of desert grasslands.

In recent years, numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of long-term monitoring of the Siberian snowpack on large spatial scales owing to evidence of increased river discharge, changes in snow fall amount and alterations with respect to the timing of ablation. This can currently only be accomplished using remote sensing methods. The main objective of this study is to take advantage of a new land surface forcing and simulation database in order to both improve and evaluate the snow depths retrieved using a dynamic snow depth retrieval algorithm. The dynamic algorithm attempts to account for the spatial and temporal internal properties of the snow cover. The passive microwave radiances used to derive snow depth were measured by the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/1) data between July 1987 and July 1995.   The evaluation of remotely sensed algorithms is especially difficult over regions such as Siberia which are characterized by relatively sparse surface measurement networks. In addition, existing gridded climatological snow depth databases do not necessarily correspond to the same time period as the available satellite data. In order to evaluate the retrieval algorithm over Siberia for a recent multi-year period at a relatively large spatial scale, a land surface scheme reanalysis product from the Global Soil Wetness Project-Phase 2 (GSWP-2) is used in the current study. First, the high quality GSWP-2 input forcing data were used to drive a land surface scheme (LSS) in order to derive a climatological near-surface soil temperature. Four different snow depth retrieval methods are compared, two of which use the new soil temperature climatology as input. Second, a GSWP-2 snow water equivalent (SWE) climatology is computed from 12 state-of-the-art LSS over the same time period covered by the SSM/I data. This climatology was compared to the corresponding fields from the retrievals. This study reaffirmed the results of recent studies which showed that the inclusion of ancillary data into a satellite data-based snow retrieval algorithm, such as soil temperatures, can significantly improve the results. The current study also goes a step further and reveals the importance of including the monthly soil temperature variation into the retrieval, which improves results in terms of the spatial distribution of the snowpack. Finally, it is shown that further improved predictions of SWE are obtained when spatial and temporal variations in snow density are accounted for. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

ASE is a NASA New Millennium Program experiment demonstrating science-driven autonomous command and control of a spacecraft. Flying on the Earth observing-1 (EO-1) spacecraft, ASE successfully detected thermal emission from the Mt. Erebus lava lake on 7 May 2004, having analyzed a Hyperion hyperspectral data product on board the spacecraft. EO-1 was re-tasked by ASE to obtain a follow-up observation 7 h later and sent a notification of detection of volcanic activity to the ground. The entire process was carried out autonomously. Initial acquisition to receipt on the ground of the positive detection took less than 3 h, a process that without ASE would have taken weeks. The ASE Thermal Classifier has detected several styles of effusive volcanic activity: active lava lakes, pahoehoe flow fields, open channel flows and lava domes. ASE successfully demonstrated that science-driven spacecraft operation greatly enhances science return per returned byte through the identification of the most valuable data, allowing prioritization of downlink products and the discarding of null data sets. This technology has applications on missions elsewhere in the solar system. Modified thermal classifiers can be used for detecting and monitoring active volcanism on the jovian satellite to, the neptunian moon Triton, and searching for active volcanism on Mars and icy satellites. The success of ASE is an incentive for future instrument and mission designers to consider on-board data-processing requirements (especially data storage capacity, number of processors and processor speed, and RAM) in order to take advantage of this flight-proven technology.

We made an assessment of Collection 4 of the MODIS LAI product using four approaches: (a) assessment against a continental scale Structural Classification of Australian Vegetation (SCAV); (b) assessment against a continental scale land use classification (LUC); (c) assessment against historical field-based measurement of LAI collected prior to the Terra Mission; and (d) direct comparison of MODIS LAI with coincident field measurements of LAI, mostly from hemispherical photography. The MODIS LAI product produced a wide variety of geographically and structurally specific temporal response profiles between different classes and even for sub-groups within classes of the SCAV. Historical and concurrent field measurements indicated that MODIS LAI was giving reasonable estimates for LAI for most cover types and land use types, but that major overestimation of LAI occurs in some eastern Australian open forests and woodlands. The six biome structural land cover classification showed some significant deviations in class allocation compared to the SCAV particularly where grasslands are allocated to shrubland, savanna woodlands are allocated to shrubland, savanna and broadleaf forest, and open forests are allocated to savanna and broadleaf forest. The land cover and LAI products could benefit from some additional examination of Australian data addressing the structural representation of Eucalypt canopies in the \"space of canopy realisation\" for savanna and broadleaf forest classes.

They offer valuable information on the current state of the Earth\'s land surface. However, considerable disagreements among them and classification legends not primarily suited for specific applications such as carbon cycle model parameterizations pose significant challenges and uncertainties in the use of such data sets.   This paper addresses the user community of global land cover products. We first review and compare several global land cover products, i.e. the Global Land Cover Characterization Database (GLCC), Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC2000), and the MODIS land cover product, and highlight individual strengths and weaknesses of mapping approaches. Our overall objective is to present a straightforward method that merges existing products into a desired classification legend. This process follows the idea of convergence of evidence and generates a \'best-estimate\' data set using fuzzy agreement. We apply our method to develop a new joint I-km global land cover product (SYNMAP) with improved characteristics for land cover parameterization of the carbon cycle models that reduces land cover uncertainties in carbon budget calculations.   The overall advantage of the SYNMAP legend is that all classes are properly defined in terms of plant functional type mixtures, which can be remotely sensed and include the definitions of leaf type and longevity for each class with a tree component. SYNMAP is currently used for parameterization in a European model intercomparison initiative of three global vegetation models: BIOME-BGC, LPJ, and ORCHIDEE.   Corroboration of SYNMAP against GLCC, GLC2000 and MODIS land cover products reveals improved agreement of SYNMAP with all other land cover products and therefore indicates the successful exploration of synergies between the different products. However, given that we cannot provide extensive validation using reference data we are unable to prove that SYNMAP is actually more accurate. SYNMAP is available on request from Martin Jung.

Apparently, the gradient is a result of at least three factors: 1) shadows caused by the undulating terrain, 2) anisotropic reflectance of the varying surfaces, and 3) atmospheric scattering.

Feedback regimes are designated based on the temporal correlations between the vegetation and precipitation and the surface temperature and precipitation. The different feedback regimes are linked to the relative importance of vegetation and soil moisture in determining land-atmosphere interactions. The resultant feedback regimes are well localized spatially. In addition, the temporal dynamics are assessed in terms of lagged covariances and phase-space plots. The two dominant feedback regimes are distinguishable by the vegetation-precipitation correlation, implying that vegetative control may be the dominant factor in influencing surface-precipitation feedbacks. These zones are not easily distinguished in the NDVI-surface temperature correlations, but exhibit different behavior in their NDVI-precipitation and surface temperature-precipitation correlations. In addition, these zones can be distinguished in phase plots of both temperature and NDVI. These results suggest a methodology for quantifying the rate of the hydrological cycle in different regions of the globe as well as identifying areas where human induced land cover change may have the most effect transitioning between different feedback zones, and therefore altering the rate of the hydrologic cycle.

However, the general rule which defines that n should be 10p to 30p is often enforced universally in remote sensing without questioning its relevance to the complexity of the specific discrimination problem. Furthermore, identifying this many training samples is often problematic when many classes and/or many bands are used. It is important, then, to test how this generally accepted rule matches common remote sensing discrimination problems because it could be unnecessarily restrictive for many applications. This study was primarily conducted in order to test whether the general rule defining the relationship between n and p was well-suited for ML classification of a relatively simple remote sensing-based discrimination problem. To summarise the mean response of n-to-p for our study site, a Monte Carlo procedure was used to randomly stack various numbers of bands into thousands of separate image combinations that were then classified using an ML algorithm. The bands were randomly selected from a 119-band Enhanced Thematic Mapper-plus (ETM+) dataset comprised of 17 images acquired during the 2001-2002 southern hemisphere summer agricultural growing season over an irrigation area in south-eastern Australia. Results showed that the number of training samples needed for accurate ML classification was much lower than the cur-rent widely accepted rule. Due to the asymptotic nature of the relationship, we found that 95% of the accuracy attained using n = 30p samples could be achieved by using approximately 2p to 4p samples, or <= 1/7th the currently recommended value of n. Our findings show that the number of training samples needed for a simple discrimination problem is much less than that defined by the general rule and therefore the rule should not be universally enforced; the number of training samples needed should also be determined by considering the complexity of the discrimination problem.

The inclusion of maximum daily air temperatures (T-a) measured at the tower sites further improved this relationship. Sixteen-day composite values of EVI and T-a were combined to predict ET across species and tower sites (r(2) = 0.74); the regression equation was used to scale ET for 2000-2004 over large river reaches with T-a from meteorological stations. Measured and estimated ET values for these river segments were moderate when compared to historical, and often indirect, estimates and ranged from 851 874 min yr(-1).

Remote sensing images, particularly at coarse spatial resolutions, are contaminated with mixed pixels that contain more than one class on the ground. The per-pixel approach may result in erroneous classification of images dominated by mixed pixels. Therefore, soft classification approaches that decompose the pixel into its class constituents in the form of class proportions have been advocated. In this paper, we employ a decision tree regression approach to determine class proportions within a pixel so as to produce soft classification from remote sensing data. Classification accuracy achieved by decision tree regression is compared with those achieved by the most widely used maximum likelihood classifier, implemented in the soft mode, and a supervised version of the fuzzy c-means classifier. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and fuzzy error matrix based measures have been used for accuracy assessment of soft classification. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, five classification methods were examined to determine the most suitable classification algorithm for the identification of no-till (NT) and traditional tillage (TT) cropping methods: minimum distance (MD), Mahalanobis distance, Maximum Likelihood (ML), spectral angle mapping (SAM), and the cosine of the angle concept (CAC). A Landsat ETM+ image acquired over southern Michigan and northern Indiana was used to test these classification methods. Each classification method was validated with 293 ground truth sampling locations collected commensurate with the satellite overpass. Classification accuracy was then assessed using error matrix analysis, Kappa statistics, and tests for statistical significance. The results indicate that of the classification routines examined, the two spectral angle methods were superior to the others. The cosine of the angle concept algorithm outperformed all the other classification routines for tillage practice identification and mapping, yielding an overall accuracy of 97.2% (Kappa = 0.959).

The field LAI data was first related to 30-m resolution Enhanced Thermal Mapper Plus (ETM+) images using empirical methods to create a high-resolution LAI map. The analysis of empirical approaches indicates that preliminary segmentation of the image followed by empirical modeling with the resulting patches, was an effective approach to developing an LAI validation surface. Comparison of the aggregated high-resolution LAI map and corresponding MODIS LAI retrievals suggests satisfactory behavior of the MODIS LAI algorithm although variation in MODIS LAI product is higher than expected. The MODIS algorithm, adjusted to high resolution, generally overestimates the LAI due to the influence of the understory vegetation. This indicates the need for improvements in the algorithm. An improved correlation between field measurements and the reduced simple ratio (RSR) suggests that the shortwave infrared (SWIR) band may provide valuable information for needle-leaf forests.

Hyperspectral imaging data covering the spectral region between 0.4 and 2.5 mum and collected from aircraft and satellite platforms have been used in the study of the earth\'s atmosphere, land surface, and ocean color properties, as well as on planetary missions. In order to make such quantitative studies, accurate radiometric and spectral calibrations of hyperspectral imaging data are necessary. Calibration coefficients for all detectors in an imaging spectrometer obtained in a laboratory may need to be adjusted when applied to data obtained from an aircraft or a satellite platform. Shifts in channel center wavelengths and changes in spectral resolution may occur when an instrument is airborne or spaceborne due to vibrations, and to changes in instrument temperature and pressure. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for refining spectral calibrations of imaging spectrometer data using observed features in the data itself. The algorithm is based on spectrum-matching of atmospheric water vapor, oxygen, and carbon dioxide bands, and solar Fraunhofer lines. It has been applied to real data sets acquired with airborne and spaceborne imaging spectrometers. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

When applying tree crown segmentation methods, individual single trees can be recognised and tree height as well as crown area can be detected. Detection of suppressed trees from a height model based on laser scanning is difficult;, however, it is possible to predict these trees by using theoretical distribution functions. In this Study, two different methods are used to predict small trees. In the first method, the parameter prediction method is utilised with the complete Weibull distribution, the parameters of which are predicted with separate parameter prediction models; thus, small trees are determined from the predicted tree height distribution. In the second method, the two-parameter left-truncated Weibull distribution is fitted to the detected tree height distribution.   The results are presented by using timber volume and stem density as predicted stand characteristics. The results showed that the root mean square error (RMSE) for the timber volume is about 25% when using only information obtained from laser scanning, whereas the RMSE for the number of sterns per ha is about 75%. Predictions for both characteristics are also highly biased and the underestimates are 24% and 62%, respectively. The use of the parameter prediction method to describe small trees improved the accuracy considerably; the RMSE figures for estimates of timber volume and number of sterns are 16.0% and 49.2%, respectively. The bias for the estimates is also decreased to 6.3% for timber volume and 8.2% for the number of steins. When a left-truncated height distribution is used to predict the heights of the missing small trees, the RMSEs for the estimates of timber volume and number of stems are 22.5% and 72.7%, respectively. In the case of the timber volume, the reliability figures for both the original laser scanning-based estimates and for the estimates that also contain small trees are comparable to those obtained by conventional compartment-wise Finnish field inventories.

The remote sensing community has responded to this increased interest by improving data quality and methodologies for extracting land cover information. However, in addition to the advantages provided by satellite products, certain limitations exist that need to be objectively quantified and clearly communicated to users so that they can make informed decisions on whether and how land cover products should be used. Accuracy assessment is the procedure used to quantify product quality. Some aspects of accuracy assessment for evaluating four global land cover maps over Canada are discussed in this paper. Attempts are made to quantify limiting factors resulting from the coarse spatial resolution of data used for generating land cover information at regional and global levels. Sub-pixel fractional error matrices are introduced as a more appropriate way for assessing the accuracy of mixed pixels. For classification with coarse spatial resolution data, limitations of the classification method produce a maximum achievable accuracy defined as the average percent fraction of dominant land cover of all pixels in the mapped area. Relationships among spatial resolution, landscape heterogeneity and thematic resolution were studied and reported. Other factors that can affect accuracy, such as misregistration and legend conversion, are also discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, however, we show that shading effects assessed by Landsat can be treated as a signal that stores important topographic information, especially when the spectral characteristics of a surface are homogenous. The coastal transverse dunes of the Ashdod area, and the desert linear dunes of Nizzana. (both located in Israel), were selected to investigate the abovementioned idea. The dune heights in these areas are 10 m on average (relative to their surroundings) and have maximum slopes of 33degrees. An innovative method for extracting slope, aspect, and height data for sand dunes using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images was developed, based on the regularity and periodicity of dunes\' landscapes. Using two Landsat images representing different sun zenith and azimuth angles, reflectance values of each image were converted to cos(i) values (i=incident angle between the surface normal and the solar beam radiation), applying histogram matching methods. The slope and aspect of each pixel were determined as those that give the best prediction of the observed value of cos(i). Height profiles were then extracted, using simple trigonometric relationships. The accuracies of heights and slopes along selected profile lines were to the order of 1 m and 3degrees, respectively (at a spatial resolution of 15 in). Best results were obtained when the images included one from the summer and the other from the winter, corresponding to maximum difference in solar zenith and azimuth angles. Errors in heights were attributed to surface heterogeneity (e.g., presence of biogenic soil crusts in the rainy season), geometric correction errors, cast shadows, and Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) effects. Comparison to Advanced Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) 3D information showed that the proposed method is better in representing the topographic variation of the area than the digital elevation model (DEM) produced by ASTER.

The single greatest impediment to making a spatially (i.e., 1:50,000 scale) and thematically detailed inventory from satellite imagery has been the topography of the three mountainous ranges in the Wellington region. The effective irradiance of incoming light varies with slope orientation, as does the proportion of light that is reflected towards the satellite (the bidirectional reflectance). In this paper, we show how satellite imagery may be processed to standardised spectral reflectance, which is a property of the vegetation alone, independent of sun position, slope, and view direction. Because of this, the use of automatic methods to map vegetation and provide spatially and thematically detailed maps is greatly simplified. Using this method, we produce a land-cover map of the Wellington region, with eight classes, to a classification accuracy of approximately 95%. We also show how the proportions of conifer, broad-leaved, and beech trees may be determined for indigenous forest to provide a framework for forest-type inventory. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Urban land transformation in the US has reduced the amount of carbon fixed through photosynthesis by 0.04 pg per year or 1.6% of the pre-urban input. The reduction is enough to offset the 1.8% gain made by the conversion of land to agricultural use, even though urbanization covers an area less than 3% of the land surface in the US and agricultural lands approach 29% of the total land area. At local and regional scales, urbanization increases NPP in resource-limited regions and through localized warming \"urban heat\" contributes to the extension of the growing season in cold regions.

Emphasis is placed on results from the National Science Foundation Land-Air-Ice Interactions (LAII) program and on optical remote sensing techniques. Case studies demonstrate that ground-level sensors on stationary or moving track platforms and wide-swath imaging sensors on polar orbiting satellites are particularly useful for capturing optical remote sensing data at sufficient frequency to study tundra vegetation dynamics and changes for the cloud prone Arctic. Less frequent imaging with high spatial resolution instruments on aircraft and lower orbiting satellites enable more detailed analyses of land cover change and calibration/validation of coarser resolution observations.   The strongest signals of ecosystem change detected thus far appear to correspond to expansion of tundra shrubs and changes in the amount and extent of thaw lakes and ponds. Changes in shrub cover and extent have been documented by modem repeat imaging that matches archived historical aerial photography. NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) time series provide a 20-year record for determining changes in greenness that relates to photosynthetic activity, net primary production, and growing season length. The strong contrast between land materials and surface waters enables changes in lake and pond extent to be readily measured and monitored. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

We studied a municipality in northeastern Par, Brazil, that has been settled for over a century and where numerous cycles of slash and burn agriculture have occurred. The forests were grouped into young (3-6 years), intermediate (10-20 years), advanced (40-70 years), and mature successional stages using 1999 Landsat 7 ETM imagery. Supervised classification of the imagery showed that these forest classes occupied 22%, 13%, 9%, and 6% of the area, respectively. Although this area underwent widespread deforestation many decades ago, forest of some type covers about 50% of the area. Row crops, tree crops, and pastures cover 8%, 20%, and 22%, respectively. The best separation among land covers appeared in a plot of NDVI versus band 5 reflectance. The same groupings of successional forests were derived independently from indices of similarity among tree species composition. Measured distributions of tree height and diameter also covaried with these successional classes, with the young forests having nearly uniform distributions, whereas multiple height and diameter classes were present in the advanced successional forests. Biomass accumulated more slowly in this secondary forest chronosequence than has been reported for other areas, which explains why the 70-year-old forests here were still distinguishable from mature forests using spectral properties. Rates of forest regrowth may vary across regions due to differences in edaphic, climatic, and historical land-use factors, thus rendering most relationships among spectral properties and forest age site-specific. Successional status, as characterized by species composition, biomass, and distributions of heights and diameters, may be superior to stand age as a means of stratifying these forests for characterization of spectral properties.

Here, the ability to generalize in space was investigated through an analysis of the transferability of predictive relations for the estimation of tropical forest biomass from Landsat TM data between sites in Brazil, Malaysia and Thailand. The data sets for each test site were acquired and processed in a similar fashion to facilitate the analyses. Three types of predictive relation, based on vegetation indices, multiple regression and feedforward neural networks, were developed for biomass estimation at each site. For each site, the strongest relationships between the biomass predicted and that measured from field survey was obtained with a neural network developed specifically for the site (r>0.71, significant at the 99% level of confidence). However, with each type of approach problems in transferring a relation to another site were observed. In particular, it was apparent that the accuracy of prediction, as indicated by the correlation coefficient between predicted and measured biomass, declined when a relation was transferred to a site other than that upon which it was developed. Part of this problem lies with the observed variation in the relative contribution of the different spectral wavebands to predictive relations for biomass estimation between sites. It was, for example, apparent that the spectral composition of the vegetation indices most strongly related to biomass differed greatly between the sites. Consequently, the relationship between predicted and measured biomass derived from vegetation indices differed markedly in both strength and direction between sites. Although the incorporation of test site location information into an analysis resulted in an increase in the strength of the relationship between predicted and actual biomass, considerable further research is required on the problems associated with transferring predictive relations.

The results show seasonality of Chl-a and SST variations in the Gulf of Tonkin, and reveal phytoplankton blooming events in the center part of the gulf during the northeast monsoon season. In summer, Chl-a concentrations were relatively low (<0.3 mg m(-3)) and distributed uniformly throughout most of the area, with a belt of higher Chl-a concentrations along the coast, particularly the coast of Qiongzhou Peninsula; in winter, Chl-a concentration increased (0.5 mg m(-3)) in the entire gulf, and phytoplankton blooms offshore-ward from the northeast coast to the center of the gulf, while Chl-a concentrations reached high levels (0.8-1 mg m(-3)) in the center of the blooms. One peak of Chl-a concentrations was observed during the northeast monsoon season in the year. SST were high (27-29 degreesC) and distributed uniformly in summer, but lower with a large gradient from northeast (17 degreesC) to southwest (25 degreesC) in winter, while strong northeast winds (8 - 10 m/s) were parallel to the east coast of the gulf Comparison of Chl-a values shows that SeaWiFS derived Chl-a concentrations match well with in situ measurements in most parts of the gulf in May 1999, but SeaWiFS derived Chl-a are higher than in situ data in river mouth waters. The seasonal variation of Chl-a concentrations and SST distribution were associated with the seasonally reversing monsoon; the winter phytoplankton blooms were related to vertical mixing and upwelling nutrients drawn by the northeast wind.

This paper analyzes the possibility to improve the radiance-to-flux conversion for the longwave radiation when spectral information about the radiation is available through a set of narrow-band (NB) measurements. The study is based on a database of spectral radiance fields at the top of the atmosphere built using radiative transfer computation. The analysis of this database shows that there exists a certain degree of correlation between the angular and the spectral behaviors of the radiation field. According to the type and the accuracy of the spectral information, this correlation allows a 25-55% reduction of the error introduced by the radiance-to-flux conversion with respect to a simple model that uses only broadband information. The method discussed in this paper might be used when broadband radiometer and spectral imager data are available together like the combination of Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget (GERB) and Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Radiometer Imager (SEVIRI) or the combination of CERES and MODIS.

The successful scaling up of such methods to the canopy level requires modeling the effect of canopy structure and viewing geometry on reflectance bands and optical indices used for estimation of water content, such as normalized difference water index (NDWI), simple ratio water index (SRWI) and plant water index (PWI). This study conducts a radiative transfer simulation, linking leaf and canopy models, to study the effects of leaf structure, dry matter content, leaf area index (LAI), and the viewing geometry, on the estimation of leaf equivalent water thickness from canopy-level reflectance. The applicability of radiative transfer model inversion methods to MODIS is studied, investigating its spectral capability for water content estimation. A modeling study is conducted, simulating leaf and canopy MODIS-equivalent synthetic spectra with random input variables to test different inversion assumptions. A field sampling campaign to assess the investigated simulation methods was undertaken for analysis of leaf water content from leaf samples in 10 study sites of chaparral vegetation in California, USA, between March and September 2000. MODIS reflectance data were processed from the same period for equivalent water thickness estimation by model inversion linking the PROSPECT leaf model and SAILH canopy reflectance model. MODIS reflectance data, viewing geometry values, and LAI were used as inputs in the model inversion for estimation of leaf equivalent water thickness, dry matter, and leaf structure. Results showed good correlation between the time series of MODIS-estimated equivalent water thickness and ground measured leaf fuel moisture (LFM) content (r(2)=0.7), demonstrating that these inversion methods could potentially be used for global monitoring of leaf water content in vegetation.

Regression analysis has been a popular empirical method of linking these two types of data to provide continuous estimates for variables such as biomass, percent woody canopy cover, and leaf area index (LAI). Traditional methods of regression are not sufficient when resulting biophysical surfaces derived from remote sensing are subsequently used to drive ecosystem process models. Most regression analyses in remote sensing rely on a single spectral vegetation index (SVI) based on red and near-infrared reflectance from a single date of imagery. There are compelling reasons for utilizing greater spectral dimensionality, and for including SVIs from multiple dates in a regression analysis. Moreover, when including multiple SVIs and/or dates, it is useful to integrate these into a single index for regression modeling. Selection of an appropriate regression model, use of multiple SVIs from multiple dates of imagery as predictor variables, and employment of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to integrate these multiple indices into a single index represent a significant strategic improvement over existing uses of regression analysis in remote sensing.   To demonstrate this improved strategy, we compared three different types of regression models to predict LAI for an agro-ecosystem and live tree canopy cover for a needleleaf evergreen boreal forest: traditional (Y on X) ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, inverse (X on Y) OLS regression, and an orthogonal regression method called reduced major axis (RMA). Each model incorporated multiple SVIs from multiple dates and CCA was used to integrate these. For a given dataset, the three regression-modeling approaches produced identical coefficients of determination and intercepts, but different slopes, giving rise to divergent predictive characteristics. The traditional approach yielded the lowest root mean square error (RMSE), but the variance in the predictions was lower than the variance in the observed dataset. The inverse method had the highest RMSE and the variance was inflated relative to the variance of the observed dataset. RMA provided an intermediate set of predictions in terms of the RMSE, and the variance in the observations was preserved in the predictions.

The general relationships were consistent, with the odds of correctly classifying a pixel increasing as patch size increased and decreasing as heterogeneity increased. Specific characteristics of these relationships, however, showed considerable diversity among the various classes. Odds ratios are reported to document these relationships. Interaction between the two landscape variables was not a significant influence on classification accuracy, indicating that the effect of heterogeneity was not impacted by the sample being in a small or large patch. Landscape variables remained significant predictors of class-specific accuracy even when adjusted for regional differences in the mapping and assessment processes or landscape characteristics.

The majority of change detection techniques rely on empirically derived thresholds to differentiate changes from background variations, which are often considered noise. Over large areas, reliable threshold definition is problematic due to variations in both the surface state and those imposed by the sensing system. A new approach to change detection, applicable to high-temporal frequency satellite data, that maps the location and approximate day of change occurrence is described. The algorithm may be applied to a range of change detection applications by using appropriate wavelengths. The approach is applied here to the problem of mapping burned areas using moderate spatial resolution satellite data. A bi-directional reflectance model is inverted against multi-temporal land surface reflectance observations, providing an expectation and uncertainty of subsequent observations through time. The algorithm deals with angular variations observed in multi-temporal satellite data and enables the use of a statistical measure to detect change from a previously observed state. The algorithm is applied independently to geolocated pixels over a long time series of reflectance observations. Large discrepancies between predicted and measured values are attributed to change. A temporal consistency threshold is used to differentiate between temporary changes considered as noise and persistent changes of interest. The algorithm is adaptive to the number, viewing and illumination geometry of the observations, and to the amount of noise in the data. The approach is demonstrated using 56 days of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface reflectance data generated for Southern Africa during the 2000 burning season. Qualitatively, the results show high correspondence with contemporaneous MODIS active fire detection results and reveal a coherent spatio-temporal progression of burning. Validation of these results is in progress and recommendations for future research, pending the availability of independent validation data sets, are made. This approach is now being considered for the MODIS burned area algorithm. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.', 'Univ Maryland, Dept Geog, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

Current field-based assessment methodology provides the needed information, but is costly, and therefore assessment frequency is low. This often allows undesirable forest structures to develop that do not coincide with management objectives. Remote sensing techniques provide a potentially low-cost alternative to field-based assessment, but require the development of methods to easily and accurately extract the required information. Automated tree detection and delineation algorithms may be an effective means to accomplish this task. In this study, a tree detection-delineation algorithm designed specifically for high-resolution digital imagery of 6-year-old trees is presented and rigorously evaluated. The algorithm is based on the analysis of local transects extending outward from a potential tree apex. The crown boundary is estimated using the point of maximum rate of change in the transect data and a rule base is applied to ensure that the point is contextually suitable. This transect approach is implemented in both the tree-detection and crown-delineation phases. The tree-detection algorithm refines the results of an initial local maximum filter by providing an outline for each detected tree and retaining only one local maximum value within this outline. The crown-delineation algorithm is similar to the detection algorithm, but applies a different rule set in creating a more detailed crown outline. Results show that the algorithm\'s tree-detection accuracy was better than that using commonly applied fixed-window local maximum filters; it achieved a best result of 91%. For the crown-delineation algorithm, measured diameters from delineated crowns were within 17.9% of field measurements of diameter at the crown base on an individual tree basis and within 3% when averaged for the study. Tests of image pixel spacings from 5 to 30 cm showed that tree-detection accuracy was stable except at the lowest (30-cm) resolution where errors were unacceptable. Delineated crown-diameter accuracy was more sensitive to image resolution, decreasing consistently and nonlinearly with increasing pixel spacing. These results highlight the need for very high resolution imagery in automated object-based analysis of forest regeneration, (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.', 'Carleton Univ, Dept Geog, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.

The idea of angular signatures in spectral;pace is proposed to provide a cogent synthesis of information from spectral and angular domains. Three new metrics, angular signature slope (ASSI), length (ASLI), and intercept indices, are introduced to characterize biome signatures. The statistical analyses with these indices confirm the idea that incorporation of the directional variable should improve biome classification result.

When VF was <60%, from emergence till middle of the elongation stage, four distinct, and quite independent, spectral bands of reflectance existed in the visible range of the spectrum: 400 to 500 nm. 530 to 600 nm, near 670 nm, and around 700 nm. When VF was between 60% and 100%, reflectance in the NIR leveled off or even decreases with an increase of VF. The decreased reflectance in the NIR, occurring at or near the midseason, can be a limiting factor in the use of that spectral region for VF estimation. It was found that for VF>60%, the information content of reflectance spectra in visible range can be expressed by only two independent pairs of spectral bands: (1) the blue from 400 to 500 nm and the red near 670 nm; (2) the green around 550 rim and the red edge region near 700 rim. We propose using only the visible range of the spectrum to quantitatively estimate VF The green (as well as a 700-nm band) and the red (near 670 nm) reflectances were used in developing new indices, which were linearly proportional to wheat VF ranging from 0% to 100%. The Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) concept was used to correct indices for atmospheric effects. Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index in the form VARI=(R-green-R-red)/(R-green + R-red - R-blue) was found to be minimally sensitive to atmospheric effects allowing estimation of VF with an error of <10% in a wide range of atmospheric optical thickness. Validation of the newly suggested technique was carried out using wheat independent data sets and reflectance data obtained for cornfields in Nebraska. Predicted green VF was compared with retrieved from digital images. Despite the fact that the reflectance contrast among the visible channels is much smaller than between the visible and NIR, the sensitivity of suggested indices to moderate to high values of VF is much higher than for the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the error in VF prediction did not exceed 10%. Suggested indices will complement the widely used NDVI, ARVI, Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and others, which are based on the red and the NIR bands in VF estimation, and also Green Atmospherically Resistant Index (GARI), which is based on the green and the NIR bands.

Substantial improvements in calibration procedures, both prior to launch and during normal operations, have also been made to ensure long-term stability in the acquired spectral radiometry. Landsat 7 data acquisitions are being driven by a long-term data acquisition plan that was designed to ensure that substantially cloud-free, seasonal coverage would be recorded and archived in the US for all land areas of the globe. NASA competitively selected a Landsat Science Team, consisting of representatives from US universities and government agencies, to exploit the Landsat 7 record for global change research. This team is addressing the technical and analytical means to process and analyze the core of this observation record, and for the first time in the history of the Landsat mission, the technical and operational aspects of the mission are being driven by the goals of the US science community. The expected outcome of these efforts is a rapid improvement in understanding the Earth system, as well as conceptual knowledge that will underpin significant advancements in the application of this technology for commercial, operational, educational, and research purposes. Pathways to achieve effective Landsat continuity in the early decades of the 21st century are also being given careful attention, and there is no question that the lessons teamed from the Landsat 7 mission will strongly influence these next-generation sensor systems.

A refinement to the empirical line (EL) approach for reflectance factor retrieval (RFR) from the Landsat-5 and -7 TM and ETM+ has been proposed. The refined empirical line (REL) approach requires only one within-scene calibration target, minimal field measurements of that target, and a reasonable estimate of dn for rho (s lambda) = 0 using a radiative transfer model or values provided by this analysis. This study showed that the REL approach worked well for a 10-year Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7 ETM+ image set in Arizona and rho (s lambda) was retrieved with an estimated accuracy of 0.01. A quantitative approach was proposed to determine the suitability of a within-scene target for the REL approach, and based on historical measurements, a variety of targets met the size and brightness requirements for the REL approach. This operational approach for RFR should encourage long-term investigations of natural resources to answer critical questions regarding resource management and effects of climate changes.

The dual-excitation fluorescence light detection and ranging (DE-FLIDAR) performs a dual excitation of the Chi present in leaves, in the UV (355 nm) and visible (532 nm) part of the spectrum, the latter being used as a reference excitation not absorbed by the epidermis. Therefore, the epidermal UV absorption of vegetation can be estimated from the Chi fluorescence excitation ratio (FER). PhiF(532)/PhiF(355). Thanks to the alternated excitation by the DE-FLIDAR, the FER is immune to natural conditions in field, such as light-induced variable ChlF and leaf movement (variation of the angle of excitation). The DE-FLIDAR was used to investigate the presence of UV-absorbing compounds in individual leaves and canopies of different plant species, tobacco, pea, barley and wheat. The FER was much larger in outdoor-grown plants, indicating an accumulation of UV-absorbing compounds. Wie also analysed the epidermal UV absorption of the adaxial and abaxial side of tobacco leaves of different age. The logarithm of the FER showed a good agreement with the absorbance of methanolic extracts obtained from the same leaves. The presented DE-FLIDAR can perform up to three simultaneous fluorescence measurements; therefore, we could compare blue fluorescence (BR) to the epidermal UV absorption. In addition, a dual ratio. the red fluorescence (RF) to far-red fluorescence (FRF) emission ratio, excited at 355 and 532 nm, was shown to be linearly dependent on the Chi content. A mathematical model of leaf absorption and fluorescence, based on the Beer-Lambert\'s law, was developed to describe and analyse the fluorescence signatures obtained with the DE-FLIDAR.

Radar pulses can also penetrate vegetation to some degree depending on the wavelength and vegetation thickness. It is hypothesized that since Radarsat and SPOT images contain complementary information, flood mapping will be more efficient when the true image types are used in combination. Radarsat SAR and SPOT multi-spectral imagery from May 1998 and July 1998 were used for the flood mapping. A Radarsat S2 image (27.5 degrees incidence angle) was obtained for May 1998. To evaluate the incidence angle effect on flood mapping, a Radarsat S1 image (27.5 degrees incidence angle) and a Radarsat S7 image (47.0 degrees incidence angle) were obtained for July 1998. The Radarsat scenes were calibrated and filtered, and all imagery were orthorectified to minimize geometric distortion. A Mahala-nobis distance algorithm was used to classify the SPOT scenes, the Radarsat scenes, and a combination of the two into open water flooded vegetation, and nonflooded land The results indicate that flood mapping in both spring and summer conditions has significantly higher accuracy when Radarsat and SPOT imagery are used in combination, rather than separately. However, it is important to use Radarsat imagery acquired at low incidence angles. Classification of the SPOT scene combined with the Radarsat S1 scene achieved significantly better results than those obtained when the SPOT scene was classified in combination with the Radarsat S7 scene.

ERS SAR images covering the period from summer 1993 to summer 1995 are analyzed, and it is shown that a combination of acquisitions from summer and winter reveals areas of forest destruction, driven mainly by the summer (May) acquisition. The damaged forest is approximately the same brightness as undamaged forest is approximately the same brightness as undamaged forest in the winter but is found to be approximately 3 dB brighter in the summer. Regions of forest that have been damaged by wildfire are indistinguishable from the pollution-damaged areas. The physical basis for these observations is highlighted using a combination of knowledge of the in situ conditions and theoretical modeling. Destruction of the vegetation canopy (associated with pollution or fire) makes the radar measurements sensitive to the state of the underlying ground. During early summer (the principal time of snowmelt) a rough and wet snow surface causes an increase in backscattering coefficient in areas where the forest canopy has been destroyed. The modeling is also extended to alternative polarizations to study the potential of future Synthetic Aperture Radars, such as the Advanced SAR to be carried on board Envisat, and other systems to enhance this mapping capability.

Small-scale variations in rainfall interception occur when both rainfall and land surface are highly variable. A key parameter of interception is the amount of rain stored on vegetation. As radar backscatter is strongly influenced by the free-water content of vegetation, SAR remote sensing might be applied to analyze large-scale rainfall interception. We concentrated in this study on C-band radar and rainfall storage in forests. The backscatter sensitivity to wetness is simulated with a radiative transfer model, which has been modified to describe the changes in dimension and dielectric constant of leaves and needles due to wetting. The simulations indicate that backscatter may decrease when a sparse coniferous forest is wetted, while the backscatter of a closed forest is found to increase with 1-4 dB due to rain storage. Thus, the sensitivity to storage strongly depends on the type of forest. The simulations are empirically tested by analyzing two sets of successive SAR image pairs from the ERS tandem mission. Given the short time between these measurements, it is argued that backscatter changes are caused mainly by changes in rain storage. The observed backscatter change is compared with wetness change estimated by a stand are hydrological model using ground-based rain radar observations as input. The observed backscatter change between a wet and a dry forest varied between 0.7 dB and 2.5 dB, in the range of the simulations. It is concluded that C-band SAR is sensitive to forest wetness, although for a quantitative assessment of water storage on forest additional information on a least forest structure is needed.

The separability between the vegetation types is thus established for the sensors available at a regional scale (AVHRR, ATSR, ERS-1 SAR) and over a broad range of ecotones. The performances of the different sensors illustrate the complementarity of the presently available remote sensing techniques. A regional vegetation map was produced of a part of the Congo Basin covering about 20 million ha by the combination of the best sensors used in the present study. Each vegetation type is mapped with the most appropriate sensor in terns of spectral behavior and spatial resolution. AVHRR data are used for the distinction between forest and savanna and for overall ecosystem monitoring, ATSR data have been showed appropriate for mapping the secondary forests, while ERS SAR data are reliable for mapping the gallery-forests, the plantations, and the swamp forests. A contingency matrix has been computed between the synthetic vegetation map and the national forest map of Congo-Kinshasa. The overall source of difference is related to the confusion between lowland rain forest and swamp forest. The combination of these sensors contributes thus to a new product, the thematic content and spatial detail of which has never been achieved before at the regional level.

Results obtained fron a sensitivity analysis allowed improved allocation of resources to maximize the predictive accuracy of the model. It was found that modeled estimates of crown cover projection, canopy size, and tree densities had significant agreement with field and air photo-interpreted estimates.

The overlapping image areas were subdivided into landscape partitions. We tested the effects of amount of forest co:er, landscape phenology, atmospheric variability (e.g., haze and clouds), and alternative processing approaches on the consistency of metric values calculated for the same place and approximate time but from different images. Two of the metrics tested (average patch size and number of patches) were more sensitive to image characteristics and contained more measurement error in a change detection analysis than the others (percent forest cover and edge density). Increasing the landscape partition size moderately reduced the amount of an-or in landscape change analysis, but at the cost of reduced spatial resolution. Processes used to generalize the forest map, such as small-polygon sieving and majority filtering, were not found to consistently decrease measurement error in metric values and in some cases increased error. Predictive models of error in a forest fragmentation change analysis were developed and significantly explained up to 50% of the variation in error. We demonstrate how, in a change analysis, predicted error can be used to identify locations that exhibit change substantially greater than the error in value estimation.

Maximum likelihood, sequential maximum a posteriori (SMAP, a Bayesian image segmentation algorithm), and back propagation neural network classification algorithms were applied and their performances evaluated. Results of the separability analyses indicated that the multitemporal SAR data contained more separable landcover information than did the multispectral TM data; the highest separabilities were achieved when the TM and SAR data were combined. Classification accuracy evaluation results indicate that the SMAP algorithm out-performed the maximum likelihood algorithm which, in turn, outperformed the neural network algorithm. The best KAPPA values, using combined data, were 0.495 for SMAP, 0.0445 for maximum likelihood, and 0.432 for neural network. Corresponding overall accuracy values were 57.1%, 52.4%, and 51.2%, respectively. A comparison between lumped crop area statistics with areal sums calculated from the classified satellite data gave the highest correspondence where the SMAP algorithm was used, followed by the maximum likelihood and neural network algorithms. Based on our application, we can therefore confirm the value of a multisource optical/SAR approach for analyzing landcover and the improvements to classification achieved using the SMAP algorithm.

In a currently used approach, regional gross, net, and aboveground net primary productivity (GPP, NPP, and ANPP) are derived from the parametric model of Monteith and are calculated as the product of the fraction of incident photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy (f(APAR)) and gross, net, and aboveground net production (radiation-use) efficiencies (epsilon(g), epsilon(n), and epsilon(an)); f(APAR) being derived from indices calculated from satellite-measured reflectances in the red and near infrared. The accuracy and realism of the primary production values estimated by this approach therefore largely depend on an accurate estimation of epsilon(g), epsilon(n), and epsilon(an). However, data are scarce for production efficiencies of semiarid grasslands, and their time and spatial variations are poorly documented, often leading to large errors for the estimates. In this paper, a modelling approach taking into account relevant ecosystem processes and based on extensive field data was used to estimate time variations of epsilon(g), epsilon(n), and epsilon(an) of a shortgrass site in Arizona. These variations were explained by variations in plant water stress, temperature, leaf aging, and processes such as a respiration and changes in allocation pattern between above- and below-ground compartments. Over the 3 study years, averaged values of epsilon(g), epsilon(n), and epsilon(an) were found to be 1.92, 0.74, and 0.29 g DM (MJ IPAR)(-1), respectively. epsilon(g) and epsilon(n) exhibited large interannual and seasonal variations mainly due to changes in water limitations during the growing season. Interannual variations of epsilon(an) were much less important. However, for shorter periods, epsilon(an) exhibited very contrasting values from regrowth to senescence. The calculation of ANPP seems less prone to errors due to environmental effects when computed on an annual basis. When estimating GPP and NPP, better results are expected if water limitations are taken into account. This could be possible through the estimation of water-stress factor by using surface temperature or other indices derived from thermal infrared remote sensing data. The limitations due to temporally varying efficiencies, shown here for shortgrass ecosystems, are also relevant to all drought-exposed ecosystems, particularly those with abundant evergreen or perennial species.

It is designed to allow the derivation of accurate (+/-50 W m(-2) or +/-0.8 mm/d water evaporation) estimates of surface heat flux at the field scale (near 40 m). Such estimates will be useful for meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural studies. The instrument will also be useful for environmental monitoring, for example, frost mapping forest fires, volcano activity, thermal pollution., etc. The IRSUTE concept has been further elaborated by conducting scientific studies (modeling canopy radiative temperature, method for flux estimation, ergodicity problem, emissivity of natural surfaces, correction of atmospheric effect), by analyzing methodological aspects (definition of pixel size, overpass time, time repeat cycle, analysis of angular effects) and system specification (superposition error and MTF effects assessment). These studies have resulted in the definition of a feasible instrument corresponding to the minisatellite category (95 kg), with a high spatial resolution (40 m), four bands in the thermal infrared domain (3.5-4.0 mu m and three bands between 8.2 mu m and 11.0 mu m, with two options), a 1-day revisit, corresponding to an orbite altitude of 540 km. The narrow ground swath (40 km) precludes a global coverage; as a result IRSUTE will focus on a set of test-sites. The phase A study is now complete. The main elements of lR-SUTE are defined.

Mineral-bound ammonium is a product of ion exchange in silicate minerals and has no visible distinguishing characteristics, however, diagnostic infrared spectral features are ideal for identification using both field and airborne/spaceborne spectrometers. Establishment of a laboratory- or field-based geochemical calibration is presently a prerequisite to quantitative mapping. For this study, ammonium content of rock samples was determined by chemical analysis and reflectance spectra were measured on whole-rock samples. A linear relation was found between ammonium concentration and the depth of a 2.12 mu m ammonium absorption feature in buddingtonite. An image-map of ammonium concentration in ppm was derived (AVIRIS) data by applying the linear calibration to the AVIRIS reflectance-calibrated spectrum at each pixel. Field spectral measurements, made with a PIMA field spectrometer on a 40 m grid, were used to create a ground-truth concentration map that confirmed the AVIRIS results. Field mapping, X-ray diffraction, and petrologic studies performed in conjunction with the AVIRIS analysis show that buddingtonite is the dominant ammonium mineral in the southern Cedar Mountains, that the ammonium is located along northeast-trending basin and range normal faults, and that it is restricted to two of four crystal-rich rhyolitic tuff units of Oligocene age. This study establishes that remote geochemical mapping using imaging spectrometer data is possible, and presents a methodology that could be extended to quantitatively map other minerals that have absorption features in the short-wave infrared.

By using a variety of techniques it is possible to extract both the surface temperature and surface emissivity front the areas over which TIMS data were acquired. One such technique was tested with the data aquired during this experiment. Several TIMS images of both the east and Ic;est central sites on 2 and 4 September were processed, mid the spectral behaviors of different land cover types were determined. These included tiger bush, millet, and fallow grassland sites. There was a 5-10 K difference ii the brightness temperature over the six channels Ir;hen significant bare soil was visible. Channels 1-3 (8.2-9.4 mu m) were cooler than the longer wavelength channels (9.6-12.5 mu m), which is characteristic of soils rich in quartz. These differences in brightness were converted to emissivity differences using the max-milt difference (MMD) method. This method relies on an empirical relationship observed between the range of emissivities and the minimum value for the six TIMS channels. The MMD method was applied iteratively to several entire sce,zes for the east central site on the two days with the interesting results that Channel 5 showed very little spatial variation in emissivity and the short wavelength channels observed substantial regions with emissivities of about 0.8 or le.ss. There is excellent reproducibility when the same area is seen in different lines on the same day. However, there are differences when the same area is seen on the two days especially for the low; emissivity values. Some of these differences may be due to soil moisture differences 2-3%, which were observed for the two days. The observed surface temperatures were in good agreement with other measures, for example, vegetation temperatures agreed well with the measured air temperatures.

However, it has seldom been checked by satellite observation. This is only possible using satellites in low but non-Sun-synchronous Earth orbit, and even in this case situations allowing reciprocity verification are rare. The ScaRaB (Scanner for Radiation Budget) radiometer on board Meteor-3-07 provided non-Sun-synchronous observations of the Earth from March 1994 to February 1995. Considering only clear-sky desert scenes which may be presumed to be unchanging, enough viewing/illumination geometry pairs to check the reciprocity principle, using reflectances averaged over a small (1.25 degrees x1.25 degrees) study areas can be obtained. We define a normalized reciprocity departure, which is zero when reciprocity is perfectly respected. The distribution of this parameter shows that the reciprocity principle is verified to better than 5% in 75% of the cases (and 1% in a third of the cases). We also define a parameter analogous to the normalized reciprocity departure, measuring anisotrophy of reflectance for arbitrary viewing/illumination geometry pairs, which would be zero for Lambertian reflection. Comparing the distributions of these parameters with the normalized reciprocity departure, we show that the reciprocal viewing/illumination geometry pairs are very distinct from the arbitrary pairs. This confirmation of the Helmholtz reciprocity principle reinforces our confidence in using it to construct anisotropic reflectance function from measurements for which not all viewing or illumination geometries are sampled.

In this study, a scheme for detecting possible WDBR using TOPEX/TMR data is proposed. The geographical distribution of identified WDBR is consistent with the simultaneous presence of high sea state and intensive rainfall. Frequent occurrences of WDBR are observed in the midlatitude of the two hemispheres, particularly in the Pacific Ocean. In contrast, WDBR rarely occurs in the majority of the tropical and subtropical oceans. The global seasonality of WDBR is found to be weak as a result of the hemispheric phase opposition of sea state and rainfall in their annual variations. Knowledge of spatial distribution and temporal variation of WDBR is useful in dealing with potential systematic biases in satellite wind and wave measurements due to rain/sea interaction. It would have been interesting to compare the WDBR with coincident estimates of global rainfall from the SSM/I (Special Sensor Microwave/Imager).

Two main problems arise in the use of remote sensing data for evaluation of LST. These are the atmospheric effect and the land emissivity effect. Different algorithms have been developed to correct these two effects. In this work we present the results of a comparative test of LST algorithms. We have used AVHRR images corresponding to a flat homogeneous region characterized by the presence of natural grassland with patches of bare soil. The images cover different seasons, thus allowing for changes in surface emissivity due to changes in vegetation cover. The results show that the Ulivieri et al. algorithms and the Price algorithm are statistically indistinguishable, according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. These two algorithms provide LST estimates close to surface temperature used as ground data. We have tested also the algorithm proposed by Kerr et al., which uses a \'\'surrogate\'\' for the emissivity, the NDVI based on the visible and near-infrared radiances measured by the AVHRR firsts two channels. The use of this approach provides results close to the Ulivieri et al. algorithm. Thus suggesting the convenience of this method that does not require previous emissivity estimates. Alternative formulations for the vegetation index has been also tested with the Kerr et al. algorithm, but the best results correspond to the use of NDVI. A study of the error propagation in the different algorithms due to errors in land surface emissivity hs been also performed. The results of this study indicated that the minimum error propagation corresponds to the Ulivieri et al. algorithm while the Price algorithm presents the maximum one. The error propagation shows a thermal dependence for all the tested algorithms except for the Ulivieri et al. algorithm. This thermal dependence is very important for Prata and Platt algorithm.

And how can this be validated? Solutions to these questions were approached by examining how the 660 nm signal of six forest stands vary through four different scales of same-sensor imagery, four traditional resampling techniques, and a new object-specific resampling technique. Analysis of the original and modeled datasets suggests that appropriately upscaled imagery represents a more accurate scene-model than an image obtained at the upscaled resolution. Results further indicate the need for a multiscale approach to feature extraction and upscaling, as no single spatial resolution of imagery appears optimal for detecting or upscaling the varying sized, shaped, and spatially distributed objects within a scene. By employing the human eye as a model, we describe a novel object-specific approach for addressing this challenge. Upscaling evaluation is based on visual interpretation, an understanding of the applied resampling theories, and the root mean square error results of 6000 samples collected from a 10 m CASI scene, and from 1.5 m, 3 m, and 5 m same site CASI images upscaled to 10 m.

The biomass levels present in the test stands ranged between 0.0 and, 44.5 kg m(-2). Two SIR-C data sets were used: one collected in April, 1994, when the soil conditions were very wet and the canopy was slightly wet from dew and a second collected in October, 1994, when the soils and canopy were dry. During the October mission, pine needles were completely flushed and the foliar biomass was twice as great in the forest stands as in April. Four methods were evaluated to estimate total biomass: one including a straight multiple linear correlation between total biomass and the various SIR-C channels; another including a ratio of the L-band HV/C-band HV channels; and two others requiring multiple steps, where linear regression equations for different stand components (height, basal area, and crown or branch biomass) were used as the basis for estimating total biomass. lt was shown that the data collected in October (dry soil conditions) were better for estimation of biomass than the data collected in April (wet soil conditions). Overall, a multistep approach resulted in the lowest root mean square (RMS) errors (5.91 kg m(-2)) when biomass levels were (20 kg m(-2)). For all biomass levels, the simple regression technique resulted in the lowest RMS errors (8.1 kg m(-2)). The multiple-step approaches have the additional advantage of being able to provide estimates of different components of stand structure and biomass, such as average tree height, basal area, branch biomass, canopy biomass, trunk biomass, and foliage biomass. The LHV channel is the critical element in all the biomass equations, as would be expected from the body of literature. The addition of other channels-generally, CHV or CHH-significantly improves biomass estimates, whether as a ratio or as additional terms in a regression equation.

This study area was included as a test site for ecological studies during the Spaceborne Imaging Radar C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) missions in 1994. The SIR-C/X-SAR missions provided the first opportunity for Earth scientists to receive multifrequency and multipolarization SAR data from space from a single platform. During the Space Radar Laboratory missions in April and October 1994, images from AIRSAR and SIR-C/X-SAR were acquired for the same areas within a few days of each other.   In this paper, the capabilities of AIRSAR and SIR-C/X-SAR images for characterizing a northern hardwood-boreal transitional forest were evaluated and compared. The use of multiple frequency, polarimetric information to produce forest-cover classification, biomass estimates, and forest spatial pattern analysis were investigated. The results from SIR-C/X-SAR compared with those from AIRSAR were generally similar despite different available frequency (C-band, L-band, X-band vs. C-band, L-band P-band) and resolution (25.0 m vs. 8.3 m).   AIRSAR data better enabled the mapping of stands of hardwood and mixed: forests than did SIR-C/X-SAR data. However, SIR-C/X-SAR produced better classification results for conifer forest stands. There was no great benefit from using higher resolution for classification except for forest stands in which there were mixtures of species (i.e., hardwood and softwood). A comparison of the image data also showed that both instruments could provide reasonable estimates of biomass density up to about 15 kg/m(2). At higher biomass levels, both AIRSAR and SIR-C showed the well-known biomass saturation effect. The average biomass densities determined from the AIRSAR and SIR-C images were reasonably close at 9.7 kg/m(2) and 9.0 kg/m(2), respectively. Finally, spatial character of the image data was examined by using perimeter and area relations and lacunarity analysis. The results were consistent between. the two instruments and showed that the forest opening patterns were self-similar for openings greater than about 3 ha.

PC2 plot is related to the overall reflectance (albedo) along the PCI axis and to the spectral inversion around 1100 nm along the PC2 axis. The fatter can be characterised by any spectral ratio of reflectance values taken before and after the inversion wavelength. Two major groups were thus identified: titanium-rich (anatase, ilmenite) laterites and aluminum phosphate laterites. The former presented spectra with low to intermediate albedos and lower near-infrared/visible and very near-infrared reflectance ratio values. The phosphate-rich samples presented intermediate to high albedos and higher reflectance ratios. Titaniferous laterites have a greater content of opaques than the phosphates which are usually richer in iron oxides. The presence of titanium lowers the albedo whereas iron oxides absorb only in the visible and very near-infrared.

Space, White Sands, and the Sonora Desert are used as calibration targets. Three different calibrations were performed: 1) using the stretched data (i.e., retransmitted data operationally destriped using NOAA\'s normalization procedure) and considering individual VISSR detectors separately, 2) using the stretched data averaged over the eight VISSR detectors; and 3) using the stretched data further destriped according to Simpson et al. (1995) and then averaged over the eight VISSR detectors. The third approach provides the best results (i.e., best equalization of the detectors). Because of uncertainties in the modeling of the VISSR radiance, using separate calibration coefficients for each detector (first approach) may not reduce the striping significantly. The calibration coefficients exhibit low frequency changes that are not correlated with seasonal variations in the extraterrestrial solar irradiance. High frequency fluctuations are large, and they are due in part,to NOAA\'s normalization procedure and to calibration uncertainties. Differences between the calibration coefficients of individual detectors also are large, as well as changes between consecutive VISSR acquisition times. Comparison of untampered (retransmitted data but not operationally destriped using NOAA\'s normalization procedure) \'\'Wednesday\'\' 1848 GMT data with stretched 1831 and 1901 GMT data indicates that NOAA\'s normalization procedure, though imperfect, reduces substantially the stripes present in the unstretched data.

Top of the canopy (TOC) NDVI and FAPAR increase with ground cover and plant leaf area. Their functional response to leaf orientation, solar zenith angle and atmospheric optical depth is similar. For instance, planophile canopies (mostly horizontal leaves) have a higher FAPAR and TOC NDVI than erectophile canopies (mostly erect leaves). However, FAPAR and TOC NDVI respond differently to other parameters such as soil reflectance and leaf optical properties. For example, an increase in soil reflectance increases FAPAR but decreases TOC NDVI. Atmospheric and bidirectional effects confound the interpretation of top of the atmosphere (TOA) NDVI. The transmissivity of NDVI, defined as the ratio TOA/TOC NDVI, decreases with increasing atmospheric turbidity and solar zenith angle. Sensing about the nadir directions under clear sky conditions and moderate solar incidence angles can result in transmissivities as high as 0.8. There are sufficient causal grounds for relating FAPAR to NDVI.

THE OPTIMAL SPATIAL-RESOLUTION', 'REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT', 'English', 'Article', NULL, 'SCALE; CLASSIFICATION', 'The prime objective of this study was to propose and test a method to identify the optimal spatial resolutions for detection and discrimination of coniferous classes in a temperate forested environment. The approach is based on the paradigm that there is an intricate relationship between the definition and the measurement of geographical entities and implies the following steps: 1) a priori define the geographical entities under investigation, 2) determine an optimization criterion for the choice of a sampling system, 3) progressively aggregate data acquired from a fine spatial sampling grid, 4) apply the optimization criterion on the series of spatially aggregated data, and 5) verify the validity of the results obtained in relation to the goal of the study. Airborne MEIS-II data, acquired at 0.5 m in eight spectral bands of the visible spectrum, were used for the study. Fourteen forest classes, at the stand level, were defined on the basis of four attributes: species, density, height, and organization of the trees. Representative sites for each forest class were selected. From the center of each site, the spatial resolution of the original data was degraded to 29.5 m, with an increment of 1 m, using an averaging window algorithm. The intraclass variance was calculated for each forest class, at every spatial resolution and for the eight spectral bands. The minimal variance was used as the indicator of the optimal spatial resolution. To evaluate the importance of the optimal resolution for class discrimination, a bivariate test of variance was performed for each pair of forest class considered at their optimal spatial resolution. Profiles of spectral separability were also established in relation to the whole series of spatial resolutions. The results show that, for all coniferous classes and for the eight spectral bands considered in the study, there is a minimal value in intraclass variance that indicates the optimal spatial resolution for each class, varying between 2.5 and 21.5 m. The optimal spatial resolution is primarily affected by the spatial and structural parameters of the forest stands. The analysis of variance between each pair of forest classes considered at their respective optimal spatial resolution reveals that all classes are significantly different in at least two spectral bands, except for 10 pairs. The spectral separability of the forest classes is at a maximum at, or very close to, their optimal spatial resolution. The study confirms the validity of the concept of optimal spatial resolution and proposes an original solution to the problem of the adequate scale of measurement for geographical entities.', 'CANADA CTR REMOTE SENSING, OTTAWA, ON, CANADA.

Full and half strings out to 60-degrees, 45-degrees, 30-degrees, and 15-degrees were tested on ground data of a wide range of cover types and sun angles.  Both a visible and near infrared band (AVHRR Bands 1 and 2) were tested using a knowledge-based system called VEG.  Using string techniques that calculate a single coefficient from an internal spectral data base, the results showed small errors for the full string +/- 60-degrees (less than 4% error), HIRIS like data (less than 5% error), and MODIS like data (less than 7% error).  Much larger errors occur in those cases where long extrapolations must be calculated (e.g., strings to only 15-degrees and 30-degrees).  Systems that view fore and aft out to 60-degrees would be desirable to minimize errors, assuming atmospheric corrections could be made at these angles.  HIRIS (views 60-degrees in forward and 30-degrees in aft directions) is a good compromise by viewing out to 60-degrees in only one direction and increases the error by approximately 2% or less.  MODIS (full string +/- 45-degrees) still has a relatively small error of approximately 5% or less.

The computational results show, in particular, the following features. Degree of polarization observed at the Brewster angle in the solar plane is suitable to derive cloud optical thickness (tau) for large solar zenith angles, particularly in the case of tau < approximately 5 while the radiance off the sunglint is suitable to infer tau in the range of tau < approximately 30. However, for improvement of accuracy, cloud information such as thermodynamic phase, size distribution, and shape of cloud particles should be separately obtained, in particular for utilization of degree of polarization. The difference of degree of polarization appears between water particles and hexagonal ice crystals at the top of the atmosphere when the scattering angle is within 50-100-degrees. Using this property, it should be possible to distinguish the thermodynamic phase of cloud particles. Furthermore, the feasibility of discrimination of the shape of the hexagonal ice crystals using the position of the neutral point is discussed, where phase angle is shown to shift to the backscattering direction at tau < 10. Hence, it is necessary to obtain tau separately.RP MASUDA, K (通讯作者)，METEOROL RES INST, 1-1 NAGAMINE, TSUKUBA, IBARAKI 305, JAPAN.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 25, 12, 12, 0, 3, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

TIMS provides coverage of the 8-12-mu-m thermal infrared band in six contiguous channels so that it is possible to observe the spectral behaviour of the surface emissivity over this wavelength interval.  The surfaces observed ranged from bare soils to coniferous forest.  As expected the fully vegetated fields, a small lake, and a coniferous forest exhibited little or no spectral variation.  However, the bare soil surfaces had a 5-10-degrees-C difference in radiant temperature over the TIMS channels with the three shorter wavelength channels (8.0-mu-m < lambda < 9.6-mu-m) having lower temperatures than the three longest wavelength channels.  This qualitatively agrees with laboratory measurements done by a group from the Universite Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg on soil samples from this area.  The quantitative agreement of the relative variation after correcting for atmospheric effects is good, but does depend on the day and location of the sample in the field.  This spectral variation arises from the absorption of infrared radiation due to the stretching vibrations of the silicon - oxygen bonds of silicates in the soil.

This study presents a new river WSE retrieval approach that combines ICESat-2 derived cross-sections and Sentinel-2 observed sub-pixel river widths to achieve an effective HD model calibration. The unknown channel Manning coefficient, river bed elevation and cross-sectional shape in the HD model are calibrated simultaneously through a Bayesian optimization algorithm. The complete workflow is implemented in a flood-prone reach in Yiluo River basin. Results show that the WSE retrieved by the new approach has a higher spatiotemporal resolution in narrower rivers than that of Sentinel-3 altimetry derived WSE, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) varies from 0.25 to 0.59 m against in-situ WSE. The HD model calibrated by WSE retrieved by the new approach simulates the WSE with RMSE of 0.36 m and the flood extent with critical success index (CSI) of 0.60 in validation, outperforming the results of the HD model calibrated by Sentinel-3 altimetry derived WSE, with corresponding results of 0.49 m and 0.58, respectively. Additional case studies in the Maqu and Lingkou reaches further demonstrate the applicability of the WSE retrieval approach proposed in this study for HD model calibration in different types of rivers.

However, due to the influence of platform or antenna perturbations, SAR Doppler shift measurements are subject to electromagnetic pointing error (EPE). These errors can typically be reduced by using echo information from land areas (including islands) within the SAR images to correct the Doppler shift. This allows the successful estimation of Doppler shifts due to sea surface factors and, in turn, the retrieval of ocean currents in the radar line-of-sight. However, in cases where SAR images lack data over land, uncorrectable EPE can result in significant inaccuracies in the retrieval of ocean currents. This study utilizes data captured by Sentinel-1A on four orbits in the Florida Strait region of the Gulf Stream from July 2020 to October 2022 to investigate the variation characteristics of EPE. To address the issues of calculating these in SAR images lacking land data, an EPE fitting method is proposed. The correction significantly reduces the error of S1A retrieved current velocity compared with line-of-sight current velocity from the HYCOM model and in situ HF radar, indicating that the proposed method provides an effective way to reduce the impact of EPE in SAR images, even when land is not directly observed.', '[Yang, Zhonghao; Wang, Jing; Miao, Hongli] Ocean Univ China, Fac Informat Sci & Engn, Qingdao, Peoples R China.

Although the original ATL07 product classifies the sea ice surface into snow-covered ice and open water (dark leads and specular leads), it has two critical issues: (1) it does not distinguish thin ice (gray ice) from thick/snow-covered ice or open water and (2) it involves uncertainties in the dark lead determination. To address these issues and obtain more accurate lead fraction and freeboard estimation, in this study, we assess a data-driven machine learning approach for sea ice surface type classification from the ATL07 product. A total of 17 IS2 tracks covering the Ross Sea in February, March, September, October, and November 2019 are used in this study. For training and testing the neural network (NN) models, we label the ATL07 data into three surface types: thick/snow-covered sea ice, thin/gray sea ice, and open water based on the coincident Sentinel-2 optical images. We use six variables from the ATL07 data: background rate, photon rate, relative surface height, width of height distribution, number of laser pulses, and difference in mean and median height, with the first three variables found to be the most significant in determining surface types. Our spatiotemporal test shows that the NN models can be applied to the ATL07 dataset with similar to 99% accuracy in the Ross Sea, and the beam test shows that the difference in the accuracy for three beams is negligible. While the current ATL07 product captures only similar to 5% of thin ice and similar to 81% of open water correctly, our NN models capture similar to 90% of both open water and thin ice leads successfully. When we qualitatively assess the surface classification of the NN models by using the coincident optical and radar images, our NN models do not show significant misclassification issues both in the daytime and nighttime and both in the winter and summer seasons. Compared to the IS2 ATL10 sea ice freeboard product, the ability of our NN model to separate thin ice and open water from snow-covered/thick ice is significant in freeboard estimation, especially for winter and highly packed sea ice areas. Open water and thin ice classes also improve mapping lead fraction and floe size distribution.', '[Koo, Younghyun; Xie, Hongjie; Ackley, Stephen F.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.

In the U.S. Corn Belt this plant water is dominated by water in crop tissue. Microwave remote sensing provides an opportunity to measure crop water at a 30 to 40-km spatial scale across the U.S. Corn Belt. Crop water has been shown to be directly proportional to L-band vegetation optical depth (VOD) through a proportionality constant called the b-parameter. NASA\'s SMAP satellite uses a static b-parameter of 0.11 for cropland areas, however the b-parameter varies with crop type. This study answers the following research questions. First, does the value of the b-parameter value vary across the U.S. Corn Belt given the observed differences in the proportions of corn and soybeans grown across the region? Secondly, does the SMAP b-parameter value vary throughout the growing season given the significant change in the distribution of crop water within tissue types throughout the growing season? Since in-situ measurements of the b-parameter are higher for corn, we hypothesize that as the relative fraction of corn in a SMAP pixel increases, the b-parameter will increase. We test this hypothesis using satellite scale modeling of crop water and SMAP L2 DCA VOD measurements at 18 sites across the U.S. Corn Belt for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017. For each site year, the crop water for the satellite pixel is simulated using the Agro-IBIS crop model and is weighted according to the proportion of corn and soybeans grown in that location. We find that there is no statistically significant correlation between the relative corn fraction and the SMAP b-parameter across the U.S. Corn Belt and that the current SMAP cropland value of 0.11 is appropriate for the beginning of the growing season (growing degree days (GDD) < 10<(0)over bar>0. C center dot day). However, we find that the b-parameter in the second half of the growing season (GDD >= 10 (0) over bar0.C center dot day), during the crop reproductive stages, has an average value of 0.17. The results from this study indicate that while there is no change in the b-parameter due to the proportion of crops growing in a satellite pixel, there may be a difference in b-parameter due to changing water distribution within the crop canopy due to the development of crop reproductive structures (ears and pods) during the second half of the growing season.', '[Hartman, Theodore; Cirone, Richard; Hornbuckle, Brian K.; Vanloocke, Andy] Iowa State Univ, Dept Agron, Ames, IA 50011 USA.

Enrolled forest carbon projects and verification entities typically rely on probabilistically sampled field data and design-based (DB) estimators to estimate carbon storage and characterize uncertainty. However, this methodology requires a large amount of field data to achieve sufficient precision and collection of these data can be prohibitively expensive. This has spurred interest in developing regional-scale maps of forest biomass that incorporate remote sensing data as an alternative to collecting expensive plot data. These maps are often generated using machine learning (ML) algorithms that combine remote sensing products and field measurements. While these maps can produce estimates across large geographic regions at fine spatial resolutions, the estimates are prone to bias and do not have associated uncertainty estimates. Here, we assess one such map developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\'s Carbon Monitoring System. We consider model-assisted (MA) and geostatistical model-based (GMB) estimators to address map bias and uncertainty quantification. The MA and GMB estimators use a sample of field observations as the response, and the ML-produced map as an auxiliary variable to achieve statistically defensible predictions. We compare MA and GMB estimator performance to DB and direct (DR) estimators. This assessment considers both counties and a small areal extent experimental forest, all within Oregon USA. Results suggest the MA and GMB estimators perform similar to the DB estimator at the state level and in counties containing many field plots. But in counties with moderate to small field sample sizes, the GMB and MA estimators are more precise than the DB estimator. As within-county sample sizes get smaller, the GMB estimator tends to outperform MA. Results also show the DR estimator\'s state-level estimates are substantially larger than the DB, MA and GMB estimates, indicating that that the DR estimator may be biased. When assessing the GMB estimator for the experimental forest, we find the GMB estimator has sufficient precision for stand-level carbon accounting even when no field observations are available within the stand. Plot-level GMB uncertainty interval coverage probabilities were estimated and showed adequate coverage.

The long-time evolution of the unstable slopes in reservoir areas after the impoundments remain poorly understood. Among the technologies applied to detecting and monitoring unstable slopes, interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology is one of the most effective. However, owing to the slopes in a reservoir suffering from periodic water-level fluctuations, InSAR technology has shortcomings for monitoring unstable slopes with large displacement for a long time. In this study, a post-processing method of InSAR and a practical strategy were proposed to monitor the long-time evolution of the unstable slopes in reservoir areas both spatially and temporally. The strategy can capture the evolution trends of the unstable slopes based on the variations in their deformation areas with reservoir water-level fluctuations for a long time. The case study was carried out in the Xiluodu reservoir area of China. The monitoring data of the unstable slopes before and after reservoir impoundment were extracted from multi-source SAR data, including those from ALOS-1, ENVISAT ASAR, and Sentinel-1. It was found that there were 40 unstable slopes before the reservoir impoundment and 152 unstable slopes after the reservoir impoundment. Of the 152 slopes, 142 slopes (94%) began deforming in the first 3 years after reservoir impoundment, 15 slopes have been experiencing continuous deformation, and 137 slopes underwent intermittent deformation. The areas of 79 slopes (52%) increased during the water-level drawdown periods and decreased during the rising periods. The areas of 22 slopes (14%) demonstrated the opposite trend, and the areas of 51 slopes (34%) increased independently of the water-level fluctuations. In terms of evolution trends in the deformation area, 30% of slopes experienced a decreasing trend, 15% were under a constant deformation trend, and 55% showed an increasing trend. The distribution of the unstable slopes varied from the dam site to the end of the reservoir, and most of them favorited the areas where slope angle and height were 20-35 degrees and 30-300 m, respectively. The soil slopes composed of the previous landslide deposits were prone to deformation, followed by the dip to overdip layered rock slopes.', '[Li, Lingjing; Wen, Baoping] China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Water Resources & Environm, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.

In our study, multi-temporal, multispectral, and hyperspectral data from an Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 3 cm were applied to a permanent research plot (1 ha), while spaceborne PlanetScope multi-temporal data with GSD of 3 m were used for a wider area of 250 ha. The main aim of the study was to evaluate the potential of these data for monitoring vegetation at the species level in the Central European relict arcto-alpine tundra (in the Krkonos?e Mountains, Czech Republic). We evaluated both types of data and their performance for various classifiers, and the benefits of adding multitemporal aspects to the classification and robustness of remote sensing for monitoring grass species. This study addresses the requirements of nature conservation practices in the Krkonos?e Mts. National Park to find a suitable method for monitoring changes in dominant and expanding grass species in response to global warming. The object-based Support Vector Machine, pixel-based Random Forest and Maximum Likelihood classifiers were evaluated. We confirmed that the UAV multispectral and hyperspectral data with GSD of 3 cm can monitor dominant grass species (Nardus stricta, Calamagrostis villosa, Molinia caerulea, Deschampsia cespitosa) in tundra with excellent accuracy (95.9% and 94.0% overall accuracy for multi-temporal and mono-temporal composites, respectively). The best F1-scores for these species ranged from 94.7 to 99.4%. However, the accuracies were substantially lower for small and sparse growing species (Avenella flexuosa and Carex bigelowii). Unexpectedly, the UAV multispectral and hyperspectral data yielded comparable results. The multi-temporal approach improved the accuracy of all types of data. Overall, we confirmed the robustness of the remote sensing approach for grass monitoring at the species level given the high spatial match between various classification outputs. Our study established a workflow for reliable monitoring of tundra grass vegetation according to the requirements of nature conservation and proposed innovative measures for the spatial accuracy assessment of classification outputs.', '[Kupkova, Lucie; Cervena, Lucie; Potuckova, Marketa; Lysak, Jakub; Roubalova, Marketa; Hrazsky, Zaboj] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Appl Geoinformat & Cartog, Albertov 6, Prague, Czech Republic.

We use the probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (pPCA) to examine the spatio-temporal variations of vertical displacements from 98 GPS stations located in 9 regions of the world recognized as those where changes in groundwater masses are the most significant. To study the Earth\'s crust displacements induced by changes in groundwater masses, we remove from GPS displacements those induced by changes in masses of other water storage components using the WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM). For validation purposes, displacements predicted by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) missions from which the WGHM compartments other than groundwater are subtracted are also used. We estimate an average global trend of vertical displacements induced by groundwater mass changes equal to 0.4 +/- 0.17 mm/yr for GRACE-WGHM differences. We observe that this trend is overestimated by groundwater-induced displacements estimated for GPS-WGHM differences for several regions around the world and mostly underestimated by WGHM. Spatio-temporal patterns are very coherent between GPS-WGHM differences and GRACEWGHM differences with significant signatures observed for periods of intense natural and/or human-induced groundwater mass changes. We show that the determined GRACE-WGHM differences and GPS-WGHM differences capture most of the wet and dry periods reflected by the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). We also find that groundwater-induced displacements estimated from the three datasets we use, show a prominent 6-year cycle.

Conventional methods for measuring the crop nutrients such as wet chemical analysis of grains are time-consuming and cost-prohibitive and, consequently, unsuitable for the consistent quantification of nutrients across space and time. In this study, we propose a new method that is using PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) and Sentinel-2 images to estimate the nutrient concentrations of crop grains before harvest. We collected grain samples for corn, rice, soybean, and wheat from a farm situated in Italy and measured their nutrient concentrations in the lab. These measurements together with the PRISMA and Sentinel-2 images acquired at the main phases of crop development (vegetative, reproductive, maturity) were used as input for twoband vegetation indices (TBVIs) and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) to predict Calcium (Ca), Iron (Fe), Potassium (K), Magnesium (Mg), Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Sulphur (S) and Zinc (Zn). Models\' performances were assessed using the coefficient of determination (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For PRISMA images, the best prediction results were obtained for P in soybean (R2 = 0.69), K in soybean (R2 = 0.66), Mg in soybean (R2 = 0.58), Fe in soybean (R2 = 0.57), K in wheat (R2 = 0.57), K in corn (R2 = 0.55), P in wheat (R2 = 0.51), S in rice (R2 = 0.58) using TBVIs.

Sugarcane cultivators could potentially benefit from these data by using them to assist operational and management practices. However, first, thorough understanding is needed of Sentinel-1 backscatter and its behavior over sugarcane canopies. In this study, we aimed to improve understanding of how Sentinel-1 backscatter responds to sugarcane yield variability and waterlogging. In order to do so we focused on an irrigated sugarcane plantation in Xinavane, Mozambique. In the analysis presented, we assessed different polarizations, their ratio, and benchmarked them against optical indices and passive microwave observations in different seasons. With the help of a large sugarcane yield dataset, we analyzed how backscatter relates to sucrose yield variability in different seasons. We found VV backscatter related to the stalk development, the most important reservoir for sucrose accumulation. In addition, in a season with reported waterlogging, optical and radar observations showed a delay in sugarcane crop development. Further analysis showed the presence of water underneath the canopy caused an increase in all polarizations and the cross ratio (CR). The results imply that Sentinel-1 backscatter contains information on both waterlogging under the canopy as well as sucrose development in the stalk. By isolating and quantifying the impact of waterlogging on backscatter, it will be possible to further quantify sucrose development with backscatter observations and identify waterlogging simultaneously.', '[den Besten, Nadja; Jackson, Daniel; Aouizerats, Benjamin; de Jeu, Richard; Burger, Rogier; Houborg, Rasmus] Planet Labs Inc, San Francisco, CA 94107 USA.

Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites can provide such observations, but algorithms are still needed that perform well across diverse climate and vegetation conditions. We developed surface inundation algorithms for Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, respectively, at 12 sites across the conterminous United States (CONUS), covering a total of >536,000 km2 and representing diverse hydrologic and vegetation landscapes. Each scene in the 5-year (2017-2021) time series was classified into open water, vegetated water, and non-water at 20 m resolution using variables from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, as well as variables derived from topographic and weather datasets. The Sentinel-1 algorithm was developed distinct from the Sentinel-2 model to explore if and where the two time series could potentially be integrated into a single highfrequency time series. Within each model, open water and vegetated water (vegetated palustrine, lacustrine, and riverine wetlands) classes were mapped. The models were validated using imagery from WorldView and PlanetScope. Classification accuracy for open water was high across the 5-year period, with an omission and commission error of only 3.1% and 0.9% for the Sentinel-1 algorithm and 3.1% and 0.5% for the Sentinel-2 algorithm, respectively. Vegetated water accuracy was lower, as expected given that the class represents mixed pixels. The Sentinel-2 algorithm showed higher accuracy (10.7% omission and 7.9% commission error) relative to the Sentinel-1 algorithm (28.4% omission and 16.0% commission error). Patterns over time in the proportion of area mapped as open or vegetated water by the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 algorithms were charted and correlated for a subset of all 12 sites. Our results showed that the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 algorithm open water time series can be integrated at all 12 sites to improve the temporal resolution, but sensor-specific differences, such as sensitivity to vegetation structure versus pixel color, complicate the data integration for mixed-pixel, vegetated water. The methods developed here provide inundation at 5-day (Sentinel-2 algorithm) and 12-day (Sentinel-1 algorithm) time steps to improve our understanding of the short- and long-term response of surface water to climate and land use drivers in different ecoregions.', '[Vanderhoof, Melanie K.; Nieuwlandt, Peter; Sagehorn, Mallory] US Geol Survey, Geosci & Environm Change Sci Ctr, Denver Fed Ctr, POB 25046,MS 980, Denver, CO 80225 USA.

The urban-rural gradient in vegetation greenness trends and their responses to biogeochemical drivers (e.g. elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate warming) and land-cover changes, however, remain un-clear. Here we used satellite-derived enhanced vegetation index to examine the greenness trends for 1500-plus cities in China for 2000-2019. We developed a conceptual framework to differentiate between the contributions of four key drivers to the greenness trends: two biogeochemical drivers, a background biogeochemical driver (BBD) and an urban biogeochemical driver (UBD), and two drivers of land-cover changes, urban expansion or densification (UED) and urban green recovery (UGR). We find that the greening trends gradually decreased from urban cores to urban new towns and then to browning trends in urban fringes. The significant greening in urban cores was mainly contributed by BBD (25.6%) and UBD (52.3%). While the minor greening in urban new towns was contributed by both BBD (33.1%) and UBD (24.1%) and weakened by UED (-39.7%). The UED (-64.4%) dominated the browning in urban fringes.

In this regard, Sentinel-2A/B offer frequent large-area observations, which have not yet been fully exploited for a spatially continuous drought monitoring of highly dynamic Central European grasslands. In this study, we developed a generalized drought monitoring framework for Central European grasslands linking Sentinel-2 data, field survey information, and spectral unmixing. We first implemented a consistent and repeatable strategy to obtain a grassland spectral library supported by the Europe-wide Land Use/ Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS) and multitemporal Sentinel-2 data. Our library captured the spectral variability of PV, NPV, and soil cover from 12 grassland areas distributed along typical environmental and land use gradients of Central Europe. We trained a generalized regression-based unmixing model with synthetic data generated from the spectral library and compared fractional cover estimates to a multitemporal reference dataset. PV, NPV, and soil were estimated with good accuracy, achieving MAEs of 6.54%, 13.7%, and 12.2%, respectively. Local unmixing models trained on area-specific library subsets were overall outperformed by the generalized model highlighting the value of a comprehensive grassland library for generalized spectral unmixing. Based on fractional cover time series from 2017 to 2021, we calculated time series of the grassland-specific Normalized Difference Fraction Index (NDFI) capturing proportions of NPV and soil relative to PV. Comparison of annual growing season drought metrics derived from the NDFI to annual meteorological drought statistics from the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) as well as the Soil Moisture Index (SMI) revealed widespread drought impacts on grasslands during the persistent drought period in Central Europe from 2018 to 2020. While impacts on grasslands overall closely followed meteorological and soil drought conditions, regionally varying drought metrics underline that local to regional environmental and hydrological conditions shaped the drought response of Central European grasslands. Our study emphasizes the value of combining Sentinel-2 data, field survey information, and spectral unmixing to enable drought monitoring across grassland gradients of Central Europe with Sentinel-2 time series.', '[Kowalski, Katja; Okujeni, Akpona; Hostert, Patrick] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter den Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.

Satellite observations provide us with a great opportunity to monitor such emissions at large scales. However, existing satellite-based estimates of Indonesian fire emissions vary considerably in magnitude, differing by a factor of four. Here, we aim to improve Indonesian fire emissions estimates through improved calculations of fire radiative energy (FRE: time-integrated fire radiative power (FRP)) and smoke aerosol emission coefficients (Ce) using multiple new-generation satellite observations. Specifically, peatland and non-peatland Ce values were derived from FRP and emission rates of smoke aerosols based on Visible Infrared Im-aging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) active fire and aerosol products. FRE was calculated from the diurnal FRP cycle that was reconstructed by fusing cloud-corrected FRP retrievals from the high temporal-resolution Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) with those from high spatial-resolution VIIRS. Then, fuel type-specific Ce values and fused AHI-VIIRS FRE were used to produce hourly and daily fire emission data from 2015 to 2020 across Indonesia. To evaluate AHI-VIIRS estimates, we generated a reference dataset of total particulate matter (TPM) by computing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol observation differences from successive Terra and Aqua satellites overpasses over a set of manually-selected smoke plumes. AHI-VIIRS-based fire emissions correlated significantly with the MODIS reference data (r = 0.84; p < 0.001). The inter -annual time series analysis of AHI-VIIRS emissions showed extreme variability (similar to 26 fold), with the greatest amount in 2015 (6.09 Tg) and the least in 2020 (0.23 Tg), during the study period. Mean annual fire emissions distributed across Indonesia\'s islands were primarily from Kalimantan (43.8%) and Sumatra (41.7%), followed by Sulawesi (5.6%), Java (4.5%), and Papua (4.4%). Additionally, contributions of Indonesian fire emissions from peatland, forest, cropland, and savanna/grassland fuel types were 51.4%, 37.8%, 7.0%, and 3.8%, respectively, during the fire season of the strong 2015 El Nino event. The analysis suggests that the majority of Indonesian fire emissions are very likely associated with large-scale land use conversion from peatland to agriculture, as well as prolonged droughts induced by El Nino events.', '[Lu, Xiaoman; Zhang, Xiaoyang; Li, Fangjun] South Dakota State Univ, Geospatial Sci Ctr Excellence, Dept Geog & Geospatial Sci, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.

Change detection methods provide access to recovery trajectories of trend and seasonality and detect abrupt changes in LST time series, but a comprehensive evaluation of the published methods is lacking. In this study, simulated LST data with a temporal resolution of 8 days under different scenarios were used to evaluate the performance of three commonly used methods: Detecting Breakpoints and Estimating Segments in Trend (DBEST), Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST), and Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonal change, and Trend (BEAST). The results obtained using the simulated data indicated that BEAST was the best method for decomposing LST time series into trend and seasonality (mean RMSEs were 0.28 K and 0.27 K, respectively) and for detecting abrupt changes in these two components (mean F1 scores were 0.83 and 0.95, respectively). BFAST was less robust to high-complexity data (F1: 0.56 and 0.52, RMSE: 1.34 K and 1.46 K). 0.91 K and 1.29 K). DBEST is recommended to capture component details because it yields the least generalized output (F1 for trend: 0.37, RMSE: 0.64 K and 1.37 K). Both BFAST and DBEST exhibited reduced accuracy when the time-series data has long-lasting continuous missing data. An application using the 20-year MODIS LST time series supports the results obtained using the simulated data. BEAST exhibited the highest detection accuracy for land cover change (13 correct detections among 15 true changes), followed by DBEST (9) and BFAST (7). All three methods were ineffective for detecting low-magnitude disturbances: wildfires, heatwaves, and cold spells due to their low intensity or short duration. To reduce the non-negligible commission error of BEAST, this study proposes an improved BEAST, which eliminates the false breakpoints in BEAST using a set of thresholds. Compared with BEAST, the user accuracy of the improved BEAST was significantly increased by 13.9% in the simulated data, resulting in an F1 increase of 0.04, and 15 false breakpoints were eliminated among 53 detected disturbances in the MODIS LST time series. This study outlines commonly used change detection methods and offers guidance for choosing the optimal method to detect changes in LST time series. Furthermore, suggestions on the determination of parameters and false breakpoints elimination in the improved BEAST enable it more practical.', '[Li, Jing; Wu, Hua; You, Nanshan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

The spaceborne, full-waveform LiDAR from GEDI provides sample footprints of canopy structure, expected to cover about 4% of the land area following two years of operation. Several options are available for estimating AGB at different geographical scales. Using GEDI sample data alone, gridded biomass predictions are based on hybrid inference which correctly propagates errors due to the modeling and accounts for sampling variability, but this method requires at least two GEDI tracks in the area of interest. However, there are significant gaps in GEDI coverage and in some areas of interest GEDI data may need to be combined with other wall-to-wall remotely sensed (RS) data, such as those from multispectral or SAR sensors. In these cases, we may employ hierarchical model-based (HMB) inference that correctly considers the additional model errors that result from relating GEDI data to the wallto-wall data. Where predictions are possible from both hybrid and HMB inference the question arises which framework to choose, and under what circumstances? In this paper, we make progress towards answering these questions by comparing the performance of the two prediction frameworks under conditions relevant for the GEDI mission. Conventional model-based (MB) inference with wall-to-wall TanDEM-X data was applied as a baseline prediction framework, which does not involve GEDI data at all. An important feature of the study was the comparison of AGB predictors in terms of both standard deviation (SD: the square root of variance) and root mean square error (RMSE: the square root of mean square error - MSE). Since, in model-based inference, the true AGB in an area of interest is a random variable, comparisons of the performance of prediction frameworks should preferably be made in terms of their RMSEs. However, in practice only the SD can be estimated based on empirical survey data, and thus it is important also to study whether or not the difference between the two uncertainty measures is small or large under conditions relevant for the GEDI mission. Our main findings were that: (i) hybrid and HMB prediction typically resulted in smaller RMSEs than conventional MB prediction although the difference between the three frameworks in terms of SD often was small; (ii) in most cases the difference between hybrid and HMB inference was small in terms of both RMSE and SD; (iii) the RMSEs for all frameworks was substantially larger than the SDs in small study areas whereas the two uncertainty measures were similar in large study areas, and; (iv) spatial autocorrelation of model residual errors had a large effect on the RMSEs of AGB predictors, especially in small study areas. We conclude that hybrid inference is suitable in most GEDI applications for AGB assessment, due to its simplicity compared to HMB inference. However, where GEDI data are sparse HMB inference should be preferred.', '[Saarela, Svetlana; Gobakken, Terje; Naesset, Erik] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, As, Norway.

Systematically monitoring forest regeneration over large and often remote areas is challenging. Remotely sensed data and associated analytical approaches have demonstrated consistent and transparent options for spatially-explicit characterization of vegetation return following disturbance. Moreover, time series of satellite imagery enable the establishment of spatially meaningful recovery baselines that can provide a benchmark for identifying areas that are either under-or over-performing relative to those baselines. This information allows for the investigation and/or prioritization of areas requiring some form of management intervention, including guiding tree planting initiatives. In this research, we assess recovery following stand replacing disturbances for the 650 Mha forested ecosystems of Canada for the period 1985-2017, wherein-51 Mha of Canada\'s forested ecosystems were impacted by wildfire, and -21 Mha were impacted by harvesting. For quantification of forest recovery, we implement the Years to Recovery or Y2R metric using Landsat time series data based on the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) to relate the number of years required for a pixel to return to 80% of its pre-disturbance NBR value. By the end of the analyzed period, 76% of areas impacted by wildfire were considered spectrally recovered compared to 93% of harvested areas. On average, we found that harvest areas had more rapid spectral recovery (mean Y2R = 6.1 years) than wildfire (mean Y2R = 10.6 years) and importantly, that Y2R varied by ecozone, disturbance type, pre-disturbance land cover, and latitude. We used airborne laser scanning data to assess whether pixels that were considered spectrally recovered had attained United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization benchmarks of canopy height (>5 m) and cover (>10%) across four geographic regions representing different forest types. Overall, 87% and 97% of recovered pixels sampled in harvests and wildfires, respectively, had achieved at least one of the benchmarks, with benchmarks of height more readily achieved than benchmarks of cover. By analyzing spatial patterns of Y2R, we identified areas that had significant positive or negative spatial clustering in their rate of spectral recovery. Approximately 3.5-4% of areas disturbed by wildfire or harvest had significant positive spatial clustering, indicative of slower spectral recovery rates; these areas were also less likely to have attained benchmarks of height and cover. Conversely, we identified significant negative spatial clustering for 0.94% of areas recovering from harvest and 1.93% of areas recovering from wildfire, indicative of spectral recovery that was more rapid than the ecozonal baseline. Herein, we demonstrated that remote sensing can provide spatial intelligence on the nature of disturbance-recovery dynamics in forested ecosystems over large areas and moreover, can retrospectively quantify and characterize historic forest recovery trends within the past three decades that have implications for forest management, climate change mitigation, and restoration initiatives in the near term.', '[White, Joanne C.; Hermosilla, Txomin; Wulder, Michael A.] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Pacific Forestry Ctr, 506 West Burnside Rd, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada.

Among all single-sensor retrieved soil moisture products, the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) products performed best in terms of R (> 0.6) and ubRMSE (close to 0.04 m(3)/m(3)), with the SMAP-MDCA (Modified Dual Channel Algorithm) being slightly better than the baseline SCA-V (Single Channel Algorithm-Vertical polarization). Importantly, the newly developed SMAP-IB product, which does not use auxiliary data, delivered the best bias statistics and higher VOD values compared with the drier SMAP retrievals, suggesting that the low VOD values (underestimated vegetation effects) may be the major factor causing the dry bias of SMAP products in this study area. It was also found that TCA may systematically overestimate the correlation and underestimate the ubRMSE of soil moisture products as compared with ground-based metrics. TCA-based metrics may vary considerably when using different triplets, due to the TCA assumptions being violated even with the most conservative triplets (in this case an active product, a passive product, and a model-based product). Redundant TCA-based metrics from multiple inde-pendent triplets could be averaged to increase the accuracy of final TCA estimates. This study is the first to use in situ measurements from the SMN-SDR to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of commonly used, multi-source soil moisture products. These results are expected to further promote the improvement of satellite-and model-based soil moisture products.', '[Zheng, Jingyao; Lu, Haishen; Zhu, Yonghua; Wang, Xiaoyi] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Natl Cooperat Innovat Ctr Water Safety & Hydrosci, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Hohai, Peoples R China.

Water shortage induces stomatal closure, causing a reduction in photosynthesis and transpiration rates. Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) emission is sensitive to subtle, stress-induced variations in non-photochemical quenching and in photosynthetic electron transport, caused by e.g., a fluctuation in the water availability. Based on this sensitivity, a framework for calibrating a water stress function in a crop growth model using ground-based SIF observations is proposed. SIF time series are simulated by coupling the AgroC crop growth model to the Soil Canopy Observations Photosynthesis Energy (SCOPE) model. This allowed parametrizing the water stress function in the AgroC crop growth model, resulting in improved estimates of actual evapotranspiration and net ecosystem exchange over a sugar beet stand during stressed periods. The improvement in the estimation of the water and carbon fluxes by AgroC during the summer months highlights the ability of canopyscale SIF observations to serve as a remote sensing metric to indicate the intensity of a stress condition. We argue that our framework, linking SIF emission to stress functions, can be used to extract information concerning drought stress from the Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) satellite, scheduled for launch in 2024.', '[De Canniere, S.; Jonard, F.] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Croix Sud 2 Box L7-05-02, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.

We develop a machine-learning algorithm using the concept of learning from patterns to estimate the multi-layer SM information in ungauged locations firmly based on local knowledge of the climatic and landscape controls. The Contiguous United States (CONUS) is clustered into homogeneous regions based on the association between SM and climate and landscape controls. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm is applied to homogenous regions to capture the complex relationship between appropriate predictor variables and in-situ SM at multiple layers over the CONUS. Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level 4 (L4) surface (0-5 cm) and rootzone (0-100 cm) SM along with climate and landscape datasets are used as predictor variables. In-situ multi-layer SM recorded by Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN), Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL), and U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) networks are utilized as predictands. XGBoost models are then trained region-wise and layer-wise to estimate multi-layer SM information at 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 cm depths (five layers) at 1-km spatial resolution. Results indicate that the predictor variables have varying levels of influence on SM with changing soil depth, and meteorological variables have the least importance. Validation at 79 independent locations indicates the multi-layer SM estimates successfully capture temporal dynamics of SM, with most locations achieving ubRMSE less than 0.04 m(3)/m(3).

The use of spectral diversity metrics from different remote sensing platforms has emerged as a promising tool for such biodiversity assessments. Satellite remote sensing presents the next frontier for implementation of these methods to assess plant diversity with spatial and temporal continuity at truly regional or global scales. However, the question of what exactly is monitored by spectral diversity metrics from relatively coarse multi-spectral satellite observations has remained largely unanswered. In this research, we examined which components contribute to satellite remotely sensed spectral diversity. We assessed the relationships between spectral diversity and in-situ taxonomic and trait diversity, and evaluated the role of confounding factors, vegetation cover, and landscape morphology (slope and elevation), in shaping these relationships. Hereto, we used Sentinel-2 imagery and in-situ field trait and species count data collected in the Montesinho-Nogueira Natura 2000 site (Portugal) together with radiative transfer models to quantify the theoretical link between in-situ trait diversity and simulated spectral diversity. Through the use of linear mixed-effect models, our results highlight that variation in vegetation cover dominates the Sentinel-2\'s spectral diversity signal (contributing 53-84% of the R2marginal). The vegetation cover component encompasses spatial variability in canopy architecture traits as well as the fraction of bare soil and plant litter spectra. These elements together strongly impact the overall spectral diversity signal, as shown both in our radiative transfer simulations and empirical comparisons. Next to vegetation cover, we found that taxonomic diversity is a significant predictor and covariate of spectral diversity, while the role of leaf trait diversity appeared insignificant in our multispectral dataset. Variation in vegetation cover dominated the spectral diversity signal in our study while it is not necessarily correlated with plant diversity. We, therefore, recommend that future applications of multi-spectral diversity metrics consider the impact of vegetation cover, including soil variability and the role of morphological traits, in shaping leaf trait - canopy reflectance relationships to better understand the ambiguous performance of spectral diversity as a proxy of plant diversity. This will result in higher robustness, consistency, and scalability of spectral diversity metrics for predicting in-situ plant diversity across scales, sensors, and ecosystems in regional biodiversity assessments.', '[Hauser, Leon T.; Timmermans, Joris; van der Windt, Niels; de Sa, Nuno Cesar; Soudzilovskaia, Nadejda A.; van Bodegom, Peter M.] Leiden Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Dept Environm Biol, Leiden, Netherlands.

The effects of wildfires are heterogeneous, meaning that the magnitude of their effects depends on many factors such as geographical region, climate and land cover/vegetation type. Yet, which areas are more affected by these events remains unclear. Here we present a novel application of the Generalized Synthetic Control (GSC) method that enables quantification and prediction of vegetation changes due to wildfires through a time-series analysis of in situ and satellite remote sensing data. We apply this method to medium to large wildfires (> 1000 acres) in California throughout a time-span of two decades (1996-2016). The method\'s ability for estimating counterfactual vegetation characteristics for burned regions is explored in order to quantify abrupt system changes. We find that the GSC method is better at predicting vegetation changes than the more traditional approach of using nearby regions to assess wildfire impacts. We evaluate the GSC method by comparing its predictions of spectral vegetation indices to observations during pre-wildfire periods and find improvements in correlation coefficient from R2 = 0.66 to R2 = 0.93 in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), from R2 = 0.48 to R2 = 0.81 for Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), and from R2 = 0.49 to R2 = 0.85 for Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI). Results show greater changes in NDVI, NBR, and NDMI post-fire on regions classified as having a lower Burning Index. We find that on average, wildfires cause a 25% initial decrease in the vegetation index (NDVI) and a larger than 80% drop in wetness indices (NBR and NDMI) after they occur. The GSC method also reveals that wildfire effects on vegetation can last for more than a decade post-wildfire, and in some cases never return to their previous vegetation cycles within our study period. We also find that the dynamical effects vary across regions and have an impact on seasonal cycles of vegetation in later years. Lastly, we discuss the usefulness of using GSC in remote sensing analyses.', '[Serra-Burriel, Feliu; Prata, Andrew T.; Cucchietti, Fernando M.] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Barcelona, Spain.

The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) system on board the International Space Station (ISS) is the latest FW spaceborne LiDAR instrument for the continuous observation of Earth\'s forests. FW systems rely on very so-phisticated pre-processing steps to generate a priori metrics in order to leverage their capabilities for the accurate estimation of the aforementioned forest characteristics. The ever-expanding volume of acquired GEDI data, which to date comprises more than 25 billion acquired unfiltered shots, and along with the pre-processed data, amounting to more than 90 TB of data, raises new challenges in terms of adapted preprocessing methods for the suitable exploitation of such a huge and complex amount of LiDAR data. To overcome the issues related to the generation of relevant metrics from GEDI data, we propose a new metric-free approach to estimate canopy dominant heights (H-dom) and wood volume (V) of Eucalyptus plantations over five different regions in Brazil. To avoid metric computation, we leverage deep learning techniques and, more in detail, convolutional neural networks with the aim to analyze the GEDI Level 1B geolocated waveforms. Performance comparisons were conducted between four convolutional neural network (CNN) variants using GEDI waveform data (either un-touched, or subsetted) and a metric based Random Forest regressor (RF). Additionally, we tested if our frame-work can improve the generalization of the models to different distant regions. First, the models were trained using data from all the study regions. Cross validated results showed that the CNN based models compared well against their RF counterpart for both H-dom and V. The RMSE on the estimation of Hdom from the CNN based models varied between 1.54 and 1.94 m with a coefficient of determination (R-2) between 0.86 and 0.91, while the RF model produced an accuracy on H-dom estimates of 1.45 m (R-2 = 0.92). For V, CNN based estimations ranged from 27.76 to 33.33 m(3).ha(-1) (R-2 between 0.82 and 0.88), while for RF, the RMSE was 27.61 m(3).ha(-1) (R-2 = 0.88). Next, model generalization was assessed by means of a spatial transfer experiment. For H-dom, both the CNN and RF approaches showed similar performances to a global model, however, the CNN based approach showed higher variability on the estimation accuracy, and the variability was related to the forest structure between the trained and tested data (similar tree heights yield better accuracies). For the estimation of V, considering both approaches, the accuracy was dependent on the allometric relationship between H-dom and V in the training and testing regions while lower accuracies on V were obtained when the testing and training regions exhibited a different allometric relationship.', '[Fayad, Ibrahim; Ienco, Dino; Baghdadi, Nicolas; Gaetano, Raffaele] Univ Montpellier, French Natl Res Inst Agr Food & Environm INRAE, AgroParisTech, CIRAD,CNRS,TETIS, F-34093 Montpellier 5, France.

In this work, we provide a data-driven alignment of chlorophyll-a and turbidity derived from the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Imager (MSI) with corresponding Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) products. For chlorophyll-a retrieval, empirical \'ocean colour\' blue-green band ratios and a near infra-red (NIR) band ratio algorithm, as well as a semi-analytical three-band NIR-red ratio algorithm, were included in the analysis. Six million co-registrations with MSI and OLCI spanning 24 lakes across five continents were analysed. Following atmospheric correction with POLYMER, the reflectance distributions of the red and NIR bands showed close similarity between the two sensors, whereas the distribution for blue and green bands was positively skewed in the MSI results compared to OLCI. Whilst it is not possible from this analysis to determine the accuracy of reflectance retrieved with either MSI or OLCI results, optimizing water quality algorithms for MSI against those previously derived for the Envisat Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and its follow-on OLCI, supports the wider use of MSI for aquatic applications. Chlorophyll-a algorithms were thus tuned for MSI against concurrent OLCI observations, resulting in significant improvements against the original algorithm coefficients. The mean absolute difference (MAD) for the blue-green band ratio algorithm decreased from 1.95 mg m(-3) to 1.11 mg m(-3), whilst the correlation coefficient increased from 0.61 to 0.80. For the NIR-red band ratio algorithms improvements were modest, with the MAD decreasing from 4.68 to 4.64 mg m(-3) for the empirical red band ratio algorithm, and 3.73 to 3.67 for the semi-analytical 3-band algorithm. Three implementations of the turbidity algorithm showed improvement after tuning with the resulting distributions having reduced bias. The MAD reduced from 0.85 to 0.72, 1.22 to 1.10 and 1.93 to 1.55 FNU for the 665, 708 and 778 nm implementations respectively. However, several sources of uncertainty remain: adjacent land showed high divergence between the sensors, suggesting that high product uncertainty near land continues to be an issue for small water bodies, while it cannot be stated at this point whether MSI or OLCI results are differentially affected. The effect of spectrally wider bands of the MSI on algorithm sensitivity to chlorophyll-a and turbidity cannot be fully established without further availability of in situ optical measurements.', '[Warren, Mark A.; Simis, Stefan G.

Their quantification facilitates predictions of meltwater runoff as well as distribution and availability of fresh water. They control the balance of the Earth\'s ice sheets and are acutely sensitive to climate change. These processes decrease the surface reflectance with unique spectral patterns due to the accumulation of liquid water and light absorbing particles (LAP), that require imaging spectroscopy to map and measure. Here we present a new method to retrieve snow grain size, liquid water fraction, and LAP mass mixing ratio from airborne and spaceborne imaging spectroscopy acquisitions. This methodology is based on a simultaneous retrieval of atmospheric and surface parameters using optimal estimation (OE), a retrieval technique which leverages prior knowledge and measurement noise in an inversion that also produces uncertainty estimates. We exploit statistical relationships between surface reflectance spectra and snow and ice properties to estimate their most probable quantities given the reflectance. To test this new algorithm we conducted a sensitivity analysis based on simulated top-of-atmosphere radiance spectra using the upcoming EnMAP orbital imaging spectroscopy mission, demonstrating an accurate estimation performance of snow and ice surface properties. A validation experiment using in-situ measurements of glacier algae mass mixing ratio and surface reflectance from the Greenland Ice Sheet gave uncertainties of +/- 16.4 mu g/gice and less than 3%, respectively. Finally, we evaluated the retrieval capacity for all snow and ice properties with an AVIRIS-NG acquisition from the Greenland Ice Sheet demonstrating this approach\'s potential and suitability for upcoming orbital imaging spectroscopy missions.', '[Bohn, Niklas] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.

To understand changes in coastal areas, e.g. environmental and social resilience to environmental change, local measurements are inadequate. Such large-scale issues can only be addressed with perhaps less accurate but large scale measurements from space. Considering vulnerability or exposure to coastal flooding, both the bathymetry (underwater) and topography (above water) are vital boundary conditions to understand and accurately estimate impacts on short (storms) and long (interseasonal) time-scales. In this work, we estimate the coastal bathymetry and topography with the optical VEN mu S satellite for every single overpass at the Field Research Facility of the US Army Corps of Engineers at Duck, NC. The experimental VEN mu S satellite enables estimation of the topography and bathymetry by two repetitive identical images with a small time-lag. This capability proofs to result in topographies with a few meters accuracy and the bathymetry estimation is at best a few decimetres accurate. As a base for future Earth Observation missions such as Landsat or Sentinel 2, VEN mu S shows that higher resolution imagery (5 m), repetitive bands and a revisit time of only 2 days, enables unprecedented land/sea monitoring.', '[Bergsma, Erwin W.

Spring phenology models, which have been widely used to predict the timing of leaf emergence, generally assume that a combination of photoperiod and thermal forcing control when leaves emerge. However, the exact nature and magnitude of how photoperiod and temperature individually and jointly control leaf emergence is the subject of ongoing debate. Here we use a continuous development model in combination with time series of land surface phenology measurements from MODIS to quantify the relative importance of photoperiod and thermal forcing in controlling the timing of canopy greenup in eastern temperate and boreal forests of North America. The model accurately predicts biogeographic and interannual variation in the timing of greenup across the study region (median RMSE = 4.6 days, median bias = 0.30 days). Results reveal strong biogeographic variation in the period prior to greenup when temperature and photoperiod influence greenup that covaries with the importance of photoperiod versus thermal controls. Photoperiod control on leaf emergence is dominant in warmer climates, but exerts only modest influence on the timing of leaf emergence in colder climates. Results from models estimated using ground-based observations of cloned lilac are consistent with those from remote sensing, which supports the realism of remote sensing-based models. Overall, results from this study suggest that apparent changes in the sensitivity of trees to temperature are modest and reflect a trade-off between decreased sensitivity to temperature and increased photoperiod control, and identify a transition in the relative importance of temperature versus photoperiod near the 10 degrees C isotherm in mean annual temperature. This suggests that the timing of leaf emergence will continue to move earlier as the climate warms, and that the magnitude of change will be more pronounced in colder regions with mean annual temperatures below 10 degrees C.', '[Moon, Minkyu; Friedl, Mark A.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA.

The variabilities of these parameters are important for understanding possible impacts of the ecosystem on climate change, yet they have not been systematically evaluated due to the lack of large-scale, long-term observations. Here we provide global estimates of these bulk aerodynamic parameters, including d, z0, rb, and rd, for the period 1982-2017 based on remote-sensed leaf area index (LAI), h, and plant functional type dependent canopy morphological characteristics. The global h estimate is acquired from LAI using a semi-empirical relation in which the coefficients have been optimized based on the canopy height product from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) onboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat). Two LAI products, Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) and Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS), are used to calculate canopy height and parameters separately. The products derived from the above two LAI datasets agree very well (spatial correlation coefficient, SCC = 0.99, relative root-mean-square-error, rRMSE = 8.28% for h, SCC = 0.99, rRMSE = 12.15% for d, and SCC = 0.98, rRMSE = 13.78% for z0). Verification of the products against in-situ canopy height records from the FLUXNET and eddy-covariance (EC)-based d and z0 estimates shows that the estimates can reproduce the annual means and seasonal variations of the bulk surface properties. We found significant positive trends in global h (0.04-0.05% year-1), d (0.07% year- 1) and z0 (0.07% year- 1) associated with the Earth greening, but they are different from the trend in LAI (0.14-0.25% year-1). The differences between the trends in LAI and the trends in derived parameters are also found in different latitudes. For instance, in the Northern Hemisphere Polar region, the GLASS LAI increases by 0.48% year- 1, leading to positive trends of 0.03% year- 1 in h, 0.18% in d, and 0.20% year- 1 in z0. The above results highlight the importance of comprehensively considering changes in LAI, canopy height, and aerodynamic parameters when evaluating the effects of ecosystem change on climate.

To address this challenge, NASA\'s Earth Mineral dust source InvesTigation (EMIT) will map the surface mineralogy of Earth\'s desert dust source regions, constraining the composition of mineral dust aerosol for use in Earth system models (ESMs). This mission foreshadows multiple future global spectroscopic investigations for which coupling with ESMs will play a critical role. Planning such experiments requires a methodology for assessing the impact of uncertain remote observations on ESM accuracy. We design and implement an end-to-end simulation of the EMIT mission, leveraging Bayesian statistical methods and Monte Carlo sampling to analyze uncertainties in the retrieval and processing of EMIT data products. Special focus is placed on those uncertainties caused by atmospheric water vapor and aerosol loading conditions likely to be encountered by EMIT. We apply these results to a single-column configuration of the Community Earth System Model (CESM), revealing the potential impact of EMIT observations on radiative forcing estimates. We show that EMIT data stand to significantly reduce uncertainty in estimates of the dust direct radiative forcing attributable to uncertainties in surface mineralogies that are input to ESMs, and that the information gain for radiative forcing comes predominantly from better constraining iron oxides, which dominate the shortwave radiative effects of aerosol dust.', '[Connelly, David S.; Mahowald, Natalie M.; Li, Longlei] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.

This article describes the Copernicus Sentinel-6 mission that is designed to provide precision sea level, sea surface height, significant wave height, inland water heights and other products tailored to operational services in the ocean, climate, atmospheric and land Copernicus Services. Sentinel-6 provides enhanced continuity to the very stable time series of mean sea level measurements and ocean sea state started in 1992 by the TOPEX/Poseidon mission and follow-on Jason-1, Jason-2 and Jason-3 satellite missions. The mission is implemented through a unique international partnership with contributions from NASA, NOAA, ESA, EUMETSAT, and the European Union (EU). It includes two satellites that will fly sequentially (separated in time by 5 years). The first satellite, named Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, launched from Vandenburg Air Force Base, USA on 21st November 2020. The satellite and payload elements are explained including required performance and their operation. The main payload is the Poseidon-4 dual frequency (C/Ku-band) nadir-pointing radar altimeter that uses an innovative interleaved mode. This enables radar data processing on two parallel chains the first provides synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processing in Ku-band to improve the received altimeter echoes through better along-track sampling and reduced measurement noise; the second provides a Low Resolution Mode that is fully backward-compatible with the historical reference altimetry measurements, allowing a complete inter-calibration between the state-of-the-art data and the historical record. A three-channel Advanced Microwave Radiometer for Climate (AMR-C) provides measurements of atmospheric water vapour to mitigate degradation of the radar altimeter measurements. The main data products are explained and preliminary in-orbit Poseidon-4 altimeter data performance data are presented that demonstrate the altimeter to be performing within expectations.Y', '[Donlon, Craig J.; Cullen, Robert; Giulicchi, Luisella; Vuilleumier, Pierrik; Francis, C.

Its Snapshot Area Map (SAM) and target mode measurements provide an innovative dataset for carbon studies on sub-city scales. Unlike any other current space-based instrument, OCO-3 has the ability to scan large contiguous areas of emission hot spots like cities, power plants, and volcanoes. These measurements result in dense, fine-scale spatial maps of column averaged dry-air mole fractions of carbon dioxide (XCO2). For the first time, we present and analyze XCO2 distributions over the Los Angeles megacity (LA) derived from OCO-3 SAM and target mode observations. Urban XCO2 enhancements range from 0 - 6 ppm (median enhancements <^> 2 ppm) relative to a clean background and show excellent agreement with nearby ground-based TCCON measurements of XCO2. OCO-3?s dense observations reveal intra-urban variations of XCO2 over the city that have never been observed from space before. The spatial variations are mainly driven by the complex fossil fuel emission patterns and meteorological conditions in the LA Basin and are in good agreement with those from co-located TROPOMI measurements of co-emitted NO2. Differences between measured and simulated XCO2 enhancements from two models (WRF-Chem and X-STILT) are typically below 1 ppm with larger differences for some sub regions. Both models capture the observed intra-urban XCO2 gradients. Further, OCO-3?s multi-swath measurements capture about three times as much of the city emissions compared to single-swath overpasses. OCO-3?s frequent target and SAM mode observations will pave the way to constrain urban emissions at finer, sub-city scales.', '[Kiel, Matthaus; Eldering, Annmarie; Blavier, Jean-Francois] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.

Here we evaluate the synergy of this frequency range for vegetation characterization, through the estimation of two vegetation parameters, its foliage and the photosynthesis activity as described by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and its woody components and carbon stock as described by the Above Ground Carbon (AGC), using different combinations of channels in the considered frequency range. Neural network retrievals are trained on these two vegetation parameters (NDVI and AGC), for several microwave channel combinations, including the future Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR) that will observe simultaneously in window channels from 1.4 to 36 GHz, for the first time. This methodology avoids the use of any assumptions in the complex interaction between the surface (vegetation and soil) and the radiation, as well as any ancillary observations, to propose a genuine and objective evaluation of the information content of the passive microwave frequencies for vegetation characterization. Our analysis quantifies the synergy of the microwave frequencies from 1.4 to 36 GHz, and shows the expected potential of the CIMR instrument for the monitoring of vegetation parameters in tropical environments, as compared to current instruments.

This research proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework consisting of a precipitation detection model (PDM) and a precipitation regime classification model (PCM) to improve orographic precipitation retrievals from GPM-DPR using machine learning.   The PDM is a Random Forest Classifier using GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) calibrated brightness temperatures (Tbs) and low-level precipitation mixing ratios from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) analysis as inputs. The PCM is a Convolutional Neural Network that predicts the precipitation regime class, defined independently based on quantitative features of ground-based radar reflectivity profiles, using GPM DPR Ku-band (Ku-PR) reflectivity profiles and GMI Tbs. The AI framework is demonstrated for warm-season precipitation in the Southern Appalachian Mountains over three years (2016-2019), achieving large reductions in false alarms (77%) and missed detections (82%) relative to GPM Ku-PR precipitation products. The spatial distribution of predicted precipitation classes within the GPM overpass reflects the complex interactions between storms and topography that determine orographic precipitation regimes. For each GPM pixel, the local precipitation class informs on the vertical structure of rainfall microphysics aiming to capture low-level processes missed in GPM DPR reflectivity profiles contaminated by ground-clutter (i.e., the radar blind-zone).', '[Arulraj, Malarvizhi] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, Cooperat Inst Satellite Earth Syst Studies, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

The blue-to-green band ratio algorithm is applied operationally to derive POC concentrations in global oceans; it, however, tends to underestimate high values in optically complex waters. With an attempt to develop accurate and robust oceanic POC models, this study aimed to explore machine learning methods in satellite retrieval of POC concentrations. Three machine learning methods, i.e. extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN), were tested, and the recursive feature elimination (RFE) method was employed to identify sensitive features. Matchups of global in situ POC measurements and Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) products were used to train and evaluate POC models. Results showed that machine learning methods produced obvious better performance than the blue-to-green band ratio algorithm, and XGBoost was the most robust among the tested three machine learning methods. However, the blue-to-green band ratio algorithm still worked well for clear open ocean waters with low POC, and ANN was more effective for optically complex waters with extremely high POC. This study provided globally applicable methods for satellite retrieval of POC concentrations, which should be helpful for studying POC dynamics in global oceans as well as in productive marginal seas.', '[Liu, Huizeng; Li, Qingquan; Yang, Chao; Wang, Junjie; Hu, Shuibo; Shi, Tiezhu; Liao, Xiaomei; Wu, Guofeng] Shenzhen Univ, MNR Key Lab Geoenvironm Monitoring Great Bay Area, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China.

This M-w 7.3 earthquake was followed by an intense seismic sequence. Implementing the double-difference earthquake location technique, we relocate 1069 events recorded by our local seismic network, deployed after the mainshock. The spatial distribution of the epicenters indicates linear alignments of the events nucleated along at least four notable clusters. The clusters are characterized by at least one significant earthquake, such as the Tazehabad earthquake of 25 August 2018 (M-w 5.9) along a dense, east-west trending cluster and the Sarpol-e Zahab earthquake of 25 November 2018 (M-w 6.3) along the cluster with a northeast-southwest trend. We use two-pass differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) and Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) methods to study the coseismic permanent displacements of the Azgeleh, Tazehabad and Sarpol-e Zahab events as well as the one-year postseismic deformation field of the 2017-2018 seismic sequence, respectively. We use non-linear and linear optimization algorithms to derive the source geometry and the slip distribution along the fault planes. The inversion is conducted by introducing also seismological constraints, leading to the definition of a listric geometry for the Azgeleh mainshock rupture that accommodates the slip area at depth of 10-16 km along a sub-horizontal plane (dipping similar to 3 degrees) and a low-angle (similar to 16 degrees) ramp. The thrust and dextral movements along this NNW-striking (similar to 345 degrees) fault have triggered a tear fault responsible for the Tazehabad event ruptured an east-west trending (similar to 267 degrees), north-dipping (similar to 78 degrees) sinistral shear fault. We present the dextral slip distribution of the Sarpol-e Zahab event along a NE-striking (similar to 34 degrees) fault, as a synthetic Riedel structure for the southern segment of the Khanaqin fault, dipping 63 degrees to the southeast. We find the postseismic deformation field associated with the seismic sequence is not confined only to the mainshock source (the Azgeleh fault), but also develops along the Tazehabad and Sarpol-e Zahab faults. We additionally propose afterslip along a duplex, flat-ramp-flat structure down-dip and up-dip of the Azgeleh coseismic slip area. The up-dip afterslip develops onto the shallow detachment (similar to 3 degrees) at depth of similar to 8 km and the down-dip afterslip propagate onto the mid-crustal decollement level within the PanAfrican basement. The Azgeleh, Tazehabad, Sarpol-e Zahab and Khanaqin faults mark the Lurestan Arc-Kirkuk Embayment sharp margin in the Northwest Zagros and play a key role in the lateral escape of the Lurestan Salient and vertical strain partitioning in the Zagros front.', '[Fathian, A.; Reicherter, K.] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Neotecton & Nat Hazards Inst, Aachen, Germany.

With regard to water availability and supply-demand balance, artificial water reservoirs have become most important elements e.g. for hydropower, irrigated agriculture, flood control, as well as for domestic and industrial water use. Nevertheless, publicly accessible information on reservoirs is still not harmonized and available at global scale. Therefore, it is more essential than ever to acquire detailed knowledge about spatio-temporal variability of water resources - especially reservoirs - and the drivers of their dynamics. In this study, we analyze daily water extent time series of the 1267 largest reservoirs worldwide based on the existing DLR-DFD Global WaterPack product derived from MODIS data (Klein et al., 2017). The study aims to present an experimental way of spatio-temporal variability analysis by implementing the TIMESAT software which is usually used for vegetation analyses. In our experimental approach we derive information on the timing when the open surface water areas of reservoirs increase and decrease by identifying start date, end date and duration of such reservoir cycles as well as timing of maximum surface water extent (hydro-metrics). For four selected reservoirs, these hydro-metrics derived from surface water extent are compared with hydro-metrics derived from in-situ water level measurements or altimetry datasets and are discussed in more detail. Based on the presented examples we demonstrate the potential of high temporal resolution surface water extent data and spatio-temporal variability analyses with TIMESAT for future applications supporting the understanding of reservoir variability as a result of water management and hydroclimatic variability.', '[Klein, Igor; Mayr, Stefan; Gessner, Ursula; Hirner, Andreas; Kuenzer, Claudia] German Aerosp Ctr, German Remote Sensing Data Ctr, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany.

Prior to analysis, estimates of surface reflectance must be inferred from radiance measurements in a process known as atmospheric correction, which compensates for the distortion of the electromagnetic signal by the atmosphere. Inaccuracies in the correction process can alter characteristic spectral signatures, leading to subsequent mischaracterization of surface properties. Global ob-servations pose new challenges for mapping surface composition, as varied atmospheric conditions and surface biomes challenge traditional atmospheric correction methods. Recent work adopted an optimal estimation (OE) approach for retrieving surface reflectance from observed radiance measurements, providing the reflectance estimates with a posterior probability. This work incorporates these input probabilities to improve the accuracy of surface feature measurements. We demonstrate this using a generic feature-fitting method that is applicable to a wide range of Earth surface studies including geology, ecosystem studies, hydrology and urban studies. Specifically, we use a probabilistic framework based on generalized Tikhonov-regularized least squares, a rigorous formulation for appropriate weighting of features by their observation uncertainty and leveraging of prior knowledge of material abundance for improving estimation accuracy. We demonstrate the validity of this procedure and quantify the increase in model performance by simulating expected accuracies in the reflectance estimation. To evaluate global uncertainties in mineral estimation, we simulate observations representative of the expected global range of atmospheric water vapor and aerosol levels, and characterize the sensitivity of our procedure to those quantities.', '[Carmon, Nimrod; Thompson, David R.; Susiluoto, Jouni; Turmon, Michael; Brodrick, Philip G.; Braverman, Amy; Cawse-Nicholson, Kerry; Green, Robert O.; Gunson, Michael] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.

Here we explored the potential of the synergistic use of SMAP and OCO-2 based data for monitoring the responses of ecosystem productivity to drought. We used complementary observational information on root-zone soil moisture and GPP (9 km) from SMAP and fine-resolution SIF (0.05 degrees; GOSIF) derived from OCO-2 SIF soundings. We compared the spatial pattern and temporal evolution of anomalies of these variables over the conterminous U.S. during the 2018 drought, and examined to what extent they could characterize the drought-induced variations of flux tower GPP and crop yield data. Our results showed that SMAP GPP and GOSIF, both freely available online, could well capture the spatial extent and dynamics of the impacts of drought indicated by the U.S. Drought Monitor maps and the SMAP root-zone soil moisture deficit. Over the U.S. Southwest, monthly anomalies of soil moisture showed significant positive correlations with those of SMAP GPP (R-2 = 0.44, p < 0.001) and GOSIF (R-2 = 0.76, p < 0.001), demonstrating strong water availability constraints on plant productivity across dryland ecosystems. We further found that SMAP GPP and GOSIF captured the impact of drought on tower GPP and crop yield. Our results suggest that synergistic use of SMAP and OCO-2 data products can reveal the drought evolution and its impact on ecosystem productivity and carbon uptake at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and demonstrate the value of SMAP and OCO-2 for studying ecosystem function, carbon cycling, and climate change.', '[Li, Xing; Xiao, Jingfeng] Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Earth Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA.

Most efforts to date have involved two-dimensional mapping of traits, typically representing top-of-canopy conditions. However, traits and their associated biological functions vary through the canopy vertical profile, such that incorporating information about vertical patterns may improve modeling of ecosystem processes like primary productivity. In 2016 and 2017, we collected extensive field data in forests in Domain 5 (Great Lakes) of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) to characterize the vertical variation in leaf mass per area (LMA), an important foliar trait related to plant growth and defense. Fieldwork was coincident with NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) overflights which collected imaging spectroscopy and lidar data. Using imaging spectroscopy to map top-of-canopy LMA and lidar to model vertical gradients of transmittance, we developed a method to map three-dimensional patterns in LMA in temperate broadleaf forests. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to estimate top-of-canopy LMA (R-2: 0.57, RMSE 10.8 g m(-2)), which, along with lidar-derived metrics of light transmittance and height, was used in a multilevel regression to model within-canopy LMA (R-2: 0.78, RMSE 8.3 g m(-2)). The coupled models accurately estimated LMA throughout the canopy without taking into account species composition (R-2 = 0.82, RMSE: 8.5 g m(-2)).', '[Chlus, Adam; Kruger, Eric L.; Townsend, Philip A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.', 'University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin MadisonRP Chlus, A (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.', 'chlus@wisc.edu; elkruger@wisc.edu; ptownsend@wisc.eduRI Townsend, Philip A/B-5741-2008', 'Townsend, Philip A/0000-0001-7003-8774; Chlus, Adam/0000-0001-6719-9956', 'NSF Macrosystems Biology and Early NEON Science [1638720]; USDA   McIntire-Stennis awards [WIS1809, WIS3008]; Division Of Environmental   Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1638720] Funding Source:   National Science Foundation', 'We thank Andrew Jablonski, Aidan Mazur, Benjamin Spaier, John Clare,   Brendan Heberlein, Ittai Herrmann, Abigail Ernst, Hannah Manninen and   Alex Brito for providing field assistance.

NNAero uses data from the NASA MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) flying on the NASA Terra and Aqua satellites. The MODIS-derived spectral reflectances of solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and at the surface were used together with ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and FMF to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the joint retrieval of FMF and AOD.

However, the global spatial and temporal dynamics of transpiration are highly uncertain, and current estimates rely on either indirect remote sensing or empirical model formulations. Here, we show that T can be estimated reliably at the global scale using observations of plant sun-induced fluorescence (SIF). To do so, we derive T using two different methods from globally-distributed eddy-covariance measurements and compare it with satellite SIF retrievals from GOME-2 and OCO-2. Whereas most research to date has focused on the link between SIF and gross primary production (GPP), we demonstrate that SIF is as highly correlated with T (mean correlation coefficient R of 0.76 across sites for 16-day periods with GOME-2 and 0.75 at the daily scale with OCO-2). SIF shows a greater predictive skill to estimate T than traditional optical vegetation indices and its dynamics are very similar to those of T. Through the use of an advanced radiative transfer model, we also demonstrate a clear empirical link between SIF and T. At 83 FLUXNET sites, remote sensing data and flux-derived GPP and T are used to estimate the relevant parameters of the Soil Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) radiative transfer model and to model SIF. While the relationship between SIF and photosynthesis (GPP) is mostly controlled by leaf biochemical properties and plant structure, the SIF-T relationship appears largely determined by air temperature and intrinsic water use efficiency. Our findings suggest that ongoing advances in satellite SIF retrievals will allow for a more direct estimation of transpiration over large scales.', '[Maes, Wouter H.] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, UAV Res Ctr, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.

The size, location and distribution of forest discontinuities are important controls on forest shortwave radiation transmission and subsequent snow surface shading and radiation energy exchange between the atmosphere and the canopy, but challenges arise when accounting for these vegetation characteristics at large spatial scales. Airborne LiDAR datasets contain detailed information about canopy structure across large spatial scales which can be exploited within 2D transmission models. However, airborne LiDAR data typically does not resolve lower canopy elements, leading to unrealistic depictions of individual trees. We present a methodology to enhance airborne LiDAR data by calculating additional trunk and branch points based on segmentation of a canopy height model, allowing more accurate estimates of canopy shortwave transmissivity. To demonstrate this, we deployed a computationally efficient 2D radiation transfer modelling framework that calculates direct and diffuse radiation from a set of distributed synthetic hemispherical images. The model can predict incoming direct and diffuse solar radiation at the snow surface at high spatial (meter-scale) and temporal (minute-scale) resolutions. Comparison between synthetic and real hemispherical photographs showed that synthetic images, if based on enhanced LiDAR data, featured canopy and individual tree crowns that were much denser than the original LiDAR portrays, improving the representation of vegetation structure especially within dense environments and along canopy edges. Corresponding modelled total shortwave radiation matched well with spatially gridded measurements from a moving pyranometer at two sites, where model RMSE was reduced to 59 and 29 W m(-2) from 181 and 138 W m(-2), respectively, compared to the same transmission model with the original LiDAR data. Maps of snow surface shading patterns corresponded well to those seen in aerial photographs, showing the enhanced LiDAR data can be used to solve complex spatiotemporal patterns of sub-canopy incoming radiation. This work demonstrates that canopy structure information from the lower canopy is an important aspect for accurate radiation transfer modelling, and methods presented here can successfully mitigate problems inherent in many airborne LiDAR datasets to improve spatially distributed estimates of sub-canopy shortwave radiation.', '[Webster, Clare; Mazzotti, Giulia; Jonas, Tobias] WSL Inst Snow & Avalanche Res SLF, CH-7260 Davos, Switzerland.

Previous studies on residential environmental quality (REQ) mainly focused on general evaluations at city level, while ignored the spatial heterogeneity of REQ inside cities and failed to survey REQ at local scales. This study recognizes the heterogeneity of REQ strongly related to land-use patterns, and aims to explore how local land-use patterns influence REQ. Firstly, a multimodal semantic segmentation method is presented to classify land uses by using satellite images, building data and points of interests. Secondly, a feature system is defined to characterize land-use patterns, which can be extracted at multiple scales based on land-use classification results. Thirdly, these features are fitted with REQ survey data by random forest regressions, which can predict REQ scores across Beijing and give deep insights into how land-use patterns influence REQ. Experimental results indicate that 1) REQ of Beijing is strongly heterogeneous, and our method can generate a REQ map revealing REQ\'s imbalance across the city; 2) land-use patterns within 700 m have significant impacts on the local REQ; 3) spatial allocations of land uses are more important than proportions for influencing REQ; and 4) our method visualizes the rules that land-use patterns influence REQ, thus can assist urban land-use planning to balance and improve REQ.', '[Zhang, Xiuyuan; Du, Shihong; Du, Shouji; Liu, Bo] Peking Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & GIS, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.', 'Peking UniversityRP Du, SH (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & GIS, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.', 'shdu@pku.edu.cn', 'Zhang, Xiuyuan/0000-0002-9350-9126', 'China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019M660003]', 'The work presented in this paper is funded by the China Postdoctoral   Science Foundation (No. 2019M660003).

Pixel offset tracking methods work well for fast-moving landslides (more than tens of cm/yr). However, existing methods may present some limitations, such as (i) a high dependence of estimation window design on experience, (ii) a tradeoff between the accuracy of single points and the overall efficiency, and (iii) a low confidence in the results caused by heterogeneous in-window samples. In this paper, an improved offset tracking method is proposed to address these problems. First, the workflow is optimized by a \"preseparation\" step added before offset estimation to distinguish between feature matching and speckle pattern matching. The optimized workflow is more efficient for natural scenes containing both feature and non-saliency regions. Second, an improved algorithm called adaptive incoherence speckle offset tracking based on homogeneous samples (AISOT-HS) is proposed for non-saliency regions. Its two key points are (i) adaptive design of the optimal estimation windows by introducing a coherence map as a guide and (ii) offset estimation without heterogeneous samples. We apply the proposed method to study the evolution of the 2018 Jinsha River landslide (Tibet, China) using SAR data from the Gaofen 3 (GF-3) satellite and the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) system onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) satellite. Compared with the traditional method, the proposed method improves the efficiency and reduces the uncertainty. We also analyze the spatiotemporal displacement pattern of this landslide, which shows that the Jinsha River landslide was most likely a thrust load-caused landslide.

However, a comprehensive assessment of the eutrophication status and its evolution is still lacking for these regional lakes, mostly because of technical difficulties and/or insufficient data to cover the large region. Our study attempts to fill this knowledge gap by using the entire archive of remote sensing images from two satellite ocean color missions (MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, or MERIS (2003-2011), and Ocean and Land Color Instrument, or OLCI (2017-2018)), together with in situ data on remote sensing reflectance and chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentrations across various lakes on the Yangtze Plain. A machine learning-based piecewise Chla algorithm was developed in this study, with special considerations to improve algorithm performance under lower Chla conditions. Remotely sensed Chla and algal bloom areas were then used to classify the eutrophication status of 50 large lakes on the Yangtze Plain, and the frequent satellite observations enabled us to estimate the probability of eutrophication occurrence (PEO) for each examined lake. The long-term mean Chla ranged from 17.58 mg m(-3) to 43.86 mg m(-3) on the Yangtze Plain, and severe floating algal blooms were found in 7 lakes. All 50 lakes had high climatological PEO values (50%) during the study period, indicating a generally high probability of eutrophication in lakes on the Yangtze Plain. However, 21 out of 51 lakes exhibited statistically significant (p<.05) decreasing trends in PEO during the observation period, suggesting an overall improvement in the water quality of lakes on the Yangtze Plain in recent years. The methods developed here are expected to contribute to real-time monitoring of drinking water safety for local regions, and the long-term results provide valuable baseline information for future lake conservation and restoration efforts.', '[Guan, Qi; Feng, Lian; Hou, Xuejiao; Zheng, Yi] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China.

TDS-1 was launched in July 2014 and provides globally distributed spaceborne GNSS-R data over a lifespan of over three years, including several months of 24/7 operations. TDS-1 wind speeds are computed using the NOC Calibrated Bistatic Radar Equation algorithm version 0.5 (C-BRE v0.5), and are evaluated against ERA5 high resolution re-analysis data over the period 2015-2018. Analyses reveal significant temporal variability in TDS-1 monthly wind speed retrieval performance over the three years, with the best performance (similar to 2 m.s(-1)) achieved in the early part of the mission (May 2015). The temporal variability of retrieval performance is found to be driven by several non-geophysical factors, including TDS-1 platform attitude uncertainty and spatial/temporal changes in GPS transmit power from certain satellites. Evidence is presented of the impact of the GPS Block IIF Flex mode on retrieved GNSS-R wind speed after January 2017, which results in significantly underestimated ocean winds over a large region covering the North Atlantic, northern Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, and the Sea of Okhotsk. These GPS transmit power changes are shown to induce large negative wind speed biases of up to 3 m.s(-1). Analyses are also presented of the sensitivity of TDS-1 wind speed retrieval to platform attitude uncertainty using statistical simulations. It is suggested that a 4 degrees increase in attitude uncertainty can produce up to 1 m.s(-1) increase in RMSE, and that TDS-1 attitude data do not fully reflect actual platform attitude. We conclude that the lack of knowledge about the GNSS-R nadir antenna gain map and TDS-1 platform-attitude limits the ability to determine the achievable wind speed retrieval performance with GNSS-R on TDS-1. The paper provides recommendations that accurate attitude knowledge and a good characterisation of GNSS-R nadir antenna patterns should be prioritised for future GNSS-R missions.', '[Hammond, Matthew Lee; Foti, Giuseppe; Gommenginger, Christine; Srokosz, Meric] Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.', 'NERC National Oceanography CentreRP Hammond, ML (通讯作者)，Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.', 'matthew.hammond@noc.ac.uk', 'Foti, Giuseppe/0000-0002-1507-2133; Srokosz, Meric/0000-0002-7347-7411', 'ESA contract [4000123436/NL/FF/gp]; NERC [NE/N018095/1]; NERC   [NE/N018095/1] Funding Source: UKRI', 'ERA5 data was generated using Copernicus Climate Change Service   Information [2018] neither the European Commission nor ECMWF is   responsible for any use that may be made of the Copernicus Information   or Data it contains.

However, the relationship between SIF and GPP at the canopy scale lacks a clear mechanistic explanation. This is largely due to the poorly characterized role of the relative contributions from canopy structure and leaf physiology to the variability of the top-of-canopy, observed SIF signal. In particular, the effect of the canopy structure beyond light absorption is that only a fraction (f(esc)) of the SIF emitted from all leaves in the canopy can escape from the canopy due to the strong scattering of near-infrared radiation. We combined rice, wheat and corn canopy-level in-situ datasets to study how the physiological and structural components of SIF individually relate to measures of photosynthesis. At seasonal time scales, we found a considerably strong positive correlation (R-2 = 0.4-0.6) of fesc to the seasonal dynamics of the photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUEP), while the estimated physiological SIF yield was almost entirely uncorrelated to LUEP both at seasonal and diurnal time scales, with the partial exception of wheat. Consistent with these findings, the canopy structure and radiation component of SIF, defined as the product of APAR and f(esc), explained the relationship of observed SIF to GPP and even outperformed GPP estimation based on observed SIF at two of the three sites investigated. These results held for both half-hourly and daily mean values. In contrast, the total emitted SIF, obtained by normalizing observed SIF for f(esc), improved only the relationship to APAR but considerably decreased the correlation to GPP for all three crops. Our findings demonstrate the dominant role of canopy structure in the SIF-GPP relationship and establish a strong, mechanistic link between the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV) and the relevant canopy structure information contained in the SIF signal. These insights are expected to be useful in improving remote sensing based GPP estimates.', '[Dechant, Benjamin; Ryu, Youngryel] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Rural Syst Engn, Seoul, South Korea.

We demonstrate that the new technique is stable and produces a set of results which are both consistent with the understood geographical and temporal distribution of CO sources, as well as those of some other co-emitted species. These regions were chosen because they have high levels of CO loadings and complex factors driving their underlying emissions profiles. We first successfully categorize the region, based on the total CO column measurements, into those locations impacted by intense urbanization (high climatological mean, low climatological variance, high loading throughout most of the year, and variation mostly due to global-scale chemistry and climatology), large-scale biomass burning (low climatological mean, high climatological variance, mostly clean but with short and intense peak events occurring around a similar time year-to-year), those regions undergoing a significant change from one type to another, and those regions which are clean. We further reproduce the temporal and spatial distributions of other co-emitted species measured by other measurement platforms, including aerosols (AOD) and gasses (NO2), and demonstrate consistency across all three platforms. Third of all, we produce an important scientific finding using these new results, in terms of a significant geographic expansion of the known biomass burning regions from Myanmar through Northern Vietnam, as compared with previous research. Fourth, we also find that urbanization dominates emissions of CO over both known urban agglomerations in East and Southeast Asia, including around Beijing, Shanghai, the Pearl River Delta, Seoul, Shandong, Chengdu, Chongqing, Hanoi and Bangkok, but also extend into otherwise unclassified or recently emerging mega-cities including Shanxi Province, Henan Province, and Liaoning Province. Additionally, we have found that there is a 37% overlap with emissions from FINN, providing both validation of the technique over known biomass burning regions, and an ability to quantify regions that are burning but not presently identified. Finally, we have a consistent and value-adding comparison and contrast with an EOF/PCA analysis in terms of both our regions classified as biomass burning and mixed/urban, with each approach offering its unique advantages and drawbacks. Although our approach has made some very simple assumptions in terms of cutoff that can and should be improved by the community, its robust results provide new insights into the rapid changes impacting CO throughout Asia, and will allow models to have an improved chance at representing peak events or areas undergoing rapid change.', '[Lin, Chuyong; Cohen, Jason Blake; Wang, Shuo; Lan, Ruoyu] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.

APiC, a novel adaptable pixel-based compositing and classification approach, is especially designed to use high resolution spatio-temporal space-borne data.   Here, pixel-based compositing is used separately for training data and prediction data. First, cloud-free pixels covered by reference data are used within adapted composite periods to compile a training dataset. The compiled training dataset contains samples of spectral reflectances for respective land cover classes at each composite period. For land cover prediction, pixel-based compositing is then applied region-wide. Multiple prediction models are used based on temporal subsets of the compiled training dataset to dynamically account for cloud coverage at pixel level. Thus we present a data-driven classification approach which is applicable in regions with different weather conditions, species composition and phenology.   The capability of our method is demonstrated by mapping 19 land cover classes across Germany for the year 2016 based on Sentinel-2A data. Since climatic conditions and thus plant phenology change on a large scale, the classification was carried out separately in six landscape regions of different biogeographical characteristics. The study drew on extensive ground validation data provided by the federal states of Germany.   For each landscape region, composite periods of different lengths have been established, which differ regionally in their temporal arrangement as well as in their total number, emphasising the advantage of a flexible regionalised classification procedure. Using a random forest classifier and evaluating outcomes with independent reference data, an overall accuracy of 88% was achieved, with particularly high classification accuracy of around 90% for the major land cover types. We found that class imbalances have significant influence on classification accuracy. Based on multiple temporal subsets of the compiled training dataset, over 10,000 random forest models were calculated and their performance varied considerably across and within landscape regions. The calculated importance of composite periods show that a high temporal resolution of the compiled training dataset is necessary to better capture the different phenology of land cover types.   In this study we demonstrate that APiC, due to its data-driven nature, is a very flexible compositing and classification approach making efficient use of dense satellite time series in areas with frequent cloud coverage. Hence, regionalisation can be given greater focus in future broad-scale classifications in order to facilitate better integration of small-scale biophysical conditions and achieve even better results in detailed land cover mapping.', '[Preidl, Sebastian; Lange, Maximilian; Doktor, Daniel] Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res GmbH UFZ, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.', 'Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ)RP Preidl, S (通讯作者)，Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res GmbH UFZ, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.', 'sebastian.preidl@ufz.de', 'Lange, Maximilian/0000-0001-9657-8779', 'Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN) [FKZ: 3517860800];   integrated project initiative of the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental   Research GmbH -UFZ', 'This research was funded (FKZ: 3517860800) by the Federal Agency for   Nature Conservation (BfN) and the integrated project initiative of the   Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research GmbH -UFZ.

Most of land cover/land use (LCLU) assessments in this region have been based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Cropland Data Layer (USDA - CDL), which may be inconsistent. Here, we demonstrate an approach to map land cover utilizing multi-temporal Earth Observation data from Landsat and MODIS. We first built an annual time series of accumulated growing degree-days (AGDD) from MODIS 8-day composites of land surface temperatures. Using the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from Landsat Collection 1\'s surface reflectance, we then fit at each pixel a downward convex quadratic model to each year\'s progression of AGDD (i.e., EVI = alpha + beta x AGDD - gamma x AGDD(2)). Phenological metrics derived from fitted model and the goodness of fit then are submitted to a random forest classifier (RFC) to characterize LCLU for four sample counties in South Dakota in three years (2006, 2012, 2014) when reference point datasets are available for training and validation. To examine the sensitivity of the RFC to sample size and design, we performed classifications under different sample selection scenarios. The results indicate that our proposed method accurately mapped major crops in the study area but showed limited accuracy for non-vegetated land covers. Although all RFC models exhibit high accuracy, estimated land cover areas from alternative models could vary widely, suggesting the need for a careful examination of model stability in any future land cover supervised classification study. Among all sampling designs, the \"same distribution\" models (proportional distribution of the sample is like proportional distribution of the population) tend to yield best land cover prediction. RFC used only the most eight important variables (e.g., three fitted parameter coefficients [alpha, beta, and gamma]; maximum modeled EVI; AGDD at maximum modeled EVI; the number of observations used to fit CxQ model; and the number of valid observations) have slightly higher accuracy compared to those using all variables.

Corrections account for the emission and absorption of radiation by air between the surface and instrument (atmospheric correction), and for the reflected longwave infrared (LWIR) radiation from non-black-body surfaces (\"emissivity\" correction) within a single modelling framework. The atmospheric correction a) can use horizontally and vertically variable distributions of atmosphere properties at high resolution (<5 m); b) is applied here with vertically extrapolated weather observations and MODTRAN atmosphere profiles; and c) is a solution to ray tracing and cross section (e.g. absorption) conflicts (e.g. cross section needs the path length but it is typically unavailable during ray tracing). The emissivity correction resolves the reflection of LWIR radiation as a series of scattering events at high spatial (<1 m) and angular (Delta Omega approximate to 0.02 sr) resolution using a heterogeneous distribution of radiation leaving the urban surfaces. The method is applied to a novel network of seven ground-based cameras measuring LWIR radiation across a dense urban area (extent: 420 m x 420 m) where a detailed 3-dimensional representation of the surface and vegetation geometry is used. Our unique observation set allows the method to be tested over a range of realistic conditions as there are variations in: path lengths, view angles, brightness temperatures, atmospheric conditions and observed surface geometry. For pixels with 250 ( +/- 10) m path length the median (5th and 95th percentile) atmospheric correction magnitude is up to 4.5 (3.1 and 8.1) K at 10:10 on a mainly clear-sky day. The detailed surface geometry resolves camera pixel path lengths accurately, even with complex features such as sloped roofs.   The atmospheric correction method evaluation, with simultaneous \"near\" (similar to 15 m) and \"far\" (similar to 155 m) observations, has a mean absolute error of 0.39 K. Using broadband approximations, the emissivity correction has clear diurnal variability, particularly when a cool and shaded surface (e.g. north facing) is irradiated by warmer (up to 17.0 K) surfaces (e.g. south facing). Varying the material emissivity with bulk values common for dark building materials (epsilon = 0.89 -> 0.97) alters the corrected roof (south facing) surface temperatures by similar to 3 (1.5) K, and the corrected cooler north facing surfaces by less than 0.1 K. Corrected observations, assuming a homogeneous radiation distribution from surfaces (analogous to a sky view factor correction), differ from a heterogeneous distribution by up to 0.25 K. Our proposed correction provides more accurate T-s observations with improved uncertainty estimates. Potential applications include ground-truthing airborne or space-borne surface temperatures and evaluation of urban energy balance models.', '[Morrison, William; Kotthaus, Simone; Grimmond, Sue] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England.

Retrieval of L/WST requires a well calibrated radiometer and an accurate atmospheric correction. In the present study, the performance of the Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS) on board Landsat 8 is evaluated for the retrieval of L/WST. libRadtran is used to retrieve atmospheric correction parameters based on atmospheric profiles of relative humidity and temperature from three global atmospheric models. Performance of single band retrievals is compared to typical MODTRAN results from the Atmospheric Correction Parameter Calculator (ACPC) and a split-window approach. A multi-temporal land masking method using imagery from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on board Landsat 8 is demonstrated, and is used to automatically classify imagery in the matchup dataset in three classes of cloud cover. Two sources of in situ data covering the Belgian Coastal Zone (BCZ) are used for validation of the L/WST product: (1) fixed locations in the Flemish Banks measurement network and (2) underway data from regular RV Belgica campaigns. In the present study the single band methods outperformed the split-window approach, and consistent retrievals are found for the MODTRAN and libRadtran simulations. Typical single band surface temperature retrievals in quasi cloud-free conditions have Root Mean Squared Differences (RMSD) of 0.7 K and 1 K for Bands 10 and 11 with low bias, depending on the method and atmospheric profile source. For imagery with scattered clouds, RMSD values increase to 1 K and 2 K respectively with an approximately 0.5 K cold bias, likely caused by cloud proximity. The calibration efforts combined into Collection 1 allows for accurate absolute surface temperature retrievals from B10 on Landsat 8/TIRS for homogeneous targets with known emissivity, such as liquid water. The method is adapted to global processing and can be used for Land Surface Temperature retrieval with a suitable source of emissivity data.', '[Vanhellemont, Quinten] Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Operat Directorate Nat Environm, Vautierstr 29, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Royal Belgian Institute of Natural SciencesRP Vanhellemont, Q (通讯作者)，Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Operat Directorate Nat Environm, Vautierstr 29, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.', 'quinten.vanhellemont@naturalsciences.be', NULL, 'Federal Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO) under the BRAIN-be   programme MICROBIAN project [BR/165/A1/MICROBIAN]', 'This work was funded by the Federal Belgian Science Policy Office   (BELSPO) under the BRAIN-be programme MICROBIAN project   (BR/165/A1/MICROBIAN).

Since most vertically-oriented building facets are not observed by a nadir-viewing remote imaging radiometer, the radiometric surface temperature (T-r) measured at a specific view angle cannot be used with existing heat transfer equations to estimate radiative and convective fluxes in the urban environment. Thus, it is necessary to derive T-c for city neighborhoods. This study develops a simple method to estimate T-c from T-r with the aid of the Temperatures of Urban Facets in 3D (TUF-3D) numerical model, which calculates 3-D sub-facet scale urban surface temperatures for a variety of surface geometries and properties, weather conditions and solar angles. The effects of geometric and meteorological characteristics - e.g., building planar area index (lambda(p)), wall facet area index (F), solar irradiance - on the difference between T-c and T-r were evaluated using the TUF-3D model. Results showed the effects of geometric and meteorological characteristics on the difference between T, and T-r differ between daytime and nighttime. The study then sought to predict the relationship between T-r and T-c, using lambda(p), F, and solar irradiance for daytime and only using lambda(p), and F for nighttime. Based on the simulated data from TUF-3D, the resulting relationships achieve a coefficient of determination (r(2)) of 0.97 and a RMSE of 1.5 K during daytime, with corresponding nighttime values of r(2) = 0.98 and RMSE = 0.69 K. The relationships between T-r and T-c are evaluated using high resolution airborne thermal images of daytime urban scenes: r(2) = 0.75 and RMSE = 1.09 K on August 6, 2013 at 12:40 pm; and r(2) = 0.86 and RMSE = 1.86K on October 24, 2017 at 11:30 am. The new relationships were also applied to estimate T-c from T-r in Hong Kong retrieved from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). In the present climatic context, the difference between T-c and T-r can reach 10 K during daytime in summer, and 6 K during daytime in winter, with seasonal variation attributable to the variations in shortwave irradiance. The nighttime difference between T-c, and T-r can also reach 2 K in both summer and spring seasons.', '[Yang, Jinxin] Guangzhou Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.

The traditional triangular space method uses a CRC spectral index (SI) and vegetation SI to create a two-dimensional scatter map in which the three vertices represent pure vegetation (FVC = 1), crop residue (CRC = 1), and bare soil (BS = 1). With this method, the CRC, FVC, and BS of each pixel are calculated based on their spatial locations in the triangular space. In practice, soil moisture and crop residue moisture (SM-CRM) affects the values of CRC spectral indices (SIs) for pure crop residue and soil, thereby reducing the accuracy of broadband remote sensing estimates of CRC, FVC, and BS. In the current work, we propose a new method for estimating fractional cover that uses a broadband spectral angle index (BAI) to estimate CRC. The proposed BAI is the included angle between (i) the line from the reflectance at band a to the reflectance at band b and (ii) the line from the reflectance at band b to the reflectance at band c, where bands a and b represent the VIS or NIR bands, respectively, and band c represents the SWIR1 or SWIR2 of the broadband remote sensing band. The proposed BAI method can mitigate the effects of soil and crop residue moisture content on spectral reflectance. This study evaluates proposed BAIs to estimate CRC and BAI-NDVI triangular space method to estimate CRC, FVC, and BS in cropland where water content varies greatly. Several different BAIs were validated using both laboratory-based measurements and field-based experiments using Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument imaging. We used two laboratory-based treatments (mixed spectral reflectance of dry, saturated soil and crop residue and the mixed spectral reflectance of winter wheat leaf and dry, saturated soil and crop residue) to analyze the response of BAIs to CRC, SM-CRM, FVC, and vegetation water content. Next, we evaluated the performance of different BAIs in determining CRC based on the mixed spectral reflectance of crop residue and soil, as well as the performance of the BAI-NDVI triangular space method and linear spectral unmixing analysis to estimate CRC, FVC, and BS from mixed spectral reflectance measurements. Our results indicate that the proposed methods reduce the influence of moisture on broadband CRC SIs, provide accurate estimates of cropland CRC and fractional estimates of CRC, FVC, and BS, and may be applied in croplands where soil and crop residue moisture content varies greatly.', '[Yue, Jibo; Tian, Qingjiu; Dong, Xinyu; Xu, Nianxu] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.

However, dune-field landscape pattern maps are rarely available due to the insufficient attention paid to representing dune-field landscape mosaics and the labor-intensive manual interpretation processes in prior studies. Moreover, automatic or semi-automated dune-field landscape pattern mapping methods are still absent, resulting from a lack of appropriate image units to represent the heterogeneous dune-field landscape patches (DLPs). To address above issues, this study makes the first attempt to apply geoscenes, a new kind of complex units proposed recently, in dune-field landscapes and proposes a multiscale segmentation approach. The proposed approach is able to represent DLPs at multiple scales on images by integrating multisource features (i.e., class-related spatial-pattern features and the line-spatial-pattern features) in a unified segmentation framework. Visual and quantitative assessments of multiscale segmentation results demonstrate that our approach can delineate DLPs effectively. Comparisons among our approach, the multiresolution segmentation in eCognition software and an urban geoscene segmentation approach also reveal the superiority of our approach. This study is hence of great significance for dune-field landscape pattern mapping and offers a potential to be coupled into other landscape investigations.', '[Zheng, Zhijia; Du, Shihong; Du, Shouji; Zhang, Xiuyuan] Peking Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & GIS, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.', 'Peking UniversityRP Du, SH (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.', 'dshgis@hotmail.com', NULL, 'National Natural Science Foundation of China [41871372]', 'The work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of   China (No. 41871372).

These trends have been particularly severe along the rock coast of southern Svalbard. Concerns have been raised over the potential for higher energy storms and longer ice-free open water seasons to increase the exposure of Arctic coasts, and consequently the concentration of infrastructure critical to Arctic community survival, to enhanced rates of erosion. Here we present and apply innovative remote sensing, monitoring and process analyses to assess the impact of recent coastal climatic changes. High resolution analyses demonstrate that the small scale ( < 0.001 m(3)) changes that are rarely considered quantitatively exhibit geomorphic responses distinct from those of larger, more readily detected cliff failures. We monitor temperature depth profiles in both the shore platform and the cliff face to show rock sensitivity over time to both global and local influences. The results demonstrate the efficacy of thermal processes on Arctic rock cliffs relative to platforms, and may hold implications for understanding strandflat development rates. New three-dimensional thermography (thermal mapping) and process zone characterisation has been used to spatially assess the sensitivity of Arctic rock coast responses to contemporary processes on deglaciating coasts. Through the spatial and temporal analyses of key geomorphic behaviour zones and comparison over a range of sites, the complex and changing interplay between subaerial weathering and cryogenic and intertidal processes has been highlighted. These data challenge long standing assumptions over the future of Arctic rock coasts and identify new, focused lines of enquiry on the decline in cryogenic processes and understanding the sensitivity of Arctic rock coasts to climatic changes.', '[Lim, Michael; Woodward, John] Northumbria Univ, Engn & Environm, Ellison Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England.

In this study, a three-source satellite ET algorithm is developed for estimating instantaneous ET rate (ETcal) under clear and non-rainy cloudy sky conditions and is validated at 20 AsiaFlux sites of multiple vegetation types (evergreen and deciduous forests, croplands and grasslands) in East Asia. The ET algorithm is completely independent from ground-based measurements and thus has the potential to be used on regional scale. All-sky surface net radiation flux is derived from satellite products. Satellite optical Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used to partition the surface available energy into vegetated area and bare soil area. Satellite microwave Emissivity Difference Vegetation Index (EDVI), an indicator of vegetation water content, is utilized to estimate canopy resistance and transpiration from vegetation. Evaporation components from canopy interception water and soil surface are estimated based on Priestley-Taylor method. The estimated evaporation fraction (EF) for all sites can produce a small absolute bias of less than 0.03 (or 8.1%) with a good determination coefficient (R-2) larger than 0.42 when validated against the corrected in-situ measured EF on instantaneous and long-term mean scales. Instantaneous ETcal under all sky conditions are found to have a R-2 of 0.61, a bias of 16.5 Wm(-2) (13.7%) and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 63.6 Wm(-2) (52.5%) over all sites, respectively. The performances of this algorithm are better achieved on 16-day (R-2 = 0.66, RMSE = 44.1 Wm(-2)) and monthly (R-2 = 0.70, RMSE = 39.1 Wm(-2)) scales. More importantly, EDVI-based ET method is able to produce ETcal with stable and good accuracy from clear sky to overcast sky (bias < 22 Wm(-2) or 18%, RMSE < 77 Wm(-2) or 59%). The daily ET and its components (ETveg, ETsoil and ETint) derived from our algorithm are further compared with those from Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) ET products. EDVI-based ET (EDVI-ET) generally shows equal performances with GLEAM-ET when using in-situ ET as reference. EDVI-ET veg shows a fairly good correlation (R-2 = 0.21) and an underestimation of -0.32 mm/day compared with GLEAM-ETveg. EDVI-ETint shows a significant correlation (R-2 = 0.30) with GLEAM-ETveg after excluding three outlier tropical forest sites. Meanwhile, EDVI-ETsoil shows a fairly good positive correlation (R-2 = 0.15) and an overestimation of 0.23 mm/day compared with GLEAMET, ETsoil] .

Especially over the past decade, EID outbreaks occurred more frequently and severely in forest landscapes, which have killed large numbers of trees. While tree mortality is observable from remote sensing, its symptom may be associated with both disease and non-disease disturbances (e.g., wildfire and drought). Species distribution modeling is widely used to understand species spatial preferences for certain habitat conditions, which may constrain uncertain remote sensing approaches due to limited spatial and spectral resolution. In this study, we integrated multi-sensor remote sensing and species distribution modeling to map disease-caused tree mortality in a forested area of 80,000 ha from 2005 to 2016. We selected sudden oak death (caused by pathogen P. ramorum) as a case study of a rapidly spreading emerging infectious disease, which has killed millions of oak (Quercus spp.) and tanoak (Lithocarpus densifiorus) in California over the past decades. To balance the needs for fine-scale monitoring of disease distribution patterns and satisfactory coverage at broad scales, our method applied spectral unmixing to extract sub-pixel disease presence using yearly Landsat time series. The results were improved by employing the probability of disease infection generated from a species distribution model. We calibrated and validated the method with image samples from high-spatial resolution NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program), and hyperspectral AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) sensors, Google Earth (R) imagery, and field observations. The findings reveal an annual sudden oak death infection rate of 7% from 2005 to 2016, with overall mapping accuracies ranging from 76% to 83%. The integration of multi-sensor remote sensing and species distribution modeling considerably reduced the overestimation of disease effects as compared to the use of remote sensing alone, leading to an average of 26% decrease in detecting disease-affected trees. Such integration strategy proved the effectiveness of mapping long-term, disease-caused tree mortality in forest landscapes that have experienced multiple disturbances.', '[He, Yinan; Chen, Gang] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, LRSEC, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.

The only database that currently provides soil salinity data with global coverage is the Harmonized World Soil Database, but it has several limitations when it comes to soil salinity assessment. Therefore, a new assessment is required. We hypothesized that combining soil properties maps with thermal infrared imagery and a large set of field observations within a machine learning framework will yield a global soil salinity map. The thermal infrared imagery acts as a dynamic variable and allows us to characterize the soil salinity change. For this purpose we used Google Earth Engine computational environment. The random forest classifier was trained using 7 soil properties maps, thermal infrared imagery and the ECe point data from the WoSIS database. In total, six maps were produced for 1986, 2000, 2002, 2005, 2009, 2016. The validation accuracy of the resulting maps was in the range of 67-70%. The total area of salt affected lands by our assessment is around 1 billion hectares, with a clear increasing trend. Comparison with 3 studies investigating local trends of soil salinity change showed that our assessment was in correspondence with 2 of these studies. The global map of soil salinity change between 1986 and 2016 was produced to characterize the spatial distribution of the change.

Satellite remote sensing provides spatially and temporally continuous information that can be used for global ET estimation. The NASA MODIS MOD16A2 operational product provides 500-m 8-day global ET estimates extending from 2001 to present. However, reliable estimates for delineating field level cropland ET patterns are lacking. In this investigation, we modified the MOD16 global algorithm to better represent cropland ET by calibrating model parameters according to C3 and C4 crop types, and incorporating finer scale satellite vegetation inputs to derive 30-m cropland ET estimates over the continental USA (CONUS). Similar overlapping enhanced vegetation index (EVI) records from Landsat and MODIS were used to generate a continuous 30-m 8-day fused EVI and ET record extending from 2008 to 2017 over CONUS croplands. The satellite-based ET estimates were compared with tower based ET observations over different crop types, and more traditional cropland actual ET (AET) estimates derived from reference ET and crop-specific coefficients. The new satellite based 30-m cropland ET estimates (ET30m) corresponded favorably with both tower ET observations (ETflux; R-2 = 0.69, RMSE = 0.70 mm d(-1), bias = 0.04 mm d(-1)) and the baseline global MOD16A2 ET product (ETMOD16). The ET30m results also showed better performance against the ETflux observations than ETMOD16 (R-2 = 0.54, RMSE = 0.82 mm d(-1)) or AET (R-2 = 0.52, RMSE = 2.47 mm d(-1)) for monitoring CONUS croplands. The spatial and temporal patterns of the ET3m results show enhanced delineation of agricultural water use, including impacts from variable climate, cropland area and diversity. The resulting ET30m record is suitable for operational applications promoting more effective agricultural water management and food security.', '[He, Mingzhu; Kimball, John S.; Running, Steven W.; Moreno, Alvaro] Univ Montana, Coll Forestry & Conservat, Numer Terradynam Simulat Grp, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.

We describe the VRR through a linear regression between integrated rainfall and vegetation productivity (using NDVI as a proxy) within a combined spatio-temporal window, sequentially moved over the study area and along the temporal axis of a time series. The trend in the slope values derived from such a sequential linear regression, termed SeRGS, thus represents a measure of change in the VRR. Scenarios of land degradation, defined here as a reduction in biological productivity, which may be caused by either climatic or anthropogenic factors are simulated for the period 1970-2016 from CRU rainfall and modelled NDVI data to test and evaluate the performance of the SeRGS method in detecting degradation, and compare it against the well-known RESTREND method. We found that SeRGS showed (1) overall more pronounced trends and higher significance levels (p <= 0.01) in detecting degradation events and (2) an improved statistical basis for the calculation of trends in the VRR (expressed by high coefficients of determination throughout the period of analysis), which was found to increase the validity of the results produced. Through the implementation of the temporal moving window the effect of inter-annual rainfall variability on vegetation productivity was effectively reduced, thereby enabling a more exact and reliable identification of the timing of degradation events (e.g. start, maximum and end of degradation) by using a time series breakpoint analysis (BFAST). Finally, the SeRGS method was applied using real data for Senegal (seasonally integrated MODIS NDVI and CHIRPS rainfall data 2000-2016) and we discuss patterns and trends.

In contrast, aerial imagery has been and continues to be regularly collected in many regions, and advances in stereo image matching have automated the creation of dense photogrammetric point clouds, which can also be used to map forest structure when paired with an accurate digital terrain model. As part of a study of the physical and ecological impacts of the 2012 High Park fire in Colorado, we generated a photogrammetric point cloud from pre-fire aerial imagery collected in 2008 and combined it with a digital terrain model generated from a 2013 post-fire lidar collection to produce canopy metrics commonly used in modelling of forest structure. We explore the correlation structure between the lidar and photogrammetry-derived canopy metrics, and the relationships between those metrics and forest structure attributes measured at unburned plots in the vicinity of the burn scar. Most corresponding lidar- and photogrammetry-derived canopy metrics had strong linear relationships between them (median r = 0.82), and metrics from both datasets yielded similar root mean square errors in multiple regression models of aboveground biomass (29.3% and 31.0%), basal area (29.8% and 27.7%), and several other forest structure attributes. We found the source of the canopy metrics (lidar or photogrammetry) to be a non-significant factor in some models of forest structure, suggesting that these datasets may be interchangeable in particular cases. Models derived from pre-fire aerial imagery were combined with burn severity information to quantify loss of biomass (2.31 +/- 0.001 Tg) and examine possible relationships between forest structure and burn severity. These applications illustrate how the broad spatial and temporal coverage of aerial imagery and growing coverage of lidar can be utilized to improve understanding of changes in forest structure, including assessments of forest carbon flux.', '[Filippelli, Steven K.; Lefsky, Michael A.; Rocca, Monique E.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.', 'Colorado State UniversityRP Filippelli, SK (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.', 'Steven.Filippelli@colostate.eduRI Rocca, Monique E/N-4528-2013', 'Rocca, Monique E/0000-0002-5298-1643', 'National Science Foundation [1339928, 1250576, 1264433]; Direct For   Biological Sciences; Emerging Frontiers [1250576, 1339928, 1264433]   Funding Source: National Science Foundation', 'This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [grant number   1339928].

In this paper, for the first time, a highly novel Joint Deep Learning framework is proposed and demonstrated for LC and LU classification. The proposed Joint Deep Learning (JDL) model incorporates a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN), and is implemented via a Markov process involving iterative updating. In the JDL, LU classification conducted by the CNN is made conditional upon the LC probabilities predicted by the MLP. In turn, those LU probabilities together with the original imagery are re-used as inputs to the MLP to strengthen the spatial and spectral feature representations. This process of updating the MLP and CNN forms a joint distribution, where both LC and LU are classified simultaneously through iteration. The proposed JDL method provides a general framework within which the pixel-based MLP and the patch-based CNN provide mutually complementary information to each other, such that both are refined in the classification process through iteration. Given the well-known complexities associated with the classification of very fine spatial resolution (VFSR) imagery, the effectiveness of the proposed JDL was tested on aerial photography of two large urban and suburban areas in Great Britain (Southampton and Manchester). The JDL consistently demonstrated greatly increased accuracies with increasing iteration, not only for the LU classification, but for both the LC and LU classifications, achieving by far the greatest accuracies for each at around 10 iterations. The average overall classification accuracies were 90.18% for LC and 87.92% for LU for the two study sites, far higher than the initial accuracies and consistently outperforming benchmark comparators (three each for LC and LU classification). This research, thus, represents the first attempt to unify the remote sensing classification of LC (state; what is there?) and LU (function; what is going on there?), where previously each had been considered separately only. It, thus, has the potential to transform the way that LC and LU classification is undertaken in future. Moreover, it paves the way to address effectively the complex tasks of classifying LC and LU from VFSR remotely sensed imagery via joint reinforcement, and in an automatic manner.', '[Zhang, Ce; Atkinson, Peter M.] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.

Never before has the need been more evident for new approaches to detect the presence of liana in ecosystems, given their significance as fingerprints of global environmental change. In this study, we explore the use of longwave infrared reflectance (LWIR, 8-11 mu m) as a wavelength region for the classification of liana and tree leaves and compare classification results with those obtained using visible-near infrared reflectance data (VIS-NIR, 0.45-0.95 mu m). Twenty sun leaves were collected from each of 14 liana species and 21 tree species located at the canopy or forest edge (n = 700) in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. LWIR and VIS-NIR reflectance measurements were performed on these leaves using a portable calibrated Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) Agilent ExoScan 4100 and a UniSpec spectral analysis system, respectively. The VIS-NIR and LWIR data were first resampled. Then these two spectral libraries were pre-processed for noise reduction and spectral feature enhancement resulting in three datasets for each spectral region as follows: filtered only, filtered followed by extraction of the first derivative, and continuous wavelet transformation (CWT). Data reduction was then applied to these data sets using principal components analysis (PCA). The outputs obtained from the PCA were used to conduct the supervised classification of liana and tree leaves. In total, 21 classifiers were applied to datasets of training and testing to extract the classification accuracy and agreement for liana and tree leaves. The results suggest that the classification of leaves based on LWIR data can reach accuracy values between 66 and 96% and agreement values between 32 and 92%, regardless of the type of classifier. In contrast, the classification based on VIS-NIR data shows accuracy values between 50 and 70% and agreement values between 0.01 and 40%. The highest classification rates of liana and tree leaves were obtained from datasets pre-processed using the CWT or from the extraction of the first derivative and classified using either random forest, k-nearest neighbor, or support vector machine with radial kernel. The results using the LWIR reflectance highlight the potential of this spectral region for the accurate detection of liana extent in tropical ecosystems. Future studies should consider this potential and test the regional monitoring of lianas.', '[Guzman, J. Antonio Q.; Rivard, Benoit; Sanchez-Azofeifa, G.

Soil texture is also used to calculate soil\'s ability to retain water for plant growth. SOC and soil texture are thus important parameters of agricultural soils and need to be regularly monitored. Optical satellite remote sensing offers the potential for frequent surveys over large areas. In addition, the recently-operated Sentinel-2 missions provide free imagery. This study compared the capabilities of Sentinel 2 for monitoring and mapping of SOC and soil texture (clay, silt and sand content) with those obtained from airborne hyperspectral (CASI/SASI sensors) and lab ASD FieldSpec spectroradiometer measurements at four agricultural sites in the Czech Republic. Combination of 10 extracted bands of the Sentinel-2 and 18 spectral indices, as independent variables, were used to train prediction models and then produce spatial distribution maps of the selected attributes. Results showed that the prediction accuracy based on lab spectroscopy, airborne and Sentinel-2 in the majority of the sites was adequate for SOC and fair for clay; however, Sentinel-2 imagery could not be used to detect and map variations in silt and sand. The SOC and clay maps derived from the airborne and spaceborne datasets showed similar trend, with both performing better where SOC levels were relatively high, though at the highest levels Sentinel-2 was able to create the SOC map more precisely than the airborne sensors. Taken across all SOC levels measured in the reference data, Sentinel-2 results were marginally lower than lab spectroscopy and airborne imagery, but this reduction in precision may be offset by the extensive geographical coverage and more frequent revisit characteristic of satellite observation.

For this evaluation, a time series of diurnal in-situ hyperspectral measurements of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) concurrent with in-situ measured Chla and SPM concentrations between 2008 and 2010 by the NIOZ jetty station (the NJS), located in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea, was used. Validation of the model retrievals against in-situ measurements showed an acceptable accuracy (Chla: R-2 = 0.80 and RMSE = 2.98 [mg m(-3)]; SPM: R-2 = 0.89 and RMSE = 2.53 [g m(-3)]) with good agreement between the temporal trends of measured and retrieved concentration values over multiple years. However, the model inversion results yielded less good estimates at SZA > 60 degrees during winter. Furthermore, the effect of the tide on the variation of daily time series of Chla and SPM concentrations was analyzed. At the particular NJS location, the tidal effects on the concentrations of SPM and Chla were found to be small. The capability of the 2SeaColor model to retrieve reliable estimates, and the favorable location of the NJS, which is little influenced by tidal phase variations, contribute to a better understanding of the long-term variability of Chla and SPM concentrations.

Mapping changes in the condition of dry forests and savannas is therefore critical. This can be challenging given that these ecosystems are characterized by continuous gradients of tree and shrub cover, resulting in considerable structural complexity. We developed a novel approach to map, separately, continuous fields of tree cover and shrub cover across the South American Gran Chaco (1,100,000 km(2)), making full use of the Landsat-8 optical and Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image archives. We gathered a large training dataset digitized from very-high resolution imagery and used a gradient-boosting framework to model continuous fields of tree cover and shrub cover at 30-m resolution. Our regression models had high to moderate predictive power (85.5% for tree cover, and 68.5% for shrub cover) and resulted in reliable tree and shrub cover maps (mean squared error of 4.4% and 6.4% for tree- and shrub cover respectively). Models jointly using optical and SAR imagery performed substantially better than models using single-sensor imagery, and model predictors differed strongly in some regions, especially in areas of dense vegetation cover. Mapping tree and shrub cover separately allowed identifying distinct vegetation formations, with shrub-dominated systems mainly in the very dry Chaco, woodlands with large trees mainly in the dry Chaco, and tree-dominated savannas in the wet Chaco. Our tree and shrub cover layers also revealed considerable edge effects in terms of woody cover away from agricultural fields (edge effects extending about 2 km), smallholder ranches (about 1.2 km), and roads and railways (about 1.4 and 0.9 km, respectively). Our analyses highlight both the substantial footprint of land-use on remaining natural vegetation in the Chaco, and the potential of multi-sensoral approaches to monitor forest degradation. More broadly, our approach shows that mapping canopy structure and distinct layers of woody vegetation in dry forest and savannas is possible across large areas, and highlights the value of the growing Landsat and Sentinel archives for doing so.', '[Baumann, Matthias; Levers, Christian; Macchi, Leandro; Bluhm, Hendrik; Kuemmerle, Tobias] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.

These maps are part of a legislated decision-making process for the protection of prime agricultural land. For summer, the two groups of crops are \'Coarse-grain & Pulse\' and \'Cotton\'. For winter, the two groups of crops are \'Cereal\' and \'Pulse\'. Non-crop groups, present in both summer and winter, are \'Bare soil\' and \'Other\' (comprising pastures, woody vegetation, and crop residues). The foundation of the maps is time-series modelling-specifically, applying the concepts of geostatistics in the temporal domain-to model the variation in land-surface phonology within a growing season. The time-series model is flexible, robust, parsimonious, parallelisable, and able to deal with irregular observations. We combined satellite imagery from the Landsat sensors, as well as, when available, Sentinel-2A and MODIS (with the last two reprojected to the 30m grid of Landsat). We applied the time-series model pixel-wise across the study region, to three variables derived from satellite imagery gathered for an individual growing season: enhanced vegetation index, and the sub-pixel proportions of bare-ground and non-photosynthetic vegetation. Weekly-averaged predicted phenological metrics then served as explanatory variables in a tiered, tree-based classification model, for the prediction of the groups. The classification model comprised two expert rules and two random forests. Prior to fitting the classification model, geospatial object-based image analysis was used to change the scale of analysis from individual pixels to (approximately) field-based segments. From the perspective of a map-user, in any given growing season we predicted \'Coarse-grain & Pulse\' correctly in 79% of cases; the values for \'Cotton\', \'Cereal\', and \'Pulse\' were 90%, 84%, and 73%, respectively; \'Bare soil\' was 72% in summer, and 88% in winter. \'Other\' was the most accurately mapped group (98% correct in summer, and 99% correct in winter).', '[Pringle, Matthew J.; Schmidt, Michael; Tindall, Daniel R.] Dept Environm & Sci, GPO Box 2454, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.

Multispectral remote sensing has enabled mapping of global spatiotemporal patterns of fire and fire effects, which has significantly improved our understanding of interactions between ecosystems, climate, humans and fire. With several upcoming spaceborne hyperspectral missions like the Environmental Mapping And Analysis Program (EnMAP), the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) and the Precursore Iperspettrale Della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), we provide a review of the state-of-the-art and perspectives of hyperspectral remote sensing of fire. Hyperspectral remote sensing leverages information in many (often more than 100) narrow (smaller than 20 nm) spectrally contiguous bands, in contrast to multispectral remote sensing of few (up to 15) non-contiguous wider (greater than 20 nm) bands.   To date, hyperspectral fire applications have primarily used airborne data in the visible to short-wave infrared region (VSWIR, 0.4 to 2.5 mu m). This has resulted in detailed and accurate discrimination and quantification of fuel types and condition, fire temperatures and emissions, fire severity and vegetation recovery. Many of these applications use processing techniques that take advantage of the high spectral resolution and dimensionality such as advanced spectral mixture analysis. So far, hyperspectral VSWIR fire applications are based on a limited number of airborne acquisitions, yet techniques will approach maturity for larger scale application when spaceborne imagery becomes available. Recent innovations in airborne hyperspectral thermal (8 to 12 pm) remote sensing show potential to improve retrievals of temperature and emissions from active fires, yet these applications need more investigation over more fires to verify consistency over space and time, and overcome sensor saturation issues. Furthermore, hyperspectral information and structural data from, for example, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors are highly complementary. Their combined use has demonstrated advantages for fuel mapping, yet its potential for post-fire severity and combustion retrievals remains largely unexplored.', '[Veraverbeke, Sander] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.

Despite the fact that these datasets have all been carefully calibrated, they show systematic differences in wind speed. At high latitudes both altimeter and radiometer winds are biased high compared to buoy measurements. Altimeter winds are more impacted than radiometer winds. Based on the assumptions that altimeter winds respond primarily to the surface wave spectrum mean squared slope and radiometer winds respond primarily to the surface wave spectrum dissipation, it is shown that the observed differences are a result of changes in atmospheric stability. An analysis which accounts for differences in air and water temperatures describes the observed differences with surprising accuracy. Based on this analysis corrections to both altimeter and radiometer winds are proposed which account for the influence of atmospheric stability. It is also shown that satellites preferentially measure at particular local times of day.

However, data on sowing dates are often scarce for both developed and developing countries, making remote sensing approaches to map sowing date an attractive approach. Yet the relative merits of different satellite sensors and metrics to estimate sowing date have not been well studied. We assess and compare the accuracies and uncertainties of satellite-derived sowing date estimates using different metrics (inflection point and threshold approaches) and satellite sensors that cover the range in the electromagnetic spectrum (optical, fluorescence, and radar). We validate these estimates using a county-level dataset derived from area-weighted field-level reported sowing dates for maize and soybean in the US states of Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana, and conduct our analysis both at the county level and at the aggregated tri-state region. We specifically use the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) from Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) and Ku-band backscattering from QuikSCAT (dB). We also compare the inflection point method and the threshold approach that defines sowing date as a specific threshold value (10%, 30% and 50%) between the minimum and maximum value in a logistic-curve smoothed phonology. We find that satellite-based estimate of sowing dates from all methods and sensors shows a wide range of predictive power at the county level, with R-2 ranging between 0.15 and 0.90, with significant variation across sensors. SIF has excellent prediction for more counties than the other sensors, but EVI performs more consistently with moderate to good prediction for the greatest bulk of counties among all sensors, while dB\'s predicted sowing dates are negatively correlated with observed dates for most counties. For each sensor, aggregation to the regional level produces time series of predicted sowing dates that more successfully capture linear time trends and inter-annual variability. Adjusting for spring temperatures and crop areal coverage significantly improves the accuracies of the estimated sowing dates at both the county and regional scales. Among the combinations of the three satellite products and four metrics, we find using SIF and/or EVI and the 30% threshold metric have the highest accuracies in terms of reproducing inter-annual variability and minimizing RMSE at regional scales. This study provides a systematic assessment of using different satellite sensors and metrics to estimate county- to regional scale crop sowing dates, which has important implications for mapping sowing date in data-limited regions across the globe.', '[Urban, Daniel] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.

(NVC) system, supports comprehensive conservation and management of natural ecosystems. At a detailed level, the NVC alliance is defined by diagnostic species and composition. Maps at this level of classification are often produced at local to regional scales (areas < 25,000 km(2)) with costly manual to semi-automated interpretation of high resolution imagery. The main objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of machine learning for automated, per-pixel (30 m) mapping of forest alliances with multi-seasonal hyperspectral imagery from a future satellite mission (HyspIRI), as simulated from Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer Classic (AVIRIS-C) data. The study area was the San Francisco (S.F.) Bay Area, California, where we mapped forest alliances at regional and county scales. We implemented the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier in a two stage approach, first mapping regional land cover followed by forest alliances in closed-canopy tree pixels. Predictor variables were reflectance bands and hyperspectral metrics based on indices, derivatives and absorption-fitting techniques applied to reflectance spectra, with data grouped into summer and three-season (spring, summer, fall) sets. For forest alliances, hyperspectral metrics improved overall accuracy of classifications by 2.9 to 6.4% relative to classifications based on the original reflectance bands. Multi-seasonal data improved overall accuracy by 1.3 to 6.2% relative to summer-only data. Using multi-seasonal metrics, the S.F. Bay Area regional classification with 21 alliances had an overall accuracy of 65.7% (Kappa 0.63), while the Sonoma County classification with 16 alliances had an accuracy of 75.9% (Kappa 0.72). Most forest alliances had internal variation in lifeform, species and structural properties that increased within-class spectral-temporal variation and complicated discrimination. Despite this challenge, classification accuracies were similar to regional NVC alliance reference data.

The paucity is due, in part, to the lack of in situ measurements of pertinent information needed to tune water depth derivation algorithms. In many cases, the collection of the needed ground-truth data is often prohibitively expensive or logistically infeasible. We present an approach for deriving water depths up to 15 m in Case 1 waters, whose inherent optical properties can be adequately described by phytoplankton, using multi-spectral satellite imagery without the need for direct measurement of water depth, bottom reflectance, or water column properties within the site of interest. The reliability of the approach for depths up to 15 m is demonstrated for ten satellite images over five study sites. For this depth range, overall RMSE values range from 0.89 m to 2.62 m when using a chlorophyll concentration equal to 0.2 mg m(-3) and a generic seafloor spectrum generated from a spectral library of common benthic constituents. Accuracy of water depth predictions drastically decreases beyond these depths.

However, it is challenging to distinguish agricultural abandonment from transitional classes such as fallow land at high spatial resolutions due to the complexity of change process. To date, no robust approach exists to detect when agricultural land abandonment occurred based on 30-m Landsat images. Our goal here was to develop a new approach to detect the extent and the exact timing of agricultural land abandonment using spatial and temporal segments derived from Landsat time series. We tested our approach for one Landsat footprint in the Caucasus, covering parts of Russia and Georgia, where agricultural land abandonment is widespread. First, we generated agricultural land image objects from multi-date Landsat imagery using a multi resolution segmentation approach. Second, we estimated the probability for each object that agricultural land was used each year based on Landsat temporal-spectral metrics and a random forest model. Third, we applied temporal segmentation of the resulting agricultural land probability time series to identify change classes and detect when abandonment occurred. We found that our approach was able to accurately separate agricultural abandonment from active agricultural lands, fallow land, and re-cultivation. Our spatial and temporal segmentation approach captured the changes at the object level well (overall mapping accuracy = 97 +/- 1%), and performed substantially better than pixel-level change detection (overall accuracy = 82 +/- 3%). We found strong spatial and temporal variations in agricultural land abandonment rates in our study area, likely a consequence of regional wars after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In summary, the combination of spatial and temporal segmentation approaches of time-series is a robust method to track agricultural land abandonment and may be relevant for other land-use changes as well.', '[Yin, He; Buchner, Johanna; Radeloff, Volker C.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, SILVIS Lab, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

In this research, empirical models were developed to both predict soil moisture from SAR and assess the relationship between LiDAR-derived vegetation and surface conditions, and polarimetric SAR parameters in a vegetated peatland environment. Importantly, the low predictive strength of soil moisture models was only evident through a process of model cross-validation (bivariate regression R-2 ranged from 0.14 to 0.66 for fitted models and 0.05 to 0.41 for independently cross-validated models). The LiDAR-derived vegetation density was found to explain a large amount of variance in the SAR data, and models to predict soil moisture from SAR from only the least vegetated sites within the peatland demonstrated much higher predictive strength (R-2 = 0.11 to 0.71). Soil moisture within the vegetated and least-vegetated sites was not significantly different. Therefore, non vegetated areas may be useful as representative imaging locations for remotely monitoring surface moisture conditions in large peatland complexes with heterogeneous vegetation.', '[Millard, Koreen; Richardson, Murray] Carleton Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', 'Carleton UniversityRP Millard, K (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', 'Koreen_millard@carleton.caRI Millard, Koreen/A-5664-2013; Richardson, Murray/AAW-3465-2021', 'Millard, Koreen/0000-0002-6346-0325', 'National Science and Engineering Research Council [402226-2012]; NSERC   Canada Graduate Scholarship', 'The authors would like to thank Doug King and Scott Mitchel for reading   an early version of the manuscript and providing suggestions in sampling   strategies and data analysis methods; Marisa Ramey, Cassandra Michel,   Cameron Samson, Keegan Smith, Julia Riddick, Doug Stiff, Lindsay   Armstrong and Fernanda Moreira Amaral for their significant contribution   to field data collection; South Nation Conservation Authority for   supplying equipment; Elyn Humphreys for installation and management of   the met station.

However, GRACE system\'s resolution is too low, and the inversion of InSAR data into volume of groundwater storage loss requires extensive and often unavailable lithological data. Here we present how InSAR can be used to constrain and spatially focus GRACE-derived groundwater mass loss to depletion areas, reducing the gap between the GRACE scale and the typical water management scales. While we highlight the tremendous potential of a fully geodetic, quantitative, and high resolution mapping of groundwater storage loss, we also point out the crucial need for producing guidelines on the proper GRACE solution to use for any study area and/or application.   In order to illustrate the GRACE/InSAR combination procedure, we present a case study in Central Mexico, where groundwater depletion of similar to 5000 Million Cubic Meters per year (MCM/yr) is reported by the water governance agencies and is well documented in the scientific literature. However, in this region, not all GRACE solutions provide reasonable groundwater depletion estimates. Using two of them, an inversion is performed to focus the groundwater-related GRACE signal over different mass distribution maps. Several mass distributions are tested, including two from InSAR-derived aquifer compaction mapping. The results show that the regions of Mexico City and Bajio, an agricultural and industrial corridor 250 km North of Mexico City, are the main contributors to the regional groundwater depletion. The mass distribution map produced directly from InSAR leads to results closer to official groundwater budgets than the others tested.', '[Castellazzi, Pascal; Martel, Richard; Brouard, Charles] Univ Quebec, Inst Natl Rech Sci, Ctr Eau Terre & Environm, 490 Rue Couronne, Quebec City, PQ G1K 9A9, Canada.

While the joint analysis of available satellite data (infrared, visible and altimetry) permitted the characterisation and tracking of the anticyclone properties and path, data from a coastal high-frequency radar system enabled a quantitative analysis of the surface cross-shelf transports associated with this anticyclone. The warm core anticyclone had a diameter of around 50 km, maximum azimuthal velocities near 50 cm s(-1) and a relative vorticity of up to -0.45f. The eddy generation occurred after the relaxation of a cyclonic wind-driven current regime over the shelf-slope; then, the eddy remained stationary for several weeks until it started to drift northwards along the shelf break. The surface signature of this eddy was observed by means of high-frequency radar data for 20 consecutive days, providing a unique opportunity to characterise and quantify, from a Lagrangian perspective, the associated transport and its effect on the Chl-a surface distribution. We observed the presence of mesoscale structures with similar characteristics in the area during different winters within the period 2011-2014.

In volcanology, elevation data are of particular importance when assessing material flows throughout a volcanic system. To obtain accurate estimates of time-varying topography in volcanic active regions, high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) are required. To monitor and evaluate topographical changes and especially volumetric gains and losses during the 2014-2015 Baroarbunga eruption, Iceland, multi-temporal TanDEM-X DEM sequences were evaluated.   The 2014-2015 volcanic eruption was associated with the rare event of a caldera collapse, visible on the surface of the Vatnajokull glacier, as well as major lava effusion in the Holuhraun plain. Before investigating topographical change at the two study areas, the TanDEM-X DEMs were analysed for absolute and relative height errors resulting from the radar system parameters, the SAR processing or the local environment. The uncertainty investigation determined that acquisitions over the snow-covered Baroarbunga caldera were primarily affected by microwave penetration into snow and DEMs over the Holuhraun lava field exhibited increased height errors due to active lava flows and dynamic outwash plain.   The topographical analysis of the 2014-2015 Baroarbunga eruption revealed a maximum vertical displacement of approximately -65 m and + 43 m at the study area of the Baroarbunga caldera and Holuhraun lava field respectively. With a total subsidence volume of -1.40 +/- 0.13 km(3) and a dense-rock equivalent (DRE) lava volume of +1.36 +/- 0.07 km(3), known uncertainties in volume were decreased by approximately 35% and 77% accordingly. Taking into account the calculation of rates, the temporal development of caldera collapse and lava effusion was found to exhibit a near-exponential decrease.

However, there is still uncertainty in SAR derived sea ice motion depending on the ice type and its thermodynamic state. There have been suggestions (mostly theoretical) that use of L-band SAR and its inherent longer wavelength (15-30 cm) and subsequent increased penetration capability could be beneficial for estimating sea ice motion, especially during the melt season. Here, we estimate and analyze sea ice motion for 9 pairs of C- and L-band SAR imagery from RADARSAT-2, PALSAR-1 and PALSAR-2 located in the Canadian Arctic over a variety of sea ice types at different thermodynamic states. Results show that the increased signal penetration of L-band SAR into multi-year ice (MYI) during the melt season facilitates the detection of more motion vectors with stronger cross-correlation coefficients compared to C-band SAR. Over newly formed ice and dry first-year ice, the reduced sensitivity to surface scattering and richer texture from L-band SAR imagery facilitates the detection of more motion vectors with stronger cross-correlation coefficients compared to C-band SAR. Over dry MYI, L-band provided stronger cross-correlation coefficients but C-band detected more motion vectors with a more representative spatial distribution. With Arctic sea ice continuing shift from a multi-year to first-year dominated icescape, coupled with an increasing melt season length, L-band SAR\'s ability to provide improved sea ice motion estimates during both the melt and freeze-up time periods could prove even more useful in the coming decades.', '[Howell, Stephen E.

However, previous studies on SIF were mainly based on satellite observations from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2), and the evaluation of these coarse-resolution SIF measurements using GPP derived from eddy covariance (EC) flux towers has been hindered by the scale mismatch between satellite and tower footprints. We use new far-red SIF observations from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) with much finer spatial resolution and GPP data from EC flux towers from 2014 to 2016 to examine the relationship between GPP and SIF for temperate forests. The OCO-2 SIF tracked tower GPP well, and had strong correlation with tower GPP at both retrieval bands (757 nm and 771 nm) and both instantaneous (mid-day) and daily timescales, with the strongest relationship for the 757 nm band (SIF757) at the daily timescale. Daily SIF757 exhibited much stronger correlation with tower GPP compared to the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) based on the surface reflectance product derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard either Terra or Aqua satellite and had a similarly strong relationship as EVI based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) corrected reflectance product (MCD43A4) based on data from both Terra and Aqua. Absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) explained 85% of the variance in SIF757, while the product of APAR and two environmental scalars - fT(min) and fVPD (representing minimum temperature stress and water stress) explained higher variance (92%) in SIF757. This suggests that SIF mainly depends on APAR and is also affected by environmental stresses that determine photosynthetic light use efficiency. The BRDF-corrected EVI also has advantages over SIF in that EVI has spatially and temporally continuous coverage and has a much longer record (2000-present). The OCO-2 SIF757 estimated GPP well (R-2 = 0.81, p < 0.0001; RMSE = 1.11 gC m(-2) d(-1)), and its performance was comparable to or slightly better than that of the MODIS GPP algorithm, a GPP model based on the light use efficiency logic. With intensive OCO-2 observations acquired in the Target mode around Park Falls, a calibration/validation site for OCO-2, we also generated gridded SIF and then estimated GPP on a per-pixel basis at the landscape scale.

The tropospheric delays vary both vertically and laterally and can be considered as the sum of (i) a vertically stratified component highly correlated with topography and (ii) a turbulent component resulting from turbulent processes in the troposphere varying both in space and time. In this paper, we outline a framework to routinely use pointwise GPS data to reduce tropospheric effects on satellite radar measurements. An Iterative Tropospheric Decomposition (ITD) model is used and further developed to separate tropospheric stratified and turbulent signals and then generate high-resolution correction maps for SAR interferograms. Cross validation is employed to assess the performance of the ITD model and act as an indicator to users of when and where correction is feasible. Tests were carried out to assess the impact of GPS station spacing on the ITD model InSAR correction performance, which provides insights into the trade-off between station spacing and the achievable accuracy. The appliCation of this framework to Sentinel-1A interferograms over the Southern California (USA) and Southern England (UK) regions shows approximately 45-78% of noise reduction even with a sparse (similar to 50-80 km station spacing) GPS network and/or with strong and non-random tropospheric turbulence. This is about a 50% greater improvement than previous methods.

There is also a need to monitor biomass changes in the coastal Everglades due to continuing sea level rise. Previous research in biomass estimation of coastal marshes has focused on pixel-based parametric modeling methods. In this study, an object-based ensemble analysis approach was developed to map sawgrass biomass at multiple scales using Landsat data. Four machine learning regression algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were evaluated and compared to the commonly used Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) method for both live and total sawgrass biomass estimation. A weighted combining scheme was developed to integrate predictions from comparable models for ensemble analysis. Nonparametric machine learning models had better performance than the parametric approach. ANN and SVM produced similar results in live biomass estimation with the correlation coefficient (r) larger than 0.9, while ANN achieved the best result for the total biomass estimation (r = 0.94). Sawgrass biomass maps were produced for two harvest seasons in 2014 and 2016 at three detail levels, which successfully revealed the spatial and temporal (seasonal and interannual) sawgrass biomass variations. Ensemble analysis of the ANN and SVM predictions of live sawgrass biomass not only made the estimation more reliable, but also generated an uncertainty map to identify the regions with a robust biomass prediction, as well as challenging areas for biomass quantification. It is concluded that the object-based ensemble analysis is a promising alternative to the commonly used pixel-based biomass modeling techniques.', '[Zhang, Caiyun; Denka, Sara; Cooper, Hannah] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Geosci, 777 Glades Rd, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA.

The MUR SST values agree with the GHRSST Multi-Product Ensemble (GMPE) SST field to 0.36 degrees C on average, except in summer-time Arctic region where the existing SST analysis products are known to disagree with each other. The feature resolution of the MUR SST analysis is an order of magnitude higher than most existing analysis products.   The Multi-Resolution Variational Analysis (MRVA) method allows the MUR analysis to use multiple synoptic time scales, including a 5-day data window used for reconstruction of mesoscale features and data windows of only few hours for the smaller scale features. Reconstruction of fast evolving small scale features and interpolation over persistent large data voids can be achieved simultaneously by the use of multiple synoptic windows in the multi-scale setting. The MRVA method is also a \"mesh-less\" interpolation procedure that avoids truncation of the geolocation data during gridding and binning of satellite samples.

The model is based on the refractive mixing dielectric model and the dielectric data measured for the three typical soils collected in the Yamal tundra. The refractive mixing dielectric model was applied to fit the measured dielectric data as a function of soil moisture at a number of fixed temperatures. As a result, the parameters of the developed model were derived as a function of temperature and texture. This set of parameters consists of the maximum gravimetric fraction of unfrozen bound water and the values of the complex refractive indexes relating to soil solids, unfrozen bound water, and moistened ice. The developed model for frozen mineral soils in conjunction with the previously developed by us dielectric model for thawed mineral soils is considered as an integral dielectric model which is applicable for permittivity calculations of soil in both thawed and frozen states.   The developed integral dielectric model for frozen and thawed mineral soils was validated using the dielectric data for five measured soils, and the statistical errors were estimated in terms of the root mean square error and the determination coefficient.

These two approaches have long been thought to be independent. In this letter, we investigated the relationship between the two approaches for extracting SOS. It was found that the thresholds at several key points in the inflexion-based approach are constant. The threshold at the inflexion point for SOS and EOS is 9.18% of vegetation growth amplitude. This threshold can link the SOS derived from the two approaches, which made it possible to determine the significant vegetation growth transitions for the threshold-based approach. Other thresholds for SOS retrieval, such as commonly-used 10% and 20% of vegetation growth amplitude, were also analyzed using a global reference NDVI.

Therefore, in this paper, a new post-classification method with iterative slow feature analysis (ISFA) and Bayesian soft fusion is proposed to obtain reliable and accurate change detection maps. The proposed method consists of three main steps: 1) independent classification is implemented to obtain the class probability for each image; 2) the ISFA algorithm is used to obtain the continuous change probability map of multi-temporal images, where the value of each pixel indicates the probability to be changed; and 3) based on Bayesian theory, the a posteriori probabilities for the class combinations of coupled pixels are calmlated to integrate the class probability with the change probability, which is named as Bayesian soft fusion. The class combination with the maximum a posteriori probability is then determined as the change detection result. In addition, a class probability filter is proposed to avoid the false alarms caused by the spectral variation within the same class. Two experiments with multi-temporal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images indicated that the proposed method achieves a clearly higher change detection accuracy than the current state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method based on Bayesian theory and ISFA was also verified to have the ability to improve the change detection rate and reduce the false alarms at the same time. Given its effectiveness and flexibility, the proposed method could be widely applied in land-use/land-cover change detection and monitoring at a large scale. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The most commonly used method for plant density quantification is based on visual counting from ground level. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a method for estimating wheat plant density at the emergence stage based on high resolution imagery taken from UAV at very low altitude with application to high throughput phenotyping in field conditions. A Sony ILCE alpha 5100L RGB camera with 24 Mpixels and equipped with a 60 mm focal length lens was flying aboard an hexacopter at 3 to 7 m altitude at about 1 m/s speed. This allows getting ground resolution between 0.20 mm to 0.45 mm, while providing 59-77% overlap between images. The camera was looking with 45 degrees zenith angle in a compass direction perpendicular to the row direction to maximize the cross section viewed of the plants and minimize the effect of the wind created by the rotors. Agisoft photoscan software was then used to derive the position of the cameras for each image. Images were then projected on the ground surface to finally extract subsamples used to estimate the plant density. The extracted images were first classified to separate the green pixels from the background and the rows were then identified and extracted. Finally, image object (group of connected green pixels) was identified on each row and the number of plants they contain was estimated using a Support Vector Machine whose training was optimized using a Particle Swarm Optimization.   Three experiments were conducted in Greoux, Avignon and Clermont sites with some variability in the sowing dates, densities, genotypes, flight altitude, and growth stage at the time of the image acquisition. The application of the method on the 270 samples available over the three sites provides a RMSE and relative RMSE on estimates of 34.05 plants/m(2) and 14.31% with a bias of 9.01 plants/m(2). However, differences in performances were observed between the three sites, mostly related to the growth stage at the time of the flight. Plants should have between one to two leaves when images are taken. Further, a specific sensitivity analysis shows that the ground resolution of the images should be better than 0.40 mm. Finally, the repeatability of the method is good especially when images are taken from similar observational geometries. The current limits and possible improvements of the method proposed are finally discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, the structure of point clouds depends not only on stand structure, but also on the LiDAR instrument, its settings, and the pattern of flight. The resulting variation between and within datasets (particularly variation in pulse density and footprint size) can induce spurious variation in LiDAR metrics such as maximum height (h(max)) and mean height of the canopy surface model (C-mean). In this study, we first compare two LiDAR datasets acquired with different parameters, and observe that h(max) and C-mean are 56 cm and 1.0 m higher, respectively, when calculated using the high-density dataset with a small footprint. Then, we present a model that explains the observed bias using probability theory, and allows us to recompute the metrics as if the density of pulses were infinite and the size of the two footprints were equivalent. The model is our first step in developing methods for correcting various LiDAR metrics that are used for area-based prediction of stand structure. Such methods may be particularly useful for monitoring forest growth over time, given that acquisition parameters often change between inventories. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

While previous efforts have shown the advantage of using the short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands instead of near-infrared (NIR) bands for atmospheric correction, such an approach could only be applied to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua satellite (MODISA). This is because MODIS data from the Terra satellite (MODIST) contain more noise and other sensor artifacts, thus this sensor has been generally regarded by the ocean color research community as not being able to provide science quality data. Here, we address this technical challenge through noise reduction and regional vicarious calibration adjustment, and demonstrate preliminary success using turbid Taihu Lake as an example. The noise in the three SWIR bands was evaluated first, and then reduced through a noise reduction method. The SWIR bands were adjusted over open-ocean waters using the well-calibrated NIR ocean bands (1-km resolution) and radiative transfer, which were then used to adjust the land bands (250-m and 500-m resolution) in the visible and NIR over turbid waters where concurrent field-measured reflectance spectra are available. Of all three combinations of SWIR bands, the combination of 1240 and 1640-nm bands was found to perform the best, showing significantly improved retrieval accuracy for Taihu Lake, leading to recovery of low-quality MODIST data to higher-quality data comparable to MODISA, and thus doubling valid data coverage. Testing of this approach on another highly turbid lake (Chaohu Lake, China) showed similar results. While the general application of this approach to turbid lakes still needs to be tested as local tuning of the calibration coefficients may be required, these results suggest that MODIST may be used as effectively as MODISA for monitoring Taihu Lake water quality.

Recent computational advances have made it possible to derive a \"local mode\" MISR aerosol product at a spatial resolution of 4.4 km that maintains the quality of the 17.6 km resolution Version 22 operational aerosol product. MISR is uniquely capable of providing total AOD as well as AOD fractionated by size (small, medium, and large), enabling estimation of size-resolved surface PM concentrations.   Total and size-fractionated AOD from the MISR 4.4 km aerosol product were used to develop spatio-temporal models to estimate surface concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and PM2.5 chemical species over Southern California. We found, and confirmed by leave-one-site-out cross validation, that PM2.5 was best estimated with a spatio-temporal model of AOD small + medium that also included adjustment for relative humidity and wind speed (R-2 = 0.67, CV R-2= 0.51), while PM10 was best estimated from AOD large with adjustment for dew point and wind speed (R-2 = 0.76, CV R-2 = 0.44). Total AOD was most strongly associated with PM2.5 components SO4 2 ( R-2= 0.74, CV R-2= 0.69) and NO3(-)(R-2= 0.72, CV R-2= 0.39). The best fitting models were applied to all available MISR aerosol retrievals over the region, generating surfaces of estimated size-resolved PM concentrations that will be a great asset to the environmental science and public health communities.

Recent studies investigating the effects of spatial configuration of greenspace show significant, but inconsistent results, including both positive and negative effects. To investigate the causes of this inconsistency, we compared Baltimore, MD and Sacramento, CA, USA, two cities with very different climatic conditions. We quantified and compared the relationships between the spatial configuration of trees and land surface temperature (LST) using different statistical approaches, and conducted the analyses using spatial units of different sizes, based on trees mapped from 1 m high resolution imagery. We found: (1) trees\' cooling efficiency was higher in Baltimore than in hotter and drier Sacramento. Additionally, percent cover of trees was more important than their spatial configuration in predicting LST in Baltimore, but the opposite was found in Sacramento. (2) Spatial configuration of trees affects LST more in Sacramento than in Baltimore, and the effects of spatial configuration of trees on LST varied greatly in terms of magnitude, significance, and even direction, between the two cities. Notably, mean patch size had significantly positive effects on LST in Baltimore, but negative effects in Sacramento. In contrast, edge density had negative effects on LST in Baltimore, but positive effects in Sacramento. (3) Different statistical approaches resulted in dramatic changes in the relationships between CST and configuration metrics. Our results underscore the necessity of controlling the effects of percent cover of trees, when quantifying the effects of spatial configuration of trees on LST. (4) Spatial autocorrelation may influence relationships between landscape metrics and LST, particularly when the unit of analysis is relatively small. (5) The relationships between spatial configuration metrics and LST are stronger with an increase of the size of the analytical unit. This study can enhance our understanding of the effects of spatial configuration of greenspace on urban heat island (UHI). It also provides important insights to urban planners and natural resource managers on how to mitigate the impact of urbanization on UHI through urban design and vegetation management.

Current satellite-based methods for mapping SWE over Quebec\'s main hydropower basins do not meet Hydro-Quebec operational requirements for SWE accuracies with less than 15% error. This paper assesses the accuracy of the GlobSnow-2 (GS-2) SWE product, which combines microwave satellite data and in situ measurements, for hydrological applications in Quebec. GS-2 SWE values for a 30-year period (1980 to 2009) were compared with space- and time-matched values from a comprehensive dataset of in situ SWE measurements (a total of 38,990 observations in Eastern Canada). The root mean square error (RMSE) of the GS-2 SWE product is 94.1 +/- 20.3 mm, corresponding to an overall relative percentage error (RPE) of 35.9%. The main sources of uncertainty are wet and deep snow conditions (when SWE is higher than 150 mm), and forest cover type. However, compared to a typical stand-alone brightness temperature channel difference algorithm, the assimilation of surface information in the GS-2 algorithm clearly improves SWE accuracy by reducing the RPE by about 30%. Comparison of trends in annual mean and maximum SWE between surface observations and GS-2 over 1980-2009 showed agreement for increasing trends over southern Quebec, but less agreement on the sign and magnitude of trends over northern Quebec. Extended at a continental scale, the GS-2 SWE trends highlight a strong regional variability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Inundation is highly dynamic and can vary substantially through time in response to multiple drivers, including precipitation and evapotranspiration. This research focused on developing a practical and effective framework for regional, long-term monitoring of wetland inundation dynamics using airborne LiDAR intensity data (Lang et al., 2013) and Landsat time-series imagery. Subpixel water fraction (SWF) maps indicating the percent of surface water within each 30-m pixel were generated on an annual basis over the entire Delmarva Peninsula on the East Coast of the United States from 1985 to 2011. Comprehensive accuracy assessments of the SWF maps were conducted using historical high-resolution aerial photography to determine the reference condition. The assessment resulted in an estimated root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.78% for the sample of open water areas (mean SWF was similar to 40% for this region of the map). Moreover, a separate accuracy assessment targeting inundation in wetlands (i.e. presence or absence of water) yielded an overall accuracy of 93%. Accuracies derived indicated that Landsat data can be calibrated to accurately extract long-term water information at the regional scale. Characteristics of inundation were examined with respect to different wetland types defined by water regime and dominant vegetation types, as well as different physical drivers. Results showed that tidal wetlands typically exhibited more intensive inundation than nontidal wetlands, and a higher degree of inundation was associated with emergent wetlands compared to wetland areas dominated by woody vegetation. Analysis of change drivers revealed that tide exerted a statistically significant influence on coastal inundation with r(2) values of 32-36% and p < 0.01, whereas inundation changes in inland wetland areas were in part driven by precipitation with r(2) values of 25-34% and p < 0.08. Because an up-to-date archive of Landsat imagery is globally available and LiDAR data are becoming increasingly more affordable, the developed framework can be easily implemented to generate a continuous inundation record in many regions of the globe to assist in ongoing and future studies focused on wetland hydrology and wetland management.

Additionally, new methods are essential to avoid model misapplication in fuel and fire management decision processes. This study proposes an exploratory evaluation framework of fire growth simulations using satellite active fire data. It uses nine very large fires that occurred in Portugal between 2003 and 2012. Their fire growth was simulated using the Fire Area Simulator (FARSITE) and compared with active fire data from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The evaluation is based on two spatial measures that quantify the absolute (SpD) and relative (NRSpD) spatial discrepancies between fire growth simulations and satellite active fires. Both measures account for the uncertain location of the fire front(s) inside the active fire footprint. Results highlight the contribution of the spatial discrepancy measures to locate areas of low/high spatio-temporal agreement between simulated fire growth and MODIS active fires, thereby aiding the assessment of potential sources of simulation error. Results also show that despite the coarse spatial resolution of MODIS active fires, these data are able to capture the spatial dynamics of fire growth. Limitations on the spatial measures were identified, particularly the lack of independence of evaluations using the NRSpD. In spite of being exploratory, this study represents a novel contribution to the evaluation of fire growth simulations because: 1) it uses satellite active fire data and is independent of the collection of reference burnt area perimeters; 2) it proposes two simple quantitative spatial discrepancy measures; and 3) it can be applied to a large number of wildfires, regardless of their geographical location. This innovative approach represents a potential cost effective evaluation scheme, that can be used systematically whenever evaluation of a large number of large wildfires is required and reference burned area perimeters are not available.

Understanding of large-scale biological dynamics is limited by the lack of adequate datasets. In this study, we analyse 15 years of remotely-sensed chlorophyll-a data (Chl-a, an index of phytoplankton biomass) acquired from the Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) of the European Space Agency (ESA). The improved spatial coverage of OC-CCI data in the Gulf of Aden allows, for the first time, an investigation into the full seasonal succession of phytoplankton biomass. Analysis of indices of phytoplankton phenology (bloom timing) reveals distinct phytoplankton growth periods in different parts of the gulf: a large peak during August (mid-summer) in the western part of the gulf, and a smaller peak during November (mid-autumn) in the lower central gulf and along the southern coastline. The summer bloom develops rapidly at the beginning of July, and its peak is approximately three times higher than that of the autumnal bloom. Remotely-sensed sea-surface temperature (SST), wind-stress curl, vertical nutrient profiles and geostrophic currents inferred from the sea-level anomaly, were analysed to examine the underlying physical mechanisms that control phytoplankton growth. During summer, the prevailing southwesterlies cause upwelling along the northern coastline of the gulf (Yemen), leading to an increase in nutrient availability and enhancing phytoplankton growth along the coastline and in the western part of the gulf. In contrast, in the central region of the gulf, lowest concentrations of Chl-a are observed during summer, due to strong downwelling caused by a mesoscale anticyclonic eddy. During autumn, the prevailing northeasterlies enable upwelling along the southern coastline (Somalia) causing local nutrient enrichment in the euphoric zone, leading to higher levels of phytoplankton biomass along the coastline and in the lower central gulf. The monsoon wind reversal is shown to play a key role in controlling phytoplankton growth in different regions of the Gulf of Aden. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The high spatial resolutions of sea-clutter image sequences from X-band radar offer a means of deriving individual waves and wave field at low-cost. However, the performance of X-band radar is impaired under rainy conditions, which are usually accompanied by the severe weather at sea. In the present study, we examine the effectiveness of S-band radar for wave measurements under precipitation. The results of comprehensive comparative studies with sea-truth data show that S-band radar is capable of carrying out wave measurements in rainy conditions. Although the longer wavelength of the S-band leads to a coarser resolution of radar imagery, the S-band radar features at least the equivalent performance of the X-band system in non-rainy conditions, in terms of wave height measurement. The results suggest that the S-band and X-band could be complementary systems. In rainy conditions the S-band is more efficient but in the non-rainy periods the X-band gives more confident results. The relationship of significant wave height with radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the modulation transfer function (MTF) between radar spectrum and wave spectrum for the used X-band and S-band radars are established and discussed in this paper.

Many satellite-based methods for fire detection and monitoring have been developed to exploit data acquired by sensors onboard polar orbiting platforms. Their relatively low temporal resolution (hours) is, however, decidedly not adequate for detecting short-living events or fires characterised by a marked diurnal cycle and rapid evolution times. Geostationary satellites have very high temporal resolution of 30 to 2.5 min and could, in principle, be more suitable for providing timely alerts and facilitating possible mitigation actions. However, such short revisit times are coupled with spatial resolutions of 3-5 km; which are coarser than those of the polar orbiting sensors generally having 1 km capability in the infrared region. This could represent a significant limitation for small fire detection and precise localization. However, unlike polar orbiting systems, the geostationary attitude assures very stable observational conditions at the pixel level, including fixed view angles, same time of day, and same ground resolution cell dimensions. This can be crucial for fire-detection methods based on multi-temporal analyses.   This work describes in detail the Robust Satellite Techniques for FIRES detection and monitoring (RST-FIRES), a multi-temporal change-detection technique, and its application to the data of Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) on board the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) platform. Its performance in terms of reliability and sensitivity was verified by >20,000 SEVIRI images collected throughout the day during a four-year -collaboration with the regional Civil Protection Departments and other Local Authorities of two Italian regions which provided about 950 near real-time ground and aerial checks of the RST-FIRES detections.   The results indicate a mean commission error rate of 18%, ranging from 3% to 30% according to the specific experimental campaign, with an average omission error of 44%, ranging from 3% to 66% depending on the campaign and the validation source used.   This study fully demonstrates the added value of the RST-FIRES technique for the early warning of fire events. During the considered validation campaigns, RST-FIRES provided the sole fire alert in 348 cases; in further 227 cases, its warnings were given >1 h before any other source of information was provided.   Finally, this paper presents and discusses a comparison among RST-FIRES and other SEVIRI-based fire detection products.   On the whole, RST-FIRES is shown to be 3 to 70 times more sensitive than all of the other considered SEVIRI-based products. This satisfactory result was not completely unexpected, considering the quite high false positive rate exhibited by RST-FIRES and the fact that other algorithms were designed to work in a wider area, from continental to the SEVIRI full disk.

To increase the spatial extent of the deformation signal, we developed a coherence-based small-baseline subset (SEAS) method and derived the time series of the landslide movement. We find no significant movement on the previously mapped Washougal, Sakamania, Oregon Shore, and Wind Mountain landslides. However, we document the slow movement of the Redbluff landslide, which is part of the Cascade Landslide Complex. The InSAR data reveal up to approximately 25 cm of line-of-sight displacement over the 4-year observation period. The Redbluff landslide is seasonally activated, with accelerated movement observed during the early winter of each year. The amplitude of the seasonal signal is variable from year-to-year, with the greatest movement observed in early winter of 2009 and 2011. To assess the triggering mechanisms, we compared the displacement time series data with local precipitation data. The deformation correlated well with precipitation, implying the slow movement is controlled by rainfall that infiltrates to the base of the slide. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

While instrument processing and retracking techniques of the radar echoes improved over the years for ocean applications to produce homogeneous products for all satellite altimetry missions, less effort has been devoted to applications over land. European Space Agency (ESA) continues improving the quality of ENVISAT data over all type of surfaces through frequent reprocessing of altimeter corrections. No similar effort was performed for the ERS missions until recently with the release of the ESA ERS REAPER product mostly devoted to ocean applications. In parallel, Centre de Topographie des Oceans et de l\'Hydrosphere (CTOH) processed the ERS-2 waveforms (WAP data) with a new implementation of the Ice-2 retracker algorithm, adding improvements and corrections to make ERS-2 data compatible and homogenous with the ENVISAT mission for continuity and long-term altimetry data analysis over land and ice sheets. The resulting product is evaluated against ENVISAT data during the tandem phase when they flew 30 min apart on the same orbit during 10 cycles of the two missions from June 2002 to July 2003. Maps of along-track differences averaged over the 10 cycles of the tandem phase and associated RMSE are presented over ocean, both Antarctica and Greenland ice sheets and land along with time series of altimetry backscattering coefficients and altimetry-based water levels. Similar comparisons were performed between ENVISAT and ERS-2 REAPER data. Low bias and RMSE values for altimeter heights and backscattering were found between ENVISAT and ERS-2 over ocean and flat areas over land and ice sheets with generally better results obtained using CTOH data. Comparisons with in situ water stages also show good agreement for Ice-2 and especially Ice-1 retracicers derived water levels (R > 0.95). (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, a holistic technique is not currently available to generate spatially and temporally continuous LSTs from Landsat due to its 16-day revisit frequency, impact of atmospheric conditions and the SLC (Scan Line Corrector)-off gap. Previous algorithms had been developed to overcome these limitations, it is still not possible to generate LSTs at any desired date with consistent accuracy and corrections. Therefore, this study aimed to devise an algorithm to reconstruct consistent, daily LSTs at Landsat spatial resolution based solely on Landsat imagery. By selecting Beijing, China, as the study area, a total of 512 images from 1984 to 2011 were downloaded from the USGS online portal and were consistently calibrated to surface reflectance and brightness temperature. The cloud-, cloud shadow-, and snow-contaminated pixels were excluded according to quality flags; and a further screening procedure based on temporal information of Landsat spectral bands 2,4, and 5 was conducted. Brightness temperatures were converted to LST5 through the single channel algorithm with input of water vapor from the NCEP Reanalysis dataset. Field LSTs were collected from 11 weather stations in Beijing in the year of 2008, 2009, and 2010. The proposed algorithm included four modules: Data filtEr, temporaL segmentation, periodic and trend modeling, and GAussian process (DELTA). Accuracy assessment showed that, compared with the in situ LSTs from weather stations, satellite-derived LSTs inverted through the single channel algorithm had an average accuracy of 2.3 K. Further comparison between LSTs reconstructed from the DELTA algorithm and those collected from weather stations in the year 2008 yielded a mean error of 3.5 K. Twelve LST maps reconstructed from the DELTA in 2000 showed that LST5 of different land covers exhibited similar seasonal patterns and reached their maximal values in June/July. Using LST of every August 15th as an example, the SUHI (surface urban heat island) intensity of Beijing was computed, which ranged from 33 K to 5.3 K from 1984 to 2011, with an increase pattern of LST in both rural and urban areas.

Their developments, especially with scanning and multi-beam systems require accurate modeling tools to analyze existing data and to design future systems. A few radiative transfer models (RTMs) can simulate LiDAR waveform of one pulse. Based on that, this paper presents an efficient, flexible and user-friendly approach that extends the existing single-pulse simulation to a device-specific multi-pulse tool in the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model. The realistic acquisition configurations (platform positions and orientations dataset) can be imported and the simulated waveforms can be converted into industrial data formats and processed by industrial software. Multi-pulse simulations of several airborne and terrestrial devices are presented. DART was also extended to simulate photon counting devices, by combining the physical principles of the single-photon detector with the waveforms. In addition, it computes solar noise contribution in LiDAR signal for any atmospheric configuration through combined simulation of waveforms and passive radiance images with any sun-sensor geometry. With these improvements, DART has become a comprehensive tool for satellite, airborne and terrestrial multi-pulse systems. Several studies are illustrated with configurations of existing and future devices, including CAO, ILRIS, MABEL, and ATLAS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Our study has been performed first at the large spatial scale, and then at the local scale, focusing on some buildings located within the city centre on the eastern side of the Tevere River.   The obtained SBAS-DInSAR measurements, analysed in light of the geological setting and the spatial distribution of the settlements, indicate that the observed displacements are mainly linked to a residual consolidation process, correlated with the urbanization and hydrometric level of the Tevere River.

The OCI Chl-a algorithm for satellite-derived Chl-a data was originally developed by Hu, Lee, and Franz (2012) (J. Geophys. Res., 117, C01011, doi: 01010.01029/02011JC007395) for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). It uses two Chl-a algorithms, i.e., the color index (CO-based (reflectance difference-based) algorithm for oligotrophic waters and the usual ocean chlorophyll-type (OCx)-based (reflectance ratio-based) algorithm (e.g., OO3M for MODIS and OC3V for VIIRS), and merges the two algorithms for different Chl-a range applications (named OCI algorithm). In this study, we use the in situ Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) optics data to demonstrate conclusively that using the OCI-based Chl-a algorithm can significantly improve VIIRS Chl-a data over oligotrophic waters with much reduced data noise from instrument calibration and the imperfect atmospheric correction. Using the VIIRS-measured global Chl-a data derived from the Multi Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (MSL12) ocean color data processing system, we have developed the Cl-based algorithm specifically for VIIRS, and further improved the two Chl-a algorithms merging method using the blue-green reflectance ratio values. Extensive evaluation results show that the new OCI Chl-a algorithm for VIIRS can produce consistent Chl-a data compared with those from the OC3V algorithm. In particular, the data transition between the CI-based and OC3V-based Chl-a algorithm is quite smooth, and there are no obvious discontinuities in VIIRS-derived Chl-a data. The new OCI-based Chl-a algorithm has been implemented in MSL12 for routine production of VIIRS global Chl-a data.

In this study, we assessed the capacity of multi-temporal airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data to estimate forest biomass dynamics at a mixed subtropical forest of southeast China, and analyzed the magnitude and spatial patterns of the above ground biomass (AGB) change over a 6-year period. To do so, we evaluated different approaches to estimate change in AGB, specifically direct (i.e., predicting biomass change using the differences in LiDAR metrics) and indirect (i.e., modeling biomass for each point in time and predicting the change as their differences) approaches. Once models were developed, the change in AGB was mapped across the study site and examined in relation to forest type and age. Our results demonstrated that the direct approach (CV-R-2 = 0.63, CV-rRMSE = 25.64%) produced more accurate estimates in change of AGB than the indirect approach (CV-R-2 = 0.59, CV-rRMSE = 28.35%). Canopy height metrics of delta mean height (Delta h(mean) 1 and a number of upper percentile heights, (i.e., Delta h(75) and Delta h(95)), calculated from the LiDAR first returns, were found to be most sensitive to changes in biomass, whereas metrics based on maximum canopy height or canopy density had less predictive power. Furthermore, differences in point cloud densities did not significantly impact the estimations of AGB and change of AGB at the plot-scale (30 x 30 m). Spatial extrapolation of the AGB change indicated that, in general, most of the forest area had an overall gain in biomass. The middle-aged stands (typically dominated by Quercus acutissima between 41 and 60 years old) show marked growth of biomass (median Delta AGB = 2.29 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) followed by mature (typically dominated by Pinus massoniana between 31 and 60 years old) (median Delta AGB = 1.72 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) and young stands (typically consisting of regenerated broadleaved trees younger than 40 years old) (median Delta AGB = 1.48 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)), whereas over-mature stands (typically dominated by Cunninghamia lanceolate older than 35 years) show the lowest growth (median Delta AGB = 0.76 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) This study demonstrates benefits of using multi-temporal LiDAR data to help identify specific areas for management interventions, to enhance forest productivity, maintain biomass stocks and optimize carbon sequestration.

This effort has been pursued with the objective to create a spatially complete, accurate, homogeneous and stable, i.e. free of spurious trends, long term SST dataset. Indeed, these are the essential attributes for its usage in climate applications. The interpolation of Level 3 (L3, i.e. daily collated images) PFV52 data to L4 has been carried out at the original 4km Pathfinder resolution by adapting to the PFV52 dataset the Mediterranean near-real-time SST processing chain set up within the MyOcean projects and now operational in the framework of the European Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS). The homogeneity and consistency of the MyOcean/CMEMS REP L4 SST dataset is guaranteed by Pathfinder, since PFV52 dataset is built from the same class of sensors and reprocessed with the same algorithm. On the other hand, in order to quantify the accuracy and demonstrate the stability of both PFV52 and REP L4 SST data, a thorough validation has been performed by comparison with an independent in situ dataset, built from all the available in situ observations covering the entire reprocessing period. The validation indicates that this new optimally interpolated time series represents a valuable SST dataset for climate studies. In addition, the REP L4 dataset extends and improves previous similar datasets covering the Mediterranean Sea, presently resulting as the longest time series at 4km resolution.

However, the magnitude of the CO2 sink is uncertain because of the scarcity of in-situ observations due to its remote and rough waters. Empirical relationships were deduced based on the in-situ partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) in surface seawater and its main controls including Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) obtained during the 26th CHINARE cruise in late spring (November) and early summer (December) 2009. An extrapolation method based on multiple linear regressions was set up for combining the empirical relationship with satellite data to compute the sea-air carbon fluxes and carbon uptake in the Southern Ocean (south of 50 degrees S). The empirical relationships are validated with independent measurements from SOCATv2 database. The mean standard deviation differences (Std) between extrapolated and measured pCO(2) from SOCATv2 database (13.8 to 18.1 mu atm) are consistent with the precision of our regressions (13.6 to 213 mu atm). Including the effects of sea ice, we estimate a Southern Ocean CO2 source to the atmosphere in November 2009 about 1.65 Tg C with an uncertainty of +/- 0.73 Tg C by uncertainty propagation formula. While in December 2009, we estimated a CO2 sink of -2.34 Tg C with an uncertainty of +/- 1.03 Tg C. The carbon source and sink of the South Atlantic Ocean, the South Indian Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean were estimated. For the austral summer, the South Atlantic Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean are still strong carbon sink. When compared to the climatological monthly results of Takahashi et al.

The magnitude and nature of this sink is still uncertain and recent studies have sought to define the dynamics that control its strength and longevity. The Landsat series of satellites has been a vital resource to understand the long-term changes in land cover that can impact ecosystem function and terrestrial carbon stock. We combine annual Landsat forest disturbance history from 1985 to 2011 with single date IKONOS stereo imagery to estimate the change in young forest canopy height and above ground live dry biomass accumulation for selected sites in the CONUS. Our approach follows an approximately linear growth rate following clearing over short intervals and does not estimate the distinct non-linear growth rate over longer intervals. We produced canopy height models by differencing digital surface models estimated from IKONOS stereo pairs with national elevation data (NED). Correlations between height and biomass were established independently using airborne LiDAR, and then applied to the IKONOS-estimated canopy height models. Graphing current biomass against time since disturbance provided biomass accumulation rates. For 20 study sites distributed across five regions of the CONUS, 19 showed statistically significant recovery trends (p < 0.001) with canopy growth from 0.26 m yr(-1) to 0.73 m yr(-1). Aboveground live dry biomass (AGB) density accumulation ranged from 1.31 t/ha yr(-1) to 12.47 t/ha yr(-1). Mean forest AGB accumulation was 631 t/ha yr(-1) among all sites with significant growth trends. We evaluated the accuracy of our estimates by comparing to field estimated site index curves of growth, airborne LiDAR data, and independent model predictions of C accumulation. Growth estimates found with this approach are consistent with site index curves and total biomass estimates fall within the range of field estimates. This is a viable approach to estimate forest biomass accumulation in regions with clear-cut harvest disturbances. Published by Elsevier Inc.', '[Neigh, Christopher S.

A comprehensive description of the glaciers\' interaction with the environment and their dynamical behavior requires complex physical models and the measurement of relevant parameters. In-situ data acquisitions are costly and often spatially sparse due to the large extent of glaciers; however, satellite-based sensors offer timely data with complete ground coverage, making them a good choice for continuous monitoring of glaciers. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) allows a nearly weather-independent monitoring of glacier motion, which is beneficial for often cloudy regions like Alaska or Patagonia. This paper presents a new workflow for the automatic extraction of glacier surfaces from SAR intensity images and the determination of their velocities involving a fluid mechanics model. An initial motion estimation is obtained from intensity tracking on SAR image pairs and subsequently corrected by a physics-based spatial regularization. The surface velocity is approximated by the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation for incompressible fluids. The regularization is formulated as a data assimilation problem in which the final solution is a proper solution of the Navier-Stokes equation and simultaneously fitted to the observed velocity. This partial differential equation (PDE) constrained optimization is solved with adjoint models using finite element methods. The proposed method is evaluated on the Taku Glacier, AK, an outlet glacier of the Juneau Icefield. Our presented approach is independent from the type of sensor as long as initial velocity estimates can be obtained. The final results can be used as input to methods estimating ice volume and thickness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

On-board this satellite is the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) with thermal infrared detection capabilities similar to those of the earlier Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Earth Observation System. Fire detection products have been developed using the thermal infrared data for both VIIRS and MODIS and, although having the observation of fire as their main objective, such products are also sensitive to the radiant emissions of active volcanic surfaces, but a comparison of their capabilities in this regard remains outstanding. Here, this comparison is conducted, with a focus on the volcanoes of Indonesia, and findings are initially promising, suggesting that the VIIRS fire detection capability is an improvement over that of its predecessor. For example, between 3 April 2012 and 14 July 2014, volcanic activity was detected on 519 days by the VIIRS product, as compared with 308 days for the MODIS-Aqua product (MYD14). Causes of this apparent enhanced sensitivity are explored and, with the examination of additional data from the MODISTerra product and the MODVOLC system, are shown to be the combined influence of spatial resolution, data processing steps, imaging scan width and the fire product algorithm used. As greater quantities of data become available, a more comprehensive comparison of these observations will be possible and will be undertaken at a global scale.

Satellite radar altimetry has now been used successfully for more than two decades to measure lake level as an addition to gauge measurements. The technique has, due to the large footprint of conventional altimetry, primarily been used for large lakes. CryoSat-2, which was launched in 2010, carries the first altimeter that is able to operate in SAR mode. The along-track resolution is approximately 300 m in SAR mode thus enabling us to accurately monitor substantially smaller lakes.   Here we evaluate the precision of the along-track mean lake levels derived from CtyoSat-2 data for five lakes; Skanderborg so, Mosso, and Anew (Denmark), Okeechobee (US), and Vanern (Sweden) with a surface area ranging from 9 to 5600 km(2). Three of the lakes are compared with gauge data. As a reference we compare our results with water levels obtained from Envisat We find that the along-track precision of the mean based on CryoSat-2 is a few centimeter, even for the small lakes, which is a significant improvement compared to previous missions such as Envisat When validating against gauge data we find RMS values of differences between the estimated lake levels and in-situ gauge measurements of only 8 cm or less, after bias correcting the estimated lake levels. To estimate the along-track mean values we apply a novel approach. Instead of attempting to identify and remove the polluted observations we use a mixture distribution to describe the observation noise, which prevents the polluted observations from biasing our final reconstructed time series. These results demonstrate the promising possibilities of the upcoming mission Sentinel-3, which potentially will be able to provide accurate time series even for small lakes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Local coral colonies, including those considered threatened by the US Endangered Species Act, exacerbate the need for thorough assessment of these plumes. Without ruling out other causal factors such as wind storms and tidal currents, it is difficult to conclude whether the plumes were caused by the dredging. From current in situ monitoring programs, it is also difficult to estimate the size, duration, extent and historical context of these plumes. Satellite observing systems, in contrast, offer a means by which these plumes can be monitored and compared to previous events. As such, turbidity plumes visible in Landsat 8 and MODE Aqua imagery were first manually outlined, and then refined (for MODIS only) using anomaly and normalized anomaly thresholds determined from pre-dredging data. Local environmental conditions were also considered and used to determine dates for which elevated reflectance data might be expected in the absence of dredging. In total, the spatial extent of all turbidity plumes observed from November 2013 to April 2015 was between 127 and 228 km(2), at least 5 times that for January October 2013. Furthermore, the frequency of observed plumes in images increased from 23% to 84% after dredging began. Coral areas were particularly affected after dredging began, with over 11 km(2) of coral area being within plumes on an average of 16% of images (maximum 39%). Temporal differences in location, severity, and size were also observed. Together, these results highlight widespread turbidity plumes associated with the Port of Miami dredging activities, which may cause large adverse effects on local coral communities. The approaches developed in this work, in particular the focus on historical norms after considering all perturbation factors, may be included in monitoring and assessment of this and future dredging activities, especially where fragile marine ecosystems may be impacted.

Spatial and temporal variations in temperature, pressure, and relative humidity create tropospheric signals in InSAR data, masking smaller surface displacements due to tectonic or volcanic deformation. Correction methods using weather model data, GNSS and/or spectrometer data have been applied in the past, but are often limited by the spatial and temporal resolution of the auxiliary data. Alternatively a correction can be estimated from the interferometric phase by assuming a linear or a power-law relationship between the phase and topography. Typically the challenge lies in separating deformation from tropospheric phase signals. In this study we performed a statistical comparison of the state-of-the-art tropospheric corrections estimated from the MERIS and MODIS spectrometers, a low and high spatial-resolution weather model (ERA-I and WRF), and both the conventional linear and new power-law empirical methods. Our test-regions include Southern Mexico, Italy, and El Hierro. We find spectrometers give the largest reduction in tropospheric signal, but are limited to cloud-free and daylight acquisitions. We find a similar to 10-20% RMSE increase with increasing cloud cover consistent across methods. None of the other tropospheric correction methods consistently reduced tropospheric signals over different regions and times. We have released a new software package called TRAIN (Toolbox for Reducing Atmospheric InSAR Noise), which includes all these state-of-the-art correction methods. We recommend future developments should aim towards combining the different correction methods in an optimal manner. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Nonetheless, rapid changes in the global environment pose challenges to the science community that are increasingly difficult to address using data from single satellite sensors or platforms due to the underlying limitations of data availability and tradeoffs that govern the design and implementation of currently existing sensors. Virtual constellations of planned and existing satellite sensors may help to overcome this limitation by combining existing observations to mitigate limitations of any one particular sensor. While multi-sensor applications are not new, the integration and harmonization of multi-sensor data is still challenging, requiring tremendous efforts of science and operational user communities.   Defined by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) as a \"set of space and ground segment capabilities that operate in a coordinated manner to meet a combined and common set of Earth Observation requirements\", virtual constellations can principally be used to combine sensors with similar spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric characteristics. We extend this definition to also include sensors that are principally incompatible, because they are fundamentally different (for instance active versus passive remote sensing systems), but their combination is necessary and beneficial to achieve a specific monitoring goal. In this case, constellations are more likely to build upon the complementarity of resultant information products from these incompatible sensors rather than the raw physical measurements. In this communication, we explore the potential and possible limitations to be overcome regarding virtual constellations for terrestrial science applications, discuss potentials and limitations of various candidate sensors, and provide context on integration of sensors. Thematically, we focus on land-cover and land-use change (LCLUC), with emphasis given to medium spatial resolution (Le., pixels sided 10 to 100 m) sensors, specifically as a complement to those onboard the Landsat series of satellites. We conclude that virtual constellations have the potential to notably improve observation capacity and thereby Earth science and monitoring programs in general. Various national and international parties have made notable and valuable progress related to virtual constellations. There is, however, inertia inherent to Earth observation programs, largely related to their complexity, as well as national interests, observation aims, and high system costs. Herein we define and describe virtual constellations, offer the science and applications information needs to offer context, provide the scientific support for a range of virtual constellation levels based upon applications readiness, capped by a discussion of issues and opportunities toward facilitating implementation of virtual constellations (in their various forms).

However, these studies did not explore the sensitivities of the ML algorithms relative to ML inputs in order to determine the behavior and performance of each algorithm. In this current study, normalized sensitivity coefficients are computed to diagnose ML performance as a function of time and space. The results showed that when using the ANN, approximately 20% of locations across North America are relatively sensitive to snow water equivalent (SWE). However, more than 65% of locations in the SVM-based brightness temperature (Tb) estimates are sensitive relative to perturbations in SWE at all frequency and polarization combinations explored in this study. Further, the SVM-based results suggest the algorithm is sensitive in both shallow and deep SWE, SWE with and without overlying forest canopy, and during both the snow accumulation and snow ablation seasons. Therefore, these findings suggest that compared with the ANN, the SVM could potentially serve as a more efficient and effective measurement model operator within a Tb data assimilation framework for the purpose of improving SWE estimates across regional- and continental-scales.

Since the area surrounding Antarctica is largely unpolluted, LER changes can only be due to variations in the cloud cover and/or in the sea ice extension. In order to evaluate their influence on LER and assess the trend of the UV reflectivity under ice-free and various sea ice concentration (SIC) levels, we compared a multi-satellite-based LER dataset with different satellite observations of cloud cover and SIC for October to March from 1979 to 2012. Despite the high cloud fraction for most of this period, sea ice was found to be the main driver of LER variability and had a greater influence on LER variability than cloud cover. The cloud cover was lower in spring than in summer for all datasets, and this difference appears to be primarily associated with the sea ice extent. While an increment of the cloud fraction of 20% has been found to cause an increase in LER of up to 13 reflectivity units (RU) under ice-free conditions, this increase is halved under low SIC. In contrast, no significant changes in LER data were found under high SIC levels. The correlation between LER and SIC is evident when the latter is higher than approximately 30%. The best correlations (r) between LER and SIC were found for the Weddell Sea (r = 0.87), the Ross Sea (r = 0.85), and the Indian Ocean (r = 0.90) for November, and for the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas (r = 0.86) and the Pacific Ocean (r = 0.83) for February and October, respectively. In contrast, no correlation was found in the proximity of the coastlines of west Antarctica in October. Overall, an enhancement of SIC from 0% to 100% results in a LER increase of 44 RU. This value is larger than the corresponding sea ice-induced increase computed for the observed and modeled shortwave albedos at the top of the atmosphere (21 and 13 RU, respectively). The LER data distributions for different regions and months show a marked seasonal double peak in reflectivity. The highest relative frequency is driven by the sea ice and peaks at approximately 90 RU, whereas the secondary peak of approximately 50 RU is dominated by cloudiness. Negative trends in the UV reflectivity of the grid cells characterized by a SIC greater than 30% were found for the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas (up to -3.6 +/- 1.0 per decade in March). Trends computed over the entire Southern Ocean for mid/high SIC bins are mostly negative, although are often not statistically significant. However, the trend in the reflectivity of the ice-free grid cells was generally positive, probably due to changes in the cloud amount/opacity.

This paper explores the utility of annual Landsat time series for monitoring forest disturbance and the role of natural rubber in mainland Southeast Asia from 2000 to 2012. A region on the Cambodian-Vietnamese border was chosen for this study considering four primary questions: 1) how accurately can annual Landsat time series map the location and timing of forest disturbances in evergreen and seasonal tropical forests, 2) are there cross-border differences in frontier and non-frontier forest disturbance rates between Cambodia and Vietnam, 3) what proportion of disturbances in frontier and non-frontier forests can be accounted for by the impact of rubber plantations, and 4) is there a relationship between global market prices for natural rubber and the annual rate of frontier forest clearing for rubber plantations on both sides of the border. We used LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery) for temporal segmentation of the Landsat time series and disturbance mapping. Our results show that this approach can provide accurate forest disturbance maps but that accuracy is affected by forest type. Highest accuracies were found in evergreen forest (91%), with lower accuracies in mixed (82%) and dry-deciduous forest types (86%). Our final map considering all forest types yielded an overall accuracy of 86%. Forest disturbance rates were generally higher on the Cambodian side of the border. Frontier forest disturbance rates averaged 3.8%/year in Cambodia compared to 2.5%/year in Vietnam. Conversion to rubber was the dominant form of frontier forest change in both countries (42% in Cambodia and 84% in Vietnam). Non-frontier forest disturbances averaged 4.0% and 2.5% in Cambodia and Vietnam, respectively, with most disturbances likewise linked with rubber plantations. Although rates of frontier forest disturbance differed in both countries, they each displayed similar correlations between disturbance rates related to rubber plantation expansion and price fluctuations of natural rubber. This suggests links between localized land cover/use change and international market forces, irrespective of differing political and socioeconomic backgrounds. Our study underlines the value of using dense Landsat time series when exploring the dynamics of human-induced land cover change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Assessing the environmental outcomes of abandonment and the potential for recultivation hinges on incomplete knowledge about the spatial patterns of fallow and abandoned farmland, especially at broad geographic scales. Our goals were to develop a methodology to map active and fallow land using MODIS Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series and to provide the first European-wide map of the extent of abandoned farmland (cropland and grassland) and recultivation. We used a geographically well-distributed training dataset to classify active and fallow farmland annually from 2001 to 2012 using a Random Forests classifier and validated the maps using independent observations from the field and from satellite images. The annual maps had an average overall accuracy of 90.1% (average user\'s accuracy of the fallow class was 73.9%), and we detected an average of 128.7 million hectares (Mha) of fallow land (24.4% of all farmland). Using the fallow/active time series, we mapped fallow frequency and hotspots of farmland abandonment and recultivation of unused farmland. We found a total of 46.1 Mha of permanently fallow farmland, much of which may be linked to abandonment that occurred after the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc. Up to 7.6 Mha of farmland was additionally abandoned from 2001 to 2012, mainly in Eastern Europe, Southern Scandinavia, and Europe\'s mountain regions. Yet, recultivation is widespread too (up to 112 Mha) and occurred predominantly in Eastern Europe (e.g., European Russia, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, and Lithuania) and in the Balkans. We also tested the robustness of our maps in relation to different abandonment and recultivation definitions, highlighting the usefulness of time series approaches to overcome problems when mapping transient land-use change. Our maps provide, to our knowledge, the first European-wide assessment of fallow, abandoned and recultivated farmland, thereby forming a basis for assessing the environmental outcomes of abandonment and recultivation and the potential of unused land for food production, bioenergy, and carbon storage.

The water depth maps we generated are relative to the lowest water level from Envisat altimetry, which is assumed to be a base level with essentially zero depth. The predicted and observed water depths along the Envisat pass showed excellent agreements with RMS differences of 12.8 cm to 17.8 cm. The water depth maps were also independently validated with oh/at obtained from PALSAR interferometry, and storage anomalies estimated by multiplying inundation extents from PALSAR ScanSAR with spatially averaged water level anomalies from Envisat altimetry. The water storage volumes calculated from our water depth maps were calculated to be 11.3 +/- 2.0 km(3), 103 +/- 23 km(3), and 93 +/- 1.8 km(3) for 12/05/2006,12/08/2007, and 12/10/2008, respectively. It is expected that our method can be applied to other river basins that have flooded forest with satellite radar altimeter over-passes. The water depth maps can be directly used to calibrate and validate the spatial and temporal variation of inundation extent and water depth in the wetland derived from a 2-D hydrodynamic model. Furthermore, our water depth maps can be used as a \"true\" dataset to perform a pre-launch \"virtual mission\" study of the Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission to be launched in 2020.

In this paper, we propose a method for hyperspectral image segmentation, based on the binary partition tree (BPT) algorithm, and we apply it to two sites located in Hawaiian and Panamean tropical rainforests. Different strategies combining spatial and spectral dimensionality reduction are compared prior to the construction of the BPT. Various superpixel generation methods including watershed transformation and mean shift clustering are applied to decrease spatial dimensionality and provide an initial segmentation map. Principal component analysis is performed to reduce the spectral dimensionality and different combinations of principal components are compared. A non-parametric region model based on histograms, combined with the diffusion distance to merge regions, is used to build the BPT. An adapted pruning strategy based on the size discontinuity of the merging regions is proposed and compared with an already existing pruning strategy. Finally, a set of criteria to assess the quality of the tree segmentation is introduced. The proposed method correctly segmented up to 68% of the tree crowns and produced reasonable patterns of the segmented landscapes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Ecological models of these processes often require data at the watershed scale. GIS-based solar models that predict insolation at the watershed scale take topographic shading into account, but do not account for vegetative shading. Most methods that quantify subcanopy insolation do so only at a single point. Further, subcanopy model calibration requires significant field effort and knowledge of characteristics (species composition, leaf area index & mean leaf angle for each species), and upscaling to watersheds is a significant source of uncertainty.   We propose an approach to modeling insolation that uses airborne LiDAR data to estimate canopy openness as a Light Penetration Index (LPI). We couple LPI with the GRASS GIS r.sun solar model to produce the Subcanopy Solar Radiation model (SSR). SSR accounts for both topographic shading and vegetative shading at a landscape scale.   After calibrating the r.sun model to a weather station at our study site, we compare SSR model predictions to black thermopile pyranometer field measurements and to hemispherical photographs using Gap Light Analyzer software, a standard method for point estimation of subcanopy radiation. Both SSR and hemispherical models exhibit a similar linear relationship with pyranometer data, and the models predict similar total solar radiation flux across the range of canopy openness. This approach allows prediction of light regimes at watershed scales with resolution that was previously possible only for local point measurements.

Many of these limitations arise from a well-known sensitivity to errors in the 11-mu m background radiance estimate used in the retrieval. Since this estimate is almost always obtained by averaging neighboring pixels, the accuracy of the bi-spectral retrieval is intrinsically coupled to the local 11-mu m surface variability at the scale of the sensor footprint. In this paper, we explore the impact of this variability on the accuracy of the retrieval using ten years of 1-km MODIS fire data. In addition, we propose a simple a priori rejection test to identify and eliminate cases in which the retrieval is destined for failure (i.e., has no physically valid solution), or has a greater likelihood of yielding highly inaccurate fire area and average temperature estimates as a result of this variability. Finally, we examine the implications of our rejection scheme on the feasibility of performing the bi-spectral retrieval globally using MODIS and other comparable 1-km sensors. Under our proposed rejection criterion based on 11-mu m background variability, the bi-spectral retrieval could be performed with sufficient accuracy (here defined as limiting the average bias in retrieved fire fraction to approximately a factor of two) for only 7% of all MODIS fire pixels detected globally during the ten-year study period. Consideration of additional error sources is likely to further reduce this fraction. (C) 2014 The Authors.

However, their application has been recently questioned when the main factor limiting evapotranspiration is energy. Even though water is the main control in dryland ecosystems, these can also undergo periods of energy and temperature limitation. In this paper we aimed to: (i) evaluate the TVDI (Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index) to estimate water deficits (e.g. ratio between actual and potential evapotranspiration), and heat surface fluxes using MODIS data; and (ii) provide insights about the factors most affecting the accuracy of results. Factors considered included the type of climatic control on evapotranspiration, NE, (i.e. water-limited vs. energy-limited), the quality of T-air estimates, the heterogeneity of land cover types and climatic variables in the region, or the algorithm to extract hydrological boundaries from the images.   The TVDI was compared with eddy covariance (EC) data from two shrublands with different climatic controls for XE in South Spain. Evaluations showed that it could be used to estimate the water deficit when water was the main limiting factor (R = 0.81-0.88; Mean Average Error, MAE = 0.16-0.17) but not in energy-limited situations (R < 02; MAE = 0.10-0.2). Spatial heterogeneity in climatic variables also had a different impact on accuracy depending on limiting factors. Relative humidity was significant at the water-limited site while solar irradiance and air temperature were more important at the energy-limited site. The skill of the TVDI to estimate surface fluxes at the water-limited site was confirmed for the dominant sensible heat flux, H (R-2 = 0.93; Mean Absolute Percentage Error, MAPE = 12.85%) but not for NE (R2 = 0.01, MAPE = 115.22%) as NE fluxes at this site are just slightly above the error of the eddy covariance system. At the energy-limited site, XE (R2 = 0.74; MAPE = 31.83%) and H estimates (R2 = 0.80; MAPE = 26.85%) were better than those from the SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land) or the PML (Penman-Monteith-Leuning) models. However, the skill to predict surface fluxes in this case was due to the net radiation inputs and not by the TVDI input Our analyses also suggest: (1) to apply the TVDI excluding energy-limited sites/periods based on climatic knowledge of limiting factors on NE; (2) the best conditions for TVDI performance correspond to the situation when the controlling factors are less limiting, e.g. during the growing season (higher SWC and lower VPD); and (3) to account better for the role of vegetation controls on transpiration.

In recent decades, several land surface energy models have used both surface broadband albedo and emissivity in order to achieve reliable evapotranspiration retrievals on a daily basis. Despite these improvements in surface energy models, we noticed an assumption that most studies make when using this framework. It assumes that the surface broadband albedo and emissivity can be estimated directly as a weighted average of spectral surface bi-directional reflectances, and as a weighted average of spectral surface emissivities retrieved at a given view angle, respectively. However, this approach does not take into account surface anisotropy, which is described by the Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) in the case of the surface albedo. In this paper, we analyze the influence that estimating land surface albedo directly from the surface reflectance (alpha(REF)) or through the BRDF integration (alpha(BRDF)) has on the estimation of energy balance components (net radiation, latent and sensible heat fluxes and evapotranspiration) by using the Simplified Surface Energy Balance Index (S-SEBI). To this end, in-situ data and remote sensing images acquisitioned at different view zenith angles (VZA) such as 0 degrees, +/- 40 degrees and +/- 57 degrees by the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) over an agricultural area were used. Results show high variation in alpha(REF) depending on the VZA when compared to alpha(BRDF), with the highest difference observed in the backward scattering direction along the hot spot region (RMSE of 0.11 and relative error of 65%). Net radiation gives relative errors from 6 to 17%, with the maximum error obtained in the images that include the hot spot effect, whereas significant changes are not observed in case of the ground heat flux and the evaporative fraction. However, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux and daily evapotranspiration show relative errors ranging between 23-39%, 6-18% and 5-15% respectively. In a future study, the influence of estimating surface emissivity directly from the average of spectral emissivities under a given view angle or using a hemispherical value will be analyzed.

These studies require thermal infrared (TIR) images at both high temporal and spatial resolution to retrieve LST. However, currently, no single satellite sensors can deliver TIR data at both high temporal and spatial resolution. Thus, various algorithms/models have been developed to enhance the spatial or the temporal resolution of TIR data, but rare of those can enhance both spatial and temporal details. This paper presents a new data fusion algorithm for producing Landsat-like LST data by blending daily MODIS and periodic Landsat TM datasets. The original Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) was improved and modified for predicting thermal radiance and LST data by considering annual temperature cycle (ATC) and urban thermal landscape heterogeneity. The technique of linear spectral mixture analysis was employed to relate the Landsat radiance with the MODIS one, so that the temporal changes in radiance can be incorporated in the fusion model. This paper details the theoretical basis and the implementation procedures of the proposed data fusion algorithm, Spatio-temporal Adaptive Data Fusion Algorithm for Temperature mapping (SADFAT). A case study was conducted that predicted LSTs of five dates in 2005 from July to October in Los Angeles County, California. The results indicate that the prediction accuracy for the whole study area ranged from 13 K to 2 K Like existing spatio-temporal data fusion models, the SADFAT method has a limitation in predicting LST changes that were not recorded in the MODIS and/or Landsat pixels due to the model assumption.

To address this issue, a new method was developed to evaluate the information content of remotely sensed soil moisture data using only large-scale precipitation. Under statistically stationary conditions, precipitation conditionally averaged according to soil moisture results in a sigmoidal curve, with high average precipitation corresponding to high average soil moisture, in a manner that reflects the dependence of drainage and evaporation on soil moisture. However, errors in soil moisture measurement degrade this relationship. Thus, soil moisture data can be assessed by the degree to which the natural sigmoidal relationship is preserved. The metric of mutual information was used as an error-dependent measure of the strength of the sigmoidal relationship. In this way, a choice model was constructed between different soil moisture data records, based on maximum mutual information. Three AMSR-E soil moisture algorithms (VUA-NASA, NASA, and U. Montana) were evaluated with the choice model for a nine-year period (2002-2011) over the contiguous United States at 1/4 degrees latitude-longitude resolution, using NLDAS precipitation. The U. Montana product resulted in the highest mutual information for 50% of the region, followed closely by VUA-NASA at 47%, and distantly by NASA at 3%. Areas where the U. Montana product yielded the maximum mutual information generally coincided with low vegetation biomass and flatter terrain, while the VUA-NASA product contained more useful information in more rugged and more highly vegetated areas.

Random forests (RF) models contain a combination of characteristics that make them well suited for its application in precipitation remote sensing. One of the key advantages is the ability to capture non-linear association of patterns between predictors and response which becomes important when dealing with complex non-linear events like precipitation. Due to the deficiencies of existing optical rainfall retrievals, the focus of this study is on assigning rainfall rates to precipitating cloud areas in connection with extra-tropical cyclones in mid-latitudes including both convective and advective-stratiform precipitating cloud areas. Hence, the rainfall rates are assigned to rain areas previously identified and classified according to the precipitation formation processes. As predictor variables water vapor-IR differences and IR cloud top temperature are used to incorporate information on cloud top height. Delta T8.7-10.8 and Delta T10.8-12.1 are considered to supply information about the cloud phase. Furthermore, spectral SEVIRI channels (VIS0.6, VIS0.8, NIR1.6) and cloud properties (cloud effective radius, cloud optical thickness) are used to include information about the cloud water path during daytime, while suitable combinations of temperature differences (Delta T3.9-10.8, Delta T3.9-7.3) are considered during night-time.   The development of the rainfall rate retrieval technique is realised in three steps. First, an extensive tuning study is carried out to customise each of the RE models. The daytime, night-time and twilight precipitation events have to be treated separately due to differing information content about the cloud properties between the different times of day. Secondly, the RF models are trained using the optimum values for the number of trees and number of randomly chosen predictor variables found in the tuning study. Finally, the final RF models are used to predict rainfall rates using an independent validation data set and the results are validated against co-located rainfall rates observed by a ground radar network. To train and validate the model, the radar-based RADOLAN RW product from the German Weather Service (DWD) is used which provides area-wide gauge-adjusted hourly precipitation information.   Regarding the overall performance, as indicated by the coefficient of determination (Rsq), hourly rainfall rates show already a good correlation with Rsq = 0.5 (day and night) and Rsq = 0.48 (twilight) between the satellite and radar based observations. Higher temporal aggregation leads to better agreement. Rsq rises to 0.78 (day), 0.77 (night) and 0.75 (twilight) for 8-h interval. By comparing day, night and twilight performance it becomes evident that daytime precipitation is generally predicted best by the model. Twilight and night-time predictions are generally less accurate but only by a small margin. This may due to the smaller number of predictor variables during twilight and night-time conditions as well as less favourable radiative transfer conditions to obtain the cloud parameters during these periods.   However, the results show that with the newly developed method it is possible to assign rainfall rates with good accuracy even on an hourly basis. Furthermore, the rainfall rates can be assigned during day, night and twilight conditions which enables the estimation of rainfall rates 24 h day. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, field estimations of primary production are scarce, making remote sensing of ocean color a valuable tool to provide synoptic maps of primary production in this ecologically relevant region. Field studies performed during spring 2005, and summer and winter 2006 showed a high spatial and seasonal variability in the daily integrated water column primary production, chlorophyll-a and biomass-normalized photosynthetic parameters. Using field measurements, five different and relatively simple (non-spectral and vertically homogeneous biomass) models were tested: three chlorophyll-, one carbon- and one absorption-based model. The chlorophyll-based \'BIOM\' model developed by Platt and Sathyendranath (Science, 241:1613-1620; 1988) provided the closest estimates to the field values, and was selected as the local algorithm. Its performance was assessed using simultaneous satellite-derived products and field photosynthetic parameters as input. Close values compared to the field estimates were obtained using BIOM (Absolute Percent Difference error, APD similar to 10%), even though satellite-derived products used as input to the model (i.e. chlorophyll-a concentration, diffuse attenuation coefficient in the photosynthetically active radiation range - PAR-, and PAR irradiance) showed relative high errors (APD similar to 40%, 20% and 50%, respectively). Provided that an efficient way to assign the physiological parameters in a pixel-by-pixel basis is found, this model seems to be the best to produce primary production maps from remote sensing of ocean color in the southern Argentine shelf and shelf-break regions.

The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission offers a unique possibility of monitoring total water storage (TWS) changes. An accurate estimation of terrestrial and surface WS changes from GRACE-TWS products, however, requires a proper signal separation procedure. To perform this separation, this study proposes a statistical approach that uses a priori spatial patterns of terrestrial and surface WS changes from a hydrological model and altimetry data. The patterns are then adjusted to GRACE-TWS products using a least squares adjustment (LSA) procedure, thereby making the best use of the available data. For the period of October 2002 to March 2011, monthly GRACE-TWS changes were derived over a broad region encompassing Iran. A priori patterns were derived by decomposing the following auxiliary data into statistically independent components: (i) terrestrial WS change outputs of the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS); (ii) steric-corrected surface WS changes of the Caspian Sea; (iii) that of the Persian and Oman Gulfs; (iv) WS changes of the Aral Sea; and (v) that of small lakes of the selected region. Finally, the patterns of (i) to (v) were adjusted to GRACE-TWS maps so that their contributions were estimated and GRACE-TWS signals separated. After separation, our results indicated that the annual amplitude of WS changes over the Caspian Sea was 152 mm, 101 mm over both the Persian and Oman Gulfs, and 71 mm for the Aral Sea. Since January 2005, terrestrial WS in most parts of Iran, specifically over the center and northwestern parts, exhibited a mass decrease with an average linear rate of similar to 15 mm/yr. The estimated linear trends of groundwater storage for the drought period of 2005 to March 2011, corresponding to the six main basins of Iran: Khazar, Persian and Oman Gulfs, Urmia, Markazi, Hamoon, and Srakhs were -6.7, -6.1, -11.2, -9.1, -3.1, and -4.2 mm/yr, respectively. The estimated results after separation agree fairly well with 256 in-situ piezometric observations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Yet satellite remote sensing suffered from lack of reliable algorithms to detect HABs in optically complex coastal waters and from frequent cloud cover. Thus, it has not been possible to document short-term changes of HABs in synoptic scales. Here, using measurements from the Geo-stationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), we studied diurnal changes of a HAB of the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum donghaiense in the ECS in May 2011. The standard remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) products from the GDPS processing algorithms showed promise in delineating HABs in turbid coastal waters, yet the cloud-masking is often too tight to reveal valid cloud-free data. An alternative approach was developed to circumvent this difficulty by using the Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R-rc) and a normalization technique. A modified red tide index (RI) was developed from the normalized R-rc data at 443,490 and 555 nm, and proven effective in delineating the P. donghaiense bloom in sediment-rich waters. The hourly RI images on 29 and 30 May 2011 (8 images per day from 8:30 to 15:30) showed consistent bloom evolution through the course of a day, with physical locations driven by tides while its surface expression increased significantly from early morning to early afternoon (maximum around 14:30 local time, a 124% and 163% increase from 9:30, respectively). The maximum coverage of the HAB at 14:30 on 29 May 2011, when no cloud was observed, reached 6620 km(2). While the short-term changes in the surface expression could be a result of the horizontal dilution due to tides, vertical migration of the dinoflagellate from early morning to afternoon, as reported elsewhere, may be a dominant reason. The case study here demonstrates the unique value of a geostationary satellite ocean color sensor in revealing short-term dynamics of HABs.

In this study, a new upscaling algorithm is developed by introducing MODIS-derived apparent thermal inertia (ATI). First, a functional relationship between the station-averaged soil moisture and the pixel-averaged ATI is constructed. Second, this relationship is used to calculate the representative soil moisture time series at a certain spatial scale. Last, the Bayesian linear regression is applied to obtain the upscaled area-averaged soil moisture by using in-situ measurements as independent variables. The algorithm is evaluated using a network of in-situ moisture sensors in the central Tibetan Plateau. The results indicate that it can effectively obtain the area-averaged soil moisture, reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) from 0.023 m(3)/m(3) before upscaling to 0.013 m(3)/m(3) after upscaling. Finally, the algorithm is implemented to the 100 km x 100 km grid box where the network is installed, and the temporal pattern of the upscaled soil moisture agrees with the hydro-meteorological knowledge of this region.

Land data assimilation can play a key role in improving heat flux prediction by merging information from a range of remotely sensed products with LSMs. This paper demonstrates this potential for an open grassland site in Australia via one-dimensional experiments spanning a year-long period. With a focus on how a LSM is impacted, in-situ field observations were assimilated. Data types as available from passive microwave and thermal infra-red remote sensors were tested for their impact, with individual and joint assimilation of LE and H, near-surface soil moisture, and skin temperature observations-all on time scales approximating satellite overpass intervals. Assessed against independent data from field observations, the multi-observation approach of joint near-surface soil moisture and skin temperature assimilation made the greatest improvements to LE (expressed as daily evapotranspiration; ET), being slightly better than for joint LE and H assimilation. This result questions the value of using LE and H retrievals from thermal imagery within an assimilation context. Individually, skin temperature assimilation was one of the best performers for soil temperature estimates but with degraded root-zone soil moisture estimates and minimal ET improvements. Likewise, near-surface soil moisture assimilation produced the greatest root-zone soil moisture improvement but with relatively modest ET improvement. Combined near-surface soil moisture and skin temperature assimilation balanced the improvements to both soil moisture and temperature states along with strong improvements to ET estimates, highlighting the benefits of multi-observation assimilation.

An automated method for determining the trend of water-level change had been proposed in this study. Lake water footprints were first identified from the ICESat/GLAS GLA14 data product. Water level change was then determined from the footprints over lake water in each campaign. Trend of water-level changes was fitted with a line for each lake. Trends of water level changes from ICESat/GLAS matched well with gauge measurements in both Qinghai Lake and Nam Co. Our results showed that the trend of water-level change varied from -0.51 m/a to 0.62 m/a. Eighteen lakes showed a decreasing trend of water-level change and 38 lakes showed an increasing trend. Most lakes in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau showed an increasing trend which was probably caused by snow or glacier melts under climate warming. However, most lakes in the Yarlung Zangbu River basin showed a decreasing trend presumably resulting from intensified evaporation caused by climate warming and intensified western wind in the winter. Desertification and aggravated soil erosion in this region contributed to water level decrease. Lakes in northern Inner-Mongolia and Xinjiang and Northeast Plain of China showed decreasing trends with precipitation reduction and warming as the most probable reasons. Water consumption for agricultural use also contributed to water-level decrease in lakes of those regions. Lakes in East China Plain fluctuated presumably because most lakes were greatly affected by inflows of Yangtze River and human activities. Lakes in Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau also fluctuated. There were no obvious changes in climate warming or precipitation in this region.

The eddy was generated after a sudden increase of the trade winds causing an enhanced southward flow and upwelling at the coast of Senegal. After this wind burst event, an extremely nonlinear cyclonic eddy with a radius of about 10 to 20 km evolved downstream of Cap-Vert with Rossby number larger than one. Our analysis suggests that the eddy was generated by flow separation at the headland of Cap-Vert. The eddy was tracked on its way into the open North Atlantic Ocean from satellites over 31 days via its sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a (CHL) signature and by a satellite-tracked surface drifter. The satellite images show that this small-scale eddy transported nutrients from the upwelling region westward into the oligotrophic North Atlantic thus giving rise to enhanced CHL concentration there. Maximum CHL concentration was encountered few days after vortex generation, which is consistent with a delayed plankton growth following nutrient supply into the euphotic zone within the eddy. Furthermore, the eddy was imaged by the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) onboard the Envisat satellite. It is shown that the radar signatures of cold eddies result from damping of short surface waves by biogenic surface films which arise from surface-active material secreted by the biota in the cold eddy as well as by the change of the stability of the air-sea interface.

These problems globally occur in biomes of mixed vegetation structure and are particularly relevant for African savannas. This paper presents a multi-resolution approach to derive fractional cover of vegetation growth forms at sub-pixel level, aiming at an improved mapping of land cover in the African grassland, savanna and shrubland biome. Fractional cover is delineated for woody growth forms (trees and shrubs), herbaceous growth forms, and bare surface. The approach incorporates very high resolution (QuickBird/IKONOS, 0.6-1 m), high resolution (Landsat TM/ETM+, 30 m), and medium resolution data (MODIS, 250 m). While QuickBird/IKONOS data are classified into discrete classes, at Landsat and MODIS resolutions, sub-pixel cover is delineated using non-parametric ensemble regression trees from the random forest family. The propagation of errors in the hierarchical multi-resolution approach is assessed with Monte Carlos simulations.   The multi-resolution approach allows the adequate description of the heterogeneous vegetation structure in selected study regions of Southern Africa The RMSE of the delineated fractional cover values range between 3.1% and 8.2% when compared with higher resolution data and between 4.4% and 9.9% when compared with field surveys. Errors at the Landsat resolution show minor influence on the accuracy of the MODIS results. Regarding the inter-resolution error propagation, for 90% of the Monte Carlo simulations, errors at the Landsat resolution resulted in RMSEs for MODIS increased by less than 4% (woody vegetation), 3.5% (herbaceous vegetation) and 2% (bare surface).

On a basin scale, the results were consistent with expected variations in phytoplankton pigments, phytoplankton community composition, and picophytoplankton biomass, in response to the major known environmental phenomena in the NSCS, such as the progressive increase in biological productivity towards the coast, the runoff from the Pearl River, higher biological productivity in the wintertime, upwelling around the Taiwan Bank, winter upwelling northwest of the Luzon Island, and the transformation and dissipation of internal waves off the Dongsha Atoll. This work represents the first effort in estimating the cell abundances of the principal picophytoplankton groups in the oceans from space. The general application of this approach to the global ocean needs to be further validated and calibrated with a more extensive data base from field observations in other parts of the oceans.

Although most past and current analyses focus on detecting changes between two or more times, the opening of the USGS Landsat archive in 2009 has enabled exploration of methods for higher-frequency, time-serial monitoring of land cover dynamics. Modifying the protocols used to develop the 2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD 2001), we fit a single classifier to a spatio-temporally distributed reference sample and applied the model to 55 Landsat-5 images covering a section of the North Carolina Piedmont Plateau from 1984 to 2007. A generalized classification scheme, multi-temporal sampling design, supervised classification based on intra-annual spectral indices, and design-based accuracy assessment yielded a time-series of 16 land cover maps from 1985 to 2006 with a spatial extent of 1.7x 10(6) ha, minimum mapping unit of 1 ha, and mean temporal interval of <2 years. Comparable to accuracy of the NLCD 2001 Land Cover Layer for the region, overall accuracy for a spatio-temporally independent test sample was 75%, with K=0.7. When weighted by class proportions, percent correctly classified and kappa rose to 88% and 0.84, respectively. The resulting map series shows spatially and temporally complex changes in water, urban, forest, and herbaceous cover resulting from natural and anthropogenic processes that would not be observable in either unior bi-temporal maps. Agricultural crop area dropped from similar to 45% in the 1980s to similar to 36% in the 1990s and then rose slightly to similar to 38% at the end of the period. Forest area increased to a maximum of similar to 55% in the 1990s and then dropped to similar to 53% in 2005. Urban growth appeared to be most rapid in the 1980s and 1990s and slowed thereafter. With continued focus on the semantics, causation, sampling, and uncertainty underlying spectral land cover classification, long-term series of Landsat images will provide increasingly robust, reliable records for a growing scientific user community. These multi-temporal datasets will be indispensable for understanding past land cover dynamics and predicting the implications of future change on the provision and management of ecosystem services.

Here, we used Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR)/Terra data to study view-illumination effects on intra- and inter-annual EVI variability in the dry season of the Brazilian Xingu Indigenous Park between 2005 and 2010. In this period, the Amazon region experienced the two most extensive droughts of the 21st century, but the study area was not severely affected by the 2005 drought when compared to the 2010 episode. Bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) was analyzed in Seasonal Semideciduous Forest. Intra-annual dry season EVI was evaluated as a function of the reflectance of MISR bands, MISR view zenith angles (VZA), view direction (forward scattering or backscattering), solar zenith angle (SZA), and the shade fraction from linear spectral mixture model. In a subsequent analysis, we used only the MISR nadir camera to eliminate the impacts of view angle and view direction on inter-annual EVI variability. Furthermore, we standardized the EVI monthly and quarterly using 2005 and 2010 as references. Results showed that view angle, view direction and solar illumination introduced significant intra- and inter-annual EVI variability not directly associated with canopy photosynthetic activity. Because of the stronger near-infrared (NIR) reflectance dependence, EVI was much more sensitive to view angle and view direction than the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), especially between +/- 45.6 degrees and nadir. EVI increased with view angle from forward scattering to backscattering. At MISR nadir viewing, EVI increased from the beginning to the end of the dry season due to increasing NIR reflectance resulting from a decreasing SZA from 43 degrees (June) to 28 degrees (September) and from a reduction in shade fraction. Monthly and quarterly inter-annual analysis using the MISR nadir camera showed the absence of well-defined patterns between the EVI, canopy greenness and droughts. Nadir EVI curves had similar patterns between the years when considering the standard deviation values. EVI differences across months were random and below the average standard deviation calculated between June and September of 2005 or 2010 (+/- 0.03). Due to the uncertainties, the quarterly standardized EVI mean was higher for 2005 (+ 0.349 +/- 0.839) than for 2010 (+ 0.041 +/- 0.754), but the opposite was observed when the quarter for EVI standardization was moved from July-August-September (JAS) to June-July-August (JJA). Our MISR results reinforce the strong need to take into account view-illumination effects when analyzing time series of MODIS EVI. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This study determines the expected cloud-free coverage for the Hyperspectral Infra-red Imager (HyspIRI) mission concept using the Terra MODIS 5 km daytime cloud mask dataset covering the period 2001-2010. The HyspIRI mission concept has two instruments: a Visible Shortwave Infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectrometer and a Thermal Infrared (TIR) multispectral imager. The VSWIR and TIR instruments have equatorial revisit times of 19 and 5 days, respectively.   Using the MODIS cloud mask data, we determined the percentage of the Earth\'s land and shallow water regions that would have been viewable with cloud-free acquisitions for each quarter and year in 2001 through 2010. For the VSWIR, the average cloud-free coverage was 83.0% quarterly and 99.6% annually. Average TIR monthly coverage was also evaluated to be 90.7%. The standard deviations for these statistics were all less than 1.2%, and the average coverages exceed HyspIRI\'s quarterly and annual requirements (listed in Table 6) by over twenty standard deviations. By the central limit theorem, it follows that in a typical year, HyspIRI will meet its coverage requirements (listed in Table 6) with extremely low uncertainty, acquiring a sufficient number of scenes to enable both monthly and quarterly assessments of the vast majority of the Earth\'s land and shallow water.   This paper includes: yearly global statistics for cloud-free MODIS observations at 5 km resolution between 2001 and 2010; a one year global map representing percent cloud-free observations between 2001 and 2010; global maps representing percent cloud-free observations between 2001 and 2010 for each quarter; maps of the predicted number of views by each HyspIRI instrument quarterly and over the course of a year; and predicted global coverage quarterly and for one year for each HyspIRI instrument, with additional monthly statistics for TIR.

The empirical line method (ELM) is used widely to correct at-sensor radiance or DN to at-surface reflectance. It is based on a simple linear relationship between those two variables. Effective application of the model requires that it is estimated in a precise and unbiased fashion. The usual approach is to use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to model the relationship between the average reflectance and radiance for a small number (3 to 8) of ground targets (GTs) and then to apply the regression on a per-pixel basis to the image. This leads to a mismatch between the scale at which the model is estimated and the scale at which the model is applied. Further, this approach wastes information and can lead to inconsistent estimators. These problems are addressed in the new approach presented here. The model was estimated on a per-pixel rather than per-GT basis. This yielded consistent, precise estimators for the ELM, but placed stronger requirements on the modeling. Specifically spatial autocorrelation and non-constant variance (heteroskedasticity) in the model residuals needed to be addressed. This was undertaken using the linear mixed model (LMM), which is a model-based expression of the geostatistical method. Of particular interest is the use of a non-stationary LMM to address the heteroskedasticity. The approach taken in this paper is of significance for a broader set of remote sensing applications. Regression and geostatistics are often applied, based typically on a stationary model. This paper shows how heteroskedasticity can be assessed and modeled using the non-stationary LMM. Heteroskedasticity is present in other remote sensing applications hence the non-stationary modeling approach, demonstrated here, is likely to be beneficial. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

For the retrieval, a coupled surface-atmosphere radiative transfer model was also used to simulate the canopy radiance in specific atmospheric conditions and to quantify fluorescence and reflectance variables by using a second method based on the canopy radiance simulation (CRS), which uses the canopy radiance measurements only. The CRS method does not require any cross calibration of reference measurements, and is extremely useful when a reliable reference cannot be found. Part of the mathematical functions that modeled reflectance and fluorescence were recently used by the authors to perform simulations of observations from space. Simulations of the retrievals for both methods were performed at two different spectral band widths of 9 nm and 20 nm to evaluate the accuracy limits for a signal to noise ratio equal to 300:1. These simulations demonstrated an enhanced accuracy as compared to previously reported retrievals on the ground, and indicated that the CRS model can indeed be successfully applied for the retrieval of fluorescence. In the retrievals from measurements, the two intervals were compared to better evaluate the combined influence of the atmospheric conditions and forward modeling spectral accuracy on the CRS method. The 20 nm interval was also used to evaluate the possibility of retrieving the bi-directional and hemispherical-directional reflectances in the viewing direction of the canopy and surroundings. Lastly, the narrower 9 nm interval delivered the most accurate simulations and was chosen for comparing the retrievals obtained by means of the two different methods. From this comparison fluorescence retrieved by means of the CRS method resulted higher (about 5%) than that retrieved with the GMB method by means of the same mathematical functions, while the retrieved reflectances were very similar. The methods presented here demonstrate that fluorescence can be retrieved even when atmospheric and surface information is limited. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

An approach to constructing confidence intervals for remote sensing-based estimates of net deforestation is illustrated. The approach is based on post-classification methods using two independent forest/non-forest classifications because sufficient numbers of observations of forest/non-forest change were not available for direct classification. Further, the approach uses a model-assisted estimator with information from a traditional error matrix for the forest/non-forest classifications to compensate for bias as the result of classification errors and to estimate variances. Classifications were obtained using a logistic regression model, forest inventory data, and two dates of Landsat imagery, although the approach to inference can be used with multiple classification approaches. For the study area in northeastern Minnesota. USA, overall pixel-level accuracies for the year 2002 and 2007 forest/non-forest classifications were 0.85-0.88, and estimates of proportion net deforestation for the 2002-2007 interval were less in absolute value than 0.015. However, standard errors for the remote sensing-based estimates of net deforestation were on the order of 0.02-0.04, meaning that the estimates were not statistically significantly different from zero. Particular attention is directed to the potentially severe sample size and classification accuracy requirements necessary for estimates of net deforestation to be detected as statistically significantly different from zero.

To this end, the relationships between observed backscattering coefficients derived from 4 retracking algorithms, namely Ocean, Ice-1, Ice-2 and Sea-Ice, and ground data, including soil type, topography, vegetation and soil moisture are investigated. The considered period is 2002-2010. Results show a strong linear relationship between the backscattering coefficients and surface soil moisture measured at six different stations along the satellite track. The best results are obtained with the Ice-1 and Ice-2 algorithms. In these cases, correlation coefficients are higher than 0.8 with RMSE smaller than 2%. Vegetation effects are found to be small due both to the nadir-looking configuration of the radar altimeter and to the low vegetation cover. Finally, the relationship between soil moisture and normalized backscattering coefficient is used to retrieve soil moisture from the altimeter data. These estimates are then compared to soil moisture estimations obtained from the METeorological Operational (METOP) Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT). These results highlight the high capabilities of Ku-band altimeters to provide an accurate estimation of surface soil moisture in semiarid regions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Satellite optical-infrared (IR) remote sensing is responsive to vegetation greenness and SOS, but measurement accuracy and global monitoring are constrained by atmosphere cloud/aerosol contamination and seasonal decreases in solar illumination for many areas. The vegetation optical depth (VOD) parameter from satellite passive microwave remote sensing provides an alternative means for global phenology monitoring that is sensitive to vegetation canopy biomass and water content, and insensitive to atmosphere and solar illumination constraints. A global VOD record from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) was used to estimate North America SOS patterns and annual variability at the ecoregion scale. The SOS metrics were derived for a four year (2004-2007) record using TIMESAT and AMSR-E 10.7 GHz frequency VOD retrievals composited to 4-day median time series. The VOD SOS corresponded favorably with MODIS-for-NACP NDVI (0.73<R<0.81; p<0.01) and LAI (0.66<R<0.89; p<0.01) greenup dates, and stand level SOS estimates derived from flux tower gross primary production (r(2) = 0.61, p<0.01) and ecosystem respiration (r(2)=0.44, p<0.01) estimates. The VOD SOS was temporally offset from MODIS greenup and tower SOS metrics by up to 4-7 weeks (RMSE) and the offset patterns coincided with the primary climate constraints (temperature and water) to vegetation growth. The VOD SOS generally preceded greenup in cold temperature constrained ecoregions and followed greenup in warmer, water limited ecoregions, with delays increasing for areas with greater woody vegetation cover. The AMSR-E VOD record captures canopy biomass changes independent of NDVI greenness or LAI measures, providing new and complementary phenological information for regional carbon, water and energy cycle studies.

The method named SCAmod by the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE) is based on a forward semi-empirical model where the at-satellite observed reflectance is expressed as a function of the fractional snow cover (FSC). The effective forest transmissivity determined for each target unit-area and the generally applicable reflectances of three major contributors (wet snow, forest canopy and snow-free ground) serve as model parameters. The forest transmissivity describes the visibility of the ground through the forest canopy from above, and can be determined from visible reflectance data acquired at full snow cover conditions. SCAmod can be applied to data from various sensors operating at optical and near-infrared region. We apply the method to Envisat/AATSR and Terra/MODIS data and validate the resulting FSC against ground truth data over Finland, with considerations of feasibility of these ground truth data in a scale of the MODIS/AATSR pixel. In comparison, also NASA MOD10_L2 fractional snow product is validated. The results indicate that SCAmod performs better than MOD10_L2 particularly in forested areas; an RMSE of 0.11 for the fraction of snow covered area (range is 0-1) is achieved. For large-scale snow mapping, using reflectance data for transmissivity determination would evidently be very time-consuming. Here we present also a new method for transmissivity generation using global land cover data and demonstrate its use for snow cover mapping in continental scale. The resulting FSC data are compared against FSC from high-resolution Landsat TM/ETM + data for selected areas in Northern and Eastern Europe. The comparison indicates that SCAmod is feasible also in continental-scale snow mapping and is superior in identifying snow in dense forests. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Four optical classes have been defined using a clustering approach performed on the spectrally normalized reflectance spectra. Normalization of the reflectance spectra was carried out during the statistical analysis to emphasize the shape of the reflectances rather than their magnitude. Each optical water type is associated with a specific bio-optical environment, in agreement with previous works. Two classes present a very marked optical character, one being mostly determined by strong phytoplankton and dissolved material loads, and the other one by a high proportion of mineral particles. The two remaining classes are related to optically mixed situations although there are some differences in the relative proportion of particulate mineral material. Applying this optical typology to the SeaWiFS daily reflectance data, we emphasized the high representativeness of these 4 optical water types which allow to describe about two thirds of the reflectance spectra found within the development sites whatever the season. The adequacy of optical water type definition for monitoring the spatiotemporal variability of coastal water masses optical quality, which reflects the impact of biological and hydrodynamic processes occurring at different time scales (i.e. from high frequency to seasonal processes), has been demonstrated. The four optical classes\' typology has been shown to remain highly representative at global scale. This underlines the effective optical vicinity of some parts of the coastal ocean during some periods of the year, in spite of the recognized high optical diversity of coastal waters. This further demonstrates the high pertinence of class-based approach for large scale coastal applications. Finally, the potential for class-based inversion algorithms for improving ocean color products retrieval, as well as the applicability of such class-specific algorithms with respect to satellite information have been illustrated from the estimation of the suspended matter concentration. This work provides very encouraging evidence of the potential and adequacy of class-based inversion methods for deriving bio-optical products in optically complex waters such as the coastal ocean.

Recent developments (Hall et al., 2011, 2008: Hilker et al., 2011a, 2010a) permit us to infer photosynthetic forest light use efficiency (epsilon) using multi-angle measurements of photochemical reflectance index (PRI) from the CHRIS/PROBA satellite imaging spectrometer, thus completing a long sought-after capability to remotely sense the major inputs driving gross primary production GPP i.e., epsilon and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR). In this first of two companion papers we introduce the theoretical underpinnings of an innovative approach that utilizes our recent developments to produce remotely sensed and spatially explicit maps of epsilon and GPP from space, and a data assimilation approach to extend the spatially explicit maps to diurnal, daily and annual time scales. We quantify GPP using the traditional radiation-limited approach of Monteith (1972); however we apply it in an innovative way. [I] Using CHRIS/PROBA we quantify epsilon at each satellite overpass for a 625 km(2) area at 30 m resolution. [II] We use a novel physiologically-based multivariate function of APAR, temperature and water vapor pressure deficit model (described herein) and use it to down-regulate epsilon at 30 minute intervals. [III] We use the CHRIS/PROBA images of spatial variation in epsilon, and NDVI to quantify APAR, hence produce snapshots of GPP. We use a data assimilation approach to extend epsilon and GPP to temporally continuous and spatially contiguous maps of vegetation carbon uptake. In the second part of this study (Hilker et al., 2011b) we demonstrate and validate our approach over eight different forest flux tower sites in North America. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

A methodology to detect outliers in satellite data sets is presented. The approach uses a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) basis. The information rejected by this EOF basis is used to identify suspect data. A proximity test and a local median test are also performed, and a weighted sum of these three tests is used to accurately detect outliers in a data set. Most satellite data undergo automated quality-check analyses. The approach presented exploits the spatial coherence of the geophysical fields, therefore detecting outliers that would otherwise pass such checks. The methodology is applied to infrared sea surface temperature (SST), microwave SST and chlorophyll-a concentration data over different domains, to show the applicability of the technique to a range of variables and temporal and spatial scales. A series of sensitivity tests and validation with independent data are also conducted. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, reliable indicators of vine water status might be of great value for the optimization of grape yield and quality. In the present study the feasibility of using hyperspectral reflectance indices related to plant biophysical properties at predicting berry yield and quality attributes in rainfed vineyards is assessed. The study was conducted on Vitis vinifera cv. Chardonnay in commercial vineyards in the D.O. Penedes region (Catalonia. Spain) over two consecutive years (2007-2008). Field measurements of fractional intercepted Photosynthetic Active Radiation (fIPAR), canopy reflectance, predawn water potential (Psi(p)) and the canopy to air temperature difference at midday (Delta T-midday) were conducted at the stage of veraison. Yield, Total Soluble Solids (TSS), Titratable Acidity (TA) and the ratio TSS/TA (maturation index,.IMAD) were determined at harvest. Contrasted water availability among vineyards prompted considerable variation in berry yield and quality attributes. Across years, higher yield was accompanied by higher TA (r = 0.59. p<0.01) and lower IMAD (r = -0.63. p<0.01) while no significant relationship was observed between yield and TSS. Yield was related to canopy vigor (fIPAR) in a variable extend: in 2007, yield was positively related to fIPAR (r = 0.71, p<0.05) while yield was found to decrease along with increasing fIPAR in 2008 (r = -0.62. p<0.05). Contrastingly, NDVI provided consistent estimates of yield across years (r = 0.57, p<0.05). These results suggest that NDVI might be more appropriate to characterize the effects of varying water availability on yield than fIPAR. In addition, yield was found to be related to Delta T-midday (r = -0.63 and r = -0.66, in 2007 and 2008, respectively). Accordingly, the Water Index (WI), an indicator of vine water status, provided robust estimates of yield across years (r = 0.61, p<0.01). The strength of the correlation between NDVI and WI vs. yield suggests that yield was influenced by changes in both leaf area (intercepted light) and photosynthesis (stomatal aperture) in a variable extent according to the timing and severity of water deficits in the years of study. Berry quality attributes did not show significant relationships against fIPAR but were related to Delta T-midday. Accordingly, NDVI did not show significant correlation with berry quality attributes, while WI was found to be consistently related to TA (r = 0.70, p<0.01) and IMAD (r = -0.71, p<0.01) across years. The results obtained suggest that the WI might provide reliable estimates of berry quality attributes in vineyards experiencing moderate to severe water deficits with potential application in precision viticulture activities such as selective harvesting according to grape quality attributes as well as for ripening assessment.

The objective of this research is to determine how effectively multi-season Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and single-season Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data can be combined to map 17 land cover categories in the Greater Boston area of, Massachusetts, USA. The key goal of this work is to test the integration of radar and optical data. The contribution of different dimensions of input data to a random forest classifier was evaluated with map accuracy statistics. PALSAR data produced a 30.99% overall classification accuracy. Higher classification accuracy (72.24%) was achieved by adding texture variables derived from the PALSAR data. A September Landsat image produced a map accuracy of 77.96%. The inclusion of Landsat images from other three seasons increased map accuracy to 86.86% and Landsat derived texture variables further increased the map accuracy to 92.69%. The highest map accuracy (93.82%) was achieved by combining Landsat and PALSAR. Though combining PALSAR and Landsat only increased the overall accuracy by 1.1%, it was a statistically significant increase, whose magnitude was limited by the high accuracy already achieved with Landsat data. Moreover, confusion matrices and land cover maps indicated that most of this increase was from three urban land cover types (low density residential, high density residential, and commercial/industrial). The results demonstrate the value of combining multitemporal Landsat imagery, ALOS PALSAR data, and texture variables for land cover classification in urban and peri-urban environments.

The new ATSR World Fire Atlas (WFA) product continuity has been tested by comparing the partially overlapping fire counts time series from the ATSR-2 (on board ERS-2) and the AATSR (on board ENVISAT) missions which showed negligible offsets. The ATSR-WFA products show very good correlation with the TRMM-VIRS and MODIS-Aqua/Terra monthly night-time fire counts.

The statistical significance of the estimated trend parameters has been verified by means of the Mann-Kendall test. Results indicate that no trends in the absolute number of fire counts can be identified at the global scale, that there has been no appreciable shift in the fire season during the last 14 years, and that statistically significant positive and negative trends are only found when data are aggregated at smaller scales.

This is achieved by performing exacting measurements of emitted radiation from the Earth\'s surface and atmosphere. In order to achieve the desired quality for sea surface temperature, it is necessary to have the use of three thermal channels (at least at night) with precise and stable radiometric calibration, high clarity and sensitivity of the thermal infra-red image data, dual-view geometry for an improved atmospheric correction, as well as additional visible and near infrared channels. This special issue, comprising 18 papers and this Preface, demonstrates the thermal calibration of the ATSR instruments, the high performance of sea surface temperature data from these sensors, and the way in which the ATSR observations have also been used to derive quantitative information about land surface properties (specifically, temperature and reflectance), aerosols and clouds, fires and gas flares. These papers celebrate the success of the ATSR instruments and the associated ground-based measurements which combined are providing exciting time series of climate observations.

While this provides an estimate of total phytoplankton biomass, it does not distinguish between phytoplankton groups, many of which have functional differences and therefore affect biogeochemical cycles differently. Phytoplankton pigment analysis has been used to quantify a wide range of photosynthetic and accessory pigments, and chemotaxonomic analysis (e.g. CHEMTAX) has been used to successfully quantify functional taxonomic groups in nature based on pigment distributions. Here, we combine CHEMTAX analysis with satellite-derived distributions of specific phytoplankton pigments to describe the distributions of particular components of the phytoplankton community in the northeast coast of the United States from space. The spatial and seasonal variations in phytoplankton community structure elucidated through satellite remote sensing methods generally agreed with observations of abundance estimates of cell counts. Diatoms were generally the most abundant phytoplankton in this region, especially during Winter-Spring and in the inner shelf, but phytoplankton populations shifted to increasing abundance of other taxa during Summer, especially offshore. While still preliminary, satellite-derived taxa-specific information with proper regional controls holds promise for providing information on phytoplankton abundance to a taxonomic group level which would greatly improve our understanding of the impacts of human activity and climate change on ecosystems.

However, reliable information on the hemispheric scale variability of SWE is lacking because traditional methods such as interpolation of ground-based measurements and stand-alone algorithms applied to space-borne observations are highly uncertain with respect to the spatial distribution of snow mass and its evolution. In this paper, an algorithm assimilating synoptic weather station data on snow depth with satellite passive microwave radiometer data is applied to produce a 30-year-long time-series of seasonal SWE for the northern hemisphere. This data set is validated using independent SWE reference data from Russia, the former Soviet Union, Finland and Canada. The validation of SWE time-series indicates overall strong retrieval performance with root mean square errors below 40 mm for cases when SWE <150 mm. Retrieval uncertainty increases when SWE is above this threshold. The SWE estimates are also compared with results obtained by a typical stand-alone satellite passive microwave algorithm. This comparison demonstrates the benefits of the newly developed assimilation approach. Additionally, the trends and inter-annual variability of northern hemisphere snow mass during the era of satellite passive microwave measurements are shown. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Previous work has shown that the remote sensing based greenness and radiation (GR) model can give accurate GPP estimates in crops. However, the feasibility of its application and the model calibration to other ecosystems remain unknown. With the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images and the surface based estimates of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), we provide an analysis of the GR model for estimating monthly GPP using flux measurements at fifteen sites, representing a wide range of ecosystems with various canopy structures and climate characteristics. Results demonstrate that the GR model can provide better estimates of GPP than that of the temperature and greenness (TG) model for the overall data classified as non-forest (NF), deciduous forest (DF) and evergreen forest (EF) sites. Calibration of the GR model is also conducted and has shown reasonable results for all sites with a root mean square error of 47.18 g C/m(2)/month. Different coefficients acquired for the three plant functional types indicate that there are shifts of importance among various factors that determine the monthly vegetation GPP. The analysis firstly shows the potential use of the GR model in estimating GPP across biomes while it also points to the needs of further considerations in future operational applications.

Remote sensing technology is critical for assessing fine-scale spatial variability of tropical forest biomass over broad spatial extents. The goal of our study was to evaluate relatively new technology, small-footprint, discrete-return lidar and hyperspectral sensors, for the estimation of aboveground biomass in a Costa Rican tropical rain forest landscape. We derived a suite of predictive metrics for field plots: lidar metrics were calculated from plot vertical height profiles and hyperspectral metrics included fraction of spectral mixing endmembers and narrowband indices that respond to photosynthetic vegetation, structure, senescence, health and water and lignin content. We used single- and two-variable linear regression analyses to relate lidar and hyperspectral metrics to aboveground biomass of plantation, managed parkland and old-growth forest plots. The best model using all 83 biomass plots included two lidar metrics, plot-level mean height and maximum height, with an r(2) of 0.90 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 38.3 Mg/ha. When the analysis was constrained to plantation plots, which had the most accurate field data, the r(2) of the model increased to 0.96, with RMSE of 10.8 Mg/ha (n = 32). Hyperspectral metrics provided lower accuracy in estimating biomass than lidar metrics, and models with a single lidar and hyperspectral metric were no better than the best model using two lidar metrics. These results should be viewed as an initial assessment of using these combined sensors to estimate tropical forest biomass; hyperspectral data were reduced to nine indices and three spectral mixture fractions, lidar data were limited to first-return canopy height, sensors were flown only once at different seasons, and we explored only linear regression for modeling. However, this study does support conclusions from studies at this and other climate zones that lidar is a premier instrument for mapping biomass (i.e., carbon stocks) across broad spatial scales.

Remote sensing provides tools for spatially explicit monitoring of drought across large areas. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of MODIS-based reflectance spectral indices to monitor drought across forest and woodland vegetation types in the fire prone Sydney Basin Bioregion, NSW, Australia. A time series of eight spectral indices were created from 2000 to 2009 to monitor inter-annual changes in drought and were compared to the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), a precipitation deficit/surplus indicator. A pixel-to-weather station paired correlation approach was used to assess the relationship between SPI and the MODIS-based spectral indices at different time scales. Results show that the Normalised Difference Infrared Index band 6 (NDIItr6) provided the most suitable indicator of drought for the high biomass vegetation types considered. The NDIIb6 had the highest sensitivity to drought intensity and was highly correlated with SPI at all time scales analysed (Le., 1,3 and 6-month SPI) suggesting that variations in precipitation patterns have a stronger influence on vegetation water content than vegetation greenness properties. Spatial similarities were also found between patterns of NDIIb6-based drought maps and SPI values distribution. NDIIb6 outperformed the spectral index currently in use for operational drought monitoring systems in the region (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) and its implementation in existing drought-monitoring systems is recommended.

The improvement observed when computing the position of individual ALS returns in the original unrectified scenes (back-projecting ALS) was contrasted against the geometric errors observed in many orthorectified images. Results showed that back-projecting the ALS is the most accurate technique for fusing high-resolution datasets. Potential sources of systematic errors were studied for all techniques, finding the nadir angle as the most influencing one. The capacity of back-projecting ALS and true orthorectification for reducing the tree leaning problem found in traditional orthophotos was evaluated. Modelled tree lean correlated with geometric errors even while individual factors alone did not. The technique used for true orthorectification solved tree leaning near nadir, but it was affected by the variance of the kriging model, resulting in a low overall accuracy. In view of the results observed in back-projected ALS, the spatial resolution of the imagery was regarded as its main source of uncertainty. The convenience of adding a correction of the effect of the atmospheric refraction and the Earth\'s curvature was also discussed. Even though the magnitude of those corrections was low, they succeeded in avoiding nadir angle-dependent systematic errors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This study aims to improve lidar-based canopy characterization with airborne laser scanners through the combined use of lidar composite metrics and machine learning models. Our so-called composite metrics comprise a relatively large number of lidar predictors that tend to retain as much information as possible when reducing raw lidar point clouds into a format suitable as inputs to predictive models of canopy structural variables. The information-rich property of such composite metrics is further complemented by machine learning, which offers an array of supervised learning models capable of relating canopy characteristics to high-dimensional lidar metrics via complex, potentially nonlinear functional relationships. Using coincident lidar and field data over an Eastern Texas forest in USA, we conducted a case study to demonstrate the ubiquitous power of the lidar composite metrics in predicting multiple forest attributes and also illustrated the use of two kernel machines, namely, support vector machine and Gaussian processes (GP). Results show that the two machine learning models in conjunction with the lidar composite metrics outperformed traditional approaches such as the maximum likelihood classifier and linear regression models. For example, the five-fold cross validation for GP regression models (vs. linear/log-linear models) yielded a root mean squared error of 1.06 (2.36) m for Lorey\'s height, 0.95 (3.43) m for dominant height, 534 (8.51) m(2)/ha for basal area, 21.4 (40.5) Mg/ha for aboveground biomass, 654 (9.88) Mg/ha for belowground biomass, 0.75 (2.76) m for canopy base height, 2.2 (2.76) m for canopy ceiling height, 0.015 (0.02) kg/m(3) for canopy bulk density, 0.068 (0.133) kg/m(2) for available canopy fuel, and 033 (0.39) m(2)/m(2) for leaf area index. Moreover, uncertainty estimates from the GP regression were more indicative of the true errors in the predicted canopy variables than those from their linear counterparts. With the ever-increasing accessibility of multisource remote sensing data, we envision a concomitant expansion in the use of advanced statistical methods, such as machine learning, to explore the potentially complex relationships between canopy characteristics and remotely-sensed predictors, accompanied by a desideratum for improved error analysis.

It has been proposed that diatom-dominated phytoplankton blooms can be identified by optical remote sensing and that specifically tuned chlorophyll and primary production algorithms should be applied in regions where these blooms are present. However there have been few studies on how the optical properties of diatom blooms change as they progress from active growth to senescence, and it is unlikely that measurements on laboratory cultures encompass the full range of physiological states found in natural waters. We have therefore examined the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of the waters around the island of South Georgia at the end of the spring diatom bloom. Considerable variability was found in the relationships between the inherent optical properties and analytically determined chlorophyll a concentrations even in the surface layer, which meant that the usual bio-optical assumptions for Case 1 waters did not apply. To account for this variability, phytoplankton absorption and scattering were modeled as a two-component mixture, with the components representing actively growing and senescent material. The specific inherent optical properties of the two components were derived by linear regression of total IOPs against chlorophyll concentration and a fraction of the suspended mineral concentration. These specific IOPs were used to develop radiative transfer models of diatom blooms in varying stages of growth and senescence. Remote sensing reflectances calculated using this technique confirmed the tendency of the standard algorithms employed in SeaWiFS, MODIS and MERIS data processing to under-estimate near-surface chlorophyll concentrations in diatom blooms. However the inclusion of increasing proportions of senescent material had a significant effect on algorithm performance only at chlorophyll concentrations below 10 mg m(-3). Optical depths predicted by the model around South Georgia were 9+/-2 m at 512 nm, indicating that a large fraction of the phytoplankton biomass was located below the depth from which the remote sensing signals originated.

C-correction) have been widely used to correct illumination differences in optical satellite data. The objective of this study was to examine the precision and accuracy of the C-correction\'s empirical parameter, c, as a function of the sample from which it was derived. Three sampling methods were compared: a random sample, a sample stratified on north and south aspects, and a sample stratified by cosine of the solar incidence angle, i. In the latter, power allocation was used to determine the quantity of observations for each stratum. Four overlapping satellite images were used (two Landsat 5 TM and two SPOT 5 HRG) with different acquisition dates and large solar zenith angles over an alpine region in Sweden. The sample stratified by cosine of i produced c with the highest precision from repeated trials and had coefficients of determination (R-2) twice as high as those from the other sampling methods. Use of power allocation in the cosine of i stratified sample enabled better representation of spectral variability: this was particularly important for the NIR band where the outcome of c differed according to sampling method. Evaluations using t-tests and classification accuracy showed that c derived from the cosine of i stratified sample correctly normalized a larger percentage of the evaluation data. The distribution of cosine of i in the study area, the spectral variability and vegetation types exert influences to consider when sampling to derive c. Although sampling was restricted to alpine vegetation only, some vegetation classes may have benefitted from separate c-parameter calculation. In general, dry alpine heath and alpine grass heath had relatively higher c-parameters, mesic alpine heath was slightly lower, and alpine willow and alpine meadow had lower c-parameters for the near-infrared band.

The accuracy assessment of the NLCD 2001 Alaska land cover classification employed a geographically stratified three-stage sampling design to select the reference sample of pixels. Reference land cover class labels were determined via fixed wing aircraft, as the high resolution imagery used for determining the reference land cover classification in the conterminous U.S. was not available for most of Alaska. Overall thematic accuracy for the Alaska NLCD was 76.2% (se. 2.8%) at Level II (12 classes evaluated) and 83.9% (se. 2.1%) at Level I (6 classes evaluated) when agreement was defined as a match between the map class and either the primary or alternate reference class label. When agreement was defined as a match between the map class and primary reference label only, overall accuracy was 59.4% at Level II and 69.3% at Level I. The majority of classification errors occurred at Level I of the classification hierarchy (i.e., misclassifications were generally to a different Level I class, not to a Level II class within the same Level I class). Classification accuracy was higher for more abundant land cover classes and for pixels located in the interior of homogeneous land cover patches.

A multi-process classification model was adopted and it consisted of an a priori classifier and an a posteriori classifier. The role of the a priori classifier was to classify the relatively simple portions of the image. This partial classification acted as the basis for the production of linear features using an iterative Radon transform. Spatial statistics derived from the linear features led to road structural intermediate inputs (RSIIs) (for example, distance to the closest segment endpoint). RSIIs were integrated with spectral information on the remaining unclassified pixels and an assessment was done to evaluate whether they would improve a binary impervious classification task The experimental results on a 2006 Landsat ETM+ image suggested that classification accuracy improved by 8.4% for the portion of the dataset classified with the a posteriori classifier and led to an improvement of 32% over the entire dataset In addition, a more challenging and wide-reaching hypothesis was tested, namely whether RSIIs could completely replace spectral information in portions of the image instead of complementing it. Exclusive use of RSIIs matched or improved classification accuracy obtained solely from spectral information, even when more than half of the validation dataset was forwarded to the a posteriori classifier. This finding offers an important contribution to the remote sensing community, since the proposed methodology handles the missing spectral information problem through exclusive analysis of the given degraded image; no external information, such as spectral information from other times and/or vector data, is needed.

Minerals lifted and suspended particles downwind of a dust source are thus identified. Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU) decomposition results for the calm condition match those of our field study. LSU calm vs. stormy comparison, based on absorbance features, highlight the spectral contrast. Despite low contrast above bright areas, morphological dissimilarity is evident via the wave and tongue-like features, aligned with the prevailing northeasterly winds. We analyze the longest part of shortwave infra-red (2080-2380 nm) wavelengths where the atmosphere is transparent, optical properties are stable, and absorption features of hydroxyl-bearing minerals, sulfates, and carbonates are pronounced. The results of our spectral analyses reveal that clay minerals may be used as tracers for atmospheric dust monitoring even above bright areas.

Eddy covariance towers provide continuous measurements of carbon flux, presenting an opportunity for evaluation of satellite estimates of GPP. Here we investigate relationships between eddy covariance estimated GPP, environmental variables derived from flux towers, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and GPP across African savanna ecosystems. MODIS GPP was found to underestimate GPP at the majority of sites, particularly at sites in the Sahel. EVI was found to correlate well with estimated GPP on a site-by-site basis. Combining EVI with tower-measured PAR and evaporative fraction (EF, a measure of water sufficiency) improved the direct relationship between GPP and EVI at the majority of the sites. The slope of this relationship was strongly related to site peak leaf area index (LAI). These results are promising for the extension of GPP through the use of remote sensing data to a regional or even continental scale. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Despite the well-established importance of Northern Eurasia in the global carbon and climate system, the distribution and properties of land cover in this region are not well characterized. To address this knowledge and data gap, a hierarchical mapping approach was developed that encompasses the study area for the Northern Eurasia Earth System Partnership Initiative (NEESPI). The Northern Eurasia Land Cover (NELC) database developed in this study follows the FAO-land Cover Classification System and provides nested groupings of land cover characteristics, with separate layers for land use, wetlands, and tundra. The database implementation is substantially different from other large-scale land cover datasets that provide maps based on a single set of discrete classes. By providing a database consisting of nested maps and complementary layers, the NELC database provides a flexible framework that allows users to tailor maps to suit their needs. The methods used to create the database combine empirically derived climate-vegetation relationships with results from supervised classifications based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The hierarchical approach provides an effective framework for integrating climate-vegetation relationships with remote sensing-based classifications, and also allows sources of error to be characterized and attributed to specific levels in the hierarchy. The cross-validated accuracy was 73% for the land cover map and 73% and 91% for the agriculture and wetland classifications, respectively. These results support the use of hierarchical classification and climate-vegetation relationships for mapping land cover at continental scales. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In a first step, high-resolution canopy height models (CHMs) were generated from the ADS40 stereo-images. In a second step, multi-resolution image segmentation was applied. Based on image segments seven different tree species for study area 1 and four for study area 2 were classified by multinomial regression models using the geometric and spectral variables derived from the ADS40 and RC30 images. To deal with the large number of explanatory variables and to find redundant variables, model diagnostics and step-wise variable selection were evaluated. Classifications were ten-fold cross-validated for 517 trees that had been visited in field surveys and detected in the ADS40 images. The overall accuracies vary between 0.76 and 0.83 and Cohen\'s kappa values were between 0.70 and 0.73. Lower accuracies (kappa <0.5) were obtained for small samples of species such as non-dominant tree species or less vital trees with similar spectral properties. The usage of NIR bands as explanatory variables from RC30 or from the second generation of ADS40 was found to substantially improve the classification results of the dominant tree species. The present study shows the potential and limits of classifying the most frequent tree species in different types of forests, and discusses possible applications in the Swiss National Forest Inventory.
