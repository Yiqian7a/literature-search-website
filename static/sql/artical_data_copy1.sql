Recently, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been widely used to understand the photosynthesis rates of vegetation under drought stress conditions. However, it is still unclear whether the reduction in SIF shown under drought stress conditions is regulated by physiological or structural factors. To understand the underlying reduction mechanism of SIF under drought stress, we conducted an experiment under a drought condition using one-year-old Prunus yedoensis seedlings. We compared the experiment trees with control trees that were not exposed to drought stress. We collected spectral and gas exchange data to monitor physiological changes and scanned the trees with a terrestrial laser scanner to monitor the structural changes. The discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) and Fluspect models were used to simulate canopy-level SIF. We found that drought stress caused leaf-level steadystate fluorescence yield to increase, while maximum photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and the quantum yield of Photosystem II decreased significantly. Regarding the canopy structural changes, the leaf inclination angle distribution of the experiment trees gradually turned toward erectophile over time (55.2 & PLUSMN; 9.3 degrees to 74.7 & PLUSMN; 6.0 degrees; mean & PLUSMN; standard deviation), whereas that of the control trees remained relatively constant (52.9 & PLUSMN; 8.8 degrees). Furthermore, reduction of crown cover of the experiment trees was 3-fold (77.4 & PLUSMN; 9.8%) compared with the control trees (26.0 & PLUSMN; 16.2%). The simulated nadir-view canopy-level SIF of the experiment trees was reduced 2.8-fold compared to the control trees. These findings, obtained specifically from Prunus yedoensis seedlings, indicate that canopy-level SIF reduced due to the canopy structural changes, although leaf-level fluorescence yield increased. Therefore, canopy structural changes should be considered when attempting to understand SIF reduction in drought conditions.', '[Hwang, Yorum; Kim, Jongmin; Ryu, Youngryel] Seoul Natl Univ, Interdisciplinary Program Landscape Architecture, Seoul, South Korea.

We investigate the methane observation capability of Sentinel-3 and how its coverage-resolution combination fits between Sentinel-5p and Sentinel-2 within a tiered observation approach for methane leak monitoring. Sentinel-5p measures methane with high precision and daily global coverage, allowing worldwide leak detection but with a coarse spatial resolution of 7 km x 5.5 km. The Sentinel-2 twin satellites have multi-band instruments that can identify source locations of major leaks (> 1 t/h) with their methane observations of 20 m resolution under favorable observational conditions, but these satellites lack daily global coverage.We show that methane enhancements can be retrieved from the shortwave infrared band measurements of Sentinel-3. We report the lowest emission detections by Sentinel-3 in the 8-20 t/h range, depending on location and wind conditions. We demonstrate Sentinel-3\'s capability of identification and monitoring of methane leaks using two case studies. Near Moscow, Sentinel-3 shows that two major short-term leaks, separated by 30 km, occurred simultaneously at a gas pipeline and appear as a single methane plume in Sentinel-5p data. For another Sentinel-5p leak detection near the Hassi Messaoud oil/gas field in Algeria, Sentinel-3 identifies the leaking facility emitting continuously for 6 days, and Sentinel-2 pinpoints the source of the leak at an oil/gas well. Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 also show the 6-day leak was followed by a four-month period of burning of the leaking gas, suggesting a gas well blowout to be the cause of the leak. We find similar source rate quantifications from plume detections by Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 for these leaks, demonstrating Sentinel-3\'s utility for emission quantification. We show that zooming in with Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 in synergy allows precise identification, quantification, and monitoring of the sources corresponding to methane plumes observed in Sentinel-5p\'s global scans.', '[Pandey, Sudhanshu; van Nistelrooij, Maarten; Maasakkers, Joannes D.; Sutar, Pratik; Tol, Paul; Aben, Ilse] SRON Netherlands Inst Space Res, Leiden, Netherlands.

Raw altimetry measurements are generally delivered in an ellipsoid height system, while lake heights are finally required in a local level height system to ensure the lake surface being strictly flat under the physical constraints of both gravity and non-gravity factors. Therefore, there is always a need for height system transformation of altimetry data. Many of the previous studies have used orthometric heights in an approximate manner in the altimetric data processing. The geoid errors, together with other error sources, can introduce significant biases into water level estimations. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal regression method to calculate orthometric height to level height (O2L) differences, which can be used to yield accurate lake levels from satellite altimetry data. In the experiments conducted in this study, we chose ICESat-2 data to train the O2L bias correction model, and evaluated the algorithm performance on two large lakes in central Asian (Issyk-Kul and Baikal lakes) and one lake in North America (Lake Michigan). The experimental results indicate that the spatiotemporal modeling method performs better than the traditional spatial modeling method in terms of regression accuracy, and the water levels derived from the new method are much closer to in-situ gauging measurements. Influenced by O2L bias, there is often a jitter phenomenon in the time series of lake levels, and the results of different satellites are, accordingly, not mutually consistent. A visual analysis reveals that the spatio-temporal modeling method can greatly reduce the high-frequency bias.', '[Hu, Yuanlin; Li, Tao; Wang, Hansheng; Jiang, Liming; Shen, Xiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Innovat Acad Precis Measurement Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Geodesy & Earths Dynam, Wuhan 430077, Hubei, Peoples R China.

Typically temporal metric percentiles derived from single pixel location time series have been used to take advantage of spectral differences among land cover classes over time and to minimize the impact of missing observations. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated potential for land cover classification of single date images. However, over large areas and using time series their application is complicated because they are sensitive to missing observations and they may misclassify small and spatially fragmented surface features due to their spatial patch-based implementation. This study demonstrates, for the first time, a one-dimensional (1D) CNN single pixel time series land classification approach that uses temporal percentile metrics and that does not have these issues. This is demonstrated for all the Conterminous United States (CONUS) considering two different 1D CNN structures with 5 and 8 layers, respectively. CONUS 30 m land cover classifications were derived using all the available Landsat-5 and -7 imagery over a seven-month growing season in 2011 with 3.3 million 30 m land cover class labelled samples extracted from the contemporaneous CONUS National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 16 class land cover product. The 1D CNNs and, a conventional random forest model, were trained using 10%, 50% and 90% samples, and the classification accuracies were evaluated with an independent 10% proportion. Temporal metrics were classified using 5, 7 and 9 percentiles for each of five Landsat reflective wavelength bands and their eight band ratios. The CONUS and detailed 150 x 150 km classification results demonstrate that the approach is effective at scale and locally. The 1D CNN classification land cover class boundaries were preserved for small axis dimension features, such as roads and rivers, with no stripes or anomalous spatial patterns. The 8-layer 1D CNN provided the highest overall classification accuracies and both the 5-layer and 8-layer 1D CNN architectures provided higher accuracies than the random forest by 1.9% - 2.8% which as all the accuracies were > 83% is a meaningful increase. The CONUS overall classification accuracies increased marginally with the number of percentiles (86.21%, 86.40%, and 86.43% for 5, 7 and 9 percentiles, respectively) using the 8-layer 1D-CNN. Class specific producer and user accuracies were quantified, with lower accuracies for the developed land, crop and pasture/hay classes, but no systematic pattern among classes with respect to the number of temporal percentiles used. Application of the trained model to a different year of CONUS Landsat ARD showed moderately decreased accuracy (80.79% for 7 percentiles) that we illustrate is likely due to different intra-annual surface variations between years. These encouraging results are discussed with recommended research for deep learning using temporal metric percentiles.', '[Zhang, Hankui K.; Luo, Dong] South Dakota State Univ, Geospatial Sci Ctr Excellence, Dept Geog & Geospatial Sci, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.

These L-band instruments could provide moderate spatial resolution inundation maps at a better temporal resolution than other satellite radars. This paper describes a retrieval algorithm for flood inundation mapping using GNSS-R data from the Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) constellation. The algorithm employs a simple dielectric model to retrieve fractional inundation from an observation of reflectivity, requiring parameterizations of soil surface and water roughness as well as ancillary soil moisture data. Here, we give a brief overview of the model, describe our parameterization scheme, and present inundation maps using CYGNSS data. We describe four case studies (from the Amazon, Mozambique, Mali, and Australia) and compare the CYGNSS inundation maps to other surface water data (SWAMPS, PALSAR-2, Dartmouth Flood Observatory, MODIS, and the Global Surface Water Explorer). We identify sources of uncertainty in the CYGNSS inundation maps and discuss possible reasons for discrepancies between the inundation retrievals.

Then, the classified blocks were used as training to map maize and soybean for the country with wall-to-wall Sentinel-2 data using a random forests approach. We used all available Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data ac-quired between April and October 2019, applied quality assurance, including cloud and shadow masking, and created monthly image composites as inputs for the random forests analysis. We derived maize and soybean area estimates using the field sample data and a regression estimator. Utilizing the probability output layer of the random forests models, we found and applied empirical probability thresholds that matched map-based crop area estimates with sample-based area estimates. Maize area in China in 2019 was estimated to be 330,609 +/- 34,109 km2 (+/- value is the standard error), and soybean area was estimated to be 78,107 +/- 12,969 km2. Validated using the field sample data as reference, our crop map had an overall accuracy of 91.8 +/- 1.2%. The user\'s and pro-ducer\'s accuracies for the maize class were 93.9 +/- 2.5% and 79.2 +/- 3.6%, and for the soybean class were 63.6 +/- 12.1% and 61.9 +/- 11.8%. Our map-based maize and soybean area estimates had close agreement with gov-ernment reports at the provincial and prefectural levels, with r2 of 0.90 and 0.92 for maize, and 0.93 and 0.94 for soybean, respectively. Our workflow can generate internally consistent results for crop area estimation and crop mapping simultaneously. As Sentinel-2 data are being acquired consistently and very-high-resolution commercial satellite data are increasingly available, our established workflow may be applied in an operational setting for annual crop mapping in China and other countries.', '[Li, Haijun; Song, Xiao-Peng; Hansen, Matthew C.; Becker-Reshef, Inbal; Adusei, Bernard; Pickering, Jeffrey; Zalles, Viviana; Potapov, Peter; Justice, Chris] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

Construction and operation of dams in the LMR basin has profoundly affected its natural streamflow regime. It is therefore important to monitor changes in reservoir water storage and to quantify the impact of reservoir operation on the redistribution of surface water resources over this basin. Given the difficulty in obtaining in-situ measurements of reservoirs on the LMR, we integrated multisource remote sensing, including satellite altimetry and optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, to generate weekly water levels and water storages of nine largest reservoirs on the main stem of the LMR from 2017 to 2021. Specifically, partial surface water extent (SWE) of reservoirs was extracted from Sentinel-1 SAR images and digital elevation models (DEMs), using Random Forest algorithms trained by partial SWE derived from Sentinel-2 optical images, showing an overall accuracy higher than 95%. Based on the partial SWE and water level estimates from ICESat-2 and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI, International Space Station-based) data, the relationships between water levels and partial SWE were derived to convert partial SWE into water level time series. Furthermore, water storage time series of the nine reservoirs were obtained from water level time series and hypsometric functions derived from SRTM DEMs that were corrected by ICESat-2 data to remove systematic errors. For the Xiaowan Reservoir on the Lancang River, there is close agreement between remote sensing-derived water levels and in-situ water levels in terms of a normalized RMSE lower than 5%. Results indicate that multisource remote sensing has large potential for high-temporal-resolution monitoring of reservoir water levels and water storage.

Combining recent advances in satellite-based ET mechanistic algorithms and data-oriented methods allows ET hybrid modeling by coupling physical constraints with machine learning (ML). Specifically, we developed two hybrid models, a surface conductance-based ML model (ML-Gs) and a soil evaporation-based ML model (ML-Es), to estimate regional ET on the TP. These hybrid models have biophysical framework, under which one of the parameters or components is modeled using ML. Hybrid models make ML complementary to the process-based ET framework, which to find an optimal junction between well physical mechanism and high model performance. The daily ET estimates were evaluated at 28 eddy covariance flux tower sites, as well as by comparison with two process-based ET algorithms (a Penman-Monteith-based ET-PM algorithm and a Priestley-Taylor-based ET-PT algorithm) and a data-oriented pure ML method. The hybrid models decreased the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of two physical algorithms (1.11 mm/day for ET-PM, 1.09 mm/day for ET-PT) to 0.50 mm/day, and increased the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) (0.35 for ET-PM, 0.36 for ET-PT) to 0.92. Our hybrid models also showed improved performance (KGE of 0.65) than pure ML (KGE of 0.62) at data-sparse regions as well as for the responses to extreme weather events. It indicates that our approach does not only boost the ET simulation accuracy, but also improve the physical un-derstanding of ML-based ET estimation. More importantly, ML-Es focuses on the ET components on the TP and is more well-defined than ML-Gs. An innovation of our approach is that for data-sparse regions and extreme cases, the more robust physical mechanism was coupled, the better generalization performance of hybrid model could achieve. The spatiotemporal ET patterns based on our hybrid models were consistent with the variations in local climatic regions and could provide critical information on the understanding of hydrological processes under the global and regional climate changes.', '[Shang, Ke; Yao, Yunjun; Jia, Kun; Zhang, Xiaotong; Guo, Xiaozheng; Yang, Junming; Yu, Ruiyang; Xie, Zijing; Liu, Lu; Ning, Jing] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

In this study, A new general carbonaceous aerosol retrieval strategy for geostationary single-view satellite observations is implemented based on a method of critical reflectance, to retrieve the parameters of BC and extra OC concentration from measured radiance without prior quantification of Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT). The method is based on measuring the change in upward reflectance between clear and hazy days over a varying surface reflectance, with the aim of finding a balance between brightening due to scattering and darkening due to absorption. Since aerosols in the proposed algorithm are considered as a mixture of BC, OC and clustered shell aerosols, this balance can be used to retrieve concentration parameters of these components via radiative transfer models. Sensitivity tests indicate that different scenarios of BC and OC volume fractions can introduce certain sensitivity pattern on critical reflectance. The retrieval is achieved by minimizing the differ-ences between measured critical reflectance and a set of look-up tables (LUTs). Random sampling consensus (RANSAC) is also used in the strategy to reduce the influence of clouds and anomalous pixels on the retrievals. Since critical reflectance should be calculated by comparing geometrically consistent clear and hazy images, the algorithm is more suitable for geostationary satellites with constant viewing geometries. An initial validation and application applied to Himawari images over the North China Plain (NCP) shows that the carbonaceous aerosol retrievals are highly consistent with the expectations in terms of spatial and temporal patterns. The retrievals of BC and OC concentration follow the daily fluctuations of the Aethalometers observations and feature small differences in mean values throughout the month. Additionally, the AOTs at 0.55 mu m can be also satisfactorily reproduced based on the carbonaceous aerosol retrievals, resulting in a mean absolute error of 0.089 and a correlation coefficient of 0.870. The main errors in the method arise from shell model assumptions, RANSAC fitting bias, inconsistent clear reference AOT in LUT, and geometric inconsistency between the clear reference and hazy images. This work indicates that the BC and OC concentration in high resolution can be acquired through the geostationary single-view remote sensing for the further air quality and climate studies.', '[Bao, Fangwen; Li, Ying] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ocean Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.

Moreover, the impacts of atmospheric forcing on the trend of ice mass change are not clear. To address these limitations, we propose a piecewise trajectory model to detect the breaking points in the trend of ice mass change and estimate the optimal segmented trends. A breaking point located around 2012.6 was detected in the CW, SW, NE, SE, and the whole Greenland based on Gravity Recovery and Climate Exper-iment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-on (FO) data and the mass budget method (MBM). Piecewise trend estimates from both methods suggest that the ice loss decelerated dramatically in east Greenland in 2012.6-2021 compared to 2002-2012.6. The GRACE results indicate that the mass loss rate decelerated by 70% (22.1 +/- 0.8 to 6.6 +/- 1.0 Gt/yr) in the NE and 38% (89.0 +/- 1.5 to 55.4 +/- 0.7 Gt/yr) in the SE. Though the rates slightly increased in some regions, the Greenland ice loss rate overall decreased from 269.9 +/- 1.8 Gt/yr to 217.0 +/- 3.3 Gt/yr. Mass budget analysis suggests that this deceleration was mainly caused by increased precipitation in east Greenland, which was associated with persistent positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phase in 2013-2021. During this positive NAO period, the enhanced westerlies and low-pressure anomaly off southeast Greenland advected more wet warm air to east Greenland and thus caused more precipitation. As the NAO exhibited a strong positive trend in this century, if it persists into the future, precipitation will have a high chance to increase in east Greenland, benefitting Greenland retaining ice.', '[Wang, Ziyun] China Univ Geosci, Sch Mech Engn & Elect Informat, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.

Plant functional characteristics can be captured by (hyper)spectral data, but it remains unclear whether the links between spectral information and C content are driven largely by tree composition, tree diversity, or by forest attributes not commonly measured in field inventories (e.g., physical canopy structure). Here, we examine the relationship between hyperspectral reflectance and aboveground C content in forests, testing the relative importance of tree composition and diversity in mediating this relationship. We use hyperspectral imaging data from an airborne survey with precisely geo-located field data on canopy trees in two forests in southern Que \' bec, Canada. Spectral data covering visible (VIS), near infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths were extracted for 2626 tree crowns within 64 field plots distributed along an elevational gradient. We applied a continuum removal to the spectra and subsequently performed a principal component analysis to reduce the spectral dimensionality. From the spectral principal components, for each plot we quantified (i) spectral composition (based on average reflectance per plot), and (ii) spectral diversity using the convex hull volume. From field data, we calculated variables characterizing the taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic composition and diversity of canopy trees. Carbon content was calculated using allometric equa-tions based on tree size. We applied a structural equation model based on partial-least squares to test both in-direct effects of spectral composition and diversity on C storage of trees (via on-the-ground tree composition or diversity), and also direct effects (reflecting forest characteristics unmeasured in field surveys). We found that spectral composition, particularly from the VIS, is related to C content largely indirectly, via changes in tree composition along the elevational gradient (a transition from deciduous to coniferous species with increasing elevation). Though spectral diversity was significantly related to tree species diversity, no direct or indirect effects on C content were detected. Overall, our findings support (i) the importance of tree composition (but not diversity) in mediating the link between hyperspectral data and forest C content, and (ii) the use of hyperspectral remote sensing as an effective surrogate of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic composition of tree com-munities with strong links to C storage.', '[Wallis, Christine I.

Nevertheless, the performance of current spatiotemporal data fusion methods is affected by several aspects, e.g., (1) retrieval of abrupt land cover changes, (2) recovery of detailed spatial information, and (3) the need to reduce side effects related to the performance differences between sensors. Concerning the above aspects, this study proposes the use of a Variation-based Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (VSDF) method. In VSDF, an abundant variation classification (AVC) is used to identify explicitly the land cover changes for spectral unmixing. In addition, feature-level fusion is introduced to strengthen the spatial structures, i.e., the edges and texture. Furthermore, a relative reliability index (RRI) is proposed to guide the prediction process to lower the uncertainty of the input datasets. With reference to the all-round performance assessment (APA) metrics, the performance of VSDF was compared with five popular methods, i.e., Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF), FSDAF 2.0, Reliable and Adaptive Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (RASDF), and Fit-FC (regression model Fitting, spatial Filtering and residual Compensation). The experimental results demonstrated that VSDF can realize a more accurate prediction of temporal land cover changes with better spatial detail than the benchmark methods. Consequently, VSDF has the potential to generate accurate high-spatiotemporal-resolution simulations for global remote sensing studies.', '[Xu, Chen; Du, Xiaoping; Yan, Zhenzhen; Zhu, Junjie; Fan, Xiangtao] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Key Lab Digital Earth Sci, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.

However, few studies assessed the accuracy of SSM and RZSM datasets in croplands of Jiangsu province. The study addressed this gap by firstly using observations from ninety-one sites to assess thirteen satellite and model-based SSM products (Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) Combined/Passive/Active, Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity in version IC (SMOS-IC), Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)-Multi-Temporal Dual-channel Algorithm (MTDCA)/Level 3 (L3)/Level 4 (L4)/SMAP-INRAE-BORDEAUX (IB)/ Multi-channel Collaborative Algorithm (MCCA), the fifth generation of the land component of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5-Land), and the Noah land surface model driven by Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS-Noah)), and four RZSM products (ERA5-Land, GLDAS-Noah, SMAP-L4 and ESA CCI (retrieved using ESA CCI Combined SSM coupled with an exponential filter)). We also inter-compared time-invariant and time-variant Triple Collocation Analysis (TCA)-based R with in situ-based R calculated using SSM anomalies. Various evaluation strategies were compared using different groups of available sites and temporal samplings. Our results showed that the model-based and combined SSM products (i.e., ERA5-Land, SMAP-L4, ESA CCI Combined/Passive/Active, GLDAS-Noah, ASCAT) performed better than the other SSM products and ERA5-Land, SMAP-L4 and ESA CCI RZSM generally performed better than the GLDAS-Noah RZSM product with higher R. Similar performance rankings were observed among time-invariant and time-variant TCA-R and in situ-based R, in which the TCA-R values for all SSM datasets were higher than the in situ-based R as the representativeness errors of the in situ measurements may bias in situ-based R. The accuracy of the ESA CCI, GLDAS-Noah and ERA5-Land SSM products was expected to be enhanced by considering the water effect and high uncertainties were observed for MTDCA and SMAP-MCCA SSM over dense vegetation periods and regions. Also, it is important to select appropriate evaluation strategies to conduct the SSM and RZSM evaluations according to the situation as the available sites and temporal samplings may bias the evalu-ation results.', '[Fan, Lei; Ma, Mingguo; Tang, Xuguang] Southwest Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Chongqing Jinfo Mt Karst Ecosyst Natl Observat & R, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.

As a key indicator of soil functioning, soil organic carbon (SOC) is crucial for ensuring food, soil, water and energy security, together with biodiversity protection. While there is a global effort to map SOC stock and status, SOC is a dynamic soil property and can change rapidly as a function of land management and land use. Here, we introduce a semi-mechanistic model to monitor SOC stocks at a global scale, underpinned by one of the largest worldwide soil database to date. Our model generates a SOC stock baseline for the year 2001, which is then propagated through time by keeping track of annual landcover changes obtained from remote sensing products with loss and gain dynamics dependent on temperature and precipitation, which finally define the magnitude, rate and direction of the SOC changes. We estimated a global SOC stock in the top 30 cm of around 793 Pg with annual losses due to landcover change of 1.9 Pg SOC yr-1 from 2001 to 2020, 20% larger than the annual production-based emissions of the United States in 2018. The biggest losses were found in the tropic and sub-tropical regions, accounting for almost 50% of the total global loss. This is a considerable contribution to greenhouse gas emissions but it also has a direct impact on agricultural production with more than 16 million hectares yr-1 falling below critical SOC limits. The proposed modelling framework is flexible, allowing it to be updated as more remote sensing and soil data becomes available, offering a first-of-its-kind global spatio-temporal SOC stock assessment and monitoring system.', '[Padarian, J.; Stockmann, U.; Minasny, B.; McBratney, A.

In this study, we developed regional mosaic generation and classification workflows for Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) imagery to discriminate these minerals over the entire crust of the Semail ophiolite (Oman-UAE). Spectral discrimination was achieved through adaptation of the ASTER (pre-)processing workflow to the specific mapping targets, available datasets, and location of this study. Necessary steps included the pre-selection of ASTER scenes without residual atmospheric water features, mosaic normalization based solely on overlapping target outcrops, correcting cross-mosaic ramp errors, and alteration map classification based on image-derived reference data. The resulting alteration map, validated through comparison with field mapping and sampling, is the most areally extensive continuous survey of hydrothermal alteration yet presented for oceanic crust, providing a renewed framework for research and mineral exploration of Earth\'s largest ophiolite. Our map confirms that the vast majority of the upper oceanic crust is regionally altered to a spilite type secondary mineral assemblage. Localized areas of epidosite alteration, marking focused hydrothermal flow paths, are confined to the upper oceanic crust, whereas areas of previously unrecognized but intense actinolite alteration are common in both the lower and upper oceanic crust. Our methodological developments expand the standard considerations necessary for regional geological mapping using infrared image mosaics. They further demonstrate the under -appreciated capability of multispectral data for mapping spectrally similar rock types. Although the specifics of the method are necessarily optimized for the Oman-UAE ophiolite, re-optimization based on local reference data should allow similar results to be achieved in other well-exposed mafic-hosted VMS districts.', '[Belgrano, Thomas M.] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton SO14 3ZH, England.

The spatial contextual information-based surface temperature versus vegetation index triangle (temperature-based triangle) is one of the most famous and widely applied methods for regional ET estimation from remotely sensed data. However, the determination of temporally variable satellite scene-specific dry and wet edges in this traditional triangle is often largely biased due to the limited range of variability of surface soil moisture avail-ability and fractional vegetation cover (or the nonexistence of end-member pixels), or must rely on the auxiliary ground-based measurements, leading to a large uncertainty or difficulty in regional evaporative fraction esti-mation. This short communication presents a practically operational moisture-based triangle to address the deficiency of the temperature-based triangle, where temporally universal dry and wet edges in this new triangle are determined by making use of the time-series slope of remotely sensed surface temperature versus vegetation index negative relationship over a small window centering the target pixel. Our validation results show that this new triangle outperformed the temperature-based triangle, reducing the root mean square error from 0.19 to 0.16 and increasing the coefficient of determination from 0.44 to 0.53, when the model-estimated evaporative fractions were validated against ground-based eddy covariance measurements at 34 sites across the globe.', '[Tang, Ronglin; Li, Zhao-Liang; Jiang, Yazhen; Peng, Zhong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

In order to accurately distinguish flood inundation from normally present conditions, up-to-date, high-resolution information on the seasonal water cover is crucial. This information is usually neglected in disaster management, which may result in a non-reliable representation of the flood extent, mainly in regions with highly dynamic hydrological conditions. In this study, we present a fully automated method to generate a global reference water product specifically designed for the use in global flood mapping applications based on high resolution Earth Observation data. The proposed methodology combines existing processing pipelines for flood detection based on Sentinel-1/ 2 data and aggregates permanent as well as seasonal water masks over an adjustable reference time period. The water masks are primarily based on the analysis of Sentinel-2 data and are complemented by Sentinel-1-based information in optical data scarce regions. First results are demonstrated in five selected study areas (Australia, Germany, India, Mozambique, and Sudan), distributed across different climate zones and are systematically compared with external products. Further, the proposed product is exemplary applied to three real flood events in order to evaluate the impact of the used reference water mask on the derived flood extent. Results show, that it is possible to generate a consistent reference water product at 10-20 m spatial resolution, that is more suitable for the use in rapid disaster response than previous masks. The proposed multi-sensor approach is capable of producing reasonable results, even if only few or no information from optical data is available. Further it becomes clear, that the consideration of seasonality of water bodies, especially in regions with highly dynamic hydrological and climatic conditions, reduces potential over-estimation of the inundation extent and gives a more reliable picture on flood affected areas.', '[Martinis, Sandro; Groth, Sandro; Wieland, Marc; Knopp, Lisa; Rattich, Michaela] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, German Remote Sensing Data Ctr DFD, Munchener Str 20, D-82234 Wessling, Germany.', 'Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR)RP Martinis, S (通讯作者)，German Aerosp Ctr DLR, German Remote Sensing Data Ctr DFD, Munchener Str 20, D-82234 Wessling, Germany.', 'Sandro.Martinis@dlr.de', 'Groth, Sandro/0000-0002-0499-9072; Raettich,   Michaela/0009-0006-6631-5496', NULL, NULL, 52, 14, 15, 6, 53, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

The popular shape model fitting (SMF) method detects crop phenology from vegetation index (VI) time-series data, but it has two limitations. First, SMF assumes the same \"relative position\" of phenological stages for the pixels of the same crop type. This assumption is valid only if all target pixels, relative to the shape model, display a synchronized increase (or decrease) in length between any two phenological stages, which is uncommon in practice. Second, the variance in the resulting phenology estimates for a particular phenological stage is related to the stage itself; this makes it challenging to simulate spatial and temporal variations in crop phenology using SMF. Here, we address both limitations by developing the shape model fitting by the Separate phenological stage method (\"SMF-S\"). SMF-S uses a modified fitting function and an iterative procedure to match the shape model with the VI time series for each phenological stage in an adaptive local window. Comparisons between SMF-S and SMF in simulation experiments show the superior performance of SMF-S in different scenarios, regardless of noise. Comparisons involving winter wheat field observations from the North China Plain showed that the RMSE values averaged over nine phenological stages were smaller for SMF-S (RMSE = 9.5 d) than for SMF (RMSE = 13.4 d) and one variant of SMF (the shape model with accumulated growing degree days (SM-AGDD); RMSE=33.6 d). Moreover, SMF-S better described the spatial variations (i.e., variance) in the results and captured the temporal shifts in multiple phenological stages. In the derived regional phenology maps of winter wheat on the North China Plain, SMF-S generated more reasonable spatial patterns, whereas SMF underestimated (overestimated) the variance in the early (late) phenological stages. We expect that the improved crop phenology estimates obtained with SMF-S could benefit various agricultural activities.', '[Liu, Licong; Cao, Ruyin; Zhou, Ji; He, Binbin] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Resources & Environm, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.

The approach uses a multi-angle index that has a loge relationship with AGB estimates in the National Biomass and Carbon Dataset 2000 (NBCD 2000). MISR Level 1B2 Terrain radiance data from May 15-June 15 of each year were converted to mapped surface bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs) and leveraged to adjust the kernel weights of the RossThin-LiSparse-Reciprocal Bidi-rectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model. The kernel weights with the lowest model-fitting RMSE were selected as the least likely to be cloud-contaminated and were used to generate synthetic MISR datasets. An optimal index calculated using BRFs modeled in the solar principal plane was found with respect to NBCD 2000 estimates for 19 sites near Mt. Lindsey, Colorado. These relationships were found in areas with AGB ranging from 20 to 190 Mg ha(-1), with the model yielding R-2 = 0.91 (RMSE: 15.4 Mg ha(-1)). With spectral-nadir metrics, the R-2 values obtained were 0.07, 0.32, and 0.37 for NIR band BRFs, NDVI, and red band BRFs, respectively. For regional application, a simplified single coefficient model was fitted to the NBCD 2000 data, to account for variations in forest type, soils, and topography.

Sustainable exploration requires a combination of innovative thinking and new technologies. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a rapidly developing technology and allows for fast and systematic mineral mapping, facilitating exploration of the Earth\'s surface at various scales on a variety of platforms. Newly available sensors allow data capture over a wide spectral range, and provide information about the abundance and spatial location of ore and pathfinder minerals in drill-core, hand samples and outcrops with mm to cm precision. Conversely, the complex geometries of the imaged surfaces affect the spectral quality and signal-tonoise ratio (SnR) of HSI data at these very narrow spatial samplings. Additionally, the complex mineral assemblages found in hydrothermally altered ore deposits can make interpretation of spectral results a challenge. In this contribution, we propose an innovative approach that integrates multiple sensors and scales of data acquisition to help disentangle complex mineralogy associated with lithium and tin mineralisation in the Uis pegmatite complex, Namibia. We train this method using hand samples and finally produce a three-dimensional (3D) point cloud for mapping lithium mineralisation in the open pit. We were able to identify and map lithium bearing cookeite and montebrasite at outcrop scale. The accuracy of the approach was validated by drill-core data, XRD analysis and LIBS measurements. This approach facilitates efficient mapping of complex terrains, as well as important monitoring and optimisation of ore extraction. Our method can easily be adapted to other minerals relevant to the mining industry.', '[Booysen, Rene; Lorenz, Sandra; Thiele, Samuel T.; Gloaguen, Richard] Helmholtz Zentrum Dresden Rossendorf, Helmholtz Inst Freiberg Resource Technol, Chemnitzer Str 40, D-09599 Freiberg, Germany.

We use TROPOMI data in a Bayesian inversion to optimize daily methane emissions while VIIRS-based radiant heat data are used to estimate the amount of gas flared. This hybrid approach allows for the characterization of methane emissions during both the flaring and venting phases of the blowout, where more than half of the blowout duration was associated with flaring. We estimate overall emissions of this 38-day event at 49 (21-63) Gg, which is lower than reported by the gas company but exceeds all known US point sources emitting at the time in terms of emission rate. We estimate that over 80% of total emissions come from the venting phase, leaving the flaring phase responsible for only a small fraction of total emissions. We show that routine satellite operations from global-scale observing instruments such as TROPOMI and VIIRS when combined can provide a detailed assessment of quantitative greenhouse gas emissions from large point sources including stochastic events and thus these data could be used for regulatory enforcement.', '[Maasakkers, Joannes D.; Lorente, Alba; Pandey, Sudhanshu; Tol, Paul; Borsdorff, Tobias; Houweling, Sander; Aben, Ilse] SRON Netherlands Inst Space Res, Utrecht, Netherlands.

Forested areas are considered a major land unit impacted by temperature rise; therefore, thorough monitoring is mandatory. An accuracy assessment of the LST of forests must consider their directional anisotropy (DA). This latter can be well depicted by thermal infrared (TIR) radiative transfer models, but the problem is complex for forests because many of the shaded areas generate multiscale gradients of temperature. In this paper, we adapted a mature and widely used visible and near-infrared (VNIR) radiative transfer model called forest reflectance and transmittance (FRT) to enhance the characterization of the DA of forest temperature. In the FRT model, the vertical heterogeneity of the forest is quantified by using the discrete elements of multilayer scene components (i.e., the tree crown, trunk, understory vegetation, and soil), thus inferring vertical thermal gradients. The Planck function and spectral-invariant theory are considered to assess the thermal emissions of the scene components and their multiple scattering processes. The FRT model is validated using directional forest brightness temperatures (BT) measured from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and simulated by using the three-dimensional ray-tracing LESS (large-scale remote sensing data and image simulation framework over heterogeneous 3D scenes) model. The results show that FRT behaves reliably since the root mean square error (RMSE) is lower than 1.0 degrees C for UAV measurements obtained at 09:20 and 13:10 and with coefficients of determination (R2) larger than 0.74 and 0.56, respectively; these results are better than the simulated results by existing models. Moreover, the comparison with ray-tracing simulations was also deemed satisfactory. According to the analysis, large variations in BT DAs may appear for different forests and seasonal changes staged by structural and thermal stratification, thus indicating the necessity of using the FRT model for complex and dynamic forest canopies.', '[Bian, Zunjian; Cao, Biao; Li, Hua; Du, Yongming; Xiao, Qing; Liu, Qinhuo] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

Following major decreases in Antarctic sea ice since 2015, the 42-year 1979-2020 satellite dataset now shows recent losses in sea ice coverage in both hemispheres, and this is convincingly demonstrated by the enumeration of monthly and yearly record high and record low sea ice extents experienced over the course of the 42 years. In fact, one of the most convincing statistics on the declining Arctic sea ice cover is the fact that since 1986 the Arctic has not experienced a single monthly record high sea ice extent in any month but has experienced 93 monthly record lows. In contrast, all 12 calendar months have their 42-year Antarctic monthly record high sea ice extents in the period 2007-2015, while 8 of the 12 calendar months have had Antarctic record lows since 2015. Globally, every calendar month has registered a new monthly record low within the past 5 years. These results are complemented (and somewhat tempered) by quantification of the range of monthly and yearly sea ice extent values over the 42 years. For instance, although the Arctic\'s lowest September monthly average sea ice extent (in 2012) is 53% lower than its highest September monthly average sea ice extent (in 1980), the other months have far smaller percent differences between their lowest and highest Arctic values. For yearly average sea ice extents, the Arctic\'s lowest value (in 2020) is 18% lower than its highest value (in 1982), the Antarctic\'s lowest value (in 2017) is 16% lower than its highest value (in 2014), and the global lowest value (in 2019) is only 12% lower than its highest value (in 1982).', '[Parkinson, Claire L.; DiGirolamo, Nicolo E.] NASA, Cryospher Sci Lab, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Code 615,8800 Greenbelt Rd, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.

Detecting the layer boundaries of aerosols and clouds is a crucial step in CALIPSO data retrieval. The CALIPSO team uses the selective iterated boundary location (SIBYL) algorithm based on threshold arrays to find aerosol and cloud layers at different horizontal resolutions. However, threshold arrays could obstruct the detection of optically tenuous layers at a high resolution and may cause overestimation when averaging signals of layer and clear air at a low resolution. Here, a multiscale algorithm using a series of sliding window sizes without threshold setting is proposed based on a pre-defined probability. The results over land and marine areas show that the multiscale algorithm detected 37.41% and 16.36% more layer area than the SIBYL at 1-80 km resolutions at daytime and 1-5 km resolutions at night time, respectively. This indicates that the multiscale algorithm does not need a threshold array, allowing more tenuous layers to be detected, especially at low signal to noise ratios (SNRs). In contrast, the SIBYL detects 4.40% more layer area than the multiscale algorithm at 1-80 km resolutions at nighttime, mainly caused by the large proportion of layer area detected by SIBYL at 20 and 80 km resolutions. This implies possible noteworthy overestimation by the SIBYL at low resolutions. Additionally, the evaluation using the depolarization ratio of ice clouds shows that the extra detected layers by the multiscale algorithm are reliable. Besides, simulation tests show that the multiscale and SIBYL algorithms achieve a 100% true detection rate when SNR is approximately 2 and 4, respectively. The new multiscale algorithm could upgrade the resolution and accuracy of the layer detection of space lidars and reduce the underestimation of layer optical depth due to missing layers.', '[Mao, Feiyue; Huang, Xin] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

Rapid and accurate building damage assessment using bitemporal high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images can quickly and safely provide us with spatial distribution information and statistics of the damage degree to assist with humanitarian assistance and disaster response. For building damage assessment, strong feature representation and semantic consistency are the keys to obtaining a high accuracy. However, the conventional object-based image analysis (OBIA) framework using a patch-based convolutional neural network (CNN) can guarantee semantic consistency, but with weak feature representation, while the Siamese fully convolutional network approach has strong feature representation capabilities but is semantically inconsistent. In this paper, we propose a deep object-based semantic change detection framework, called ChangeOS, for building damage assessment. To seamlessly integrate OBIA and deep learning, we adopt a deep object localization network to generate accurate building objects, in place of the superpixel segmentation commonly used in the conventional OBIA framework. Furthermore, the deep object localization network and deep damage classification network are integrated into a unified semantic change detection network for end-to-end building damage assessment. This also provides deep object features that can supply an object prior to the deep damage classification network for more consistent semantic feature representation. Object-based post-processing is adopted to further guarantee the semantic consistency of each object. The experimental results obtained on a global scale dataset including 19 natural disaster events and two local scale datasets including the Beirut port explosion event and the Bata military barracks explosion event show that ChangeOS is superior to the currently published methods in speed and accuracy, and has a superior generalization ability for man-made disasters.', '[Zheng, Zhuo; Zhong, Yanfei; Wang, Junjue; Ma, Ailong; Zhang, Liangpei] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.

The training and testing stages of a supervised image classification may proceed ignorant of the presence of some classes in the region to be mapped. This violates the assumption of an exhaustively defined set of classes that is often made in classification analyses. In such circumstances, the overall accuracy of a thematic map produced by the application of a trained classifier will be less than the accuracy of the classification of the test set by the same classifier. This situation arises because the cases of an untrained class can normally only be commissioned into the set of trained classes. Simple mathematical relationships between classification and map accuracy are shown for assessments of overall, user?s and producer?s accuracy. For example, it is shown that in a simple scenario the accuracy of a thematic map is less than that of a classification, scaling as a function of the abundance of the untrained class(es). Impacts on other estimates made from thematic maps, such as class areal extent, are also briefly discussed.

Timely information regarding extent, timing and magnitude of forest disturbance events is crucial for effective disturbance management strategies. Yet, we still lack accurate, near-real-time and high-performance remote sensing tools for monitoring abrupt and subtle forest disturbances. This study presents a new approach called \'Stochastic Continuous Change Detection (S-CCD)\' using a dense Landsat data time series. S-CCD improves upon the \'COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD)\' approach by incorporating a mathematical tool called the \'state space model\', which treats trends and seasonality as stochastic processes, allowing for modeling temporal dynamics of satellite observations in a recursive way. The quantitative accuracy assessment is evaluated based on 3782 Landsat-based disturbance reference plots (30 m) from a probability sampling distributed throughout the Conterminous United States. Validation results show that the overall accuracy (best F1 score) of S-CCD is 0.793 with 20% omission error and 21% commission error, slightly higher than that of COLD (0.789). Two disturbance sites respectively associated with wildfire and insect disturbances are used for qualitative map-based analysis. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses suggest that S-CCD achieves fewer omission errors than COLD for detecting those disturbances with subtle/gradual spectral change. In addition, S-CCD facilitates a better real-time monitoring, benefited by its complete recursive manner and a shorter lag for confirming disturbance than COLD (126 days vs. 166 days for alerting 50% disturbance events), and reached up to similar to 4.4 times speedup for computation.

Monitoring its variations across space and over time is critical in ecological studies. So far, several reflectance-based metrics have been tested to achieve this objective, yielding different degrees of success. Our work aimed at exploring the potential of a novel metric based on far-red sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F-760) to map the functional diversity of terrestrial ecosystems. This was achieved exploiting high-resolution images collected over a mixed forest ecosystem with the HyPlant sensor, deployed as an airborne demonstrator of the forthcoming ESA-FLEX satellite. A reference functional diversity map was obtained applying the Rao\'s Q entropy metric on principal components calculated on key plant functional trait maps retrieved from the hyperspectral reflectance cube. Based on the spectral variation hypothesis, which states that the biodiversity signal is encoded in the spectral heterogeneity, two moving window-based approaches were tested to estimate the functional diversity from continuous spectral data: i) the Rao\'s Q entropy metric calculated on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and ii) the coefficient of variation (CV) calculated on hyperspectral reflectance. Finally, a third moving window approach was used to estimate the functional diversity based on F-760 heterogeneity quantified through the calculation of the Rao\'s Q entropy metric.   Results showed a strong underestimation of the functional diversity using the Rao\'s Q index based on NDVI and the CV of reflectance. In both cases, a weak correlation was found against the reference functional diversity map (r(2) = 0.05, p < .001 and r(2) = 0.04, p < .001, respectively). Conversely, the Rao\'s Q index calculated on F-760 revealed similar patterns as the ones observed in the reference map and a better correlation (r(2) = 0.5, p < .001). This corroborates the potential of far-red F for assessing the functional diversity of terrestrial ecosystems, opening unprecedented perspectives for biodiversity monitoring across different spatial and temporal scales.', '[Tagliabue, Giulia; Panigada, Cinzia; Celesti, Marco; Cogliati, Sergio; Colombo, Roberto; Rossini, Micol] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Environm & Earth Sci, Remote Sensing Environm Dynam Lab, Milan, Italy.

Changing patterns in precipitation intensity and increasing glacial ablation during spring and summer have major influence on river dynamics and the risk of widespread flooding. To monitor these rapid events, more frequent discharge observations are necessary. Having access to near-daily satellite based discharge observations is therefore highly beneficial. In this context, the recently launched Sentinel-1 and 2 satellites promise unprecedented potential, due to their capacity to obtain radar and optical data at high spatial (10 m) and high temporal (1-3 days) resolutions. Here, we use both missions to provide a novel approach to estimate the discharge of the Pjorsa (Thjorsa) river, Iceland, on a near-daily basis. Iceland, and many other high-latitude regions, are affected by frequent cloud-cover, limiting the availability of cloud-free optical Sentinel-2 data. We trained a Random Forest supervised machine learning classifier with a set of Sentinel-1 backscatter metrics to classify water in the individual Sentinel-1 images. A Sentinel-2 based classification mask was created to improve the classification results. Second, we derived the river surface area and converted it to the effective width, which we used to estimate the discharge using an at-a-station hydraulic geometry (AHG) rating curve. We trained the rating curve for a six-month training period using in situ discharge observations and assessed the effect of training area selection. We used the trained rating curve to estimate discharge for a one-year monitoring period between 2017/10 and 2018/10. Results showed a Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) of 0.831, indicating the usefulness of dense Sentinel-1 and 2 observations for accurate discharge estimations of a medium-sized (200 m width) high-latitude river on a near-daily basis (1.56 days on average).

The aerosol optical depth (AOD) describes the optical characteristics of aerosol loading. This paper describes a novel algorithm, which retrieves AOD above snow-covered regions from the measurements of the up-welling radiation at the top of atmosphere, observed by the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) instruments. The algorithm optimizes the generic eXtensible Bremen Aerosol/cloud and surfacE parameters Retrieval (XBAER) approach for longer wavelengths over the cryosphere. The algorithm utilizes the characteristics of solar bidirectional distribution properties of snow and aerosol at wavelength 3.7 mu m to derive above-snow-AOD. Since the impact of fine-mode aerosol on 3.7 mu m is ignorable, the retrieved AOD in this manuscript represents mainly coarse-mode dominated part. A novel method to extract the solar reflection part at 3.7 mu m is presented and used in the surface parameterization. Two aerosol types (sea salt-dominated and dust-dominated) are used and the best-fit type is derived by an iterative procedure, using a LookUp-Table (LUT) approach. Sensitivity studies of the impact on the retrieved AOD using XBAER algorithm, which investigate the impacts of aerosol type, snow surface emissivity and potential cloud contamination under typical AATSR observation conditions, are presented. The sensitivity studies show that the surface parametrization and aerosol typing are suitable for the retrieval of above-snow-AOD over the Arctic snow-covered region. AOD observations retrieved in this study from AATSR (2002-2012) observation collocated with those from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites over Greenland show good agreement. 72.1% of the match-ups fall into the expected error envelope of (+/- 0.15AOD +/- 0.025). The AATSR derived above-snow-AOD at 0.55 mu m research product has also been compared with Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) aerosol product, the Mineral Aerosols Profiling from Infrared Radiances (MAPIR) derived Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) AOD research product, and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) AOD simulations over Greenland on April 2011. The comparison reveals that all datasets show similar patterns for the AOD above Greenland. The AOD is smaller in central Greenland and larger over the coastline regions. The XBAER derived above-snow-AOD has improved coverage, as compared to that of the existing AATSR aerosol product. The transition between above-snow-AOD and AOD derived over surrounding ocean surfaces does not indicate any systematic errors. Two aerosol transport events have been well-captured by the XBAER derived above-snow-AOD research product. The new algorithm is also applied to the SLSTR onboard Sentinel-3 demonstrating new SLSTR above-snow-AOD data products, and its value for research in the changing AOD during the period of Arctic Amplification.', '[Mei, Linlu; Rozanov, Vladimir; Vountas, Marco; Burrows, John P.] Univ Bremen, Inst Environm Phys, Otto Hahn Allee 1, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.

A suite of products including annual land cover maps and annual land cover change maps will be produced using the Landsat 4-8 data record. LCMAP products will initially be created for the conterminous United States (CONUS) and then extended to include Alaska and Hawaii. A critical component of LCMAP is the collection of reference data using the TimeSync tool, a web-based interface for manually interpreting and recording land cover from Landsat data supplemented with fine resolution imagery and other ancillary data. These reference data will be used for area estimation and validation of the LCMAP annual land cover products. Nearly 12,000 LCMAP reference sample pixels have been interpreted and a simple random subsample of these pixels has been interpreted independently by a second analyst (hereafter referred to as \"duplicate interpretations\"). The annual land cover reference class labels for the 1984-2016 monitoring period obtained from these duplicate interpretations are used to address the following questions: 1) How consistent are the reference class labels among interpreters overall and per class? 2) Does consistency vary by geographic region? 3) Does consistency vary as interpreters gain experience over time? 4) Does interpreter consistency change with improving availability and quality of imagery from 1984 to 2016? Overall agreement between interpreters was 88%. Class-specific agreement ranged from 46% for Disturbed to 94% for Water, with more prevalent classes (Tree Cover, Grass/Shrub and Cropland) generally having greater agreement than rare classes (Developed, Barren and Wetland). Agreement between interpreters remained approximately the same over the 12-month period during which these interpretations were completed. Increasing availability of Landsat and Google Earth fine resolution data over the 1984 to 2016 monitoring period coincided with increased interpreter consistency for the post-2000 data record. The reference data interpretation and quality assurance protocols implemented for LCMAP demonstrate the technical and practical feasibility of using the Landsat archive and intensive human interpretation to produce national, annual reference land cover data over a 30-year period.

However, the spatial resolution of such observations often impedes the change analysis of geographic phenomena that may occur at sub-pixel level, such as changes in built-up land. In such cases, the integration of these data products with increasingly available contemporary high resolution settlement data employed as spatial constraints can potentially mitigate this drawback. Little research has been done regarding the quantitative potential of such integrative approaches, often due to the lack of multi-temporal reference data about changes in built-up area at sufficient spatio-temporal granularity and extent. In this contribution, we present and evaluate a time-series based approach for built-up area change analysis using Landsat time series data, spatially constrained by contemporary building footprint data.

Blended and interpolated L4 SST products offer major advantages over alternative SST data sources due to their spatial and temporal completeness, yet their ability to discriminate upwelling-induced steep temperature transitions in coastal waters remains largely unassessed. Here we analysed the performance of eleven L4 GHRSST-compliant products in estimating in situ water temperatures recorded by a large network of shallow subtidal and intertidal temperature loggers deployed in shores covering regimes with a wide range of upwelling intensities. Results indicate that while most products perform satisfactorily for most of the year, performance is severely affected during the upwelling season in locations with strong upwelling. We show that upwelling negatively impacts all four metrics used to assess dataset performance (average bias, correlation, centred root-mean-square error and normalized standard deviation), leading to a considerable overestimation of coastal water temperatures (with average bias exceeding 2 degrees C in some cases). We also show that while the use of L3 data (i. e., prior to blending and interpolation) leads to an increase in performance compared to L4 GHRSST-compliant products, the gain is probably not substantial enough to offset issues related with their spatial and temporal inconsistency along coastlines. Our results suggest that the use of L4 GHRSST-compliant products can lead to a misrepresentation of the thermal fingerprint of upwelling, and thus should be limited (or even avoided) in locations dominated by its effects. Conversely, the use of L4 GHRSST-compliant products on locations with little to no upwelling appears to be warranted. The mismatch between in situ and remotely-sensed sea water temperatures here reported also highlights the need for implementation of long-term monitoring networks of in situ temperature loggers.', '[Meneghesso, Claudia; Seabra, Rui; Santos, Antonio M.; Lima, Fernando P.] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO, Campus Agr Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal.

A strong relationship between SIF and GPP has been observed at the seasonal scale from both ground-based and satellite observations. However, variations of SIF due to changes in plant growth stages appear to influence the SIF-GPP relationship. It remains unclear how this relationship is affected by plant growth-related changes, especially for C4 plants such as maize. In this study, continuous in situ measurements for canopy far-red SIF retrieval and GPP calculation were made in maize during the growing season of 2017. Diurnal and seasonal variations of canopy SIF and its yield (SIFyield) were analyzed over different growth stages of maize to understand how they affect the relationship with GPP. The results show that the relationship between SIP and GPP varies with the growth stages of maize during the growing season, indicating that canopy structure has a strong impact on the seasonal variations of canopy SIF and its relation to GPP. Furthermore, we found that SIFyield is significantly correlated with canopy photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE) at the canopy level throughout the season. However, it is almost uncorrelated with LUE after adjusting for the effects of canopy structure with the structural vegetation index MTVI2. This finding highlights the importance of canopy structure in the relationship between SIFyield and LUE, complicating the use of canopy SIF for tracking vegetation physiological activity. Overall, our observation-based findings show that canopy structure affects the SIF-GPP relationship, strengthening our understanding of the mechanistic link between SIF and photosynthesis.', '[Li, Zhaohui; Zhang, Qian; Li, Ji; Wu, Yunfei; Zhang, Zhaoying; Wang, Songhan; Zhang, Yongguang] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

Functional diversity is rarely studied at regional scales, and its scale dependence is poorly understood. Capturing trait variations at distinct spatial scales and in differently managed grasslands remains challenging, mainly because a limited number of trait measurements are available and field campaigns are time-consuming. Here, we derived alpha- and beta-FD indices based on SLA measured in the field and estimated from optical satellite data by using molecular absorption profiles of leaves in canopies. We inverted the 1-D columnar radiative transfer model PROSAIL using Sentinel-2 reflectance data at canopy level. From the inversion we were able to distinguish different alpine management types based on retrieved SLA. Model uncertainties were mainly related to the different local plant communities, here represented by functional diversity indices and community-weighted means of traits. Thus, successful PROSAIL application was affected by management type. Management categories displaying lower alpha-FD, like mowed and fertilized, delivered the most reliable results. Further, we compared FD (i.e., richness, evenness, divergence) from local to regional scales. Locally, management determines the magnitude of FD, whereas on a regional scale, parcel size and the uniformity of agricultural practices control trait diversity. Our results highlight the importance of quantifying beta-FD from space as it delivers additional information on the impact of management types, differing from locally measured alpha-FD values.', '[Rossi, Christian; Kneubuler, Mathias; Schaepman, Michael E.] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Remote Sensing Labs, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.

These semiannual, lake-wide overturning events play an important role regulating the thermal structure, deep-water ventilation, nutrient supply, water circulation, and nearshore water quality of the lakes. The general pattern of overturning has long been known from field observations and models, but its timing, duration, detailed spatio-temporal progression and seasonal and inter-annual variability remain largely undocumented, particularly in the context of recent climate-driven changes in lake thermal dynamics. Here, we used a reconstructed record of daily and spatially-explicit lake surface water temperatures (LSWT) to analyze the migration of the 4 degrees C thermal front as it progressed from the shorelines to the deep parts of the Laurentian Great Lakes during every overturning event between June 1995 to April 2012. The analysis revealed a strong asymmetry in the timing and duration of overturning between spring and fall, and no relationship with the lake-averaged LSWT or its rate of change. Key differences in the average spatio-temporal progression of overturning were also observed between spring and fall, with the spring progression being largely driven by latitude and water depth and the fall progression being less predictable and influenced by other factors such as wind. Narrow regions of very slow overturning progression were also identified, revealing areas of the lakes where persistent 4 degrees C thermal bars are likely to re-occur every year. The timing and duration of these seasonal overturning events varied between years by as much as one and two months, respectively, with a direct impact on the duration of lake-wide stratification. In 2012, Lakes Michigan and Ontario experienced an incomplete fall overturning, leading only to a partial winter stratification. Lakes Michigan and Ontario were more susceptible to experience an incomplete overturning than the other Laurentian Great Lakes, seemingly due to a combination of comparatively milder winter air temperatures and lower lake dynamic ratio (steepness of bottom slope). Overall, the duration of lake-wide winter stratification was found to be strongly correlated with mean winter air temperatures, and a simple trend analysis suggested that rising temperatures could lead to more frequent incomplete fall overturnings and partial winter stratifications in Lakes Michigan and Ontario over the next few decades.

Theses factors are usually represented by Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD), vegetation scattering albedo, and surface roughness parameter, along with soil moisture. The VOD is the degree to which vegetation attenuates the microwave radiation. It has generally the dominant effect from vegetation, whereas scattering is negligible and close to zero. The surface roughness (which varies in space but not much in time) is until recently, often assumed to be a global constant. In this work, we attempted to simultaneously retrieve the VOD, the surface roughness parameter, and the soil moisture at the global scale using the Level 3 daily 0.25 degrees X-band brightness temperatures of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) sensor. The methodology, coined as the Simultaneous Parameter Retrieval Algorithm (SPRA), is based on the premise that the vegetation dynamics undergo slower temporal changes than the soil moisture-an assumption, which is successfully used in the past for microwave radiometric retrievals at lower frequencies. Results indicate that the SPRA produces the VOD retrievals with reduced high-frequency noise when compared to the baseline Land Parameter Retrieval Algorithm (LPRM) retrievals. This effect assisted in identifying the influence of precipitation and cropping patterns on the temporal dynamics of the VOD. Good agreement is observed between the mean SPRA VOD and canopy height data (global correlation = 0.75). The spatial patterns of surface roughness parameter agree well with the roughness product (HR map) developed using Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) sensor based data (global correlation = 0.57). Validation of SPRA and LPRM soil moisture products with in-situ observations over the Contiguous United States (CONUS) indicated an improvement in mean ubRMSE with SPRA product (SPRA-0.11 m(3)/m(3) and LPRM-0.18 m(3)/m(3)) and comparable mean Pearson correlations between the two products (SPRA-0.36 and LPRM-0.38).

Remote sensing can provide frequent and consistent data to facilitate wetland monitoring from regional to national scales and support their conservation and adaptive management. However, unique characteristics of wetlands, particularly land cover heterogeneity and background reflectance from soil, water and dead biomass, limit the efficacy of remote-sensing based metrics developed for terrestrial ecosystems. To identify the factors impacting satellite-based measurements of wetland greenness, we tested how six spectral vegetation indices responded to the land surface characteristics and regional climatic and edaphic context of 1,138 wetlands sites surveyed by the U.S EPA\'s National Wetland Condition Assessment. Spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) were estimated using all cloud-free surface reflectance data captured in 2011 by Landsat 5 TM and 7 ETM +. We tested two annually aggregated metrics maximum and median greenness- for each SVI to facilitate the analysis of such a large dataset of satellite images. Using univariate and multivariate ordinary least square regression, we assessed how the annual maximum and median of each SVI responded to indicators of vegetation structure and composition, presence of dead biomass, open water, bare soil, and climatic/edaphic variables. Results show that, in the full national-scale dataset, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) were most responsive to field-based metrics of vegetation structure and composition. However, the responses of SVIs differed significantly among wetland types, suggesting that their use should be tailored to the specific characteristics of the monitored wetlands. Annually aggregated metrics showed different sensitivity in multivariate models, with median greenness being more sensitive to structure and composition, but also to confounding site variables including litter, open water, and bare soil.

In this context, metrics are typically derived from the DAP point cloud in a manner analogous to that of ALS data. However, image matching algorithms also allow for spectral information from the image data to be transferred to the point cloud. Herein, we quantify the contribution of this spectral information to the area-based prediction of five forest inventory attributes: Lorey\'s mean height, quadratic mean diameter, basal area, gross volume per ha, and stems per ha in a highly productive coastal temperate rainforest on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Using ground plots and ALS-derived area-based estimates as reference, we compare plot-level predictions generated using (i) DAP point cloud metrics, (ii) DAP spectral metrics, and (iii) combinations of DAP point cloud and spectral metrics. In addition to prediction accuracy, we assessed variable importance to identify those metrics that were most informative for the developed models. Our results indicated that for models generated using DAP data, prediction accuracy was greatest when the point cloud-based metrics were incorporated. Models that incorporated both point cloud and spectral information were only slightly more accurate than models based on point cloud metrics only. We found that the improvement in accuracy was not observed for all stand attributes. The highest increase in accuracy for models combining point cloud and spectral metrics was observed for quadratic mean diameter, basal area per hectare, and stem volume per hectare, with change in relative root mean square error of -1.3%, -1.75%, and -0.23%, respectively. Models derived with spectral metrics only had the lowest accuracy with R-2 values never exceeding 0.25. Analysis of the variable importance indicated that point cloud metrics are markedly more important than spectral metrics. We conclude that the benefit of the additional spectral information in this forest environment is negligible, and the effort to derive the spectral information cannot be justified for operational applications. Our results confirm those of other studies in other environments that have likewise found minimal benefit to the incorporation of DAP spectral information in area-based estimation.', '[Tompalski, Piotr; Coops, Nicholas C.] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.

While interpolation/assimilation efforts exist to assemble discrete SWOT river observations into a spatially complete and temporally continuous record, the efficacy of such efforts is severely compromised by large observation gaps. In this study, we introduced spatiotemporal error correlations in runoff fields into the Inverse Streamflow Routing (ISR) model to improve the gap-filling capability for creating continuous daily discharge. This enhanced ISR model was first investigated in the Ohio River basin, which showed very significant improvements with better reproduced spatial and temporal dynamics of the runoff fields and the discharge time series. Results using 25 validation gauges showed a more concentrated Kling-Gupta Efficiency distribution, where the median was improved from 0.494 to 0.750. The enhanced ISR model was further tested over 16 representative global river basins to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. The best fitted e-fold correlation length and time leading to the greatest improvements varied largely among the 16 basins. While all basins benefitted from the spatiotemporal correlations in the SWOT gap-filling, basins suffering from poorer initial guess and fewer SWOT observations, such as the Dnieper, Kolyma and Murray basins, showed larger performance gains than others. Although the experiments were idealized and did not reflect all potential errors that may be present in a real-world application, we demonstrate that the utility of SWOT river products and their value in hydrologic sciences may be boosted by expanding a local/intermittent observation platform into a far-reaching source of hydrologic information through both river hydrodynamics in channel networks and spatiotemporal coherence of runoff errors.', '[Yang, Yuan] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.

The High Plains Aquifer (HPA) in the central United States is one of the largest and most stressed aquifer systems in the world. It supports a $20 billion economy, but groundwater use is unsustainable over much of the aquifer. Emerging cloud computing tools like Google Earth Engine (GEE) make it possible to use the full Landsat record to monitor regional systems like the HPA with high spatial and temporal resolution over multiple decades. However, challenges remain to develop irrigation classification methods that are robust to a wide range of climate conditions and crop types, evolving management, and missing data. Here, we addressed these challenges to produce an annual, moderately high resolution (30 m) irrigation map time series from 1984 to 2017 over the aquifer. Leveraging GEE\'s extensive data catalog, we combined Landsat imagery, environmental covariables, and a large heterogeneous ground truth dataset to create a single random forest classifier applied annually to the entire region. Following classification, we applied the Bayesian Updating of Land-Cover (BULC) algorithm to fill imagery gaps and reduce commission errors in the provisional irrigation time series. Novel neighborhood greenness indices contributed to an overall 91.4% map accuracy across years; county statistics (r(2) = 0.86) were similarly well-matched. Trend analysis of irrigated area through time identified regions of stable, expanding, and declining irrigated area. Given declining aquifer storage, we estimate that up to 24% of currently irrigated area may be lost this century.

A novel, objective and efficient method is presented for delineating the maximum inundation extents of lowland intermittent riverine wetland depressions using a high resolution LiDAR-derived digital terrain model (DTM). The method was specifically developed for wetland depressions associated with the lower reaches of the Murrumbidgee River in the southern Murray Darling Basin, Australia, but is suitable for any similar intermittent wetland depressions where the natural inundation extent is otherwise unclear. The method is based on the premise that immediately after rising water reaches a threshold level, much larger volumes of water are required to inundate not just the discrete wetland depression but also its surrounding local area; that threshold level can be considered the wetland fill level. Using a series of water levels and a corresponding series of the volume between each water level and a DTM of a wetland area, the maximum rate of increasing acceleration in volume with respect to water level, i.e. the wetland fill level, can be identified. The fill levels of eight wetland areas, ranging in size from 44 to 384 ha, were produced by this method and subsequently used to map their maximum inundation extents. Corresponding maps of the inundation frequency gradient were independently determined from a time series of Landsat derived inundation maps. The level of separation in inundation frequency of map cells inside the maximum inundation extents compared to those outside, determined by the Kolmogorov Smirnov statistic, validated the technique, while identifying that a minimum level of variation in the elevation of the wetland area may be necessary for it to be successfully applied. The technique has potential to be applied more widely as an objective and relatively inexpensive procedure to identify the potential maximum inundation extent of intermittent floodplain wetlands when a good quality high resolution DTM, acquired during a dry phase, is available.', '[Hall, Andrew; Wassens, Skye] Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, POB 789, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia.

First, the requirements of SSI in various studies or applications are presented along with the theoretical background of SSI satellite estimation. Methods to estimate SSI from satellites are then summarized as well as their advantages and limitations. Validations of satellite-based SSI on two typical spatial scales are discussed followed by a brief description of existing products and their accuracies. Finally, the challenges faced by current SSI satellite estimation are analyzed, and possible improvements to implement in the future are suggested.

We introduce a novel approach for the generation of large-scale thematic maps, based on the use of multi-temporal data, acquired over short observation intervals (short-time-series). A larger interferometric coherence loss is expected with the increasing time difference between two interferometric acquisitions. This phenomenon is normally indicated as temporal decorrelation whose amount differs depending on the type of imaged target on ground. The basic idea is therefore to accurately model the evolution in time of the temporal decorrelation and use the estimated parameters, together with backscatter, as input features for the Random Forest machine learning classification algorithm. The work has been carried out on the case study of land cover mapping over central Europe, considering Sentinel-1 C-band interferometric stacks, acquired over a time span of about one month. Three different land cover classes have been considered: artificial surfaces as e.g. urban areas, forests, and non-forested areas as the ensemble of low vegetation, bare soil, and agricultural areas.

This scale was originally developed for visual comparison and generated an immense amount of data, with hundreds of thousands of observations being gathered from the last 130 years. Since recently, the FU scale is also applicable to remote sensing data. This has been possible thanks to an optical characterization of the 21 FU colors in terms of the (x,y) CIE standards and new algorithms that convert remote-sensing reflectances (R-rs) from satellite-borne ocean color sensors to FU. R-rs-derived hue angle and FU have been recently applied with success in the assessment of color variability of lakes and specific shelf areas, but an evaluation over global oceanic waters is still missing. By clustering global climatological ESAOC-CCI v2.0 R-rs with the derived FU, we obtain a set of R-rs to be used as optical water types (OWTs). Diffuse attenuation coefficient, Secchi disk depth and chlorophyll concentration are also associated to the FU classes. The angular distances of a given R-rs to the two nearest FU classes are proposed as simple and robust membership indexes, adding up to one. We also evaluate the advantages and limitations of FU and the hue angle as monitoring tools over the full marine range, from the most oligotrophic areas to the turbid and productive coastal zones. The first 7 FU indexes cover 99% of global surface waters. Unlike the hue angle, that resolves all spatio-temporal color variations, the FU scale is coarse as a monitoring tool for oligotrophic waters as all the subtropical gyres saturate to FU = 1, while the color of other seas varies across 2, 3 or even 4 FU classes. We illustrate the introduction of a new \"zero\" FU class that increases monitoring resolution at the blue end of the color range. Finally, we show how optical diversity varies across the color range and compare several sets of OWTs from a color perspective. Overall, we provide a valuable and self-consistent dataset that enhances the usefulness of the FU scale by converting it to useful information for the oceanographic community. This OWT scheme keeps the advantages of other datasets, like being useful to study ocean color product quality and characterize the uncertainties, but also allows to continue to monitor long-term change in optical diversity over the global ocean color. Integration into the optical modules of ecosystem models can help verify past simulations that predate the satellite age, through comparisons with in-situ FU data collected at the time.', '[Pitarch, Jaime] NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Coastal Syst, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands.

This paper presents a combined Landsat-8 Sentinel-2 burned area mapping algorithm. The data handling integrates recent research on Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 preprocessing to generate registered, surface nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) sensor time series that are used as an input. The different sensor data are combined through a random forest change regression, trained with synthetic data built from laboratory and field spectra and using a spectral model of fire effects on reflectance. The random forest regression is applied independently at each gridded 30 m pixel location on a temporally rolling basis considering three months of sensor data to map the central month. Temporal consistency checks are used to reduce commission errors due to non-fire related spectral changes, and a region growing algorithm is used to reduce omission errors due to temporally sparse observations. In the resulting product, each 30 m pixel is labelled as burned, unburned or unmapped. At burned pixels the estimated day of burning, and a single value that provides an estimate of the product of the subpixel fraction burned (f) and the combustion completeness (cc), henceforth termed \"f.cc\", and an associated quality measure, are defined. The algorithm is demonstrated using six months of every available Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A acquisition over 10 degrees x 10 degrees of Southern Africa. Experiments comparing the mapped burned areas considering Sentinel-2A only and both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A data indicate a greater area burned and a smaller number of unmapped pixels when both sensors are used. The results are compared with contemporaneous NASA MODIS fire products to gain insights into their temporal and spatial reporting differences. Temporally, the Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 30 m product reports the day of burning on average three days later than the MODIS 500 m burned area product, because of the lower revisit frequency of the Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 observations. Spatially, the Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 30 m product captures more detail than the MODIS 500 m burned area product, with systematically higher burned area estimates. Despite the areal differences, the spatial pattern of the two products is similar, as reflected by the correlation (r(2) similar to 0.7) and slope (> 0.8) of regressions of the proportions of area burned defined in coarse resolution cells between the two products, taking into account the 3 day temporal bias. A comparison with multi-date PLANET 3 m data, shows high visual agreement in the location and approximate day of burning and higher f.cc values in the interiors of distinct burns than at the edges, and lower values in areas containing mixes of burned and unburned 3 m pixels. The Landsat-8/Sentinel-2A burned area mapping results are validated by comparison with burned areas interpreted visually from two date Sentinel-2A data, over 30 km x 30 km boxes selected by systematic sampling. The results mapped less area burned than the interpreted maps, as reflected by a 0.24 omission error and a negative relative bias (0.19), with a small 0.06 commission error. Regression between the proportions of area burned defined in 1.5 km cells provide a high correlation (r(2) = 0.89) and slope close to unity (0.82) and indicate that the Landsat-8/Sentinel-2A results identified similar burned area spatial patterns as the interpreted maps.', '[Roy, David P.; Li, Zhongbin] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, Ctr Global Change & Earth Observat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.

Joint passive microwave retrievals of soil moisture theta and vegetation optical depth tau potentially provide unparalleled insight into these couplings on a global scale. However, this requires careful data analyses. Using a novel coupling distortion metric R-s(2), we show that snapshot dual-polarization retrievals of tau and theta-widely used in vegetation studies - are spuriously correlated for SMAP L-band observations. Naive estimates of tau-theta coupling metrics are thus grossly distorted across a range of time scales. To mitigate the spurious correlations, we introduce a regularized retrieval algorithm. Our regularization algorithm exploits the assumed slowly changing nature of tau by penalizing rapid variations in the tau estimates. The degree of regularization r must balance a trade-off, as we find overregularization due to the oversmoothing of tau also distorts coupling estimates. When r is chosen to balance the trade-off according to R-s(2), the spurious correlations are found to essentially vanish. The estimates of tau-theta correlation change substantially compared to non-regularized retrievals. The changes are largest (similar to 0.5) over high-biomass at time scales of up to two weeks, but sizeable differences are also found on longer time scales. Our analyses show that estimating vegetation-soil moisture coupling metrics benefits from dedicated retrievals and data analysis approaches. Provided the uncertainties are carefully accounted for, satellite radiometry offers exciting opportunities to study ecohydrological interactions such as plant water uptake and hydraulics.', '[Berg, Aaron] Univ Guelph, Dept Geog, Guelph, ON, Canada.

We investigated the magnitude of change in topographical and seasonal O-4 vertical column density (VCD) in Northeast Asia and evaluated its effect on AEH retrieval accuracy using our AEH retrieval algorithm. In addition, the effect of a temperature-dependent cross-section for O-4 (TDCS) on Look Up Table (LUT)-based AEH retrieval accuracy was quantified. A comparison between the retrieved AEH and those from the NIES lidar network for the period from January 2005 to June 2009, applying both the TDCS and the seasonal and topographical O-4 VCDs, resulted in a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.44 km for both smoke and dust aerosols. However, when both a TDCS (an O-4 absorption cross-section at a single temperature of 293 K; SCS) and a single O-4 VCD value were applied to the LUT, the RMSE for both aerosol types was calculated to be 0.52 km (0.51 km), which implies that TDCS contributes most to AEH retrieval accuracy when accurate O-4 VCDs are applied to the LUT. For smoke aerosols only, both TDCS and multiple O-4 VCD (SCS and single O-4 VCD) applications had RMSE values of 0.46 km (0.66 km). The retrieved AEHs were additionally compared with satellite-based lidar measurements. We also investigated the effects of uncertainties in our algorithm input data (e.g., O-4 VCD, TDCS, AOD, and surface reflectance) on AEH retrieval error using synthetic radiances. Large errors can be caused by uncertainties in O-4 VCD and AOD. In particular (0.4 <= AOD < 1.0), O-4 VCD uncertainty led to AEH errors 0.96 km. However, the effect of uncertainty of TDCS on AEH retrieval is much smaller than that of O-4 VCD, which agrees with a small contribution of TDCS to an improvement of AEH retrieval accuracy found in the comparison between the lidar data and the retrieved AEH with the TDCS LUT.', '[Choi, Wonei; Lee, Hanlim; Park, Junsung; Kang, Hyeongwoo] Pukyong Natl Univ, Major Spatial Informat Engn, Div Earth Environm Syst Sci, Busan 48513, South Korea.

Although previous studies have widely used NTL images to map urban extent at multiple scales, it remains a challenging task to address how NTL respond exactly to urbanization and thus to map urbanization from NTL. In this study, using monthly Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP/VIIRS) NTL images between 2013 and 2017, we developed a method to decompose time-series NTL signal into annual and seasonal components. Further, we proposed an NTL-based indicator for the detection of impervious surfaces change (ISC) by integrating annual increment and seasonal variation of NTL brightness. The indicator was then used to identify ISC by using a thresholding method. The application of the methodology in the conterminous United States (CONUS) revealed a more rapid urbanization in the southern CONUS than the northern states and a northeastern-southwestern gradient of NTL seasonality. It was also found that NTL of November and December provided the most accurate characterization of urban extent for most areas in the CONUS. The detection of ISC in four representative regions (i.e. Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, greater Washington D.C., Denver-Aurora, and Atlanta) resulted in a moderate to high accuracy with the overall accuracy of similar to 80% and the Kappa value ranging from 0.56 to 0.73. Despite of this, the results showed a low accuracy of NTL-derived changing year of ISC (Kappa: 0.28) because of the existence of temporal inconsistency between NTL increase and ISC. The proposed method has the potential to timely map urban expansion at large geographical scales (e.g., continental and global) in a cost-efficient manner.', '[Xie, Yanhua] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Sustainabil & Global Environm, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, 1710 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53726 USA.

We estimate soil evaporation (E) using the complementary concept and soil surface temperature, therefore, the revised G(c)-TSEB requires no soil moisture as input. We tested G(c)-TSEB at 10 flux sites under various land cover and climate conditions. The flux-calibrated G(c)-TSEB performed well in ET predictions, with determinant coefficients (R-2) larger than 0.9 at most of the sites. The modeled transpiration was highly correlated with the Gross Primary Production, indicating the usefulness of the model in ET partitioning. More importantly, G(c)-TSEB can be calibrated against the land surface temperature (LST), which is operationally available using remote sensing technique. Overall, daily ET that was predicted by the LST-calibrated G(c)-TSEB generally matched the trends of the ET measurements at most of the sites, and R-2 range from 0.63 to 0.93, with a median of 0.80, at all sites. Transpiration estimation was highly consistent with the simulations from the flux-calibrated model. Moreover, in vegetated surfaces, soil evaporation was estimated reasonably well using the LST-calibrated G(c)-TSEB. However, positive biases are prevalent when vegetated fraction is smaller than 0.2, especially in cold regions because of the dramatic differences in evaporation process between summer and winter.

Our results revealed that in taller woody vegetation (forest and savanna), albedo increases during the growing period by up to 0.04 compared with the non-growing period, while it decreases in shorter vegetation (grassland and shrubland) by up to 0.03. The warming impact due to a decrease in albedo during the growing period in shorter vegetation is counteracted by a considerable increase in evapotranspiration, leading to net cooling. Analysis of land cover change impact on albedo showed a regional annual average instantaneous surface radiative forcing of -0.03 +/- 0.02 W m(-2). The land cover transitions from forest to cropland, and savanna to grassland, displayed the largest mean albedo increase across all seasons, causing an average instantaneous surface radiative forcing of -2.6 W m(-2) and -1.5 W m(-2) and a decrease in mean LST of 0.12 K and 0.09 K, all in dry period (December, January, February), respectively. Despite the albedo cooling effect in these conversions, an average net warming of 1.3 K and 0.23 K was observed under the dominant influence of non-radiative mechanisms. These results show that the impact of radiative mechanism was small, highlighting the importance of non-radiative processes in understanding the climatic impacts of land cover changes, as well as in delineating effective mitigation strategies.', '[Abera, Temesgen Alemayehu; Heiskanen, Janne; Pellikka, Petri; Maeda, Eduardo Eiji] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, POB 68, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.

Their accuracy has been assessed in many coastal zones around the world and they are ready for exploitation near the shore. This opens a variety of applications of the sea level data obtained from the specific reprocessing of radar altimeter signals in the coastal strip. In this work, we retracked altimeter waveforms of the European Space Agency satellites: ERS-2 RA and Envisat RA-2 from descending track (#0360) over the eastern side of the Strait of Gibraltar using the Adaptive Leading Edge Sub-waveform (ALES) retracker. We estimated along-track Sea Level Anomaly (AT_SLA) profiles (RA-2) at high posting rate (18 Hz) using improved range and geophysical corrections. Tides were removed with a global model (DTU10) that displays a good performance in the study area: the mean root square sum (RSS) of the main constituents obtained with DTU10 and 11 tide gauge stations was 4.3 cm in agreement with the RSS using a high-resolution local hydrodynamic model (UCA2.5D) (4.2 cm). We also estimated a local mean sea surface by reprocessing ERS-2/Envisat waveforms (track #0360) with ALES. The use of this local model gave more realistic AT_SLA than the values obtained with the global model DTU15MSS. Finally, the along-track Absolute Dynamic Topography (AT_ADT) was estimated using a local Mean Dynamic Topography obtained with the local hydrodynamic model UCA2.5D. We analysed the cross-strait variability of the sea level difference between the African/Spanish coasts along the selected track segment. This was compared to the sea level cross-strait difference from the records of two tide gauges located in the African (Ceuta) and Spanish (Tarifa) coasts. The sea level differences from altimetry and tide gauges were linked to the zonal component of the wind. We found a positive and significant ( > 95% c.l.) correlation between easterlies/westerlies and positive/negative cross-strait sea level differences between the southern and northern coasts of the Strait in both datasets (altimetry: r = 0.54 and in-situ: r = 0.82).', '[Gomez-Enri, J.; Gonzalez, C.

However, gauging stations are extremely limited across most high-mountain regions such as the Tibetan Plateau (TP), known as the Asia\'s water towers. Remote sensing, in combination with partial in situ discharge measurements, bridges the gap in monitoring river discharge over ungauged and poorly gauged basins. Of great importance for the successful retrieval of river discharge using remote sensing are river width (water surface area) and water level (water surface elevation), but it is challenging to retrieve accurate discharge values for high-mountain regions because of narrow river channels, complex terrain, and limited observations from a single satellite platform. Here, we used 1237 high-spatial-resolution images (Landsat series and Sentinel 1/2) to derive water surface areas with the Google Earth Engine (GEE), and satellite altimetry (Jason-2/3 and Satellite with Argos and AltiKa (SARAL/Altika)) to derive water levels for the Upper Brahmaputra River (UBR, the Yarlung Zangbo River in China) in the TP where the river width is typically less than 400 m. Using three power function equations, discharge was estimated for cross-sections around the four gauging stations in the UBR with triangular cross-sections outperforming their trapezoidal counterparts. It was also found that the equation combining both river width and water level produced the best discharge estimates whereas the other two equations (requiring either river width or water level as the input data) were complementary and could be used to extend the time series of discharge estimates. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient values for the discharge estimates range from 0.68 to 0.98 during the study period 2000-2017. The proposed method is feasible to estimate discharge in the UBR and potentially other high-mountain rivers globally.', '[Huang, Qi; Long, Di; Du, Mingda; Zeng, Chao; Li, Xingdong; Hong, Yang] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.

It is still unclear to what extent it depends on errors in parameter estimations (numerical source) or to the wave physics (physical source).   By improving the application of this correction we compute 20-Hz sea level anomalies that are about 30% more precise (i.e. less noisy) than the current standards. The improvement is two-fold: first we prove that the SSB correction should be applied directly to the 20-Hz data (12 to 19% noise decrease); secondly, we show that by recomputing a regional SSB model (based on the 20-Hz estimations) even a simple parametric relation is sufficient to further improve the correction (further 15 to 19% noise decrease).   We test our methodology using range, wave height and wind speed estimated with two retrackers applied to Jason-1 waveform data: the MLE4 retracked-data available in the Sensor Geophysical Data Records of the mission and the ALES retracked-data available in the OpenADB repository (https://openadb.dgfi.tum.de/). The regional SSB models are computed parametrically by means of a crossover analysis in the Mediterranean Sea and North Sea.   Correcting the high-rate data for the SSB reduces the correlation between retracked parameters. Regional variations in the proposed models might be due to differences in wave climate and remaining sea-state dependent residual errors. The variations in the empirical model with respect to the retracker used recall the need for a specific SSB correction for any retracker.   This study, while providing a significantly more precise solution to exploit high-rate sea level data, calls for a re-thinking of the SSB correction in both its physical and numerical component, gives robustness to previous theories and provides an immediate improvement for the application of satellite altimetry in the regions of study.', '[Passaro, Marcello; Nadzir, Zulfikar Adlan] Tech Univ Munich, Deutsch Geodat Forschungsinst, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.

The advent of the Sentinel satellites program provides free datasets with good spatiotemporal resolution that can be a valuable source of information for monitoring pasture resources. We combined optical remote sensing data (proximal hyperspectral and Sentinel 2A) with a radiative transfer model (PROSAIL) to estimate leaf Area Index (LAI), and biomass, in a dairy farming context. Three sites in Southern England were used: two pasture farms that differed in pasture type and management, and a set of small agronomy trial plots with different mixtures of grasses, legumes and herbs, as well as pure perennial ryegrass. The proximal and satellite spectral data were used to retrieve LAI via PROSAIL model inversion, which were compared against field observations of LAI. The potential of bands of Sentinel 2A that corresponded with a 10 m resolution was studied by convolving narrow spectral bands (from a handheld hyperspectral sensor) into Sentinel 2A bands (10 m). Retrieved LAI, using these spectrally resampled S2A data, compared well with measured LAI, for all sites, even for those with mixed species cover (although retrieved LAI was somewhat overestimated for pasture mixtures with high LAI). This proved the suitability of 10 m Sentinel 2A spectral bands for capturing LAI dynamics for different types of pastures. We also found that inclusion of 20 m bands in the inversion scheme did not lead to any further improvement in retrieved LAI. Sentinel 2A image based retrieval yielded good agreement with LAI measurements obtained for a typical perennial ryegrass based pasture farm. LAI retrieved in this way was used to create biomass maps (that correspond to indirect biomass measurements by Rising Plate Meter (RPM)), for mixed-species paddocks for a farm for which limited field data were available. These maps compared moderately well with farmer-collected RPM measurements for this farm. We propose that estimates of paddock-averaged and within-paddock variability of biomass are more reliably obtained from a combined Sentinel 2A-PROSAIL approach, rather than by manual RPM measurements. The physically based radiative transfer model inversion approach outperformed the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index based retrieval method, and does not require site specific calibrations of the inversion scheme.', '[Punalekar, S.

However, intermediate scale Landsat studies have shown that these changes are heterogeneous and may be related to landscape and regional variability in climate, land cover, topography and moisture availability. In this study, a Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series (1984-2016) was examined for an area spanning the transition from sub-Arctic boreal forest to Low Arctic tundra in central Canada. This was supplemented by analyses of relationships with a suite of environmental variables and in situ measurements of bulk vegetation volume. Results show that NDVI trends were generally positive (i.e. increasing) across the study area but were smallest in the forest zone and largest in the northern tundra zone. More than one-quarter (27%) of un-masked pixels exhibited a significant (p < 0.05) trend and virtually all (99.3%) of those pixels exhibited an increasing, or \"greening\", trend. Greening pixels were most common in the northern tundra zone and the southern ecotone zone. Random Forest modeling of the relationship between NDVI and environmental variables indicated that the magnitude and direction of trends varied across the forest to tundra transition. Areas that experienced larger increases in NDVI include: (i) areas where summer temperatures increased; (ii) areas exhibiting predominantly shrub and forest cover; and (iii) locations closer to major drainage systems, further from major lakes, and at lower elevations. Ground validation in the central portion of the study area reveals a strong relationship (R-2 = 0.79) between vegetation volume and NDVI for non-tree functional groups and that alder (Alnus crispa) shrublands and open spruce (Picea mariana and P. glauca) woodland with shrubby understories were most likely to exhibit greening. These findings indicate that the largest positive and more significant NDVI trends were associated with increased productivity in shrub-dominated environments, especially at, and north of the treeline in localities with favorable growing conditions. Smaller and less significant NDVI trends in boreal forest environments south of the treeline were likely associated with long-term successional change following disturbance rather than the variables analyzed here.', '[Bonney, Mitchell T.; Danby, Ryan K.; Treitz, Paul M.] Queens Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, D201 Mackintosh Corry Hall,68 Univ Ave, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.

However, such datasets are not widely available because of the large spatiotemporal heterogeneity of Ta caused by complex biophysical and socioeconomic factors such as built infrastructure and human activities. In this study, we developed a 1 km gridded dataset of daily minimum Ta (Tmin) and maximum Ta (Tmax), and the associated uncertainties, in urban and surrounding areas in the conterminous U.S. for the 2003-2016 period. Daily geographically weighted regression (GWR) models were developed and used to interpolate Ta using 1 km daily land surface temperature and elevation as explanatory variables. The leave-one-out cross-validation approach indicates that our method performs reasonably well, with root mean square errors of 2.1 degrees C and 1.9 degrees C, mean absolute errors of 1.5 degrees C and 1.3 degrees C, and R 2 of 0.95 and 0.97, for Tmin and Tmax, respectively. The resulting dataset captures reasonably the spatial heterogeneity of Ta in the urban areas, and also captures effectively the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon that Ta rises with the increase of urban development (i.e., impervious surface area). The new dataset is valuable for studying environmental impacts of urbanization such as UHI and other related effects (e.g., on building energy consumption and human health). The proposed methodology also shows a potential to build a long-term record of Ta worldwide, to fill the data gap that currently exists for studies of urban systems.', '[Li, Xiaoma; Zhou, Yuyu] Iowa State Univ, Dept Geol & Atmospher Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA.

Experimental results indicated that, overall, the SANN method is accurate in remote-sensing estimations of aquatic vegetation biomass. However, accuracies of estimations were unsatisfactory for certain indicators and sessions when data was taken. The estimations were analyzed using three sets of indicators: (i) root mean square error, average relative error, and total relative error; (ii) correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination, and their scatter plots; and (iii) relative error values and their distributions. The results clearly showed that the SANN method was superior to the BP neural network as well as the stepwise multiple linear regression analysis (SR). However, when the relative errors in biomass estimations by the other two methods were low, the advantages of the SANN method were less pronounced.

However, the imagery that was available at that time was inadequate for the task as it did not permit the direct observation and counting of warrens. Since then, advances in the availability and resolution of satellite imagery mean that it is now possible to map the entire distribution of southern hairy-nosed wombats and to estimate their population abundance using very high-resolution imagery (<= 1.0 m). However, other landscape features such as rabbit warrens can make the identification of wombat warrens problematic, and not all wombat warrens are visible, even in the best resolution imagery. By comparing data that we collected from field surveys conducted between May 2015 - May 2017 with satellite imagery we could identify that many wombat warrens have visible trails linking warrens with each other. Whilst this allowed us to differentiate between wombat and rabbit warrens in most circumstances, the lack of visible trails in some instances highlighted the need for ground truthing surveys to be conducted as part of any broad scale wombat population survey. Based on the difference between the number of warrens that we marked during our ground surveys with the number which were visible in the satellite imagery, we calculated a range of indices which can be used to correct future broad-scale population estimates based on satellite imagery, to account for warrens which may be obscured by vegetation and other confounding factors.', '[Swinbourne, Michael J.; Taggart, David A.; Swinbourne, Alyce M.; Lewis, Megan; Ostendorf, Bertram] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Waite Campus, Adelaide, SA 5064, Australia.', 'University of AdelaideRP Swinbourne, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Waite Campus, Adelaide, SA 5064, Australia.', 'michael.swinbourne@adelaide.edu.au', 'LEWIS, MEGAN/0000-0003-1203-6281', 'Australian Government through the Australian Research Council   [LP160100937]; Australian Research Council [LP160100937] Funding Source:   Australian Research Council', 'This research was partially funded by the Australian Government through   the Australian Research Council (LP160100937).', 32, 15, 16, 0, 27, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Although its primary mission is to measure the column-averaged mixing ratio of CO2 (Xco(2)) to constrain global carbon source/sink distribution, one of the OCO-2 spectrometers allows for a robust SIF retrieval solely based on solar Fraunhofer lines. Here we present a technical overview of the OCO-2 SIF product, aiming to provide the scientific community guidance on best practices for data analysis, interpretation, and application. This overview consists of the retrieval algorithms, OCO-2 specific bias correction, retrieval uncertainty evaluation, cross-mission comparison with other existing SIF products, and a global-scale examination of the SIF-GPP relationship. With the initial three years of data (September 2014 onward), we compared OCO-2 SIF with retrievals from Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2), and examined its relationship with FLUXCOM and MODIS GPP datasets. Our results show that OCO-2 SIF, along with GOSAT products, closely resemble the mean spatial and temporal patterns of FLUXCOM GPP from regions to the globe. Compared with GOME-2, however, OCO-2 depicts a more realistic spatial contrast between the tropics and extra-tropics. The linear relationship between OCO-2 SIF and existing modeled GPP products diverges somewhat across biomes at the global scale, consistent with previous GOSAT or GOME-2 based findings when modeled GPP products were used, but in contrast to a consistent cross-biome SIF-GPP relationship obtained at flux tower sites with OCO-2 products. This contrast suggests a critical need to reconcile differences in diverse SIF and GPP products and the relationships among them. Overall, the OCO-2 SIF products are robust and valuable for monitoring the global terrestrial carbon cycle and for constraining the carbon source/sink strengths of the Earth system. Finally, insights are offered for future satellite missions optimized for SIF retrievals.', '[Sun, Ying; Frankenberg, Christian; Magney, Troy] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA.

This study used L-band space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) within a change-detection framework to delineate forested areas affected by wind and insect disturbances. The results showed that changes in back scatter relate to damage caused by wind and insect outbreaks.

At night, with the rise of SUHI intensity levels, the frequency of SUHI intensity levels increased from the periphery to the center within the same season. ISDD had a marked influence on the frequency of SUHI intensity levels during the daytime, and the frequencies of level-1 to level-4 intensities increased with ISDD.

Land cover is considered to be an Essential Climate Variable because changes in it can result in local, regional or global scale impacts on climate. In LSMs, land cover (LC) class maps are converted to PFT fractional maps using a cross walking (CW) table by prescribing the fraction of each PFT that occurs within each LC class. In this study we assess the largest plausible range of PFT uncertainty derived from remotely sensed LC maps produced under the European Space Agency Land Cover Climate Change Initiative on simulations of land surface fluxes using 3 leading LSMs. We evaluate the impact of uncertainty due to both LC classification algorithms, and CW procedure, on energy, moisture and carbon fluxes in LSMs. We investigate the maximum plausible range of uncertainty deriving from both LC and CW within the context of a potential biomass scale (bare ground-grass shrub-tree), representing a gradient from low to high biomass PFTs. More specifically, plausible alternative land cover maps and associated PFT fractional distributions were produced to prioritise low or high biomass vegetation in the LC classification (uncertainty in LC), and subsequently in the assignment of PFT fractions for each LC class (uncertainty in CW), relative to a reference PFT distribution.   We examined the impact of PFT uncertainty on 3 key variables in the carbon, water and energy cycles (gross primary production (GPP), evapo-transpiration (ET), and albedo), for 3 LSMs (JSBACH, JULES and ORCHIDEE) at global scale. Results showed a greater uncertainty in PFT fraction due to CW as opposed to LC uncertainty, for all three variables. CW uncertainty in tree fraction was found to be particularly important in the northern boreal forests for simulated LSM albedo. Uncertainty in the balance between grass and bare soil fraction in arid parts of Africa, central Asia, and central Australia was also found to influence albedo and ET in all models. The spread due to PFT uncertainty for albedo was between 30 and 105% of inter-model uncertainty, for GPP between 20 and 90%, and for ET 0-30%. Each model had a different sensitivity to PFT uncertainty, for example, GPP in JSBACH was found to have a much higher sensitivity to PFT uncertainty in the tropics than JULES and ORCHIDEE, whereas the inverse was true for ET.   These results show that inter-model uncertainty for key variables in LSMs can be reduced by more accurate representation of PFT distributions. Future efforts in land cover mapping should therefore be focused on reducing CW uncertainty through better understanding of the fractional cover of PFTs within a land cover class. Efforts to reduce LC uncertainty should particularly be focused on more accurate mapping of grass and bare soil fractions in arid areas. In the context of Land Surface Models, these results demonstrate that prescribed vegetation distribution in models is a key source of uncertainty that is comparable to the spread between models for key model state variables.', '[Hartley, A.

The WorldView constellation, operated by DigitalGlobe, images over 1.2 billion km(2) annually at <2 m spatial resolution. Due to computation, data cost, and methodological concerns, VHR satellite data has mainly been used to produce needed geospatial information for site-specific phenomena. This project produced a VHR spatiotemporally explicit wall-to-wall cropland area map for the rainfed residential cropland mosaic of the Tigray Region, Ethiopia, which is comprised mostly of smallholder farms. Moderate resolution satellite data do not have adequate spatial resolution to capture the total area occupied by smallholder farms, i.e., farms with agricultural fields of <= 45 x 45 m in dimension. In order to accurately map smallholder cropped area over a large region, hundreds of VHR images spanning two or more years are needed. Sub-meter WorldView-1 and WorldView-2 segmentation results were combined with median phenology amplitude from Landsat 8 data to map cropped area. Over 2700 VHR WorldView-1, -2 data were obtained from the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) via the NextView license agreement and were processed from raw imagery to produce a smallholder crop map in similar to 1 week using a semi-automated method with the large computing capacity of the Advanced Data Analytics Platform. We estimated cropped area in Tigray to be 46% with a commission error of 5% +/- 10% and omission error of 15% +/- 12%. This methodology is extensible to other regions with similar vegetation texture and can easily be expanded to run on much larger regions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[McCarty, J.

This manuscript describes the implementations of MSI processing into the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) and provides qualitative and quantitative analyses of remote sensing reflectance products (Rrs), which are essential in the retrievals of near-surface concentrations of water constituents in aquatic systems. In situ validations and intercomparisons of MSI-derived 11 products with those derived from Landsat-8\'s Operational Land Imager (OLI) both indicated reasonable products in coastal/inland waters. Following vicarious calibrations using reference in situ water-leaving radiances, the overall absolute relative differences and the root mean squared differences (RMSD) found for the matchup analyses were, < 7% and < 0.0012 1/sr, respectively, for the blue and green bands. With preliminary indications of consistency with the OLI products and very good agreements with in situ data, a time-series plot of total suspended solids (TSS) product derived from both missions was produced and analyzed for an inland system. It is surmised that frequent moderate-to-high resolution R products from the combined Sentinel-2A (and 13) and Landsat-8 missions are now available to the science/user community for developing algorithms suited for coastal/inland waters. Nonetheless, further research needs to be dedicated to a) improving atmospheric corrections over bodies of waters rich in dissolved organic matter or suspended particles, b) mitigating the impact of haze-or sea surface-reflected solar radiations at low solar zenith angles, and c) minimizing image artifacts to maximize the use of multi-mission products.', '[Pahlevan, N.; Sarkar, S.; Franz, B.

Trees with isohydric strategies regulate stomatal conductance to maintain stationary leaf water potential, while trees with anisohydric strategies allow leaf water potential to fall, which in the absence of significant hydraulic cavitation will facilitate greater rates of carbon uptake. Despite the recognition of the gas exchange consequences of isohydric and anisohydric strategies for individual tree species, there have been few studies regarding whether isohydric trees produces distinct spectral signatures under drought stress that can be remotely sensed. Here, we examined the capability of four vegetation indices (PRI, NDVI, NDVI705, and EVI) to capture the differences in spectral responses between isohydric and anisohydric trees within a deciduous forest in central Indiana, USA. Both leaf-level spectral measurements and canopy-scale satellite observations were used to compare peak growing-season spectral signatures between a drought and a non-drought year. At the leaf scale, two vegetation indices (NDVI and NDVI705) failed to capture the drought signal or the divergent isohydric/anisohydric behavior. EVI successfully captured the drought signal at both leaf and canopy scales, but failed to capture the divergent behavior between isohydric and anisohydric tree species during the drought. PRI captured both drought signals and divergent isohydric/anisohydric behavior at both leaf and canopy scales once normalized between sunlit (backward direction images) and shaded (forward direction images) portions of canopy, which indicates drought stress and subsequent photosynthetic down regulation are greater in the sunlit portion of canopy. This study presents a significant step forward in our ability to directly mapping emergent isohydricity at different scales based on divergent spectral signatures between sunlit and shaded canopies.', '[Hwang, Taehee; Gholizadeh, Hamed; Sims, Daniel A.; Robeson, Scott M.; Rahman, Abdullah F.] Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, Bloomington, IN 47401 USA.

Thus it is important to enhance our capabilities of observing, understanding and forecasting storm surges for mitigating damage and loss. Previous studies have shown that cross-shelf altimetric sea surface height profiles can be used to determine storm surge features. In this study we combine satellite altimetry with tide-gauge data to study storm surge features off Florida in the Gulf of Mexico during Hurricane Isaac 2012. Satellite observations show a storm surge of about 0.8 m near Cedar Key and Apalachicola decreasing westward and southward in the early morning of August 28, 2012 (UTC), consistent with tide-gauge measurements. Our analysis of satellite data reveals that the storm surge propagates northward from Naples to Cedar Key with a phase speed of 14-16 m/s and a cross-shelf decay scale of 190-220 km, in approximate agreement with the estimates from tide-gauge data. In contrast, an analysis of tide-gauge data reveals that the storm surge propagates westward from Apalachicola to Pensacola with a phase speed of 6-7 m/s and a cross-shelf decay scale of about 85 km. It is further shown that the post-storm sea level variations at these stations are associated with first-mode continental shelf waves. The present study shows that along-shelf altimetric sea surface height profiles can be useful to observe and understand storm surge features as cross-shelf ones demonstrated previously, of importance to improvement of storm surge forecasting. It suggests that a constellation of altimeter missions especially with wide-swath altimetry could be suited to monitor storm surges. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Adequate validation of such products is critical for their proper usage and interpretation. Validation of coarse-resolution products often relies on independent data derived from moderate resolution sensors (e.g., Landsat). Validation of Landsat products, in turn, is challenging because there is no corresponding source of high-resolution, multispectral imagery that has been systematically collected in space and time over the entire temporal extent of the Landsat archive. Because of this, comparison between high-resolution images and Landsat science products can help increase user\'s confidence in the Landsat science products, but may not, alone, be adequate. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach to systematically validate the Landsat-derived BAECV product. Burned area extent was mapped for Landsat image pairs using a manually trained semi-automated algorithm that was manually edited across 28 path/rows and five different years (1988,1993, 1998, 2003, 2008). Three datasets were independently developed by three analysts and the datasets were integrated on a pixel by pixel basis in which at least one to all three analysts were required to agree a pixel was burned. We found that errors within our Landsat reference dataset could be minimized by using the rendition of the dataset in which pixels were mapped as burned if at least two of the three analysts agreed. BAECV errors of omission and commission for the detection of burned pixels averaged 42% and 33%, respectively for CONUS across all five validation years. Errors of omission and commission were lowest across the western CONUS, for example in the shrub and scrublands of the Arid West (31% and 24%, respectively), and highest in the grasslands and agricultural lands of the Great Plains in central CONUS (62% and 57%, respectively). The BAECV product detected most (>65%) fire events >10 ha across the western CONUS (Arid and Mountain West ecoregions). Our approach and results demonstrate that a thorough validation of Landsat science products can be completed with independent Landsat-derived reference data, but could be strengthened by the use of complementary sources of high-resolution data.

Global datasets of recorded passive microwave emissions provide non-destructive, daily information on snow processes including the presence of liquid water in the snow, which can be an indicator of snowmelt The objective of this research is to test the sensitivity of the emission signal as it relates to the spatial distribution of liquid water content in the snowpack. This signal response was evaluated over an area approximately the size of a microwave pixel to assess whether a relationship exists between the aerial extent of wet snow and the magnitude of the T-B response. A sensitivity analysis was performed using a high-resolution, physically based snow-emission model to simulate microwave emissions. The signal response to wet snow was evaluated given a range of spatially distributed snowpack conditions. Daily snow states were simulated for a 9-year period using a high-resolution (50 m) energy balance snow model over a 34 x 34 km domain. These data were fed into a microwave emission model to simulate brightness temperatures. A near-linear relationship was found between the T-B signal response over a spatially heterogeneous snowpack and the percent area with liquid water content (LWC) present. The results were confirmed by evaluating actual wet snow events over a 9-year period. The model output was also compared to AMSR-E passive microwave satellite data and discharge data at a basin outlet within the study area. The results are used to help understand the impact of spatially distributed snowmelt as detected by passive microwave data.

Remotely sensed data provide the only long term, large scale record of changes within dryland ecosystems. The Residual Trend, or RESTREND, method is applied to satellite observations to detect dryland degradation. Whilst effective inmost cases, it has been shown that the RESTREND method can fail to identify degraded pixels if the relationship between vegetation and precipitation has broken-down as a result of severe or rapid degradation. This paper presents an extended version of the RESTREND methodology that incorporates the Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend method to identify step changes in the time series that are related to significant structural changes in the ecosystem, e.g. land use changes. When applied to Australia, this new methodology, termed Time Series Segmentation and Residual Trend analysis (TSS-RESTREND), was able to detect degradation in 5.25% of pixels compared to only 2.0% for RESTREND alone. This modified methodology was then assessed in two regions with known histories of degradation where it was found to accurately capture both the timing and directionality of ecosystem change.

Due to the lack of on-board calibration, there are systematic biases in NTL data. Consequently, a key deterrent to the use of the entire NTL archive is the difficulty in generating a consistent NTL time series. Currently, there are a number of methods to calibrate Nu. data in order to generate a consistent time series. However, there is no systematic evaluation of the performances of these calibration efforts. The purpose of this paper is to compare and evaluate existing calibration methods and to provide guidance to NTL end users on their relative strengths and weaknesses. We apply two widely adopted criteria to assess the performance of the methods: a) systematic bias minimization, and b) relation with ancillary socio-economic data on economic activity and electricity consumption. Our results show that global-scale calibration methods outperform regionally-based calibration methods. Furthermore, inconsistencies, in the form of differences in pixel values from two satellites of the same region and year, continue to exist in NTL data even after the calibration methods are applied, both across regions and across scales. We find that dimly lit regions are more difficult to calibrate compared to brightly lit regions and that inconsistencies persist in higher northern and lower southern latitudes. We conclude that significant improvements in calibration results will require a shift either towards absolute correction methods using in-situ data or relative calibration methods using NTL from VIIRS.

AMSR2 Level 3 (L3) soil moisture products retrieved from two versions of brightness temperatures using the Japanese Aerospace eXploration Agency (JAXA) and the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) algorithm were included. For the LPRM algorithm, two different parameterization methods were applied. Furthermore, two versions of SMOS L3 soil moisture product were assessed. The results are contrasted against the use of \"random\" stations. Accounting for all versions, frequencies and overpasses, the latest versions of the JAXA UX2) and LPRM (LP3) products were found to surpass the earlier versions (JX1, LP1 and LP2). Soil moisture retrieval based on the latter version of brightness temperature and parameterization scheme improved when C-band observations were used but not X-band. However, X-band retrievals (r: 0.71, MAE: 0.07, RMSD: 0.08 m3/m3) were found to perform better than C-band (r: 0.68-0.70, MAE: 0.070.09 m(3)/m(3), RMSD: 0.09-0.10 m(3)/m(3)). Moreover, an intercomparison between different acquisition times (morning and evening) of AMSR2 X-band products found a better performance from evening overpasses (1:30 pm; r: 0.69-0.77) as opposed to morning overpasses (1:30 am; r: 0.47-0.66). In the case of SMOS, morning (6:00 am; r: 0.77) retrievals were found to be superior over evening (6:00 pm; r: 0.69) retrievals. Overall, both versions of JAXA products, the second and third versions of LPRM X-band products, and two versions of SMOS products were found to meet the mean average error (MAE) goal accuracy of the AMSR2 mission (MAE < 0.08 m(3)/m(3)) but none of the products achieved the SMOS goal of RMSD < 0.04 m(3)/m(3). Furthermore, performance of the products differed depending on the statistic used to evaluate them. Consequently, considering the results in this study, JX2 products are recommended if both absolute and temporal accuracy of the soil moisture product is of importance, whereas LP3(x) products from evening observations and SMOS version 3.00 (SMOS2) products from morning overpasses are recommended if temporal accuracy is of greater importance.

In this study, an advanced SWE retrieval algorithm based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method was developed. This method samples the posterior multiple-layer snow properties according to the likelihood of the brightness temperature (TB) simulation with the actual TB observations. The Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks with improved Born approximation (MEMLS-IBA) was used as the observation model. Using a globally applicable method to produce prior estimates of snow properties, the retrieval approach is called the Bayesian Algorithm for SWE Estimation with Passive Microwave measurements (BASE-PM), and was applied on 48 snowpits at Sodanlcyla, Finland; Churchill, Canada and Colorado, US. The result shows that the root mean squared (RMS) error of the retrieved SWE is 42.7 mm excluding two outliers, and is 30.8 mm if the outliers as well as six deep snowpits from Colorado are excluded. This accuracy approximately meets the 30-mm requirement of Integrated Global Observing Strategy for shallow snow. The poor performance for the outlier and deep snowpits is explained. Additional experiments using more accurate priors show that SWE retrieval accuracy can be improved with local snowcover knowledge, e.g. if historical snowpit measurements or snow process model simulations are available.

In the second approach, labeled \'separate retrieval assimilation\', separate soil moisture products are retrieved from each of the active and passive microwave observations, before being simultaneously assimilated into the model. In both approaches, a Neural Network (NN) is used to retrieve soil moisture from passive microwave AMSR-E brightness temperatures and/or active microwave ASCAT backscatter observations. A spatially distributed (3D) ensemble Kalman filter is used for the assimilation over the contiguous United States from August 2007 until September 2011. The analysis skill of both assimilation approaches is evaluated against in situ observations from 60 SCAN stations and compared to the model open loop (no assimilation) skill. When averaged across the 60 sites, the skill obtained from both assimilation experiments is very similar. For surface soil moisture, the average correlation and anomaly correlation are 0.69 and 0.58, respectively. These metrics are slightly better than those of the open loop, by 0.05 for the correlation and by 0.03 for the anomaly correlation. The root zone soil moisture estimates from the assimilation were also slightly improved compared to the open loop (by 0.03 for the average correlation and by 0.01 for the average anomaly correlation). Locally, there are differences between the skill values of the two assimilation experiments. These are related to differences in the skill of the assimilated retrieval products and how well these differences are captured by the observation errors specified in the data assimilation.

However, different drought indices have differing characteristics, and are suitable for specific environments. The aim of this study was to compare the occurrence of drought, as detected by remote sensing across the Continental United States (CONUS). We used drought events during 2011 and 2012 to compare various indices developed for the study of drought phenomena. Three in situ drought indices, the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), Z-index and standardized precipitation indices (SPI) with different time scales were used to evaluate drought conditions in different climate divisions. The drought indices compared in this study include the vegetation condition index (VCI), the temperature condition index (TCI), the perpendicular drought index (PDI) and modified PDI (MPDI) derived from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, the precipitation condition index (PCI) derived from tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) data, and the soil moisture condition index (SMCI) derived from advanced microwave scanning radiometer - earth observing system (AMSR-E). Other synthesized drought indices, which combine indices such as VCI, TCI, SMCI and PCI, were also compared in this study. These included the vegetation health index (VHI), temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI), scaled drought condition index (SDCI), the microwave integrated drought index (MIDI), the synthesized drought index (SDI), the optimized meteorological drought index (OMDI), and the optimized vegetation drought index (OVDI). The results include a wide variety of drought conditions based on different drought indices. Meteorological drought indices indicated that more regions were under severe drought than agricultural drought indices did. Drought indices appear to be more similar to standard drought indices than PDI, MPDI and TVDI. The results also indicate that different indices have strengths and weaknesses in different climates across CONUS. SMCI has a good correlation with short-term SPI, and the sensitivity of SMCI is strongly dependent on terrain, as it performs worse in regions with heavy tree cover than in regions with a low density of vegetation. TCI, VCI, PDI and MPDI are more similar to 3-month SPI data, but correlate weakly with station-based indices located in areas of high precipitation, higher soil permeability, large-scale agriculture and forests. PCI is more strongly correlated with short-term drought conditions in almost all climate divisions than other single indices. VCI would be more reliable if there were only red and NIR surface reflectance bands available, while VHI would be a better choice if only NDVI and LST data were available. Condition index-based drought indices (PCI, TCI, VCI, SMCI, VHI, SDCI, SDCI, MIDI, OVDI, OMDI) performed better than other categories of drought indices, and the use of time series analysis may be a contributing factor to this difference in performance.

Although parts of the landslide complex have been found reactivated in recent years, the timing and magnitude of motion have not been systematically monitored or interpreted. Here we apply novel time-series strategies to study the spatial distribution and temporal behavior of the landslide movement between 2007 and 2011 using InSAR images from two overlapping L-band ALOS PALSAR-1 satellite tracks. Our results show that the reactivated part has moved approximately 700 mm downslope during the 4-year observation period, while other parts of the landslide complex have generally remained stable. However, we also detect about 300 mm of seasonal downslope creep in a terrain block upslope of the Cascade landslide complex terrain previously thought to be stable. The temporal oscillation of the seasonal movement can be correlated with precipitation, implying that seasonal movement here is hydrology-driven. The seasonal movement also has a frequency similar to GPS-derived regional ground oscillations due to mass loading by stored rainfall and subsequent rebound but with much smaller magnitude, suggesting different hydrological loading effects. From the time-series amplitude information on terrain upslope of the headscarp, we also re-evaluate the incipient motion related to the 2008 Greenleaf Basin rock avalanche, not previously recognized by traditional SAR/InSAR methods. The approach used in this study can be used to identify active landslides in forested terrain, to track the seasonal movement of landslides, and to identify previously unknown landslide hazards.

Field-based phenotyping platforms are being evaluated for their ability to deliver the necessary throughput for large scale experiments and to provide an accurate depiction of trait performance in real-world environments. We developed a dual-camera high throughput phenotyping (HTP) platform on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and collected time course multispectral images for large scale soybean [Glycine max (L) Merr.] breeding trials. We used a supervised machine learning model (Random Forest) to measure crop geometric features and obtained high correlations with final yield in breeding populations (r = 0.82). The traditional yield estimation model was significantly improved by incorporating plot row length as covariate (p < 0.01). We developed a binary prediction model from time-course multispectral HTP image data and achieved over 93% accuracy in classifying soybean maturity. This prediction model was validated in an independent breeding trial with a different plot type. These results show that multispectral data collected from the UAV-based HTP platform could improve yield estimation accuracy and maturity recording efficiency in a modern soybean breeding program.

However, additional lidar dimensions offer the possibility to transcend basic 3-D mapping capabilities, including i) the physical time (t) dimension from repeat lidar acquisition and ii) laser return intensity (LRIK) data dimension based on the brightness of single- or multi-wavelength (lambda) laser returns. The additional dimensions thus add to the x,y, and z dimensions to constitute the five dimensions of lidar (x.y,z, t, lambda n). This broader spectrum of lidar dimensionality has already revealed new insights across multiple EES topics, and will enable a wide range of new research and applications. Here, we review recent advances based on repeat lidar collections and analysis of LRI data to highlight novel applications of lidar remote sensing beyond 3-D. Our review outlines the potential and current challenges of time and LRI information from lidar sensors to expand the scope of research applications and insights across the full range of EES applications.

The conception of LDCM to the reality of Landsat 8 followed an arduous path extending over nearly 13 years, but the successful launch on February 11, 2013 ensures the continuity of the unparalleled Landsat record. The USGS took over mission operations on May 30, 2013 and renamed LCDM to Landsat 8. Access to Landsat 8 data was opened to users worldwide. Three years following launch we evaluate the science and applications impact of Landsat 8. With a mission objective to enable the detection and characterization of global land changes at a scale where differentiation between natural and human-induced causes of change is possible, LDCM promised incremental technical improvements in capabilities needed for Landsat scientific and applications investigations. Results show that with Landsat 8, we are acquiring more data than ever before, the radiometric and geometric quality of data are generally technically superior to data acquired by past Landsat missions, and the new measurements, e.g., the coastal aerosol and cirrus bands, are opening new opportunities. Collectively, these improvements are sparking the growth of science and applications opportunities. Equally important, with Landsat 7 still operational, we have returned to global imaging on an 8-day cycle, a capability that ended when Landsat 5 ceased operational Earth imaging in November 2011. As a result, the Landsat program is on secure footings and planning is underway to extend the record for another 20 or more years.

Four wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars with different degrees of O-3-tolerance were grown under an elevated O-3 concentration (E-O-3) in fully open-air field conditions for two consecutive growth seasons from 2012 to 2013. The aim was to find sensitive hyperspectral indictors for real-time detection of O-3 effects. The results showed that E-O-3 caused a significant decrease in leaf thickness and pigment concentrations, resulting in a change in leaf reflectance. The effects of E-O-3 on both physiological variables and reflectance characteristics were wheat cultivar-specific, with a greater and earlier O-3 effect found in the O-3-sensitive wheat cultivars than in the O-3-tolerant cultivars. Spectral indices that were previously developed to detect leaf biological variables were examined, and highly correlated relations were found between the chlorophyll content and the three spectral parameters ND705, mND(705) and R-550. with Pearson r values of 0.896, 0.892 and -0.872, respectively. When independently determined data from 2013 were used to test the derived equations, the coefficients (R-2) of correlation between the measured and estimated chlorophyll were 0.817 (ND705), 0.833 (mND(705)) and 0.776 (R-550): the root mean square errors (RMSE) were 0.227 (ND705), 0.228 (mND(705)) and 0.254 (R-550) (mg kg(-1)); and the mean relative errors (RE) were 8.7% (ND705), 8.1% (mND(705)) and 9.1% (R-550). Furthermore, O-3-induced changes in the three optical parameters were in accordance with the leaf chlorophyll responses in wheat. Our study suggested that the reflectance indices mND(705), ND705 and R-550, especially the former two spectral indices that contained information from several bands, could help to support the diagnosis and real-time monitoring of O-3 induced damage in wheat. To estimate the wheat yield accurately using the selected spectral indices, the filling stage was found to be the best time for measuring canopy reflectance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

An empirical method to estimate and correct the time independent systematic errors from resampled quasi L2 SMOS SSS is presented. The method is based on self-consistency hypothesis of long term (July 2010-June 2014) variability of SMOS SSS among SMOS dwell-lines and orbit orientation (ascending and descending). The bias correction is performed by first adjusting SSS relative variations among dwell-lines and orbits orientation and then by determining a mean correction over four years. A reference time series of SSS and the associated relative systematic error for each dwell-line and orbit orientation is estimated using a least square approach. Then, the 4-year mean value of corrected SMOS SSS is adjusted relative to a 4-year mean in situ data climatology.   Four years of salinity maps mitigated from systematic errors are presented. Independent validation using in situ thermosalinograph SSS from ships of opportunity is presented. The new SMOS bias corrected SSS over the global ocean shows an improvement of 32% of the RMSD.

It has been suggested that the use of L-band SAR may alleviate this concern given increased penetration depths at longer wavelengths; however, this has not been thoroughly assessed. Here the separability of FYI and MYI is compared using horizontally polarized (HH) C-band (RADARSAT-2) and L-band (ALOS/PALSAR) ScanSAR images acquired over landfast sea ice in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago in the spring and summer of 2009. L-band provided enhanced contrast between FYI and MW during early melt onset and during the drainage phase of advanced melt, while C-band was found to provide enhanced contrast when the wet snowpack was transitioning from the pendular regime to the funicular regime. At the time of the pendular-funicular transition, the backscatter signatures of FYI and MYI reversed at both C- and L-band. This behavior is well established at C-band, but has not been reported previously at L-band. The L-band imagery also provided improved definition of floe boundaries and ridges throughout the melt season. Finally, the L-band data had reduced speckle (equivalent number of looks similar to 12), relative to the C-band data (-9 equivalent looks). These results indicate that L-band SAR data acquired during the melt season could be used to enhance operational and scientific sea ice information products that have traditionally been derived from single-frequency C-band SAR data.

Total suspended matter (TSM) derived from the discharge of sediment-laden rivers is highly variable over a wide range of time and space scales. In the present study, the first use of remote sensing to monitor the river TSM plume was conducted to investigate the effects of heavy rainfall events on Lake Taihu by the largest inflowing river (Tiaoxi River) based on a calibrated and validated model using daily 250 m MODIS imagery in band 1 (620-670 nm). From 2004 to 2013, 48 MODIS images of 20 heavy rainfall events were obtained, showing that the area of the TSM plume significantly increased in the waters adjacent to the inflowing river, reflecting runoff input. The TSM concentration of the river plume after heavy rainfall was significantly higher than that before rainfall (ANOVA, p < 0.001). A significantly positive correlation between the TSM plume area and the rainfall amount in heavy rainfall events (p < 0.01) was also observed. The heaviest rainfall event, in October 2013, caused a river plume with an area of 302.8 km(2), which lasted for more than 10 days. The significant increase in the frequency and rainfall amount of rainstorms and large rain in the past 50 years (1965-2014) in Lake Taihu under global warming indicated an important role of remote sensing in monitoring the river plume resulting from heavy precipitation. The present study demonstrates that remote sensing tools can be valuable instruments in the detection and tracking of the effect of heavy rainfall events on the distribution and diffusion of the TSM concentration in the lake. The results obtained from the present study are valuable for further hydrological research on the Tiaoxi River, particularly for the immediate assessment of flood impacts on soil erosion of the catchment.

We characterized optical classes or optical water types (OWTs) from remotely sensed data and determined the temporal and spatial distribution of the OWTs. OWT distributions were interpreted through their inherent optical properties (IOPs) and physical drivers. Five identified OWTs based on spectrally normalized remote sensing reflectance imagery from the MODIS-Aqua mission revealed a gradient between class-specific IOPs for colored dissolved organic matter absorption (a(CDOM)) and particulate backscattering (b(bp)). The clearest OWT displayed widespread prominence over the lake and within and across years, indicating strongly stable physical dynamics including stratification and permanent circulation patterns. The most optically complex OWT (highest a(CDOM) and b(bp)) followed more stochastic dynamics coinciding with localized runoff and mixing events. OWTs with intermediate optical complexity delineated river outflow plumes, upwelling, and annual lake wide turnover events while revealing annual and biannual harmonic patterns. OWTs verified both previously observed and unobserved dynamics in Lake Superior, demonstrating a valuable utility to characterize spatio-temporal, optical, and biogeochemical variability.

To retrieve SM from L-band radiometric observations, two significant effects have to be accounted for, namely soil roughness and vegetation optical depth. In this study, soil roughness effects on retrieved SM values were evaluated using brightness temperatures acquired by the L-band ELBARA-II radiometer, over a vineyard field at the Valencia Anchor Station (VAS) site during the year 2013. Different combinations of the values of the model parameters used to account for soil roughness effects (H-R, Q(R), N-RH and N-RV) in the L-MEB model were evaluated. The L-MEB model (L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere) is the forward radiative transfer model used in the SMOS soil moisture retrieval algorithm. In this model, HR parameterizes the intensity of roughness effects, Q(R) accounts for polarization effects, and N-RH and N-RV parameterize the variations of the soil reflectivity as a function of the observation angle, theta, respectively for both H (Horizontal) and V (Vertical) polarizations. These evaluations were made by comparing in-situ measurements of SM (used here as a reference) against SM retrievals derived from tower-based ELBARA-II brightness temperatures mentioned above. The general retrieval approach consists of the inversion of L-MEB. Two specific configurations were tested: the classical 2-Parameter (2-P) retrieval configuration where SM and T-NAD (vegetation optical depth at nadir) are retrieved, and a 3-Parameter (3-P) configuration, accounting for the additional effects of the vineyard vegetation structure.   Using the 2-P configuration, it was found that setting N-Rp (p = H or V) equals to 1 provided the best SM estimations in terms of correlation and unbiased Root Mean Square Error (ubRMSE). The assumption N-RV = N-RH = -1 simplifies the L-MEB retrieval, since the two parameters Two and H-R can then be grouped and retrieved as a single parameter (method here defined as the Simplified Retrieval Method (SRP)). The main advantage of the SRP method is that it is not necessary to calibrate H-R before performing the SM retrievals. Using the 3-P configuration, the results improved, with respect to SM retrievals, in terms of correlation and ubRMSE, as the structural characteristics of the vineyards were better accounted for. However, this method still requires the calibration of H-R, a disadvantage for operational applications. Finally, it was found that the use of in-situ roughness measurements to calibrate the roughness model parameters did not provide significant improvements in the SM retrievals as compared to the SRP method.

This human- and partially nature-induced ground deformation has gradually threatened the stability of urban infrastructure and caused the loss of wetland habitat along the Gulf of Mexico. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques can measure ground motions in high spatial resolution over large coverage. The purpose of this study is to map the spatial and temporal variations in surface deformation around the HG region using a Multi-Temporal InSAR (MTI) technique and to assess the role of fluid withdrawal (groundwater withdrawal and hydrocarbon extraction), salt tectonics, and fault activity in land surface deformation. MTI-derived land surface deformation measurements are then compared to GPS and extensometer observations, geologic and hydrologic data, and information about hydrocarbon extraction to address the causes of the observed deformation. The MTI measurements based on ERS-1/2 datasets have mapped regional subsidence up to 53 mm/yr in the northwestern HG as well as a slight uplift at 20 mm/yr in the southeastern HG from 1993 to 2000. InSAR measurements obtained from Envisat and ALOS data reveal subsidence rate of up to 30 mm/yr over the northwestern HG between 2004 and 2011. Our results indicate that the pattern of ground deformation was nearly concentric around locations of intense groundwater withdrawal and the spatial extent of the subsiding area has been shrinking and migrating toward the northeast after 2000. We have resolved localized ground subsidence cones over hydrocarbon exploration fields, which were likely caused by reservoir compaction. We have differentiated ground surface deformation over salt domes, which was due to ongoing differential movement of individual salt spines. We have identified 5-40 mm/yr differential subsidence across a number of faults in the region. These faults functioned as water barriers disrupting the integrity of ground water flow and aggravating localized surface displacements.

For example, EESMs often rely on leaf-scale or literature-derived estimates for a key determinant of canopy photosynthesis, the maximum velocity of RuBP carboxylation (V-cmax, mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Our recent work (Ainsworth et al., 2014; Serbin et al., 2012) showed that reflectance spectroscopy could be used to estimate V-cmax at the leaf level. Here, we present evidence that imaging spectroscopy data can be used to simultaneously predict V-cmax and its sensitivity to temperature (E-V) at the canopy scale. In 2013 and 2014, high-altitude Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectroscopy (AVIRIS) imagery and contemporaneous ground-based assessments of canopy structure and leaf photosynthesis were acquired across an array of monospecific agroecosystems in central and southern California, USA. A partial least-squares regression (PLSR) modeling approach was employed to characterize the pixel-level variation in canopy V-cmax (at a standardized canopy temperature of 30 degrees C) and E-V, based on visible and shortwave infrared AVIRIS spectra (414-2447 nm). Our approach yielded parsimonious models with strong predictive capability for V-cmax (at 30 degrees C) and E-V (R-2 of withheld data = 0.94 and 0.92, respectively), both of which varied substantially in the field (>= 1.7 fold) across the sampled crop types. The models were applied to additional AVIRIS imagery to generate maps of V-cmax and E-V, as well as their uncertainties, for agricultural landscapes in California. The spatial patterns exhibited in the maps were consistent with our in-situ observations. These findings highlight the considerable promise of airborne and, by implication, space-borne imaging spectroscopy, such as the proposed HyspIRI mission, to map spatial and temporal variation in key drivers of photosynthetic metabolism in terrestrial vegetation.

The proposed method contains elements of active learning and includes classifier to analyst queries. The spectral transition zone between two thematic classes (i.e., where training labels of different classes overlap in feature space) is targeted through iterative training derivation. Three partition categories are defined: pure, indivisible and unlabeled. Pure partitions contain training labels from only one class, indivisible partitions contain training data from different classes, and unlabeled partitions do not contain training data. A minimum spectral tolerance threshold defines the smallest partition volume to avoid over-fitting. In this way the transition zones between class distributions are minimized, thereby maximizing both the spectral volume of pure partitions in the feature space and the number of pure pixels in the classified image. The classification results are displayed to show each classified pixel\'s partition category (pure, unlabeled and indivisible). Mapping pixels belonging to unlabeled partitions serves as a query from the classifier to the analyst, targeting spectral regions absent of training data. The classification process is repeated until significant improvement of the classification is no longer realized or when no classification errors and unlabeled pixels are left. Variably-sized partitions lead to intensive training data derivation in the spectral transition zones between the target classes. The methodology is demonstrated for surface water and permanent snow and ice classifications using 30 m conterminous United States Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) data time series from 2006 to 2010. The surface water result was compared with Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) water body and National Land Cover Database (NLCD) open water classes with an overall agreement greater than 99% and Kappa coefficient greater than 0.9 in both of cases. In addition, the surface water result was compared with a classification generated using the same input data and a standard bagged Classification and Regression Tree (CART) classifier.

Satellite remote sensing is the only way to estimate R-s at both global and regional scales. Many efforts have been made to evaluate the accuracy of current R-s products generated from satellite observations, but only a limited amount of ground measurements was generally used and the individual satellite products were used for analyzing R-s variability. In this study, four satellite estimates of R-s, including the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment - Surface Radiation Budget (GEWEX-SRB V3.0), the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project - Flux Data (ISCCP-FD), the University of Maryland (UMD)/Shortwave Radiation Budget (SRB) (UMD-SRB V3.33) product, and the Earth\'s Radiant Energy System (CERES) EBAF, were evaluated using comprehensive ground measurements at 1151 sites around the world from the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA) and the China Meteorological Administration (CMA). It was found that these satellite estimates of R-s agree better with surface measurements at monthly than at daily time scale and can capture the seasonal variation of R-s very well, but these satellite products overestimated R-s by approximately 10w m(-2). The mean bias and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the monthly mean estimates from these four data sets were 10.2 w m(-2) and 24.8 w m(-2) respectively. The global annual mean values of R-s were 186.7 w m(-2), 185.4 w m(-2), and 188.6 w m(-2) for CERES-EBAF, ISCCP-FD, and GEWEX-SRB V3.0 respectively. The averaged global annual mean R-s value from ground-measured-calibrated three satellite derived R-s products was 180.6 w m(-2), which is smaller than that estimated from individual satellite-derived products. The CERES-EBAF product shows the best accuracy among these four data sets, which indicates that including more accurate cloud information from active instruments can improve the accuracy of R-s. These satellite products show different temporal trends. Both GEWEX-SRB V3.0 and ISCCP-FD showed similar trends at the global scale but with different magnitudes. A significant dimming was found between 1984 and 1991, followed by brightening from 1992 to 2000, and then by a significant dimming over 2001-2007. The CERES-EBAF product showed a brightening trend, but not significantly since 2000. The variability from satellite estimates at pixel level was also analyzed. The results are comparable with previous studies based on observed R-s at the surface for specific regions, although some inconsistencies still exist and the magnitudes of the variations should be further quantified. We also found that clouds contribute more to the long-term variations of R-s derived from satellite observations than aerosols. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this sensitive ecosystem, minor increases in woody plant biomass may induce significant changes in ecosystem structure and function. However, establishing methods for quantifying and potentially scaling woody plant biomass in low-stature biomes is challenging. In this study, we investigated the potential to use terrestrial laser scanning (US) to remotely estimate harvested biomass and leaf area of two dominant low-stature (<1.5 m tall) Arctic shrub species in 0.64 m(2) subplots established in northern Alaskan tundra. We explored two biomass estimation approaches (volumetric surface differencing and voxel counting) applied to point clouds obtained from close-range (2 m) and variable-range (<50 m) terrestrial laser scans. Relationships between harvested biomass and TB metrics were strong for all combinations of approaches, with voxel counting giving a marginally better result than surface differencing for close-range data (R-2 = 0.94 vs 0.92; RMSE = 102 g vs 117 g) and surface differencing proving stronger than voxel counting for variable-range data (R-2 = 0.91 vs 0.82; RMSE = 119 g vs 169 g). Strong relationships between total harvested biomass and total leaf dry mass (R-2 = 0.93; RMSE = 13.4 g), and between leaf dry mass and leaf wet area (R-2 = 0.99; RMSE = 9.01 cm(2)) justify estimation of shrub leaf area from TLS-derived shrub biomass. Our results show that rapidly acquired, repeatable terrestrial laser scans taken at multiple ranges can be processed using simple biomass estimation approaches to yield aboveground biomass and leaf area estimates for low-stature shrubs at fine spatial scales (sub-meter to similar to 50 meters) with the fidelity required to monitor small but ecologically meaningful changes in tundra structure. Further, these data may be employed as ground reference data for broader scale remote sensing data collection, such as airborne LiDAR scanning, that would enable shrub biomass and leaf-area estimates at fine spatial resolution over large spatial extents.

Satellite-based diagnostic models, which use satellite images and/or climate data as input, are widely used to estimate GPP. Many models used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to estimate the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) by vegetation canopy (FPAR(canopy)) and GPP. Recently, the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) has been increasingly used to estimate the fraction of PAR absorbed by chlorophyll (FPAR(chl)) or green leaves (FPAR(green)) and to provide more accurate estimates of GPP in such models as the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), Temperature and Greenness (TG) model, Greenness and Radiation (GR) model, and Vegetation Index (VI) model. Although these EVI-based models perform well under non-drought conditions, their performances under severe droughts are unclear. In this study, we run the four EVI-based models at three AmeriFlux sites (rainfed soybean, irrigated maize, and grassland) during drought and non-drought years to examine their sensitivities to drought. As all the four models use EVI for FPAR estimate, our hypothesis is that their different sensitivities to drought are mainly attributed to the ways they handle light use efficiency CLUE), especially water stress. The predicted GPP from these four models had a good agreement with the GPP estimated from eddy flux tower in non-drought years with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) in the order of 2.17 (VPM), 2.47 (VI), 2.85 (GR) and 3.10 g C m(-2) day(-1) (TG). But their performances differed in drought years, the VPM model performed best, followed by the VI, GR and TG, with the RMSEs of 1.61, 232, 3.16 and 3.90 g C m(-2) day-1 respectively. TG and GR models overestimated seasonal sum of GPP by 20% to 61% in rainfed sites in drought years and also overestimated or underestimated GPP in the irrigated site. This difference in model performance under severe drought is attributed to the fact that the VPM uses satellite-based Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) to address the effect of water stress (deficit) on LUE and GPP, while the other three models do not have such a mechanism. This study suggests that it is essential for these models to consider the effect of water stress on GPP, in addition to using EVI to estimate FPAR, if these models are applied to estimate GPP under drought conditions.

The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system is a dominant source of interannual climate variability in the western United States, with important effects on temperature, precipitation, and drought. In this study, we examine the connection between ENSO and terrestrial vegetation dynamics using MOD17 annual net primary productivity (NPP) and land surface phenology derived from MODIS and AVHRR vegetation indices. Three phenology metrics-start of growing season (SOS), end of growing season (EOS), and length of growing season (LOS)-were estimated separately for El Nino and La Nina years by fitting difference logistic functions to split-sample time series of the MODIS enhanced vegetation index (for the period 2000-2011) and AVHRR-derived 3rd generation GIMMS NDVI (NDVI3g) for two temporal periods (2000-2011 and 1982-2011). El Nino events were associated with a significantly earlier SOS than La Nina events in most regions of the western U.S. ENSO-related differences in timing of the end of growing season were generally smaller and more heterogeneous. ENSO impacts on total length of the growing season tended to be spatially heterogeneous but mostly positive in El Nino years. Relative to La Nina events, El Nino events were generally associated with significantly higher NPP in each ecoregion (with mean differences ranging from 2 to 45 gC m(-2) year(-1)). The correlation between total annual production and the Southern Oscillation Index was highest in mid- to late-winter prior to the growing season, suggesting some predictive power in advance of the growing season. These results suggest that future intensification of the ENSO system could have serious consequences for terrestrial ecosystems in the western U.S., especially in regions where ENSO already has a strong impact on interannual climate variability and vegetation dynamics.

Taking the advantage of phytoplankton communities having distinct optical properties, this study presents a new model to explicitly detect and differentiate between three phytoplankton size-classes namely, picophytoplankton, nanophytoplankton, and microphytoplankton, based on distinct differences in the optical signatures of these phytoplankton groups in a wide variety of coastal and oceanic waters. The model is based on the assumption that there is a significant relationship between chlorophyll-a concentration, and total as well as the size-fractioned absorption coefficients of phytoplankton. The new model is validated using three different in-situ datasets collected from a wide variety of locations in the global and regional oceans (including turbid coastal and eutrophic waters) and its results are further compared with those of the existing two- and three-component models. The new model performs better than other models in terms of yielding more accurate estimates of the total and size-dependent phytoplankton absorption coefficients across the entire visible wavelengths. Since satellite observation of \'ocean color\' as detected by a remote sensor provides an estimate of the chlorophyll-a concentration, commonly used as an index of phytoplankton biomass, the new model is also applied to regional and global images of seasonal climatology over a decade of satellite ocean color observations provided by the MODIS-Aqua sensor. When applied to the MODIS-Aqua images of the Arabian Sea dominated by spatially intense algal blooms, the present model is generally excellent at predicting and describing the spatial distribution of these phytoplankton groups within cyclonic eddies and adjacent regions in the Arabian Sea. Conversely, size-fractioned phytoplankton absorption coefficients derived from global images of seasonal climatology are found to vary depending on the season and ocean basin. These global images imply that when phytoplankton abundance increases, larger size-classes are added incrementally to a background of smaller cells. Further examination of these data showed that picophytoplankton population is generally low, although dominating a major part of the surface ocean during summer and winter. Nanophytoplankton and microphytoplankton populations are high in surface waters of the North and South Atlantic, North and South Pacific Oceans, Arabian Sea, and equatorial region, showing an increasing trend in summer and a decreasing trend in winter in each hemisphere. These results suggest that the new model is an important tool which will inspire further research to investigate different phytoplankton size classes and their variability on regional and global scales.

New models were developed using an area-based approach to predict wood volume, stem volume, aboveground biomass, and basal-area across a wide range of canopy structures, sites and LiDAR characteristics. This new modeling approach does not adopt standard approaches of stepwise regression using a series of height metrics derived from airborne LiDAR. Rather, it used four metrics describing complementary 3D structural aspects of the stand canopy. The first three metrics were related to mean canopy height, height heterogeneity, and horizontal canopy distribution. A fourth metric was calculated as the coefficient of variation of the leaf area density profile. This fourth metric provided information on understory vegetation. The models that were developed with the four structural metrics provided higher estimation accuracy on stand attributes than models using height metrics alone, while also avoiding data over-fitting. Overall, the models provided prediction error levels ranging from 12.4% to 24.2%, depending upon forest type and stand attribute. The more homogeneous coniferous stand provided the highest estimation accuracy. Estimation errors were significantly reduced in mixed forest when separate models were developed for individual stand types (coniferous, mixed and deciduous stands) instead of a general model for all stand types. Model robustness was also evaluated in leaf-off and leaf-on conditions where both conditions provided similar estimation errors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Without reliable cropland-pasture separation it will be impossible to retrieve high-quality information on agricultural expansion or land use intensification, and on related ecosystem service provision. In this context, the savanna biome is critically important, but information on land use and land cover (LULC) is notoriously inaccurate in these areas. This is due to pronounced spatial-temporal dynamics of agricultural land use and spectral similarities between cropland, pasture, and natural savanna vegetation. In this study, we investigated the potential to reliably separate cropland, pasture, natural savanna vegetation, and other relevant land cover classes employing Landsat-derived spectral-temporal variability metrics for a savanna landscape in the Brazilian Cerrado. In order to better understand the surplus value and limitations of spectral-temporal variability metrics for classification purposes, we analyzed four datasets of different temporal depth, using 344 Landsat scenes across four footprints between 2009 and 2012. Our results showed a reliable separation between cropland, pasture, and natural savanna vegetation achieving an adjusted overall accuracy of 93%. A similar accuracy and spatial consistency of LULC classification could not be achieved based on spectral information alone, indicating the high additional value of temporal information for identifying LULC classes in the complex land use systems of savanna landscapes. There is great potential for transferring our approach to other savanna systems which still suffer from inaccurate LULC information. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

For this reason, the main objective of this study was to investigate the potential of the combined use of active and passive microwave signatures to improve the understanding of emission and scattering mechanisms over land. The discrete scattering model developed by the Tor Vergata University, driven by a single set of input parameters, was used to simulate both emission and backscattering. The model accuracy was assessed by comparing modelled emissivity, multiplied by the effective temperature, with C-band AQUA AMSR-E observations and modelled backscattering coefficient with Metop ASCAT observations. The investigation was carried out using datasets collected over the Maqu area, which is located in the north-eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau and is covered by homogeneous grassland with a thin litter layer. In situ soil moisture measurements and MODIS Terra/Aqua 8-days LAI products served as model inputs, whereas the most sensitive other parameters, such as surface roughness and litter and vegetation parameters, were calibrated to obtain the best match between modelled outputs and both ASCAT and AMSR-E 2009 observations. With the calibrated parameters, measured soil moisture and MODIS LAI as input, the model correctly simulated the temporal variations of ASCAT backscattering coefficient, with R-2 of 0.9 and rinse of 0.5 dB. The results obtained in the passive case strongly depended on the adopted effective temperature. The best thatch with satellite observations was found when the surface temperature was obtained from Ka-band AMSR-E data, leading to R-2 of 0.8 and rinse of 6K for H polarisation data and R-2 of 0.5 and rinse of 6K for v polarisation data.   The validation carried out using the 2010 data, without any further refinement of the calibrated parameters, showed a slightly worse agreement between modelled and observed signatures.   The results showed that the combined use of active and passive microwave signatures contributed to an unambiguous interpretation of emission and scattering processes over the study area, it allowed us to impose constraints to non-available inputs of the Tor Vergata model and it led to correct simulations of the satellite signatures. These findings are important to better understand the potential of the synergistic use of radiometer and radar data, like those to be provided by NASA\'s SMAP. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

First, a PC index (PCI) is defined as remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs, sr(-1)) at 620 nm normalized against a baseline formed linearly between Rrs(560) and Rrs(665). Because PC has a local absorption peak at similar to 620 nm, PCI is shown in both theory and model simulations to exhibit a monotonic functional relationship with PC concentration. Field measurements also support this hypothesis, from which an empirical algorithm is developed to estimate PC concentrations between similar to 1 and 300 mu g/L with unbiased RMS uncertainties of 58%. Radiative transfer simulations further show that such a field-based algorithm can be applied directly to MERIS Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (Rrc) after adjusting algorithm coefficients. Spectral analyses and image comparisons indicate that such an algorithm is nearly immune to perturbations from thick aerosols, thin clouds, significant sun glint, and extreme water turbidity. Mean usable data coverage increases from <1% to >50% when using Rrc as compared to Rrs processed using standard atmospheric correction algorithms in SeaDAS. The robust algorithm performance and significantly improved data coverage lead to the establishment of a long-term (2002-2012) time-series of PC concentrations in Taihu Lake, which show both seasonal and inter-annual changes. Test of the algorithm over other lakes, including Dianchi Lake (a typical plateau lake of China), suggests that the same band-subtraction approach might be applicable to other inland water bodies, although local bio-optical conditions due to different sediment and phytoplanlcton compositions need to be considered when applying such an empirical approach.

Canopy profiles were derived from lidar data using the MacArthur-Horn transformation and from field data using a model we developed that uses two sets of allometric equations describing crown shape and tree height and a third from raw field data. We conducted a statistical comparison of seven asynchronous relative vegetation profiles (RVP) derived from different methodologies between the years of 2005 and 2012. We compared three airborne lidar datasets, three modeled profiles from field data, and one terrestrial lidar dataset using pairwise Mantel tests, multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP) and a permutation-based comparison using a similarity index for within plot comparisons. We used the results of MRPP to determine possible drivers of poor agreement between instruments and models and found a moderate relationship between within-plot variability (observed delta) and estimated above ground biomass (r(2) = 0.273, p < 0.05), which we attribute to poor model performance on low density/low biomass plots. In addition, correlation analysis of height metrics derived from RVPs resulted in weak correlations at low height percentiles and strong correlations at higher percentiles. Overall, we identified general similarity between lidar profiles using MRPP (lidar only A = 0.202, p < 0.001), but poorer agreement between lidar and modeled profiles (all profiles A = 0.076, p < 0.001). We attribute some of these differences to selection of canopy profile models and to approaches used for accounting for canopy occlusion in lidar transformations. In addition, we discuss the possibility of using Mantel tests to estimate temporal scales of vertical structure change in La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Few studies so far have dealt with monitoring of straw and litter degradation during the dry season over large areas while they are important fodder for livestock sustainability. MODIS band combinations (NBAR collection 5) were tested against a set of field measurements carried out over 20 rangeland sites from 2004 to 2011 in the Sahel. The best empirical linear models were obtained for indices using MODIS bands in the shortwave infrared domain (Band 6 centered at 1.6 mu m, Band 7 centered at 2.1 mu m), in particular with the Soil Tillage Index (STI). STI explained 66% of the variance of dry masses (Mass = 3158(STI - 1.05), r(2) = 0.66, RMSE = 280 kg DM/ha, n = 232) for dry and intermediate season data. A regression is also proposed for year-round data (Mass = 3371(STI - 1.06), r(2) = 0.67, RMSE = 352 kg DM/ha, n = 536). The strong inter-site and inter-annual variabilitieswere well captured and the decay rate was found consistent with grazing intensity and fire occurrence. The results imply that the STI can be applied to monitor the mass of dry tissues in the Sahel and potentially in many semi-arid areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Lake levels are directly and indirectly affected by meteorological variations and are both indicators for and caused by water management. Therefore, it is important to monitor the changes of water levels in lakes. As an alternative to water level gauges, satellite radar altimetry is an established method. The problem of radar altimetry so far is that it only gives reliable lake levels for relatively large lakes. The recent Cryosat mission passes many lakes in the so-called SARIn mode at improved along-track resolution. Still, the accuracy and robustness of standard level 2 is limited due to pollution of the waveform by surrounding land topography. We propose to actively extract the water surface component by a novel retracking method based on cross-correlation of observed level 1b waveforms with a generic simulated waveform. Different scatterers will result in different cross-correlation solutions, but, as the water level is contributing to each consecutive waveform, it can efficiently be extracted by a majority voting scheme. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed retracker, we compared the estimated lake levels with accurate Jason-2 estimates over Lake Nasser in Egypt. The proposed retracking algorithm performs better than the level 2 product, and has a RMS of differences with Jason-2 lake levels of 0.30 m. The remaining differences with Jason-2 data are correlated to the amount of topographic pollution, but also show some remaining surface slope artifact. By using the proposed method, one can optimally profit from Cryosat measurements for lake level measurements. Not only can we retrieve lake levels closer to the shore, but due to its dense ground track spacing (7-8 km at the Equator) it is possible to estimate lake levels over many more lakes than with other altimeters. Cryosat lake level estimates are therefore a promising extension of existing time series as measured by notably Envisat, Jason-1 & 2 and GFO.

Twenty AISA flight-lines were radiometrically leveled and merged to form a 10 x 20 km mosaic, which then served to generate a simulated spaceborne EnMAP scene (30 m spatial resolution) using the End-to-End Simulation Tool to assess the sensors mapping capabilities. Spatial Spectral Endmember Extraction was used to derivespectral endmembers for the AISA and EnIVIAP data. Image endmembers were compared with spectral measurements of field samples to assess how well key rock types were represented. Results show that the AISA imagery provided a better representation of mafic and ultramafic rock types compared with the EnMAP simulation. Endmembers were then used to map the distribution of geological materials using Iterative Spectral Mixture Analysis. Results indicate the airborne data provided more detailed maps compared with EnMAP simulated data. However, EnMAP data could still discriminate and map broad scale lithological units, specifically mafic and ultramafic rocks. This study demonstrates the feasibility of EnMAP to provide large scale reconnaissance mapping capability of geologic materials over vast subarctic and arctic regions (potentially 30 x 5000 km of imagery per day) using expert knowledge combined with automated spectral analysis methods.

When restoring these fire-suppressed forests, managers often try to reproduce these structures to increase ecosystem resilience. We examined unburned and burned forest structures for 1937 0.81 ha sample areas in Yosemite National Park, USA. We estimated severity for fires from 1984 to 2010 using the Landsat-derived Relativized differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) and measured openings and canopy clumps in five height strata using airborne LiDAR data. Because our study area lacked concurrent field data, we identified methods to allow structural analysis using LiDAR data alone. We found three spatial structures, canopy-gap, clump-open, and open, that differed in spatial arrangement and proportion of canopy and openings. As fire severity increased, the total area in canopy decreased while the number of clumps increased, creating a patchwork of openings and multistory tree clumps. The presence of openings >0.3 ha, an approximate minimum gap size needed to favor shade-intolerant pine regeneration, increased rapidly with loss of canopy area. The range and variation of structures for a given fire severity were specific to each forest type. Low- to moderate-severity fires best replicated the historic clump-opening patterns that were common in forests with frequent fire regimes. Our results suggest that managers consider the following goals for their forest restoration: 1) reduce total canopy cover by breaking up large contiguous areas into variable-sized tree clumps and scattered large individual trees; 2) create a range of opening sizes and shapes, including similar to 50% of the open area in gaps >0.3 ha; 3) create multistory clumps in addition to single story clumps; 4) retain historic densities of large trees; and 5) vary treatments to include canopy-gap, clump-open, and open mosaics across project areas to mimic the range of patterns found for each forest type in our study.

We tested our approach with a preliminary uncertainty assessment over the forested areas of California spanning a broad range of climatic and land-use conditions and find our AGB estimates to be comparable to estimates of AGB from inventory records and other available satellite-estimated AGB maps at aggregated scales.

Currently, neither ecosystem carbon uptake (through photosynthesis) nor ecosystem carbon release (through respiration) can be measured directly during the daytime. Instead, flux-tower measurements rely on nighttime respiration based on the assumption of zero carbon uptake which are then projected to daytime using an exponential relationship to soil temperature at shallow soil depth. As an alternative to this approach, R could possibly also be determined from combining daytime eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem production (NEP) and spectral observations of gross primary production (GPP). In previous work, we have shown that multi-angular observations can be used to determine GPP from the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and spectrally obtained observations of light-use efficiency (epsilon). The difference of NEP and GPP suggests that daytime respiration is greater and more dynamic than conventional estimates derived from nighttime flux values. Our findings also suggest that an accelerated ecosystem metabolism results in an exponential increase in respiration which eventually diminishes net ecosystem production. Respiration was also closely related to air and soil temperature. We conclude that tower-level spectral measurements provide considerable new insights into ecosystem fluxes as they allow independent yet complementary measurements of different aspects of the carbon and energy cycle.

Our results suggest that the K-d(490) shows a large variation in the Eastern China Seas, ranging from 0.02 to 4.0 m(-1), with an average value of -0.17 m(-1). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

It also plays tremendous role in accurate retrieval of light use efficiency, which is essential for assessing vegetation health status. The main goal of this work was to study in detail relationships of fAPAR absorbed by photosynthetically active vegetation (fAPAR(green)) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for two crops with contrasting leaf structures (C3 vs. C4) and canopy architectures, using close range (6 m above the canopy) radiometric data and daily MODIS data taken during eight growing seasons over three irrigated and rainfed maize and soybean sites. Our specific goal was to understand differences in fAPAR(green)/NDVI relationship when crop canopy was almost vertically homogeneous (with respect to leaf area and leaf chlorophyll content), as in vegetative stage, and vertically heterogeneous as in reproduction stage. Firstly, we established fAPAR(green)/NDVI relationships for NDVI, taken at close range, and assessed noise equivalent of fAPAR(green) estimation by NDVI, and then we established relationships for NDVI retrieved from daily MODIS 250 m data. Daily MODIS data illuminated fine details of this relationship and detected effects of canopy heterogeneity on fAPAR(green)/NDVI relationship. In vegetative stage, the fAPAR/NDVI relationships for contrasting in leaf structures and canopy architectures crops were almost linear allowing accurate estimation of fAPAR(green) as it is below 0.7. However, very different fAPAR(green)/NDVI relationships in reproductive stages for both crops were observed, showing that canopy architecture and leaf structure greatly affect the relationship as leaf chlorophyll content changes and vertical distribution of chlorophyll content and green LAI inside the canopy becomes heterogeneous. We have found fine details of the fAPAR(green)/NDVI relationships with two types of hysteresis that prevent the use of a single relationship for fAPAR(green) estimation by NDVI over the whole growing season and suggested mechanisms for each type of hysteresis that should be further studied using radiative transfer models.

TSM concentrations and water-leaving reflectance measured on the coastal water surface in southern Gyeonggi Bay were used to develop an empirical TSM algorithm. TSM maps were generated from the GOCI images at hourly intervals to examine temporal variations in TSM concentrations. Validation of the maps (via comparisons with in situ measurements) showed that the empirical TSM algorithm had been effectively employed. A comparison with the MODIS-derived TSM concentration also supported the reliability of the maps. GOCI-derived TSM at 1-h intervals successfully represented hourly variations in TSM according to the tidal status. In conclusion, the temporal dynamics of sediment movement with the tidal cycle can be effectively estimated on the west coast of the Korean Peninsula using GOCI.

This paper introduces the current (2012-2017) Landsat Science Team\'s efforts to establish an initial understanding of Landsat 8 capabilities and the steps ahead in support of priorities identified by the team. Preliminary evaluation of Landsat 8 capabilities and identification of new science and applications opportunities are described with respect to calibration and radiometric characterization; surface reflectance; surface albedo; surface temperature, evapotranspiration and drought; agriculture; land cover, condition, disturbance and change; fresh and coastal water; and snow and ice. Insights into the development of derived \'higher-lever Landsat products are provided in recognition of the growing need for consistently processed, moderate spatial resolution, large area, long-term terrestrial data records for resource management and for climate and global change studies. The paper concludes with future prospects, emphasizing the opportunities for land imaging constellations by combining Landsat data with data collected from other international sensing systems, and consideration of successor Landsat mission requirements.

Metrics derived from linear regression models applied to high temporal resolution satellite data are commonly used to estimate rates of vegetation change. This approach implicitly assumes that vegetation changes gradually and linearly, which may not always be the case. In order to account for non-linear change in annual observations of vegetation from satellites, we test and apply a polynomial fitting-based scheme to annual GIMMS (Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies)-NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) observations for North Africa (including the Sahel) for the period 1982-2006. The scheme divides vegetation change into cubic, quadratic, linear, and \"concealed\" trend behaviors, the latter indicating that while no net change in vegetation amount has occurred over the period, the curve exhibits at least one minimum or/and maximum indicating that the vegetation has undergone change during the elapsed time period. Our results show that just over half the study area (51.9%) exhibit trends that are statistically significant, with a dominance of positive linear trends (22.2%) that are distributed in an east-west band across the Sahel, thus confirming previous studies. Non-linear trends occur much less frequently and are more widely scattered. Nevertheless, they tend to duster within or on the outskirts of zones of linear trend, underscoring their importance for detecting anomalous change features. We also show that the ratio of linear vs. non-linear trends tends to be associated with different land cover types/land cover change estimates, many of which reflect biome-level controls on vegetation dynamics. However, more local drivers related to direct human impact, such as urbanization, cannot be ruled out. Our change detection approach retains the more complex signatures embedded in long-term time series by preserving details about change rates, therefore allowing for a more subtle interpretation of change trajectories on a case-by-case basis. The fitting method is entirely automated and does not require the judicious selection of thresholds. However, while polynomials can give a better fit, they like linear models are based on assumptions, and may sometimes lead to oversimplification or miss short-term variations. Our method can help to contribute more accurate information to one of the major goals of the burgeoning field of land change science, namely to observe and monitor land changes underway throughout the world.

Therefore, K-d can be used as an index of water quality for coastal ecosystems that are dependent on photosynthesis, such as the coral reef environments of the Florida Reef Tract. Ultraviolet (UV) light reaching corals can lead to reductions in photosynthetic capacity as well as DNA damage. Unfortunately, field measurements of K-d(UV) lack sufficient spatial and temporal coverage to derive statistically meaningful patterns, and it has been notoriously difficult to derive K-d in optically shallow waters from remote sensing due to bottom contamination. Here we describe an approach to derive K-d(UV) in optically shallow waters of the Florida Keys using variations in the spectral shape of MODIS-derived surface reflectance. The approach used a principal component analysis and stepwise multiple regression to parsimoniously select modes of variance in MODIS-derived reflectance data that best explained variance in concurrent in situ K-d(UV) measurements. The resulting models for K-d(UV) retrievals in waters 1-30 m deep showed strong positive relationships between derived and measured parameters [e.g., for K-d(305) ranging from 0.28 to 3.27 m(-1); N = 29; R-2 = 0.94]. The predictive capabilities of these models were further tested, also showing acceptable performance [for K-d(305), R2 = 0.92; bias = -0.02 m(-1); URMS = 23%]. The same approach worked reasonably well in deriving the absorption coefficient of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in UV wavelengths [a(g)(UV), m(-1)], as K-d(UV) is dominated by ag(UV). Application of the approach to MODIS data showed different spatial and temporal K-d(305) patterns than the K-d(488) patterns derived from a recently validated semi-analytical approach, suggesting that different mechanisms are controlling K-d in the UV and in the visible. Given the importance of water clarity and light availability to shallow-water flora and fauna, the new K-d(UV) and ag(UV) data products provide unprecedented information for assessing and monitoring of coral reef health, and could further assist ongoing regional protection efforts.

However, surface velocities have been measured at only a few of these glaciers. Thus, it remains uncertain if and to what extent the glacier dynamics has changed over time and contributed to ice loss in these ice fields. In this study, we examine the temporal evolution of flow velocities and ice-front positions at eight major glaciers in the Southern Patagonian Ice Field (SPI; Hielo Patagonico Sur) by using Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) images from the Environmental Satellite (Envisat) launched in 2002 by the European Space Agency and Advanced Land Observation Satellite/Phased Array-type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS/PALSAR) data recorded from 2002 to 2011. The examined eight glaciers include Glaciar Jorge Montt, Occidental, Pio XI (or Briiggen), O\'Higgins, Viedma, Upsala, Perito Moreno, and Grey. Not all the glaciers revealed significant changes in frontal positions and flow velocities in the study period. We detected significant temporal velocity changes at Glaciar Upsala, Jorge Montt, Occidental, and Pio XI. Among these four glaciers, Glaciars Upsala, Jorge Montt, and Occidental revealed significant acceleration and terminus retreat and were undergoing dynamic-thinning. The markedly different absolute velocities but equally large longitudinal near-terminus stretching at the three glaciers support a calving model based on crevasse-depth criteria, which predict a calving position where crevasse-depths are equal to ice thickness; crevasse-depths are controlled by the longitudinal stretching rate. Meanwhile, Glaciar Pio XI revealed complex spatial and temporal evolution in surface velocities without significant retreat, and its dynamics remains enigmatic. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The core of the framework is an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) used to control crop model runs, assimilate remote sensing (RS) data and update model state variables. We modified the Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer - Cropping System Model (DSSAT-CSM)-Maize model (Jones et al., 2003) to be able to stop and start simulations at any given time in the growing season, such that the EnKF can update model state variables as RS data become available. The data assimilation-crop modeling framework was evaluated against 2003-2009 maize yields in Story County, Iowa, USA, assimilating AMSR-E soil moisture and MODIS-LAI data independently and simultaneously. Assimilating LAI or soil moisture independently slightly improved the correlation of observed and simulated yields (R = 0.51 and 0.50) compared to no data assimilation (open-loop; R = 0.47) but prediction errors improved with reductions in MBE and RMSE by 0.5 and 0.5 Mg ha(-1) respectively for LAI assimilation while these were reduced by 1.8 and 1.1 Mg ha(-1) for soil moisture assimilation. Yield correlation improved more when both soil moisture and LAI were assimilated (R = 0.65) suggesting a cause-effect interaction between soil moisture and LAI, prediction errors (MBE and RMSE) were also reduced by 1.7 and 1.8 Mg ha(-1) with respect to open-loop simulations. Results suggest that assimilation of LAI independently might be preferable when conditions are extremely wet while assimilation of soil moisture + LAI might be more suitable when conditions are more nominal. AMSR-E soil moisture tends to be more biased under the presence of high vegetation (i.e., when crops are fully developed) and that updating rootzone soil moisture by near-surface soil moisture assimilation under very wet conditions could increase the modeled percolation causing excessive nitrogen (N) leaching hence reducing crop yields even with water stress reduced at a minimum due to soil moisture assimilation. However, applying the data assimilation-crop modeling framework strategically by considering a-priori information on climate condition expected during the growing season may improve yield prediction performance substantially, in our case with higher correlation (R = 0.80) and more reductions in MBE and RMSE (2.5 and 3.3 Mg ha(-1)) compared to when there is no data assimilation. Scaling AMSR-E soil moisture to the climatology of the model did not improve our data assimilation results because the model is also biased. Better soil moisture products e.g., from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, may solve the soil moisture data issue in the near future. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, fast, easy applicable methods for a first snapshot of the LGD pattern are required and might be the basis for choosing relevant and representative sampling sites. In the present case study, which is actually the first application of an airborne measurement of thermal infrared radiation (TIR) to identify LGD pattern for entire deep freshwater lakes, the measurement was substantiated with thermal profiles in sediments and a water-table map. We found that measurement of TIR is a powerful tool to identify LGD pattern in lake-related studies provided that there is a lack of warm surface inflows. A TIR image taken in March 2012 shows that warm groundwater entering the relatively colder lake water in some near-shore areas is visible as a plume floating on top of the lake water. Prerequisites for the application of TIR to detect LGD pattern are the positive buoyancy of the groundwater relative to lake water and weak mixing in the water column. We propose a dimensionless scale for identifying groundwater floating conditions based on weather conditions. Attributing a surface thermal anomaly to LGD depends on careful consideration of other factors that could produce similar patterns and careful consideration of lake physics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The investigations are focused to the determination and analyses of snow-free ground reflectance (rho(ground)). The objective is to derive information on typical average snow-free ground reflectance for predominant non-forested land cover classes in Eurasia and to investigate the implications of their variations to the FSC estimation accuracy. The snow-free ground reflectances are derived from MODIS time series, using single band reflectances and their related indices. Our approach for the determination of rho(ground) is based on the assumption that the behavior of ground reflectance in conditions occurring directly after the snow melt adequately represents the snow-free ground reflectance during snow ablation i.e. melting snow cover including snow-free patches. Additionally, the effects of the rho(ground) variability to snow mapping accuracy for different land cover types are analyzed focusing to the SCAmod algorithm. The current operational implementations of SCAmod use a fixed value for snow-free ground reflectance at the visible wavelengths around 555 nm (corresponding to Terra/MODIS band 4). The deviation between the true snow-free ground value and the fixed value causes error in FSC estimation and, thus, it is necessary to investigate the magnitude and variations of the true rho(ground) for different land covers. Even so, our investigation for the target area of Europe, shows that the currently used fixed value of rho(ground) (10.0%-units) in SCAmod seems to work adequately for land cover classes investigated here. For example, the obtained rho(ground) mean and standard deviation 10.0 +/- 1.3%-units for the agricultural areas and steppe at 555 nm seem to widely coincide with the fixed value. According to SCAmod, the error in FSC estimation caused by the deviation between the fixed and the land cover class-specific value of rho(ground) for agricultural areas and steppe yields a systematic error close to zero and a random error ranging from 2.5 to 1.5%-units with the corresponding FSC range of 0-50%. However, in the case of wetlands (7.4 +/- 0.8%-units), the systematic error caused to FSC estimation using the fixed value compared to using the estimated class-specific value is as large as from 5 to 2.5%-units with the FSC range of 0-50%. For FSC retrievals larger than 50% the error caused by the variability in rho(ground) is considerably smaller for all of the studied land cover classes.   Our results show that the performance of SCAmod improves if land cover-specific rho(ground) values are applied at least for wetlands. We also suggest that the global application of SCAmod would benefit from the generation of a rho(ground) map for all land cover types by using the methods-presented in this paper. This post-winter reflectance climatology map can be constructed by calculating and using the class-specific rho(ground) statistics together with suitable land cover information.

Lichens with usnic acid, a yellowish pigment, constitute a large portion of caribou winter diet across much of their range. We take a new approach of modeling lichen abundances by capitalizing on unique spectral characteristics of usnic acid lichens. We utilize a recently completed ground reference vegetation data set extending over 12,000 km(2) in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska to model the abundance of usnic lichen and other forage vegetation groups. Spectral signatures were obtained for more than 700 vegetation monitoring plots in Denali from Landsat 7 ETM + imagery. We fit models of the absolute percent cover of vegetation groups corresponding to caribou diet items, with a focus on lichens. We used non-parametric multiplicative regression to capture the non-linear relationships between vegetation cover and spectral and environmental data. Different groupings of lichen cover were tried as response variables in addition to usnic lichens to see if other lichen color groups were more detectable. The best fitting lichen model was for usnic acid lichens, which explained 37% of the variation using only three predictors (elevation, bands 1 and 7). Elevation had a non-linear, double-humped shaped relationship to usnic lichen abundance while bands 1 and 7 were positively correlated with usnic lichen cover. These results support previous spectroradiometric ground measurements that indicated usnic lichens were distinctive at those wavelengths. Other vegetation groups had models that explained between 31% and 51% of the variation in cover. Maps of estimated abundance of usnic lichens and other vegetation groups covering the northern half of Denali were generated using our models. These maps enable the study of the role of food resources as a continuous resource in winter habitat selection by caribou, rather than assuming food as a coarser, categorical or thematic variable assigned to discrete areas of the landscape as has been done in most previous studies.

Here we demonstrate a new aerial remote sensing system enabling routine and inexpensive aerial 3D measurements of canopy structure and spectral attributes, with properties similar to those of LIDAR, but with RGB (red-green-blue) spectral attributes for each point, enabling high frequency observations within a single growing season. This \"Ecosynth\" methodology applies photogrammetric \"Structure from Motion\" computer vision algorithms to large sets of highly overlapping low altitude (<130 m) aerial photographs acquired using off-the-shelf digital cameras mounted on an inexpensive (<USD$4000), lightweight (<2 kg), hobbyist-grade unmanned aerial system (UAS). Ecosynth 3D point clouds with densities of 30-67 points M-2 were produced using commercial computer vision software from digital photographs acquired repeatedly by UAS over three 625 ha (250 m x 250 m) Temperate Deciduous forest sites in Maryland USA. Ecosynth point clouds were georeferenced with a precision of 1.2-4.1 m horizontal radial root mean square error (RMSE) and 0.4-12 m vertical RMSE. Understory digital terrain models (DTMs) and canopy height models (CHMs) were generated from leaf-on and leaf-off point clouds using procedures commonly applied to LIDAR point clouds. At two sites, Ecosynth CHMs were strong predictors of field-measured tree heights (R-2 0.63 to 0.84) and were highly correlated with a LIDAR CHM (R 0.87) acquired 4 days earlier, though Ecosynth-based estimates of aboveground biomass and carbon densities included significant errors (31-36% of field-based estimates). Repeated scanning of a 50 m x 50 m forested area at six different times across a 16 month period revealed ecologically significant dynamics in canopy color at different heights and a structural shift upward in canopy density, as demonstrated by changes in vertical height profiles of point density and relative RGB brightness. Changes in canopy relative greenness were highly correlated (R-2 = 0.87) with MODIS NDVI time series for the same area and vertical differences in canopy color revealed the early green up of the dominant canopy species, Liriodendron tulipifera, strong evidence that Ecosynth time series measurements can capture vegetation structural and spectral phenological dynamics at the spatial scale of individual trees. The ability to observe canopy phenology in 3D at high temporal resolutions represents a breakthrough in forest ecology. Inexpensive user-deployed technologies for multispectral 3D scanning of vegetation at landscape scales (<1 km(2)) heralds a new era of participatory remote sensing by field ecologists, community foresters and the interested public.

Because of the remoteness and poor accessibility of these alpine lakes, and a lack of lake bathymetric data, estimating their mass budget over the TP poses a considerable challenge. However, the integration of optical remote sensing images, satellite altimetry data, and gravimetry data makes it possible to monitor the overall variations in lake water storage in this extensive region. The ICESat/GLAS altimetry data used in this study reveal that most of the lakes in the TP showed a significant upward tendency (0.2-0.6 m/year) in water level between 2003 and 2009, particularly those lakes that are supplied with a large proportion of glacial meltwater. A series of lake area data derived from Landsat MSSaM/ETM + imagery over the past four decades indicate that during the 1970-1990 period most of the lakes experienced severe shrinkage, with only some of those in central and western Tibet undergoing expansion. During the 1990-2011 period, in contrast, the majority of the lakes on the TP displayed a remarkably expansion tendency. The total lake area increased from 35,638.11 km(2) in the early 1970s to 41,938.66 km(2) in 2011. Based on the statistical relationships between the extent of the lake surface area and lake water levels from 2003 to 2009, an empirical model for each of the region\'s 30 lakes is established to estimate the lake water level from the corresponding area data, thereby reconstructing time series of lake level data for each lake from the 1970s to 2011. Based on time series of lake area and water level data, a time series of lake water volume is also reconstructed. The results show that total lake water storage increased by 92.43 km(3) between the early 1970s and 2011, with lakes with an area larger than 100 km(2) accounting for 77.21% of the total lake water volume budget. Moreover, the GRACE signals confirm a similar spatial pattern in water mass changes, i.e., a significantly positive water mass balance in the north and center of the TP and mass loss in southeastern Tibet and along the Himalayas. The water mass budget (6.81 km(3)/year) derived from satellite gravimetry signals in the Chiangtang Plateau are in good agreement with the estimated rising rate of 6.79 km(3)/year of lake water storage in this region based on the empirical model developed in this study. The mechanism of lake water storage changes is discussed and analyzed with reference to previous studies. (C) 2013 Ersevier Inc.

However, large area ground-based monitoring campaigns required for calibration are both costly to maintain, and reduce the generality of results. Estimation of directional gap probability (P-gap) from waveform lidar which is both direct (i.e. physically-based) and minimises or removes requirements for field calibration would be a significant advance for large area sampling. We present a new model for estimating P-gap from small footprint airborne waveform lidar data that accounts for differences in canopy (rho(v)) and ground (rho(g)) reflectivity and compare this new method with published discrete return lidar methods. We use lidar surveys acquired at multiple altitudes using RIEGL LMS-Q680i and RIEGL LMS-Q560 waveform systems over a savanna woodland in the Einasleigh Uplands bioregion of northern Queensland, Australia. The waveform model for P-gap was found to fit observed waveform data in cases where the assumption of constant rho(v) and rho(g) was satisfied. P-gap estimates from the waveform model were shown to be relatively insensitive to variation in sensor altitude. This was in contrast to other methods of estimating P-gap where differences up to similar to 0.15 P-gap have been observed. Comparison of lidar-derived P-gap with ground measurements showed the new waveform model produced estimates corresponding to within 5% P-gap. We suggest the waveform model to retrieve rho(v)/rho(g) and P-gap is a significant advance in retrieval of canopy structure parameters from small footprint lidar, reducing the need for local calibration, and providing direct estimates of P-gap. If the assumptions of relatively stable rho(v)/rho(g) are shown to hold across a greater range of sensor, survey, and canopy structure configurations we suggest this method may have wide practical application for retrieval of P-gap.

Because the data are not usually observed concurrently, unaccounted spatial and temporal variances cause error in blending algorithms, yet, to date, there has been no definitive assessment of algorithm performance against spatial and temporal variances. Our objectives were to: (i) evaluate the accuracy of two advanced blending algorithms (STARFM and ESTARFM) and two simple benchmarking algorithms in two landscapes with contrasting spatial and temporal variances; and (ii) synthesise the spatial and temporal conditions under which the algorithms performed best. Landsat-like images were simulated on 27 dates in total using the nearest temporal cloud-free Landsat-MODIS pairs to the simulation date, one before and one after. RMSD, bias, and r(2) estimates between simulated and observed Landsat images were calculated, and overall variance of Landsat and MODIS datasets were partitioned into spatial and temporal components. Assessment was performed over the whole study site, and for specific land covers. Results addressing objective (i) were that: ESTARFM did not always produce lower errors than STARFM; STARFM and ESTARFM did not always produce lower errors than simple benchmarking algorithms; and land cover spatial and temporal variances were strongly associated with algorithm performance. Results addressing objective (ii) indicated ESTARFM was superior where/when spatial variance was dominant; and STARFM was superior where/when temporal variance was dominant. We proposed a framework for selecting blending algorithms based on partitioning variance into the spatial and temporal components and suggested that comparing Landsat and MODIS spatial and temporal variances was a practical method to determine if, and when, MODIS could add value for blending.

Instead of hundreds of small leaf facets, only a small number of porous thin objects are used to construct a complex tree crown or crop canopy. With gaps inside the object, it can effectively represent a group of small leaves. Each porous object has several properties, including shape, size (R), thickness (H), leaf area index (LAI), leaf angle distribution (LAD) and leaf clumping conditions (C). These properties are used to dynamically create the small leaves at run-time; hence, only view factors between porous objects (not between hundreds of small leaves) need to be calculated and stored. As a result, the model significantly reduces the huge memory requirement and long computation time of view factors for a large, realistic vegetation scene. RAPID is able to simulate arbitrary vegetation canopies in complex landscapes and to calculate BRF within a few minutes, which makes its application possible on different satellite pixel levels. This innovative technique is evaluated by comparing with directional reflectances from other models as well as field measurements. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Phenology is also a first-order control on terrestrial carbon and energy budgets, and remotely sensed observations of phenology are often used to parameterize seasonal vegetation dynamics in ecosystem models. Current land surface phenology products are only available at moderate spatial resolution and possess considerable uncertainty. Higher resolution products that resolve finer spatial detail are therefore needed. A need also exists for data sets and methods that link ground-based observations of phenology to moderate resolution land surface phenology products. Data from the Landsat TM and ETM + sensors have the potential to meet these needs, but have been largely unexplored by the phenology research community. In this paper we present a method for characterizing both long-term average and interannual dynamics in the phenology of temperate deciduous broadleaf forest using multi-decadal time series of Landsat TM/ETM + images. Results show that spring and autumn phenological transition dates estimated from Landsat data agree closely with in-situ measurements of phenology collected at the Harvard Forest in central Massachusetts, and that Landsat-derived estimates for the start and end of the growing season in Southern New England varied by as much as 4 weeks over the 30-year record of Landsat images. Application of this method over larger scales has the potential to provide valuable information related to landscape-scale patterns and long term dynamics in phenology, and for bridging the gap between in-situ phenological measurements collected at local scales and land surface phenology metrics derived from moderate spatial resolution of instruments such as MODIS and AVHRR.

However, it remains uncertain how much short-term variability exists in other polythermal glaciers, particularly those in High Asia. Here we report satellite radar image analyses that reveal diverse glacier surface velocities and their evolution in West Kunlun Shan (WKS), NW Tibet, where little is known about glacier dynamics. On the basis of radar images obtained from 2003 to 2011, we examined 36 glaciers, and classified them into two classes according to their multi-temporal velocity profiles: 25 as normal-flow type (surface velocity reaches maxima around the middle part, and gradually approaches zero toward downstream and upstream), and four as surging type (surface velocities are greater than 150 m/yr, and/or the terminus advance is recognized from the radar images). Seven other glaciers do not fit the former two classes, and reveal stagnant velocity profiles that are nearly zero in the lower part but are similar to those of the normal type in the upper part. Although these glaciers could be just stagnant tongues indicative of receding normal type glaciers, given the temporal evolution at the Zhongfeng Glacier, the stagnant type possibly represents a quiescent phase of the surging type glaciers. While glacier surfaces are mostly clean with limited debris-cover, except near the termini, surge-type glaciers might be common in WKS. The observed short-term velocity changes provide us with evidence for efficient basal slip even at the high-elevation polythermal glaciers. This study demonstrates that frequent radar image acquisitions are helpful to understand short-term velocity changes at remote glaciers in detail. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

The specific dynamics of such semi-permanent settlements, comprising both the structural changes (to the extent of the camp, and the population density), and their wider impacts on the surroundings, require adaptive monitoring capacities. In areas where livelihoods and food security are highly dependent on natural resources, environmental deterioration can result in violent conflicts over access to, or control of, scarce natural resources, or in renewed migration of the population. Remote sensing, and in particular very high spatial resolution satellite imagery, can help determine the actual population dynamics, together with environmental changes in the surrounding areas. In an ex-post assessment using three time slices (2002, 2004, 2008) we assessed the changing environmental conditions and the resulting implications for human security and ecosystem integrity in the vicinity of a large internally displaced persons (IDP) camp in northern Darfur, Sudan. We used a Weighted Natural Resource Depletion index that integrates selected land use/land cover target classes and their relative importance for human security and/or ecosystem integrity by incorporating weightings assigned by experts to each of these classes. The results showed that the dramatic increase in the camp\'s population between June 2002 and May 2008 (from approximately 1200 to about 50,000 inhabitants) and areal extent (a growth of similar to 436%) was accompanied by a noticeable decrease in the area covered by single shrubs and small trees (similar to -68%), in the area covered by patches of shrubs and trees (similar to-34%), and in the area covered by grassland (similar to -3%). Moreover, a marked expansion in small-scale farming was observed, especially into fertile wadi soils. Almost 45% of all grid cells (60 m x 60 m) had experienced at least some degree of depletion of natural resources (i.e. woody vegetation, grassland, etc.) between 2002 and 2008. Major depletion was observed in the north-eastern and eastern parts of the camp in particular, while minor depletion occurred over almost all of the study area. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In this context, we investigated the perspective offered by coupling a simple algorithm for yield estimate (SAFY) with the Formosat-2 data to estimate crop production over large areas. With a limited number of input parameters, the SAFY model enables the simulation of time series of green area index (GAI) and dry aboveground biomass (DAM). From 2006 to 2009, 95 Formosat-2 images (8 m, 1 day revisit) were acquired for a 24 x 24 km(2) area southwest of Toulouse, France. This study focused on two summer crops: irrigated maize (Zea mays) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus). Green area index (GAI) time series were deduced from Formosat-2 NDVI time series and were used to calibrate six major parameters of the SAFY model. Four of those parameters (partition-to-leaf and senescence function parameters) were calibrated per crop type based on the very dense 2006 Formosat-2 data set The retrieved values of these parameters were consistent with the in situ observations and a literature review. Two of the major parameters of the SAFY model (emergence day and effective light-use efficiency) were calibrated per field relative to crop management practices. The estimated effective light-use efficiency values highlighted the distinction between the C4 (maize) and 0 (sunflower) plants, and were linked to the reduction of the photosynthesis rate due to water stress. The model was able to reproduce a large set of GAI temporal shapes, which were related to various phenological behaviours and to crop type. The biomass was well estimated (relative error of 28%), especially considering that biomass measurements were not used for the calibration. The grain yields were also simulated using harvest index coefficients and were compared with grain yield statistics from the French Agricultural Statistics for the department of Haute-Garonne. The inter-annual variation in the simulated grain yields of sunflower was consistent with the reported variation. For maize, significant discrepancies were observed with the reported statistics.

Although a large amount of ice is located in the Himalayas, this region is yet only sparsely represented in global glacier databases. Accordingly, a sound and comprehensive change assessment or determination of water resources was not yet possible. In this study, we present a new glacier inventory for the western Himalayas, compiled from Landsat ETM + scenes acquired between 2000 and 2002, coherence images from ALOS PALSAR image pairs, the SRTM digital elevation model (DEM) and the ASTER Global DEM (GDEM). Several specific challenges for glacier mapping were found in this region and addressed. They are related to debris cover, orographic clouds, locally variable snow conditions, and creeping permafrost features in cold-dry regions. Additional to seven topographic parameters that are obtained from the ASTER GDEM for each glacier, we also determined the relative amount of debris cover on the glacier surface. The inventory contains 11,400 glaciers larger than 0.02 km(2), which cover a total area of 9,310 km(2). Analysis of the inventory data revealed characteristic patterns of mean glacier elevation and relative debris cover amounts that might be related to the governing climatic conditions. The full dataset will be freely available in the GUMS glacier database to foster further analyses and modeling of the glaciers in this region. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Over the land surfaces, simultaneous retrievals of surface soil moisture (SM) and vegetation characteristics made from the multiangular and dual polarization SMOS observations are now available from Level-2 (L2) products delivered by the European Space Agency (ESA). Therefore, first analyses evaluating the SMOS observations in terms of Brightness Temperatures (TB) and 12 products (SM and vegetation optical depth TAU) can be carried out over several calibration/validation (cal/val) sites selected by ESA over all continents. This study is based on SMOS observations and in situ measurements carried out in 2010 over one of the main SMOS cal/val sites in Europe: the VAS (Valencia Anchor Station) site in the region of Utiel-Requena, close to Valencia, Spain. The main vegetation types in the region are vineyards, orchards and natural Mediterranean vegetation. The SMOS observations were analyzed in conjunction with those carried out by the L-band ELBARA-II radiometer over a vineyard which is considered as representative of the main land use of the VAS site. Time series of TB and retrievals of SM and TAU based on both the SMOS (L2 products) and the ELBARA-II observations were compared and evaluated against in situ measurements. A good agreement was found between the time variations in TB and in the retrieved SM values computed over the site from the SMOS and ELBARA-II observations (the determination coefficient R-2 was > 0.88 for the TB values and R-2 > 0.64 for the retrieved SM values). However, it was found that the SMOS L2 SM products underestimated the SM values retrieved from ELBARA-II by similar to 0.2 m(3)/m(3). It is likely this offset can be partially explained by differences between the observed scenes: while the ELBARA-II footprint includes a single vineyard, the heterogeneous SMOS footprint includes not only a large number of vineyards but also a natural Mediterranean vegetation with persistent leaves overlaying rocky soils. The time variations in TAU retrieved from the ELBARA-II observations were found to be closely related to those of the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) vegetation index obtained from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) (R-2 = 0.61) and revealed the vegetation cycle over the year. Conversely, the time variations in the SMOS Level-2 TAU product did not reveal any trends in relation to the vegetation development over the site. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The MODIS-Aqua-derived normalized water-leaving radiances, nL(w)(lambda), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) data are compared with in situ radiometric measurements from the NASA SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System (SeaBASS) database and Chl-a data from the Chesapeake Bay Water Quality Database. Results show that, using the NIR-SWIR combined ocean color data processing, improved nL(w)(lambda) and Chl-a data products can be produced in the Chesapeake Bay. However, Chl-a data are still overestimated in some Chesapeake Bay regions, in particular, in the upper bay region where waters are strongly influenced by the total suspended sediment (TSS) concentration. Specifically, using the NIR-SWIR approach, mean ratios of MODIS-derived and in situ-measured nL(w)(lambda) at wavelengths of 412, 443, 488, 531, 551, and 667 nm for the Chesapeake Bay are 1.288, 1.093, 0.998, 0.946, 0.908, and 0.865, respectively, while mean Chl-a values over the region from satellite-derived and in situ-measure data are 11.14 and 10.28 mg. m(-3), respectively. Based on a strong correlation relationship between TSS and water diffuse attenuation coefficient, a regional TSS algorithm for the Chesapeake Bay has been developed and validated, with mean ratio of 1.064 between MODIS-derived and in situ-measured TSS data. Therefore, using the NIR-SWIR algorithm for MODIS-Aqua ocean color data processing, nL(w)(lambda), Chl-a, and TSS data from 2002 to 2010 for the Chesapeake Bay have been generated and used for characterizing the water properties in the region, showing strong seasonal and interannual variability, as well as important spatial variations in the region.

However, remote estimates of urban thermal inertia show anisotropy effects due to thermal anisotropy. This study investigates the impacts of thermal anisotropy on the estimation of urban thermal inertia. We present the concepts of DTI (directional thermal inertia) and DATI (directional apparent thermal inertia) to describe this anisotropic effect. A combined approach to estimating thermal inertia named NLS (nonlinear least square) is proposed as a compromise solution using temporal temperature measurements. Intercomparisons between methods are indirectly conducted by predicting surface temperatures, and the results indicate the NLS has higher accuracy of 1 to 2 K. The DTI estimation over an urban scale model, together with flat concrete and grass surfaces, reveals that the DTI intensity is significant when DRTs (directional radiometric temperatures) are used as inputs. Over the scale model, the DTI and DATI values range from 0.028 to 0.038 K-1 and from 1530 to 2970 W.s(1/2.)m(-2)-K-1 if the zenith and azimuth are between -60 degrees and +60 degrees and between 0 degrees and +360 degrees, respectively. Further discussions demonstrate that DRT intensity has an approximate linear relationship with DTI intensity and that it thus could be used as a predictor of DTI intensity. We finally propose that using complete urban surface temperatures instead of the DRT would be better to estimate urban thermal inertia from the perspective of surface energy balance.

Remotely sensed thermal-infrared imagery collected by Landsat provides estimates of land-surface temperature that allow mapping of evapotranspiration (ET) at the spatial scales at which water is being used. This paper explores the utility of moderate-resolution thermal satellite imagery in water resource management General modeling techniques for using land-surface temperature in mapping the surface energy balance are described, including methods developed to safeguard Er estimates from expected errors in the remote sensing inputs. Examples are provided of how remotely sensed maps of ET derived from Landsat thermal imagery are being used operationally by water managers today: in monitoring water rights, negotiating interstate compacts, estimating water-use by invasive species, and in determining allocations for agriculture, urban use, and endangered species protection. Other applications include monitoring drought and food insecurity, and evaluation of large-scale land-surface and climate models. To better address user requirements for high-resolution, time-continuous Er data, novel techniques have been developed to improve the spatial resolution of Landsat thermal-band imagery and temporal resolution between Landsat overpasses by fusing information from other wavebands and satellites. Finally, a strategy for future modification to the Landsat program is suggested, improving our ability to track changes in water use due to changing climate and growing population. The long archive of global, moderate resolution TIR imagery collected by the Landsat series is unmatched by any other satellite program, and will continue to be an invaluable asset to better management of our earth\'s water resources.

Temperature drives many of the physical and biological processes that impact the global and local environment. As our knowledge of, and interest in, the role of temperature on these processes have grown, the value of Landsat data to monitor trends and process has also grown. The value of the Landsat thermal data archive will continue to grow as we develop more effective ways to study the long term processes and trends affecting the planet. However, in order to take proper advantage of the thermal data, we need to be able to convert the data to surface temperatures. A critical step in this process is to have the entire archive completely and consistently calibrated into absolute radiance so that it can be atmospherically compensated to surface leaving radiance and then to surface radiometric temperature. This paper addresses the methods and procedures that have been used to perform the radiometric calibration of the earliest sizable thermal data set in the archive (Landsat 4 data). The completion of this effort along with the updated calibration of the earlier (1985-1999) Landsat 5 data, also reported here, concludes a comprehensive calibration of the Landsat thermal archive of data from 1982 to the present.

Time series data stacks were generated for four study areas: (1) a four scene area dominated by forest and rangeland ecosystems in the southwestern United States, (2) a sagebrush-dominated rangeland in Wyoming, (3) woodland adjacent to prairie in northwestern Nebraska, and (4) a forested area in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Through analyses of time series data, we found evidence of gradual systematic change in many of the natural vegetation communities in all four areas. Many of the conifer forests in the southwestern US are showing declines related to insects and drought, but very few are showing evidence of improving conditions or increased greenness. Sagebrush communities are showing decreases in greenness related to fire, mining, and probably drought, but very few of these communities are showing evidence of increased greenness or improving conditions. In Nebraska, forest communities are showing local expansion and increased canopy densification in the prairie-woodland interface, and in the White Mountains high elevation understory conifers are showing range increases towards lower elevations. The trends detected are not obvious through casual inspection of the Landsat images. Analyses of time series data using many scenes and covering multiple years are required in order to develop better impressions and representations of the changing ecosystem patterns and trends that are occurring. The approach described in this paper demonstrates that Landsat time series data can be used operationally for assessing gradual ecosystem change across large areas. Local knowledge and available ancillary data are required in order to fully understand the nature of these trends.

A quadratic function (R-2=0.95, p<0.0001) accurately explained the variance in the simulated data for a chl-a range of 1-60 mg m(-3). Similarly a twofold calibration and validation of chl-a models using MERIS dataset, (chl-a range: 0.9-28.1 mg m(-3)) yielded R-2 of 0.9, and RMSE of similar to 2 mg m(-3) respectively. NDCI was applied on images over the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay, the Mobile Bay, and the Mississippi River delta region in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The newly developed algorithm was successful in predicting chl-a concentration with approximately 12% overall bias for all above study regions. Findings from this research imply that NDCI can be successfully used on MERIS images to quantitatively monitor chl-a in inland coastal and estuarine waters. In case of remote coastal waters with no ground truth data. NDCI can be used to detect algal bloom and qualitatively infer chl-a concentration ranges very similar to NDVI\'s application in terrestrial vegetation studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

ATSR-2 and Advanced ATSR (AATSR) SST estimates are compared to drifting buoy and moored buoy observations over the period 1995 to 2008. The primary ATSR estimates are of skin SST, whereas buoys measure SST below the surface. Adjustment is therefore made for the skin effect, for diurnal stratification and for differences in buoy-satellite observation time. With such adjustments, satellite-in situ differences are consistent between day and night within similar to 0.01 K. Satellite-in situ differences are correlated with differences in observation time, because of the diurnal warming and cooling of the ocean. The data are used to verify the average behaviour of physical and empirical models of the warming/cooling rates.   Systematic differences between adjusted AATSR and in-situ SSTs against latitude, total column water vapour (TCWV), and wind speed are less than 0.1 K, for all except the most extreme cases (TCWV <5 kg m(-2), TCWV >60 kg m(-2)). For all types of retrieval except the nadir-only two-channel (N2), regional biases are less than 0.1 K for 80% of the ocean. Global comparison against drifting buoys shows night time dual-view two-channel (D2) SSTs are warm by 0.06 +/- 0.23 K and dual-view three-channel (D3) SSTs are warm by 0.06 +/- 0.21 K (day-time 02: 0.07 +/- 0.23 K). Nadir-only results are N2: 0.03 +/- 0.33 K and N3: 0.03 +/- 0.19 K showing the improved inter-algorithm consistency to similar to 0.02 K. This represents a marked improvement from the existing operational retrieval algorithms for which inter-algorithm inconsistency is >0.5 K. Comparison against tropical moored buoys, which are more accurate than drifting buoys, gives lower error estimates (N3: 0.02 +/- 0.13 K, 02: 0.03 +/- 0.18 K). Comparable results are obtained for ATSR-2, except that the ATSR-2 SSTs are around 0.1 K warm compared to AATSR. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

One of the key impacts of rapid urbanization on the environment is the effect of urban heat island (UHI). Understanding the effects of landscape pattern on UHI is crucial for improving the ecology and sustainability of cities. This study investigated how landscape composition and configuration would affect UHI in the Shanghai metropolitan region of China, based on the analysis of land surface temperature (LST) in relation to normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), vegetation fraction (Fv), and percent impervious surface area (ISA). Two Landsat ETM+ images acquired on March 13 and July 2, 2001 were used to estimate LST. Fv, and percent ISA. Landscape metrics were calculated from a high spatial resolution (2.5 x 2.5 m) land-cover/land-use map. Our results have showed that, although there are significant variations in LST at a given fraction of vegetation or impervious surface on a per-pixel basis, NDVI, Fv, and percent ISA are all good predictors of LST on the regional scale. There is a strong negative linear relationship between LST and positive NDVI over the region. Similar but stronger negative linear relationship exists between LST and Fv. Urban vegetation could mitigate the surface UHI better in summer than in early spring. A strong positive relationship exists between mean LST and percent ISA. The residential land is the biggest contributor to UHL followed by industrial land. Although industrial land has the highest LST, it has limited contribution to the overall surface UHI due to its small spatial extend in Shanghai. Among the residential land-uses, areas with low- to-middle-rise buildings and low vegetation cover have much high temperatures than areas with high-rise buildings or areas with high vegetation cover. A strong correlation between the mean LST and landscape metrics indicates that urban landscape configuration also influences the surface UHI. These findings are helpful for understanding urban ecology as well as land use planning to minimize the potential environmental impacts of urbanization. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The SeaWiFS diffuse light attenuation ranged from 0.10 to 2.64 m(-1). Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis suggested that spatial and temporal patterns in diffuse light attenuation were influenced by wind speed, nutrient loading, and river discharge from the Mississippi and Atchafalaya River Basin. SeaWiFS daily integrated surface photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm) and diffuse light attenuation were used to calculate the absolute PAR and percentage of surface PAR that reached the sediment water interface (SWI) on the LCS. Large portions of the LCS were euphotic to the SWI especially during April and May. This finding implied that significant primary production was possible beneath the pycnocline during spring and early summer. In addition, this study was the first to demonstrate that the euphotic depth was correlated to the depth at which the water column turned hypoxic on the LCS. The development of hypoxic waters may be influenced by decreased light availability below the pycnocline in addition to aforementioned physical forcing.

The relationship between the radar backscatter and aboveground biomass (AGB) was strong (r(2)=0.86 for ALOS HV to biomass plots, r(2)=0.95 relating ALOS-derived biomass for 40 suspected unchanged regions to JERS-1 HH). The root mean square error (RMSE) associated with AGB estimation varied from similar to 25% for AGB<100 Mg ha(-1) to similar to 40% for AGB>100 Mg ha(-1) for the ALOS HV data. Change detection showed a significant loss of AGB over high biomass forests, due to suspected deforestation and degradation, and significant biomass gains along the forest-savanna boundary, particularly in areas of low population density. Analysis of the errors involved showed that radar data can detect changes in broad AGB class in forest-savanna transition areas with an accuracy >95%. However, quantitative assessment of changes in AGB in Mg ha(-1) at a pixel level will require radar images from sensors with similar characteristics collecting data from the same season over multiple years.

Classification of remote sensing imagery is a powerful way to analyze and detect large-scale disturbances.

Engelm.) killed by an unprecedented spruce beetle outbreak in southern Utah, USA. After co-registration and masking out non-vegetation the Disturbance Index (DI) was calculated for each image. DI values associated with Engelmann spruce mortality, determined by comparing each image to a no outbreak baseline image, were then used to classify the images. Dendrochronologically determined dates of spruce death collected from across the outbreak area were used to assess the ability of the DI to accurately differentiate stands of dead spruce from live conifer forest. The overall classification accuracy of the DI varied from 80 to 82% while the accuracy to detect spruce beetle-killed spruce varied from 59 to 71%. Both user\'s and producer\'s accuracy to classify beetle infested stands increased over the temporal sequence of image dates. However, confusion matrix-derived statistics varied by image date. Consistent with previous studies, the spruce beetle outbreak began building in multiple, seemingly independent locations across the study area. Over time, areas attacked earlier in the outbreak enlarged and coalesced on the landscape. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[DeRose, R.

We developed an algorithm to estimate ET using a semi-empirical Priestley-Taylor (PT) approach, which can be applied at a range of spatial scales. We estimated regional net radiation (R-net) at monthly time scales using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo and land surface temperature. Good agreement was found between satellite-based estimates of monthly R-net and field-measured R-net, with a RMSE of less than 30 Wm(-2). An adjustable PT coefficient was parameterized as a function of leaf area index and soil moisture based on observations from 27 AmeriFlux eddy covariance sites. The biome specific optimization using tower-based observations performed well, with a RMSE of 17 Wm(-2) and a correlation of 0.90 for predicted monthly latent heat. We implemented the approach within the hydrology module of the CASA biogeochemical model, and used it to estimate ET at a 1 km spatial resolution for the conterminous United States (CONUS). The RMSE of modeled ET was reduced to 21.1 mm mon(-1), compared to 27.1 mm mon(-1) in the original CASA model. The monthly ET rates averaged over the Mississippi River basin were similar to those derived using GRACE satellite measurements and river discharge data. ET varied substantially over the CONUS, with annual mean values of 110 +/- 76 mm yr(-1) in deserts, 391 +/- 176 mm yr(-1) in savannas and grasslands, and 840 +/- 234 mm yr(-1) in broadleaf forests.

In this study, a new retrieval strategy for fine-to-moderate resolution multiangle observations was developed, based on the operational sequence used to retrieve the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 5 reflectance and BRDF/albedo products. The algorithm makes use of a semiempirical kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance model to provide estimates of intrinsic albedo (i.e., directional-hemispherical reflectance and bihemispherical reflectance), model parameters describing the BRDF, and extensive quality assurance information. The new retrieval strategy was applied to NASA\'s Cloud Absorption Radiometer (CAR) data acquired during the 2007 Cloud and Land Surface Interaction Campaign (CLASIC) over the well-instrumented Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) Cloud and Radiation Testbed (CART) site in Oklahoma, USA. For the case analyzed, we obtained similar to 1.6 million individual surface bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) retrievals, from nadir to 75 degrees off-nadir, and at spatial resolutions ranging from 3 m to 500 m. This unique dataset was used to examine the interaction of the spatial and angular characteristics of a mixed agricultural landscape; and provided the basis for detailed assessments of: (1) the use of a land cover type-specific a priori knowledge in kernel-driven BRDF model inversions; (2) the interaction between surface reflectance anisotropy and instrument spatial resolution: and (3) the uncertainties that arise when sub-pixel differences in the BRDF are aggregated to a moderate resolution satellite pixel. Results offer empirical evidence concerning the influence of scale and spatial heterogeneity in kernel-driven BRDF models; providing potential new insights into the behavior and characteristics of different surface radiative properties related to land/use cover change and vegetation structure.

Ecological literature has two different coverage metrics. Vertical canopy cover (VCC) is the vertical projection of tree crowns ignoring within-crown gaps. Angular canopy closure (ACC) is the proportion of covered sky at some angular range around the zenith, and can be measured with a field-of-view instrument, such as a camera. We compared field-measured VCC and ACC at 15 degrees and 75 degrees from the zenith to different LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) metrics, using several LiDAR data sets and comprehensive field data. The VCC was estimated to a high precision using a simple proportion of canopy points in first-return data. Confining to a maximum 15 degrees scan zenith angle, the absolute root mean squared error (RMSE) was 3.7-7.0%, with an overestimation of 3.1-4.6%. We showed that grid-based methods are capable of reducing the inherent overestimation of VCC. The low scan angles and low power settings that are typically applied in topographic LiDARs are not suitable for ACC estimation as they measure in wrong geometry and cannot easily detect small within-crown gaps. However, ACC at 0-15 degrees zenith angles could be estimated from LiDAR data with sufficient precision, using also the last returns (RMSE 8.1-113%, bias -6.1-+4.6%). The dependency of LiDAR metrics and ACC at 0-75 degrees zenith angles was nonlinear and was modeled from laser pulse proportions with nonlinear regression with a best-case standard error of 4.1%. We also estimated leaf area index from the LiDAR metrics with linear regression with a standard error of 0.38. The results show that correlations between airborne laser metrics and different canopy field characteristics are very high if the field measurements are done with equivalent accuracy.

Direct measurement of LAI is labor intensive, impractical at large scales and does not capture seasonal or annual variations in canopy biomass. The need to monitor canopy related fluxes across landscapes makes remote sensing an attractive technique for estimating LAI. Many vegetation indices, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), tend to saturate at LAI levels >4 although tropical and temperate forested ecosystems often exceed that threshold. Using two monospecific shrub thickets as model systems, we evaluated the potential of a variety of algorithms specifically developed to improve accuracy of LAI estimates in canopies where LAI exceeds saturation levels for other indices. We also tested the potential of indices developed to detect variations in canopy chlorophyll to estimate LAI because of the direct relationship between total canopy chlorophyll content and LAI. Indices were evaluated based on data from direct (litterfall) and indirect measurements (LAI-2000) of LAI. Relationships between results of direct and indirect ground-sampling techniques were also evaluated. For these two canopies, the indices that showed the highest potential to accurately differentiate LAI values >4 were derivative indices based on red-edge spectral reflectance. Algorithms intended to improve accuracy at high LAI values in agricultural systems were insensitive when LAI exceeded 4 and offered little or no improvement over NDVI. Furthermore, indirect ground-sampling techniques often used to evaluate the potential of vegetation indices also saturate when LAI exceeds 4. Comparisons between hyperspectral vegetation indices and a saturated LAI value from indirect measurement may overestimate accuracy and sensitivity of some vegetation indices in high LAI communities. We recommend verification of indirect measurements of LAI with direct destructive sampling or litterfall collection, particularly in canopies with high LAI. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We evaluate how aerosol profiles measured by ground-based lidar and simulated by models can help improve the association between AOD retrieved by the Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) and fine particle sulfate (SO4) concentrations using matched data at two lidar sites. At the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) site, both lidar and model aerosol profiles marginally improve the association between SO4 concentrations and MISR fractional AODs, as the correlation coefficient between cross-validation (CV) and observed SO4 concentrations changes from 0.87 for the no-scaling model to 0.88 for models scaled with aerosol vertical profiles. At the GSFC site, a large amount of urban aerosols resides in the well-mixed boundary layer so the column fractional AODs are already excellent indicators of ground-level particle pollution. In contrast, at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) site with relatively low aerosol loadings, scaling substantially improves model performance. The correlation coefficient between CV and observed SO4 concentrations is increased from 0.58 for the no-scaling model to 0.76 in the GEOS-Chem scaling model, and the model bias is reduced from 17% to 9%. In summary, despite the inaccuracy due to the coarse horizontal resolution and the challenges of simulating turbulent mixing in the boundary layer, GEOS-Chem simulated aerosol profiles can still improve methods for estimating surface aerosol (504) mass from satellite-based AODs, particularly in rural areas where aerosols in the free troposphere and any long-range transport of aerosols can significantly contribute to the column AOD.

For that purpose, CHRIS images in mode 1 were acquired throughout a two-year period for a Mediterranean ecosystem dominated by the semi-deciduous shrub Phlomis fruticosa. During each acquisition, coincident in situ Leaf spectra and ecophysiological measurements (Leaf Area Index, leaf pigment content and leaf water potential) were conducted. After data preprocessing, absorption feature information was calculated for both CHRIS and Leaf spectra for the whole spectrum. Three common characteristic absorption features within the spectral areas 450-550 nm, 550-750 nm and 900-1000 nm were detected. Each spectral area was then examined separately and four characteristic parameters were calculated that described the pattern, magnitude and position of the maximum absorption. Correlations between CHRIS and Leaf spectra for each date and viewing angle (VA) were then conducted. All correlations, either on full continuum removed spectra or on spectral areas, showed high coefficients of determination, especially (i) in higher observation angles (VA + 55), (ii) during the wet season and (iii) in strong absorptions such as the \"red absorption\". Subsequently, correlations between CHRIS and Leaf absorption parameters of selected spectral areas with field-measured ecophysiological parameters were examined. Ecophysiological parameters proved to be highly correlated to CHRIS and Leaf absorption parameters in magnitude and/or pattern of the absorption feature and less in wavelength of the maximum absorption. CHRIS VAs +/- 36 showed the highest correlations although the type of relation, linear or nonlinear, was not conclusive. Finally, a first comparison between narrowband spectral indices and absorption features in correlations with ecophysiological parameters showed that both methods provide significant and comparable results, with oblique angles showing best performance. However, ecophysiological parameters are generally better predicted linearly by narrowband spectral indices issued from CHRIS, with most significant differences appearing on pigments absorbing mainly within 450-550 nm.

The objective of this study was to map the surface water temperature and improve understanding of spatiotemporal variations in a hydroelectric reservoir. In this work, MODIS land-surface temperature (LST) level 2, 1-km nominal resolution data (MOD11L2, version 5) were used. All available clear-sky MODIS/Terra images from 2003 to 2008 were used, resulting in a total of 786 daytime and 473 nighttime images. Descriptive statistics (mean, maximum and minimum) were computed for the historical images to build a time series of daytime and nighttime monthly mean temperatures. The thermal amplitude and anomaly were also computed. In-situ meteorological variables were used from 2003 to 2008 to help understand the spatiotemporal variability of the surface water temperature. The surface energy budget and the depth at which the wind can distribute the heat input of a given surface were also measured.

While satelite sensors have been used to map different reef communities, the accuracy of these maps tends to be low (overall accuracy<50%) and optical airborne methods with high spectral resolution have, to date, been the most effective (if expensive) means of achieving higher accuracy. A potential means of compensating for the low spectral and radiometric resolution of optical satellite data, which is a major cause of its poor performance, is to combine satellite data with acoustic remote sensing. This study quantified the benefit of the synergy between optical satellite data (IKONOS) and acoustic (RoxAnn) sensors. The addition of acoustic data provided three new data axes for discriminating habitats: seabed roughness (E1), reef depth (z) and the depth correction of satellite spectral data to uniform depth. Seabed hardness (E2) was not an informative channel in our study. The use of z to conduct the water-column correction of the optical bands to uniform depth is a potential improvement over applying the depth-invariant index approach to optical data in the absence of ancillary information on depth. Habitat maps of the forereef of Glovers Atoll (Belize, Central America) were created using k-means unsupervised classification on eleven different treatment images constructed from various combinations of optical and acoustic data layers. The maximum benefit of data synergy was achieved by depth correcting the optical bands. The accuracy of maps based on the depth-invariant optical index was not enhanced when E1, E2 or z were added as separate layers but was enhanced when these three acoustic measures were added in concert. Data synergy can improve the accuracy of habitat maps and the availability of both data sets allows practitioners to take advantage of each techniques\' additional strengths such as providing synoptic continuous imagery for education and general management planning (in the case of optical imagery) and maps of reef rugosity (in the case of acoustic data).

It was also assessed how estimated tree height, stem diameter, and tree species were influenced by these differences. The study was based on 412 trees from a boreal forest reserve in Norway. Three different ALS acquisitions were carried out. Leaf-on and leaf-off data were acquired with the Optech ALTM 3100 sensor, and an additional leaf-on dataset was acquired using the Optech ALTM 1233 sensor. Laser echoes located within the vertical projection of the tree crowns were attributed to different echo categories (\"first echoes of many\", \"single echoes\", \"last echoes of many\") and analyzed. The most pronounced changes in laser height distribution from leaf-on to leaf-off were found for the echo categories denoted as \"single\" and \"last echoes of many\" where the distributions were shifted towards the ground under leaf-off conditions. The most pronounced change in the intensity distribution was found for \"first echoes of many\" where the distribution was extremely skewed towards the lower values under leaf-off conditions compared to leaf-on. Furthermore, the echo height and intensity distributions obtained for the two different sensors also differed significantly. Individual tree properties were estimated fairly accurately in all acquisitions with RMSE ranging from 0.76 to 0.84 m for tree height and from 3.10 to 3.17 cm for stem diameter. It was revealed that tree species was an important model term in both and tree height and stem diameter models. A significantly higher overall accuracy of tree species classification was obtained using the leaf-off acquisition (90 vs. 98%) whereas classification accuracy did not differ much between sensors (90 vs. 93%).

We quantify these effects in a linear predictor (X) of four forest inventory attributes (Lorey\'s height HT, basal area BA, volume VOL, and stem density TPH) with LiDAR data acquired over 40 spruce-dominated large plots in southeastern Norway. A grid-based random thinning of the raw multi-echo LiDAR data, to five target densities between 0.25 m(-2) and 2.0 m(-2), generated 100 replications with each density. A DTM was estimated for each replicate and target pulse density. The four linear predictors were constructed from two indicators of canopy density and a posited average effect of a power-transform of echoes classified as canopy returns. Replication variance varied significantly among plots but the reliability ratio of X was high (>= 0.92) for HT, BA and VOL but lower for TPH, especially at low pulse densities. Reliability ratios increased with pulse density. Replication variance attenuated the linear regression coefficients by about 10% and inflated the residual variance by 3-6%. A proposed calibration was effective in reducing the impact of replication effects. A proposed bootstrap procedure can be used in practice to obtain good approximations of the replication variance. With echo-densities of approximately 1 m(-2) or higher the replication effects do not warrant the effort of a calibration. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Accuracy of these models was estimated by cross-validation and by calculating the percentage of correctly classified pixels on the resulting maps. Robustness of this approach was assessed by applying these models to an independent set of images using independent field data for validation. Biophysical parameters of both habitat types were used to interpret the misclassifications. The resulting trees provided a cross-validation accuracy of 98.7% for common reed and 97.4% for submerged macrophytes. Variables discriminating reed marshes from other land covers were the difference in the near-infrared band between March and June, the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index of December, and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) of September. Submerged macrophyte beds were discriminated with the shortwave-infrared band of December, the NDWI of September, the red band of September and the Simple Ratio index of March. Mapping validations provided accuracies of 98.6% (2005) and 98.1% (2006) for common reed, and 86.7% (2005) and 85.9% (2006) for submerged macrophytes. The combination of multispectral and multiseasonal satellite data thus discriminated these wetland vegetation types efficiently. Misclassifications were partly explained by digitizing inaccuracies, and were not related to biophysical parameters for reedbeds. The classification accuracy of submerged macrophytes was influenced by the proportion of plants showing on the water surface, percent cover of submerged species, water turbidity, and salinity. Classification trees applied to time series of SPOT-5 images appear as a powerful and reliable tool for monitoring wetland vegetation experiencing different hydrological regimes even with a small training sample (N = 25) when initially combined with thorough field measurements.

A large history of human use has produced high physiognomic heterogeneity in Mediterranean ecosystems. However, the consequences for ecosystem functioning remain insufficiently understood. We analyzed spectral indicators of matter and energy fluxes in the land surface to classify the functional ecosystem heterogeneity in a Mediterranean region covering different management histories and protection types. We specifically analyzed the spatial variability in seasonal and annual patterns in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), surface temperature (T-s) and albedo from five Landsat ETM images. Then we classified numerically this variability into ecosystem functional types (EFTs) and explored their seasonal dynamics in terms of photosynthetic radiation absorption and evapotranspiration. We identified eight main EFTs with ecologically relevant differences including contrasting dynamics in MAR seasonality, great variation in incoming radiation reflection and differing evapotranspiration rates, particularly during the water-limitation period. Functional variability in natural vegetation mostly consisted in dissimilar annual rates of NDVI and albedo, whereas differences in seasonality were more evident in transformed areas. Similarly, the spatial distribution of EFTs was partly associated to protection, with two EFTs exclusive of protected areas and comparatively higher functional diversity in humanized areas. Landform effects on water availability in protected areas and human activities under different ecological settings were seemingly responsible for the large functional diversity of the region. We advocate for the explicit incorporation of multifunctional ecosystem heterogeneity in ecosystem management and monitoring designs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Modelling DTC is also useful for temporal compositing and for cloud screening. However, an earlier version of the DTC model presented in this article did not capture the smooth and gradual increase of LST around sunrise: this shortcoming is addressed here. Starting from the energy balance equation of the surface, a DTC model is developed which accounts for atmospheric attenuation of solar irradiation, the land surface\'s main heating source. By including total optical thickness (TOT), the new model reproduces the shape of morning rise of LST better, is able to \"squash\" DTC temporally, and more accurately reproduces the natural variability of DTC width and slope. Three different formulations of relative optical air mass are given and a Levenberg-Marquardt minimisation scheme is used to fit the DTC model to time series of LST which are obtained from ground based thermal infrared (TIR) data measured at permanent validation stations near \"Gobabeb Training and Research Centre\", Namibia, and near the town of Evora, Portugal. For turbid atmospheres (transparency 40%) the new model reduces the average deviation between modelled and measured LST by a factor of around three. Statistical analyses of 154 DTCs collected at the two validation sites show that the new DTC model consistently outperforms the earlier version of the model. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A new technique is introduced that characterizes the chlorophyll uncertainty associated with distinct optical water types, and shows that for much of the open ocean the relative error is under 35%. This technique is based on a fuzzy classification of remote sensing reflectance into eight optical water types for which error statistics have been calculated. The error statistics are based on a data set of coincident MODIS Aqua satellite radiances and in situ chlorophyll measurements. The chlorophyll uncertainty is then mapped dynamically based on fuzzy memberships to the optical water types. The uncertainty maps are thus a separate, companion product to the standard MODIS chlorophyll product. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This study assesses the performance of a simplified (i.e. random distribution of vegetation is assumed) version of the Land-SAF algorithm for the estimation of Leaf Area Index (LAI) when prototyped with VEGETATION (processed in CYCLOPES program) and MODIS reflectances. The prototype estimates of LAI are evaluated both by comparison with validated CYCLOPES and MODIS LAI products derived from the same sensors and directly through comparison with ground-based estimates. Emphasis is given on evaluating the impact of the algorithm and input data on LAI retrieval discrepancies. Analysis is achieved over Europe for the 2000-2003 period. The results demonstrate the capacity of the Land-SAF algorithm to retrieve consistent LAI estimates from multiple optical sensors even when their reflectances present systematic differences. High spatial and temporal consistencies between Land-SAF prototype estimates and existing LAI products are found. The differences between Land-SAF and CYCLOPES LAI are lower than their uncertainties (RMSE (relative RMSE) within 0.4 (30%)). Land-SAF prototype estimates and MODIS LAI show larger discrepancies mainly due to differences in the vegetation structure representation and algorithm assumptions (RMSE ranging from 0.2 (30%) up to 0.8 (40%)). Land-SAF prototype provides higher LAI values than MODIS for herbaceous canopies (i.e. shrubs, grasses and crops) and lower values for woody biomes (i.e. savannas and forests). Direct validation indicates that LAI estimates from prototyping of the Land-SAF algorithm with CYCLOPES and MODIS reflectances achieve similar performances (differences with ground measurements are lower than 0.5 LAI units in 60% and 50% of the cases, respectively) as CYCLOPES and MODIS LAI products. Results from this prototyping exercise appear useful for improved retrieval of LAI and constitute a step forward for refinement, validation and consolidation of the Land-SAF algorithm.

Data from the Landsat series of satellites have been successfully applied to map a range of biophysical vegetation parameters at a 30 m spatial resolution; the Landsat 16 day revisit cycle, however, which is often extended due to cloud cover, can be a major obstacle for monitoring short term disturbances and changes in vegetation characteristics through time.   The development of data fusion techniques has helped to improve the temporal resolution of fine spatial resolution data by blending observations from sensors with differing spatial and temporal characteristics. This study introduces a new data fusion model for producing synthetic imagery and the detection of changes termed Spatial Temporal Adaptive Algorithm for mapping Reflectance Change (STAARCH). The algorithm is designed to detect changes in reflectance, denoting disturbance, using Tasseled Cap transformations of both Landsat TM/ETM and MODIS reflectance data. The algorithm has been tested over a 185 x 185 km study area in west-central Alberta, Canada. Results show that STAARCH was able to identify spatial and temporal changes in the landscape with a high level of detail. The spatial accuracy of the disturbed area was 93% when compared to the validation data set, while temporal changes in the landscape were correctly estimated for 87% to 89% of instances for the total disturbed area. The change sequence derived from STAARCH was also used to produce synthetic Landsat images for the study period for each available date of MODIS imagery. Comparison to existing Landsat observations showed that the change sequence derived from STAARCH helped to improve the prediction results when compared to previously published data fusion techniques.

The forward modeling efforts focus on the estimation of diffuse irradiance and upwelling diffuse radiance, and on the formulation of BRDF effects. The inversion scheme consists of four steps, that go deeper and deeper into the phenomena\'s complexity.

Considerable research has been conducted to investigate shadow detection and removal in remotely sensed imagery. Few studies, however, have evaluated how applications of these shadow detection and restoration methods can help eliminate the shadow problem in land cover classification of high spatial resolution images in urban settings. This paper presents a comparison study of three methods for land cover classification of shaded areas from high spatial resolution imagery in an urban environment. Method I combines spectral information in shaded areas with spatial information for shadow classification. Method 2 applies a shadow restoration technique, the linear-correlation correction method to create a \"shadow-free\" image before the classification. Method 3 uses multisource data fusion to aid in classification of shadows. The results indicated that Method 3 achieved the best accuracy, with overall accuracy of 88%. It provides a significantly better means for shadow classification than the other two methods. The overall accuracy for Method 1 was 81.5%, slightly but not significantly higher than the 80.5% from Method 2. All of the three methods applied an object-based classification procedure, which was critical as it provides an effective way to address the problems of radiometric difference and spatial misregistration associated with multisource data fusion (Method 3), and to incorporate thematic spatial information (Method 1).

FPAR (the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the plant canopy) is a critical input to diagnostic models, however little is known about the relative effectiveness of FPAR products from different satellite sensors nor about the sensitivity of flux estimates to different parameterization approaches. In this study, we used multiyear observations of carbon flux at four eddy covariance flux tower sites within the conifer biome to evaluate these factors. FPAR products from the MODIS and SeaWiFS sensors, and the effects of single site vs. cross-site parameter optimization were tested with the CFLUX model. The SeaWiFs FPAR product showed greater dynamic range across sites and resulted in slightly reduced flux estimation errors relative to the MODIS product when using cross-site optimization. With site-specific parameter optimization, the flux model was effective in capturing seasonal and interannual variation in the carbon fluxes at these sites. The cross-site prediction errors were lower when using parameters from a crosssite optimization compared to parameter sets from optimization at single sites. These results support the practice of multisite optimization within a biome or ecoregion for parameterization of diagnostic carbon flux models. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The in situ data for the match-up analyses were collected mostly from non-turbid ocean waters. It is critical to assess and understand the algorithm performance for deriving MODIS ocean color products, providing science and user communities with the important data quality information. Results show that, although the SWIR method for data processing has generally reduced the bias errors, the noise errors are increased due mainly to significantly lower sensor signal-noise ratio (SNR) values for the MODIS SWIR bands, as well as the increased uncertainties using the SWIR method for the atmospheric correction. This has further demonstrated that future ocean color satellite sensors will require significantly improved sensor SNR performance for the SWIR bands.

However, moisture content is also known to have a strong influence on reflectances of soils and sediments. If the effects of sediment composition. grain size and moisture content could be distinguished spectrally, it might be possible to map these properties at synoptic scales using hyperspectral, or perhaps even broadband, remote sensing. Mapping the spatiotemporal distribution of sediment composition and moisture content could provide unique constraints on both the processes by which the sediments are deposited as well as the constraints they may impose on subsequent water flow and sediment transport. The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta (GBD) is formed by the convergence of these two great rivers and is superlative in both size and geologic activity. Sediment redistribution and channel migration associated with the annual floods disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands of people living on the GBD but is also critical for maintaining the delta area fertile and above sea level. The 30+ year archive of Landsat imagery could provide a basis for spatiotemporal analysis of these fluvial dynamics if sediment properties could be inferred or measured from reflectance spectra. However, before confronting the challenge of broadband detection we must understand the spectral properties of the sediments under more controlled laboratory conditions. Bidirectional reflectance spectroscopy of 109 sediment samples from the GBD yields a spectral mixing space that appears to be structured by variations in moisture content, grain size and possibly lithology. Although the individual Empirical Orthogonal Functions of the Principal Components do not correspond to unique absorption features, clustering within the mixing space is clearly influenced by moisture content and grain size. Laboratory spectra of sediment reflectance measured under varying moisture content yield distinct trajectories through the spectral mixing space for different grain size distributions of sieved sediments. These variations in moisture content account for > 98% of spectral variance observed in these samples. Drying trajectories of coarse, fine and mixed sediments are distinct and suggest that moisture and grain size might be spectrally distinguishable. These results are consistent with Angstrom\'s hypothesis of moisture-driven spectral absorption but more controlled experiments are necessary to test the hypothesis rigorously.

The REGularized canopy reFLECtance (REGFLEC) modeling tool couples leaf optics (PROSPECT), canopy reflectance (ACRM), and atmospheric radiative transfer (6SV1) model components, facilitating the direct use of at-sensor radiances in green, red and near-infrared wavelengths for the inverse retrieval of leaf chlorophyll content (C-ab) and total one-sided leaf area per unit ground area (LAI). The inversion of the canopy reflectance model is constrained by assuming limited variability of leaf structure, vegetation clumping, and leaf inclination angle within a given crop field and by exploiting the added radiometric information content of pixels belonging to the same field. A look-up-table with a suite of pre-computed spectral reflectance relationships, each a function of canopy characteristics, soil background effects and external conditions, is accessed for fast pixel-wise biophysical parameter retrievals. Using 1 m resolution aircraft and 10 m resolution SPOT-5 imagery, REGFLEC effectuated robust biophysical parameter retrievals for a corn field characterized by a wide range in leaf chlorophyll levels and intermixed green and senescent leaf material. Validation against in-situ observations yielded relative root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) on the order of 10% for the 1 m resolution LAI (RMSD=0.25) and C-ab (RMSD=4.4 mu g cm(-2)) estimates, due in part to an efficient correction for background influences. LAI and C-ab retrieval accuracies at the SPOT 10 m resolution were characterized by relative RMSDs of 13% (0.3) and 17% (7.1 mu g cm(-2)), respectively, and the overall intrafield pattern in LAI and C-ab was well established at this resolution. The developed method has utility in agricultural fields characterized by widely varying distributions of model variables and holds promise as a valuable operational tool for precision crop management. Work is currently in progress to extend REGFLEC to regional scales.

A novel processing strategy is developed and applied. It uses approximately 1 million ICESat elevation differences at geometrically overlapping footprints of both crossing and repeated tracks. The data are edited using quality flags defined by the ICESat/GLAS science team, as well as other additional criteria. In order to reduce the influence of surface slope, we propose a correction based on the ICESat/GLAS laser altimetry digital elevation model. Three slightly different processing strategies to convert the observed temporal elevation differences to elevation/volume changes are compared for 6 different drainage systems, further divided into regions above and below 2000 m in elevation. The final chosen strategy includes the correction for surface slopes, but does not include the removal of outlying elevation changes. For the region above 2000 m, a positive elevation change rate of 2 cm/year is obtained, which corresponds to a volume change rate of 21 km(3)/year. For the region below 2000 m the estimated elevation change rate is -24 cm/year, which corresponds to a volume loss of 168 km(3)/year. In general, the obtained results are in agreement with trends discovered by other authors that were also derived from laser altimetry. Nevertheless, the estimation obtained in this study suggests a more negative trend than those obtained previously. The differences can be explained by differences in the sampling of the region below 2000 m and, to a certain extent, by different time spans of the datasets used. A representative sampling of coastal areas is identified as the most critical issue for an accurate estimation of volume change rates in Greenland. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

With the increased area of infestation, ecological, environmental and economic concerns about gypsy moth disturbance remain significant, necessitating coordinated, repeatable and comprehensive monitoring of the areas affected. In this study, our primary objective was to estimate the magnitude of defoliation using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery for a gypsy moth outbreak that occurred in the US central Appalachian Mountains in 2000 and 2001. We focused on determining the appropriate spectral MODIS indices and temporal compositing method to best monitor the effects of gypsy moth defoliation. We tested MODIS-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and two versions of the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDIIb6 and NDIIb7, using the channels centered on 1640 turn and 2130 turn respectively) for their capacity to map defoliation as estimated by ground observations. In addition, we evaluated three temporal resolutions: daily, 8-day and 16-day data. We validated the results through quantitative comparison to Landsat based defoliation estimates and traditional sketch maps. Our MODIS based defoliation estimates based on NDIIb6 and NDIIb7 closely matched Landsat defoliation estimates derived from field data as well as sketch maps. We conclude that daily MODIS data can be used with confidence to monitor insect defoliation on an annual time scale, at least for larger patches (> 0.63 km(2)). Eight-day and 16-day MODIS composites may be of lesser use due to the ephemeral character of disturbance by the gypsy moth. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[de Beurs, K.

Two experimental sites were used in our study, the oceanside of a M. cerifera thicket, which is exposed to sea spray, and the protected, leeside of the thicket. Using the physiological reflectance index (PRI), we were able to detect stress at both the canopy and landscape level. Monthly variations in stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, and relative water content indicated a strong summer drought response that was not apparent in chlorophyll fluorescence or in the water band index (WBI) derived from canopy and airborne reflectance measurements. In contrast, there were significant differences in both physiological measurements and tissue chlorides between the two sites used in the study, indicating salinity stress. This was reflected in measurements of PRI. There was a positive relationship between PRI measured at the canopy-level and light-adapted fluorescence (Delta F/F\'(m),: r(2) = 0.69). PRI was significantly lower on the oceanside of the Myrica cerifera thicket. PRI was not significantly related to NDVI (r(2)=0.01) at the canopy-level and only weakly related (r(2)=0.04) at the landscape-level, suggesting that the indices are independent. The chlorophyll index (CI) did not show any significant changes between the two sites. Frequency histograms of pixels sampled from airborne hyperspectral imagery revealed that the distribution of PRI was shifted to the right on the backside of the thicket relative to the oecanside and there was a significant difference between sites. These results suggest that PRI may be used for early identification of salt-stress and to identify areas across the landscape where community structure may change due to sea-level rise.

The proposed method relates the DSLR directly to the TOA radiances in the MODIS Thermal InfraRed (TIR) channels provided that the terrain altitude and the satellite Viewing Zenith Angle (VZA) are known. The simulation analysis shows that the instantaneous DSLR could be estimated by the proposed method with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 12.4 W/m(2) for VZA=0 and terrain altitude z=0 km. Similar results are obtained for the other VZAs and altitudes. Considering the MODIS instrumental errors of 0.25 K for the TOA brightness temperatures in channels 28, 33 and 34, and of 0.05 K for channels 29 and 31, and of 0.35 K for channel 36, the overall retrieval accuracy in terms of the RMSE is decreased to 13.1 W/m(2) for the instantaneous DSLR. Moreover, a comparison of MODIS derived DSLR and NSLR are done with the field measurements made at six sites of the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) in the United States for days with cloud-free conditions at the moment of MODIS overpass in 2006.

Retrieved distributions of crown cover, mean canopy height, and aboveground woody biomass for forested areas showed good matches with maps from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service, with R-2 values of 0.78, 0.69, and 0.81, and absolute mean errors of 0.10, 2.2 m, and 4.5 tons acre(-1) (10.1 Mg ha(-1)), respectively, after filtering for high root mean square error (RMSE) on model fitting, the effects of topographic shading, and the removal of a small number of outliers. This is the first use of data from the MISR instrument to produce maps of crown cover, canopy height, and woody biomass over a large area by seeking to exploit the structural effects of canopies reflected in the observed anisotropy patterns in these explicitly multiangle data.

The present study was carried out in the framework of the Swiss Mire Protection Program, where increase and decrease of forest areas are key issues. In a first step, automatic DSMs were generated using an image matching approach from CIR aerial images of 1997 and 2002. In a second step, the DSMs were co-registered and normalized using LiDAR data. Tree layers from both years of various levels of detail were then generated combining canopy covers derived from normalized DSMs with a multi-resolution segmentation and a frizzy classification. On the basis of these tree layers, fractional tree/shrub covers were calculated using explanatory variables derived from these DSMs only. Bias was estimated by analysing the distribution of the fractional model differences. The corrected models reveal a decrease of tree/shrub probability which indicates a decrease of forest and other wooded areas between 1997 and 2002. The models also indicate real shrub encroachment in open mire. The detection of shrub encroachment may be helpful for selective logging purposes for sustainable mire habitat management. The study stresses the importance of high-resolution and high-quality DSMs and highlights the potential of fractional covers for ecological modeling. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

However, the altimetric signal is sensitive to different properties of the snowpack, and therefore can also be used to determine these properties. The radar altimeter onboard the European Space Agency\'s ENVISAT satellite provides a dual-frequency dataset at Ku (13.6 GHz) and S band (3.2 GHz). In this paper, these signals are studied over the Antarctic ice-sheet during the 4 first years of the mission (2002-2006), in order to retrieve snowpack properties.   The altimeter signal can be described by 4 classical waveform parameters. The 4 year time-series of all these parameters are decomposed into a linear and a seasonal time component. The linear component is almost constant. The distribution of the mean parameters over the Antarctic ice-sheet shows that the altimeter signal is sensitive to small-scale (mm) surface roughness.   For the first time, the amplitudes and phases of the seasonal variations are characterized. The S band amplitudes are greater than the Ku band, and the phase varies over the entire ice-sheet. Previous studies suggested that the seasonal variations of the altitude from the altimeter are created by a decrease of the snowpack height through compaction. The dual-frequency observations shown here suggest that this hypothesis is too simple. Instead, the altitude variations observed in the altimetric signal are not created by the snowpack height change, but are more likely caused by the seasonal change of the snow properties, which cause a different response between the S and Ku bands. Therefore, both the linear and the seasonal variations of the altimetric signal can be used to retrieve snowpack properties.   Here, we compare the dual-frequency ENVISAT signal with a model of the altimetric echo over the Antarctic ice-sheet. The model combines a surface model with a sub-surface model, for both the S and Ku bands. The Brown model [Brown G. S. (1977). The average impulse response of a rough surface and its applications. IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, 25, 1.] is used to describe the interaction of the radar wave with the snow surface. The backscatter coefficient of the surface is derived using the IEM method [Fung, A. K. (1994). Microwave scattering and emission models and their applications, Boston, MA: Artech House.]. The sub-surface signal takes into account both the layering effects and the scattering caused by the homogeneous media which is composed of small snow grains. The model is tested in two areas of the Antarctic plateau which present very different waveform parameters. The sensitivity of the radar signal to the different snowpack properties is investigated. The analysis of the waveform behaviours shows that the sub-surface signal can be completely :masked by the small-scale surface roughness signal.   Finally, the temperature and surface density effects are investigated in order to explain the seasonal variations of the altimetric signal. Both the temperature and the compaction rate of the snow change seasonally. Temperature is shown to impact on the Ku band signal. Furthermore; the compaction rate of the snow surface can explain all of the seasonal variation characteristics observed at both the S and Ku bands. The seasonal change of compaction rate in the snow creates a change in the waveform shape that can bias the altitude. In particular, the snow compaction can induce a bias in the retrieved altimetric altitude of more than 80 cm for the Ku band and 1.5 m for the S band. This work underlines that the altitude time-series needs to be corrected for the shape of the altimetric echo over ice-sheets. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Photon recollision probability p allows to calculate easily the spectral behavior of canopy scattering, i.e. the sum of canopy reflectance and transmittance. However, to divide the scattered radiation into reflected and transmitted fluxes, additional models are needed. In this paper, we present a simple formula to estimate the fraction of radiation scattered upwards by a canopy. The new method is semi-empirical, makes use of the concept of photon recollision probability, and is derived from an analysis of modeling results. Although a physical interpretation is given for the single additional parameter needed in the formula, the scattering asymmetry parameter q, the method is not strictly based on the radiative transfer equation. Our results indicate that the method is accurate for low to moderate leaf area index (LAI) values, and provides a reasonable approximation even at LAI=8. In addition, we present a method to compute p using numerical radiative transfer models. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Mottus, Matti] Tartu Observ, EE-61602 Tartu, Estonia.

Spatial and temporal homogenisation of the various input data sets is carried out, including meteorological point measurements from stations, numerical weather predictions, and snow maps from satellites. The meteorological data are downscaled to match the scale of the snow products, derived from optical satellite images of MODIS and from radar images of Envisat ASAR. Snow maps from SAR and optical imagery reveal systematic differences which need to be compensated for use in snowmelt models. We applied a semi-distributed model to demonstrate the use of satellite snow cover data for short-term runoff forecasting. During the snowmelt periods 2005 and 2006 daily runoff forecasts were made for the drainage basin Otztal (Austrian Alps) for time lags up to 6 days. Because satellite images were obtained intermittently, prognostic equations were applied to predict the daily snow cover extent for model update. Runoff forecasting uncertainty is estimated by using not only deterministic meteorological predictions as input, but also 51 ensemble predictions of the EPS system of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast. This is particularly important for water management tasks, because meteorological forecasts are the main error source for runoff prediction, as confirmed by simulation studies with modified input data from the various sources. Evaluation of the runoff forecasts reveals good agreement with the measurements, confirming the usefulness of the selected data processing and assimilation scheme for operational use.

While assimilation of remotely sensed surface soil moisture is a proven approach for improving root zone soil moisture, and presumably latent (LE) and sensible (H) heat flux predictions from LSMs, limitations in model physics and over-parameterisation mean that physically realistic soil moisture in LSMs will not necessarily achieve optimal heat flux predictions. Moreover, the potential for improved LE and H predictions from the assimilation of LE and H observations has received little attention by the scientific community, and is tested here with synthetic twin experiments. A one-dimensional single column LSM was used in 3-month long experiments, with observations of LE, H, surface soil moisture and skin temperature (from which LE and H are typically derived) sampled from truth model run outputs generated with realistic data inputs. Typical measurement errors were prescribed and observation data sets separately assimilated into a degraded model run using an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) algorithm, over temporal scales representative of available remotely sensed data. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between assimilation and truth model outputs across the experiment period were examined to evaluate LE, H, and root zone soil moisture and temperature retrieval. Compared to surface soil moisture assimilation as will be available from SMOS (every 3 days), assimilation of LE and/or H using a best case MODIS scenario (twice daily) achieved overall better predictions for LE and comparable H predictions, while achieving poorer soil moisture predictions. Twice daily skin temperature assimilation achieved comparable heat flux predictions to LE and/or H assimilation. Fortnightly (Landsat) assimilations of LE, H and skin temperature performed worse than 3-day moisture assimilation. While the different spatial resolutions of these remote sensing data have been ignored, the potential for LE and H assimilation to improve model predicted LE and H is clearly demonstrated.

The LDAS consists of a land surface scheme as the model operator, a radiative transfer model as the observation operator, and the simulated annealing method for minimizing the difference between the observed and simulated microwave brightness temperature. The atmospheric model produces forcing data for the LDAS, and the LDAS produces better initial surface conditions for the modelling system. This coupled system can take into account land surface heterogeneities through assimilating satellite data for a better precipitation prediction. To assess the effectiveness of the new system, 3-dimensional numerical experiments were carried out in a mesoscale area of the Tibetan Plateau during the wet monsoon season. The results show significant improvement compared with a no assimilation regional atmospheric model simply nested from the global model. The surface soil moisture content and its distribution from the assimilation system were more consistent to in situ observations. These better surface conditions affect the land-atmosphere interactions through convection systems and lead to better atmospheric predictability as confirmed by satellite-based cloud observations and in situ sounding observations. Through the use of satellite brightness temperature, the developed coupled land-atmosphere assimilation system has shown potential ability to provide better initial surface conditions and its inputs to the atmosphere and to improve physical downscaling through regional models.

Technical issues related to the longevity and quality of the Landsat-5 and -7 instruments prompted this investigation into how data from other sensors may be integrated with the existing Landsat image archive. Change maps indicating the location and extent of stand replacing disturbances occurring between 1999 and 2004 were developed using a rank-order change detection approach. The near-infrared (NIR) band from an image representing initial stand conditions (T1: Landsat-7 ETM+), and the NIR band of images acquired on subsequent dates and with different sensors (T2: ASTER, SPOT-4, and Landsat-5 TM) were selected, essentially acting as three different T2 images. Pair-wise comparisons between the T1 image and each of the T2 images required the pixel values to be sorted. ranked, and differenced; a threshold was then applied to the difference values to identify the stand replacing disturbances. The rank-order change detection approach precluded the need for an additional image normalization process. When compared to a manually interpreted map of change events, the output from the ASTER, SPOT-4, and Landsat-5 TM data were all equally effective in identifying all of the stand replacing disturbances that occurred between 1999 and the year of T2 image acquisition, and errors of commission were minimal. Important logistical limitations to cross-sensor change do exist however and include the lack of spatially or temporally extensive image archives for sensors other than Landsat, incompatible image footprints, and data cost and policy. This rank-order change detection approach is suitable for applications involving multi-temporal datasets where problems may exist due to image normalization, cross-sensor radiometric calibration, or unavailability of a desired sensor type.

In this study, the spatio-temporal evolution of root zone soil moisture of the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW) in Arizona was investigated during the Soil Moisture Experiment 2004 (SMEX04). Root zone soil moisture was estimated via assimilation of aircraft-based remotely sensed surface soil moisture into a distributed Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant (SWAP) model. An ensemble square root filter (EnSRF) based on a Kalman filtering scheme was used for assimilating the aircraft-based soil moisture observations at a spatial resolution of 800 m x 800 m. The SWAP model inputs were derived from the SSURGO soil database, LAI (Leaf Area Index) data from SMEX04 database, and data from meteorological stations/rain gauges at the WGEW. Model predictions are presented in terms of temporal evolution of soil moisture probability density function at various depths across the WGEW. The assimilation of the remotely sensed surface soil moisture observations had limited influence on the profile soil moisture. More specifically, root zone soil moisture depended mostly on the soil type. Modeled soil moisture profile estimates were compared to field measurements made periodically during the experiment at the ground based soil moisture stations in the watershed. Comparisons showed that the ground-based soil moisture observations at various depths were within +/-1 standard deviation of the modeled profile soil moisture. Density plots of root zone soil moisture at various depths in the WGEW exhibited multi-modal variations due to the uneven distribution of precipitation and the heterogeneity of soil types and soil layers across the watershed.

These observations are currently provided by moderate resolution sensor (with pixel size ranging from 250 m to 10 km). However, the intra-pixel spatial heterogeneity which may be important at moderate resolution, induces a scaling bias on non-linear estimation processes of land surface variable. A possible strategy to correct this scaling bias consists in using variogram model of high spatial resolution data (e.g. SPOT/HRV 20 m) as a proxy for the spatial heterogeneity within moderate resolution pixel. However, ways have to be found to get prior knowledge of this intra-pixel spatial heterogeneity metric without systematic concurrent high spatial resolution images. This paper aims at proposing a spatio-temporal model of the variogram of high spatial resolution data, which enables us to retrieve the spatial heterogeneity within moderate spatial resolution pixel using a temporal sampling of few high spatial resolution scenes. It capitalizes on variogram modeling of a time series of high spatial resolution NDVI images to quantify and model the temporal changes in landscape spatial heterogeneity over a particular crop site (Fundulea, Romania). We first demonstrate that important temporal variations in surface spatial heterogeneity observed over an agricultural site mainly result from the shift in seasonal trajectories between crop classes (here winter versus summer crops). The mean length scale as measured by the variogram integral range is mainly influenced by the gathering of fields with similar NDVI values. The scene overall spatial variability and the spatial heterogeneity within moderate resolution pixels, as quantified by the variogram. sill and the dispersion variance, respectively, increase with the difference in NDVI between winter and summer crops. The influence of surface spatial heterogeneity on the description of land surface processes is thus critical when the phenological variability between crop classes is maximum, suggesting that the number of high spatial resolution scenes should increase at these periods of the seasonal cycle. Then, based on these observations, we build a model describing the temporal course of surface spatial heterogeneity, i.e. the temporal trajectory of the variogram of high spatial resolution NDVI image, as a function of crop seasonality. Once calibrated from a temporal sampling of few high spatial resolution scenes, this model proves to be powerful to predict the variogram at a date at which the high spatial resolution scene is not available and thus to retrieve the spatial heterogeneity within moderate resolution pixels through the seasonal cycle within a mean relative uncertainty of 20%.

Journal of Applied Meteorology, 29, 851-862.] is evaluated and extended for use in atmospheric correction and surface irradiance calculation schemes. Thermal infrared split window channels at 10.8 and 12.0 gm of the MSG-SEVIRI (Meteosat Second Generation-Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager) instrument are used. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of the improved measurement capabilities of the MSG-SEVIRI instrument with its 15 min temporal resolution and its radiometric accuracy of 0.25 K and 0.37 K in the 10.8 and 12.0 gm channels. The temporal resolution allows exploitation of the daily land surface temperature variation. There is no further need for explicit auxiliary information on air and land surface temperatures, which is difficult to obtain on an operational basis. Updated coefficients for the split window parameterization are derived based on simulations of \'top-of-atmosphere\' SEVIRI brightness temperatures for the globally representative Thermodynamic Initial Guess Retrieval (TIGR3) set of radiosonde profiles. It turns out that the linear dependency on the transmission ratio in both split window channels as originally proposed by Kleespies & McMillin [Kleespies, J.T., McMillin L.M. (1990). Retrieval of precipitable water from observations in the Split Window over varying surface temperatures. Journal of Applied Meteorologv, 29, 851-862.] has to be extended towards a non-linear approach in order to make it applicable to the full range of global atmospheric conditions. Sensitivity studies reveal that the parameterization relies on the availability of input brightness temperatures with a variation larger than approximately 5 K during the daily cycle. The new TWC algorithm was tested with MSG-SEVIRI data for European and African regions for the period March-August 2004 and compared with radiosonde data. The results show that the algorithm is capable of producing TWC values with a mean bias of -0.2 min and an RMSE of 6.8 min. From the total amount of 2583 coincidences for all viewing zenith angles both for winter and summer conditions, 82% were within a 5 min and 94% were within a 10 min difference interval between MSG-based and radiosonde-based TWC. A second comparison to European GPS measurements for the same period from March to August 2004 reveals a bias of -3.0 mm and an RMSE of 6.0 mm. This result is obtained for 11 UTC GPS measurements which proved to match best the MSG-TWC values. Comparing MSG-TWC to daily cloud-free mean GPS values shows a lower bias of -2.56 min and an increased RMSE of 6.6 mm. These findings support the usefulness of the new MSG-based algorithm for surface irradiance calculations and atmospheric correction purposes. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Particularly, it uses two statistical tools - Pearson\'s r and Moran\'s I - to define relationships of several topographic attributes with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII), and their seasonal changes (from May to July and then September) in the Mediterranean-type landscape of the Santa Monica Mountains, California. The analyses are conducted at both the original data resolution and 20 aggregated resolutions, covering a total range of 30 m to 1500 m, so that topography-vegetation relationships can be compared at different scales. Large sample sizes have supported the significance of the following main findings for this landscape. First, elevation, slope, and southness are the most relevant primary topographic attributes among the tested attributes and their importance changes across seasons. Second, NDVI, NDII, and their seasonal variations have notably different relationships (including no relationship) with topography. Third, the observed topography-vegetation correlations (r) tend to change - typically increase - with the coarsening of spatial scale. Lastly, the spatial autocorrelation of vegetation variables and topographic attributes are often comparable, and the comparability is more apparent when topography-vegetation correlations are stronger. In all, the topography-NDVI/NDII relations defined in this paper may improve the understanding of the multi-scale and property-specific role that mountain topography plays in the formation and seasonal change of vegetation patterns.

Concurrent ground measurements of surface temperature, emissivity, and atmospheric radiosonde profiles were collected at the test site, which is a thermally homogeneous area of rice crops with nearly full vegetation cover in summer. Using the ground data and the local radiosonde profiles, at-sensor radiances were simulated for the ASTER TIR channels and compared with LIB data (calibrated at-sensor radiances) showing discrepancies up to 3% in radiance for channel 10 at 8.3 mu m (equivalently, 2.5 degrees C in temperature or 7% in emissivity), whereas channel 13 (10.7 mu m) yielded a closer agreement (maximum difference of 0.5% in radiance or 0.4 degrees C in temperature). We also tested the ASTER standard products of land surface temperature (LST) and spectral emissivity generated with the Temperature-Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm with standard atmospheric correction from both global data assimilation system profiles and climatology profiles. These products showed anomalous emissivity spectra with lower emissivity values and larger spectral contrast (or maximum-minimum emissivity difference, MMD) than expected, and as a result, overestimated LSTs. In this work, a scene-based procedure is proposed to obtain more accurate MMD estimates for low spectral contrast materials (vegetation and water) and therefore a better retrieval of LST and emissivity with the TES algorithm. The method uses various gray-bodies or near gray-bodies with known emissivities and assumes that the calibration and atmospheric correction performed with local radiosonde data are accurate for channel 13. Taking the channel 13 temperature (atmospherically and emissivity corrected) as the true LST, the radiances for the other channels were simulated and used to derive linear relationships between ASTER digital numbers and at-ground radiances for each channel. The TES algorithm was applied to the adjusted radiances and the resulting products showed a closer agreement with the ground measurements (differences lower than 1% in channel 13 emissivities and within +/- 0.3 degrees C in temperature for rice and sea pixels).

We assessed the potential of Fourier-based textural ordination (FOTO) to estimate mangrove forest biomass from very high resolution (VHR) IKONOS images. The FOTO method computes texture indices of canopy grain by performing a standardized principal component analysis (PCA) on the Fourier spectra obtained for image windows of adequate size. For two distinct study sites in French Guiana, FOTO indices derived from a I m panchromatic channel were able to consistently capture the whole gradient of canopy grain observed from the youngest to decaying stages of mangrove development, without requiring any intersite image correction. In addition, a multiple linear regression based on the three main textural indices yielded accurate predictions of mangrove total aboveground biomass. Since FOTO indices did not saturate for high biomass values, predictions were furthermore unbiased, even for levels above 450 t of dry matter per hectare. Maps of canopy texture (with RGB coding) and biomass were then produced over 8000 ha of unexplored, low accessibility mangrove. Applying the FOTO method to the 4 m near-infrared channel yielded acceptable results with some limitations for characterization of juvenile mangrove types. We finally discuss the influence of technical aspects pertaining to VHR images and to FOTO implementation (especially the size of the window used to compute Fourier spectra) and we evoke the interesting prospect of broad regional validity offered by the method to characterize high biomass tropical forest from standardized measures of canopy grain.

Differencing single band indices derived from multispectral pre- and post-fire images is one of the most frequently used change detection algorithms. In this paper we examine a commonly used index used in mapping fire effects due to wildland fire. Subtracting a post-fire from a pre-fire image derived index produces a measure of absolute change which then can be used to estimate total carbon release, biomass loss, smoke production, etc. Measuring absolute change however, may be inappropriate when assessing ecological impacts. In a pixel with a sparse tree canopy for example, differencing a vegetation index will measure a small change due stand-replacing fire. Similarly, differencing will produce a large change value in a pixel experiencing stand-replacing fire that had a dense pre-fire tree canopy. If all stand-replacing fire is defined as severe fire, then thresholding an absolute change image derived through image differencing to produce a categorical classification of burn severity can result in misclassification of low vegetated pixels. Misclassification of low vegetated pixels also happens when classifying severity in different vegetation types within the same fire perimeter with one set of thresholds. Comparisons of classifications derived from thresholds of dNBR and relative dNBR data for individual fires may result in similar classification accuracies. However, classifications of relative dNBR data can produce higher accuracies on average for the high burn severity category than dNBR classifications derived from a universal set of thresholds applied across multiple fires. This is important when mapping historic fires where precise field based severity data may not be available to aid in classification. Implementation of a relative index will also allow a more direct comparison of severity between fires across space and time which is important for landscape level analysis. In this paper we present a relative version of dNBR based upon field data from 14 fires in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California, USA. The methods presented may have application to other types of disturbance events. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', 'USDA Forest Serv, Mcclellan, CA 95652 USA.

Their synergistic use could greatly benefit the broad user community by ensuring a global view of the Earth with high-quality products. A necessary condition for data fusion is radiometric calibration agreement between the two instruments. Earlier studies showed about 3% absolute radiometric difference between MISR and respective MODIS land bands in the visible and near-IR spectrum, which are also used in aerosol and cloud research. This study compared two surface albedo products derived from MODIS and MISR LIB data using the AERONET-based Surface Reflectance Validation Network (ASRVN). The ASRVN shows a positive MISR-MODIS albedo bias of + (0.01-0.03). Cross-sensor calibration inconsistencies were identified as a primary cause of the albedo biases. To establish an independent MODIS-MISR calibration link, top-of-atmosphere MODIS and MISR reflectances were regressed against each other over liquid water clouds. The empirical regression results have been adjusted for the differences in the respective MISR and MODIS spectral responses using radiative transfer simulations. The MISR-MODIS band gain differences for the top-of-atmosphere reflectance estimated with this technique are +6.0% in the Blue, +3.3% in the Green, +2.7% in the Red, and +0.8% in the NIR band. Applying the derived values to rescale the MODIS or MISR LIB data is shown to significantly reduce the cross-sensor ASRVN surface albedo biases. An absolute calibration scale for both sensors could be established based on independent ground-based measurements of the surface albedo at selected AERONET sites. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

MODIS data are used to retrieve the aerosol optical thickness, whereas MISR data are first used to determine the surface properties on the clear day, and then to retrieve aerosol absorption on hazy days by using the derived surface properties as the ground boundary condition. The method is applied to two extreme cases of absorption in biomass burning situations: One case over Mongu (South Africa) and the other over Alta Floresta (Brazil).

The objective is to generate LAI data that is appropriate for numerical weather prediction. A series of techniques and procedures which includes data quality control, time-series data smoothing, and simple data analysis is applied. The LAI analysis is an optimal combination of the MODIS observations and derived climatology, depending on their associated errors sigma(o) and sigma(c). The \"best estimate\" LAI is derived from a simple three-point smoothing technique combined with a selection of maximum LAI (after data quality control) values to ensure a higher quality. The LAI climatology is a time smoothed mean value of the \"best estimate\" LAI during the years of 2002-2004. The observation error is obtained by comparing the MODIS observed LAI with the \"best estimate\" of the LAI, and the climatological error is obtained by comparing the \"best estimate\" of LAI with the climatological LAI value. The LAI analysis is the result of a weighting between these two errors. Demonstration of the method described in this paper is presented for the 15-km grid of Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC)\'s regional version of the numerical weather prediction model. The final LAI analyses have a relatively smooth temporal evolution, which makes them more appropriate for environmental prediction than the original MODIS LAI observation data. They are also more realistic than the LAI data currently used operationally at the MSC which is based on land-cover databases. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

As more than 50% of the human population lives in cities, urbanization has become an important contributor for global warming. Pearl River Delta (PRD) in Guangdong Province, southern China, is one of the regions experiencing rapid urbanization that has resulted in remarkable Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, which will be sure to influence the regional climate, environment, and socio-economic development. In this study, Landsat TM and ETM+ images from 1990 to 2000 in the PRD were selected to retrieve the brightness temperatures and land use/cover types. A new index, Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBaI), was proposed to extract bare land from the satellite images. Additionally, Shenzhen, which has experienced the fastest urbanization in Guangdong Province, was taken as an example to analyze the temperature distribution and changes within a large city as its size expanded in the past decade. Results show that the UHI effect has become more prominent in areas of rapid urbanization in the PRD region. The spatial distribution of heat islands has been changed from a mixed pattern, where bare land, semi-bare land and land under development were warmer than other surface types, to extensive UHI. Our analysis showed that higher temperature in the UHI was located with a scattered pattern, which was related to certain land-cover types. In order to analyze the relationship between UHI and land-cover changes, this study attempted to employ a quantitative approach in exploring the relationship between temperature and several indices, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBaI) and Normalized Difference Build-up Index (NDBI). It was found that correlations between NDVI, NDWI, NDBaI and temperature are negative when NDVI is limited in range, but positive correlation is shown between NDBI and temperature.

It was shown that the integral of the Ratio Vegetation Index (iRVI) during the rain season was the most suitable index to estimate herbaceous biomass (R-2=0.69). Next, the performance of single, greenness, and accumulated remotely sensed fire risk indices, related to vegetation water content, were evaluated using fire activity data. The Accumulated Relative Normalised Difference Vegetation Index Decrement (ARND) performed the best when estimating fire risk (c-index=0.76). Finally, results confirmed that the assessment of fire risk was improved by combination of both the vegetation biomass (iRVI) and vegetation water content (ARND) related indices (c-index =0.80).

Neither the Hyperion nor the combined ALI+ASTER datasets had sufficient information dimensionality for mapping the diverse range of surface materials exposed on the Altiplano.

The reflectance directional signatures are quantified by the three parameters of a modified version of the Ross-Li reflectance model. The variability of the estimated parameters with respect to the seven MODIS biome classes was found to be higher within the classes than between classes, with the exception of the desert targets that show more isotropic reflectances. A limited number of standard BRDFs (typically 5 in the red and near infrared) capture most of the variability of the directional reflectance measurements, supporting the idea that different land surfaces have similar directional signatures. Over vegetation targets, they are characterized by a strong increase toward backscattering and much smaller variations in forward directions. The results express the diversity in structural situations within a given biome class and indicate that, at the resolution of the POLDER sensor, i.e. a few kilometers, the BRDF contains little information on the dominant vegetation type. We show that standard directional signatures may be used to correct the reflectance measurements for directional effects with an RMS error on the order of 0.011 in the red and 0.015 in the near infrared.

Retrievable quantities include aerosol amount over a wide variety of surfaces (including bright targets); aerosol microphysical properties such as particle shape; geometrically-derived cloud-top heights and 3-D cloud morphologies; distinctions between polar clouds and ice; and textural measures of sea ice, ice sheets, and vegetation. At the same time, multiangle data are necessary for accurate retrievals of radiative quantities such as surface and top-of-atmosphere albedos, whose magnitudes are governed by structural characteristics of the reflecting media and which involve angular integration over intrinsically anisotropic intensity fields. Measurements of directional radiation streams also provide independent checks on model assumptions conventionally used in satellite retrievals, such as the application of 1-D radiative transfer theory, and provide data required to constrain more sophisticated, 3-D approaches. In this paper, the value of multiangle remote sensing in establishing physical correspondence and self-consistency between scene structural and radiative characteristics is demonstrated using simultaneous observations from instruments aboard NASA\'s Terra satellite (MISR, CERES, ASTER, and MODIS).

For Chl ranging between 0.4 to 4 mg m(-3) the ratio between MODIS FLH and in situ Chl is about 0.1 W m(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1) per mg m(-3) chlorophyll (Chl = 1.255 (FLH x 10)(0.86), r = 0.92, n = 77). In contrast, the band-ratio chlorophyll product of either MODIS or SeaWiFS in this complex coastal environment provided false information. Errors in the satellite Chl data can be both negative and positive (3 - 15 times higher than in situ Chl) and these data are often inconsistent either spatially or temporally, due to interferences of other water constituents. The red tide that formed from November to December 2004 off SW Florida was revealed by MODIS FLH imagery, and was confirmed by field sampling to contain medium (10(4) to 10(5) cells L-1) to high (> 10(5) cells L-1) concentrations of the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis. The FLH imagery also showed that the bloom started in mid-October south of Charlotte Harbor, and that it developed and moved to the south and southwest in the subsequent weeks. Despite some artifacts in the data and uncertainty caused by factors such as unknown fluorescence efficiency, our results show that the MODIS FLH data provide an unprecedented tool for research and managers to study and monitor algal blooms in coastal environments.

It demonstrates how valuable, and otherwise unattainable, spatially distributed and timely baseline data can be obtained using basic remote sensing techniques. It further shows how these data can be combined to retrieve information pertaining to the hydro-ecological relationships in the wetland. The study was conducted in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), which is a large wetland complex in northeastern Alberta, Canada. Combinations of Radarsat Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical satellite images (Landsat or SPOT multispectral) were used to generate a time-series of flood maps for the six-year period, 1996 to 2001. These maps clearly depict the extent of the 1996 and 1997 overland, floods and the subsequent water level draw down. A flood duration map that shows how long each image cell was inundated was generated by combining the series of flood maps. The flood duration map highlights regions where the duration of flooding appears to be highest or lowest. Such maps are invaluable for any ecological change detection protocols that may be developed for this region. The general vegetation patterns were also mapped using multi-temporal SPOT-4 images from the summer season (May and August) of 2001 to an accuracy of 86%. By comparing the vegetation and flood duration maps, the relationship between vegetation patterns and duration of flooding could be examined. Results indicated that basins inundated for longer periods (3-5 years) were dominated by relatively more productive graminoid (grass-like) vegetation, whereas, areas flooded for less than two years were characterised by less productive shrub vegetation. Airborne scanning LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data from the summer (June) of 2000 were also used to generate a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of selected non-flooded areas. LiDAR DEM accuracy was satisfactory (Root Mean Square Error of 0.24 m) and it proved to be sufficiently detailed to detect the subtle topographic patterns in this relatively flat region. Comparison of the vegetation map to the DEM demonstrated that the shrubs were located in areas that were, on average, between 0.5 m (in south) and 0.73 m (in north) higher than the graminoid covered regions. Notwithstanding other parameters that influence the distribution of vegetation, these results indicate that flood duration and elevation are two important factors. The usefulness of these spatial databases recommends the timely generation of flood and vegetation maps in the continued monitoring of the changes and relationships in this delta.

The relationships between backscattering coefficients and soil parameters were examined by means of 16 ASAR images and several field campaigns. We have found that HH and HV polarizations are more sensitive than VV polarization to Surface roughness. The results also show that the radar signal is more sensitive to surface roughness at high incidence angle (43). However, the dynamics of the radar signal as a function of soil roughness are weak for root mean square (rms) surface heights between 0.5 cm and 3.50 cm (only 3 dB for lift polarization and 43 incidence angle). The estimation of soil moisture is optimal at low and medium incidence angles (20 37). The backscattering coefficient is more sensitive to volumetric soil moisture in Fill polarization than in HV polarization, In fact. the results show that the depolarization ratio sigma(0)(HH)/sigma(0)(HV) is weakly dependent on the roughness condition, whatever the radar incidence. On the other hand, we observe a linear relationship between the ratio sigma(0)(HH)/sigma(0)(HV) and the soil moisture. The backscattering coefficient ratio between a low and it high incidence angle decreases with the rms surface height, and minimizes the effect of the soil moisture. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Surface reflection (SR) and signal propagation times (PT) were used to independently determine dielectric permittivity and water content of soil and canopy. Measured surface reflection coefficients progressively decreased with increasing canopy biomass according to Beer-Lambert type relationships. In contrast, PT measurements remained unaffected by canopy, and hence provided an accurate account of soil water content dynamics. Immediately after canopy removal, SR-based soil water content measurements were in close agreement with PT values. Canopy dielectric properties were inferred from canopy water contents (epsilon(c-CWC)) and canopy propagation times (epsilon(c-CPT)). Distinct canopy reflections were correlated with key canopy biophysical parameters. The study demonstrates the usefulness of a horn antenna GPR for characterization of vegetation canopy scattering, and for subcanopy water content measurements within a well-defined footprint, thereby offering a potential for calibration and verification of radar data collected from air- and spaceborne platforms.

This study evaluated spring snow cover depletion in the NOAA daluset over a study area in the Canadian Arctic mainland north of the tree line. The evaluation used four sources of information: (1) surface snow depth and snow survey observations, (2) snow cover extent produced from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), (3) snow cover extent derived from Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I), and (4) Landsat 5 TM browse images. Six spring seasons from the period 1981-2000 with low (1984, 1988, and 1998) and high (1985, 1995, and 1997) spring snow cover extent were evaluated. The evaluation revealed that the NOAA weekly dataset consistently overestimated snow cover extent during the spring melt period, with delays of up to 4 weeks in melt onset. A number of possible reasons for this delay were investigated. The most likely causes for the delayed melt onset were frequent cloud cover in the spring melt period, and the low frequency of data coverage over higher latitudes. The results suggest that caution should be exercised when using this dataset in any studies related to the timing of snowmelt in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Correction schemes require spatially distributed estimates of vegetation water content at scales comparable to that of the microwave sensor footprint (10(1) to 10(4) in). This study compares the relative utility of high-resolution (1.5 in) aircraft and coarser-resolution (30 in) Landsat imagery in upscaling an extensive set of ground-based measurements of canopy biophysical properties collected during the Soil Moisture Experiment of 2002 (SMEX02) within the Walnut Creek Watershed. The upscaling was accomplished using expolinear relationships developed between spectral vegetation indices and measurements of leaf area index, canopy height, and vegetation water content. Of the various indices examined, a Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), derived from near- and shortwave-infrared reflectances, was found to be least susceptible to saturation at high levels of leaf area index. With the aircraft data set, which did not include a short-wave infrared water absorption band, the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) yielded best correlations with observations and highest saturation levels. At the observation scale (10 in), LAI was retrieved from both NDWI and OSAVI imagery with an accuracy of 0.6, vegetation water content at 0.7 kg m(-2), and canopy height to within 0.2 in. Both indices were used to estimate field-scale mean canopy properties and variability for each of the intensive soil-moisture-sampling sites within the watershed study area. Results regarding scale invariance over the SMEX02 study area in transformations from band reflectance and vegetation indices to canopy biophysical properties are also presented.

Depending on the change detection index considered, we also need to determine the class number and features. This is done using the a contrario theory approach rather than classical statistical tests.

In this study, we used a small-footprint lidar sensor (airborne laser scanner, ALS) to estimate sub-canopy elevation and canopy height in an evergreen tropical rain forest. A fully automated, local-minima algorithm was developed to separate lidar ground returns from overlying vegetation returns. We then assessed inverse distance weighted (IDW) and ordinary kriging (OK) geostatistical techniques for the interpolation of a sub-canopy DTM. OK was determined to be a superior interpolation scheme because it smoothed fine-scale variance created by spurious understory heights in the ground-point dataset. The final DTM had a linear correlation of 1.00 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.29 m when compared against 3859 well-distributed ground-survey points. In old-growth forests, RMS error on steep slopes was 0.67 m greater than on flat slopes. On flatter slopes, variation in vegetation complexity associated with land use caused highly significant differences in DTM error distribution across the landscape. The highest DTM accuracy observed in this study was 0.58-m RMSE, under flat, open-canopy areas with relatively smooth surfaces. Lidar ground retrieval was complicated by dense, multi-layered evergreen canopy in old-growth forests, causing DTM overestimation that increased RMS error to 1.95 m.   A DCM was calculated from the original lidar surface and the interpolated DTM. Individual and plot-scale heights were estimated from DCM metrics and compared to field data measured using similar spatial supports and metrics. For old-growth forest emergent trees and isolated pasture trees greater than 20 m tall, individual tree heights were underestimated and had 3.67- and 2.33-m mean absolute error (MAE), respectively. Linear-regression models explained 51% (4.15-m RMSE) and 95% (2.41-m RMSE) of the variance, respectively. It was determined that improved elevation and field-height estimation in pastures explained why individual pasture trees could be estimated more accurately than old-growth trees. Mean height of tree stems in 32 young agroforestry plantation plots (0.38 to 18.53 in tall) was estimated with a mean absolute error of 0.90 m (r(2) = 0.97; 1.08-m model RMSE) using the mean of lidar returns in the plot. As in other small-footprint lidar studies, plot mean height was underestimated; however, our plot-scale results have stronger linear models for tropical, leaf-on hardwood trees than has been previously reported for temperate-zone conifer and deciduous hardwoods.

Current methods of measuring residue cover are inadequate for characterizing the spatial variability of residue cover over large fields. The objectives of this research were to determine the spectral reflectance of crop residues and soils and to assess the limits of discrimination that can be expected in mixed scenes. Spectral reflectances of dry and wet crop residues plus three diverse soils were measured over the 400-2400 nm wavelength region. Reflectance values for scenes with varying proportions of crop residues and soils were simulated. Additional spectra of scenes with mixtures of crop residues, green vegetation, and soil were also acquired in corn, soybean, and wheat fields with different tillage treatments. The spectra of dry crop residues displayed a broad absorption feature near 2100 nm, associated with cellulose-lignin, that was absent in spectra of soils. Crop residue cover was linearly related (r(2) = 0.89) to the Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI), which was defined as the relative depth of this absorption feature. Green vegetation cover in the scene attenuated CAI, but was linearly related to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, r(2) = 0.93). A novel method is proposed to assess soil tillage intensity classes using CAI and NDVI. Regional surveys of soil conservation practices that affect soil carbon dynamics may be feasible using advanced multispectral or hyperspectral imaging systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The geometric Li-Sparse reciprocal and Roujean kernels are considered in the procedure applied to space-borne Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectance (POLDER) sensor data which decomposes as follows: (1) quality control, (2) accumulation of a priori information on model coefficients of directional hemispherical reflectance, and (3) implementation of BRDF model inversion methods based on the biased estimation instead of usual nonbiased least solution due to its large variance. The first two steps are detailed in this paper; the third one appears in a companion paper. The data control procedure consists both in filtering inputs of reflectance data and output of model coefficients. In the first stage, the analysis criteria rely on Fisher statistics. In the second stage, a procedure is applied to red and near-infrared POLDER data corresponding to the 16 classes of International Geosphere Biosphere Program (IGBP) land cover classification. Among the retained criteria, some are based on the BRDF shape. They encompass (1) T-statistics, (2) the bowl shape index (BSI), (3) the dome shape index (DSI), (4) the white sky albedo (WSA, bi-hemispherical reflectance), and (5) the black sky albedo variance (BSA, directional-hemispherical reflectance). Statistical results include mean values and covariance matrix for the spectral BRDF model coefficients. This procedure eliminates about 10% of data measurements, thereby reducing uncertainty in retrieved BRDF model coefficients and WSA. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

There is not, however, a universally accepted definition of urban sprawl. It has been described using quantitative measures, qualitative terms, attitudinal explanations, and landscape patterns. To help local, regional and state land use planners better understand and address the issues attributed to sprawl, researchers at NASA\'s Northeast Regional Earth Science Applications Center (RESAC) at The University of Connecticut have developed an urban growth model. The model, which is based on land cover derived from remotely sensed satellite imagery, determines the geographic extent, patterns, and classes of urban growth over time.   Input data to the urban growth model consist of two dates of satellite-derived land cover data that are converted, based on user-defined reclassification options, to just three classes: developed, non-developed, and water. The model identifies three classes of undeveloped land as well as developed land for both dates based on neighborhood information. These two images are used to create a change map that provides more detail than a traditional change analysis by utilizing the classes of non-developed land and including contextual information. The change map becomes the input for the urban growth analysis where five classes of growth are identified: infill, expansion, isolated, linear branch, and clustered branch.   The output urban growth map is a powerful visual and quantitative assessment of the kinds of urban growth that have occurred across a landscape. Urban growth further can be characterized using a temporal sequence of urban growth maps to illustrate urban growth dynamics. Beyond analysis, the ability of remote sensing-based information to show changes to a community\'s landscape, at different geographic scales and over time, is a new and unique resource for local land use decision makers as they plan the future of their communities.

Texture information is related to forest structure by means of geostatistical analysis based on directional variograms for the NIR channel. The results demonstrate a strong interaction between the elements contributing to the forest structure, i.e. the tree crowns and the gaps, and the viewing and illumination conditions of each observation. The concept of the Bi-directional Standard deviation Distribution Function (BSDF) is introduced to discriminate the forest structures. A simple geometric-optical gap model explains more than 80% of the variability of the NIR reflectance standard deviation. Finally, a cross-thresholding approach using the NIR reflectance and the Local Directional Contrast (LDC) is proposed and successfully applied to discriminate the canopy roughness of the different forest sites.

In doing so, we aimed to: (i) refine methods for monitoring monthly changes in lake areas and seasonal water balance, building from previous studies; (ii) explore the extent to which simple hydrological models can be developed for individual playas; and (iii) compare the hydrologic response of individual playas to seasonal rainfall inputs within North Africa. Here, analyses were conducted using two time-series of AVHRR data (c.2 images per month) for southern Tunisia and northern Algeria (1983-1993 and 1987-1999), with coincident meteorological data. These data were used to detect and monitor inundation events within specific playa catchments in the Zone of Chotts region. Key analyses methods included: (a) the use of reflectance profiles for each time-series to infer inundation processes for each playa and (b) the extraction of lake areas from sequential image data to determine the extent of inundation with an accuracy of between 2% and 6% (depending on lake size). For those playas which were found to inundate as a direct result of precipitation records of lake area change were used to drive simple hydrological models to allowed mean monthly precipitation (P), monthly effective precipitation (P-E), and monthly evaporation (E) to be estimated. The techniques presented here make an important contribution to our understanding of the hydrology of playas in this region. Results for individual playas also suggest that these techniques may be useful in highlighting the dynamic response of these environments to the forcing mechanisms for regional precipitation (e.g., North Atlantic Oscillation [NAO]). In addition, the findings suggest that more widespread monitoring of playa inundation processes in this manner may impact on our understanding of the precipitation/evaporation status of a number of dryland regions.

A forest map of Northeast China was generated from an unsupervised classification of 25 10-day VGT composite data (NDVI and NDWI) over the period of March 11-20, 1999 to November 11-20, 1999. Seven different forest categories were distinguished from the 1-km spatial resolution VGT data. The VGT forest map was compared to estimates of forest area derived from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) images. There was a good agreement on spatial distribution and area of forest between the VGT product and the TM product, however, the VGT product provided additional information on forest type. Analysis of NDVI and NDWI over the plant growing season allows for the identification of distinct growth patterns between the different forest types. It is evident that VGT data can be used to provide timely and detailed forest maps with limited ancillary data needed. The VGT-derived forest maps could be very useful as input to biogeochemical models (particularly carbon cycle models) that require timely estimates of forest area and type.

The IR temperatures were calibrated and adjusted to account for the intervening atmosphere, For each day, 1-km resolution temperature scones were generated for a 1000 x 1000-km rectangular region extending from about 60degreesN, 111degreesW over the northern part of the Canadian Province of Alberta to about 500N, 97degreesW in southern Manitoba. There are 132 water bodies of area larger than 100 km(2) in this study area. The temperature cycle over these water bodies can be decomposed into a straight line with a small positive slope for spring ice break-up, followed by a fitted quadratic curve for the summer temperature variations. The curve fit parameters give information on the transition between ice and ice-free conditions. Data stratification confirms a strong latitudinal influence on the shape of the curves. It was not possible to quantify the effect of water depth. as the depth of most boreal lakes is not known. Instead, a list of fit coefficients for all the water bodies is provided. Once detrended from the quadratic curves, the amplitude of the diurnal cycle and major variations in temperatures of the water bodies can be determined. The detrended water temperature variations are about one-third the magnitude of the detrended air temperature variations from nearby weather stations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

If cloud cover is brief(< 4 h) and only partial on the scale of a METEOSAT pixel, the discontinuous time series of cloud-free measurements still approximates a cloud-free diurnal temperature cycle (DTC). In order to interpolate the missing values and to describe the thermal behaviour of the land surface as a whole, advantage is taken of METEOSAT\'s high temporal resolution of 30 min. A Levenberg-Marquardt minimisation scheme is utilised to automatically fit a model of the DTC to the time series of cloud-screened brightness temperatures (BT). Out of physical considerations and in order to stabilise the fits, a priori knowledge from solar geometry is utilised and the model function is required to be smooth and continuous. A robust estimator of the error, which is based on the median rather than the arithmetic mean, is used to lessen the impact of outliers on the fits. The thermal behaviour of the land surface is then described by the determined model parameters, and the 48 METEOSAT BTs per pixel per day are reduced to five parameters per pixel per day. Monthly maximum and median composites of cloud-screened METEOSAT BTs yield synthetic DTCs, which are less influenced by synoptic effects. Fitting the model to monthly composites reduces the 17520 METEOSAT BTs per pixel per year to 60 parameters per pixel per year. This data reduction is advantageous to climatological studies, which require the processing of long time series. The model parameters are shown to be related to physical properties of the land surface, particularly to the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and thermal inertia.

Even by excluding comparisons where local variation was high, model predictions of forest growth compared poorly with those estimated from ground survey (r(2) = 0.4). This variation was only partly attributed to variation in canopy f phi (p,a). Local variation in climate and soils played an equal if not greater role. When the sample plots were stratified into 14 broad forest types. within which growth potential varied similarly (coefficient of variation for each of the 14 types averaged 6%), a good relation between predicted and measured forest growth capacity across all types resulted (r(2) = 0.82, P less than or equal to0.01, SE = 1.2 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1)). The implications of these analyses suggest that: (1) models should be rigorously tested before applying across landscapes: (2) accuracy in locating plots and in extrapolating data limits spatial resolution; (3) soil surveys in mountainous regions are inaccurate and difficult to interpret, (4) mapped vegetation classifications provide a useful level of stratification; and (5) remotely sensed estimates of canopy nitrogen status and biomass increment and canopy nitrogen status are needed to improve and validate regional assessment of growth.

A common problem, however, is represented by the spatial variability of the spectral endmembers to estimate, which may be caused by variations in several environmental factors (topography, water availability, soil type, etc.). This problem is currently addressed by a modified multivariate regression procedure than can define spatially variable spectral endmembers. The procedure is based on a local calibration of the regression statistics (mean vectors and variance/covariance matrices), which is obtained by weighting the values of the training pixels according to their distance from each pixel examined. The locally found regression statistics are then used to extrapolate pure class spectral endmembers, which are therefore different for each image pixel. An experiment was carried out using multitemporal NOAA-AVHRR NDVI profiles and class abundance estimates of Tuscany region in central Italy. The results show that the spatially variable spectral endmembers are far more accurate than conventional fixed endmembers to recompose the original NDVI imagery. Finally, it is discussed how these spatially variable pure class NDVI values can serve for data integration and as input for agro-meteorological applications and ecosystem simulation modeling.

The first method, called the product rule, is a simple and general method of combining two or more classification rules as a single rule. Stacked regression methods of combining classification rules are discussed and compared to the product rule. The second method of increasing classifier accuracy is a simple nonparametric classifier that uses spatial information for classification. Two data sets used for land cover mapping of Landsat TM scenes from Idaho and Montana illustrate the new methods. For these examples, the product rule compared favorably to the more complex stacked regression methods. The spatial classifier produced substantial increases in estimated accuracy when combined with one or more additional classifiers that used remotely sensed variables for classification. These results suggest that the product rule may produce increases in map accuracy with little additional expense or effort. The spatial classifier may be useful for increasing accuracy when patterns exist in the spatial distribution of land cover.

These three products are important because they relate to or are components of the metabolism of the biosphere and can be determined for terrestrial ecosystems from satellite-borne sensors. The importance of these products in the EOS program necessitates the need to use standard methods to obtain accurate ground truth estimates of L, f(APAR), and NPP that are correlated to satellite-derived estimates. The objective of this article is to review; direct and indirect methods used to estimate L, f(APAR) and NPP in terrestrial ecosystems. Direct estimates of L, biomass, and NPP can be obtained by harvesting individual plants, developing allometric equations, and applying these equations to all individuals in the stand. Using non-site-specific allometric equations to estimate L and foliage production can cause large errors because carbon allocation to foliage is influenced by numerous environmental and ecological factors. All of the optical instruments that indirectly estimate L actually estimate \"effective\" leaf area index (L-E) and underestimate L when foliage in the canopy is non-randomly distributed (i.e., clumped). We discuss several methods, ranging from simple to complex in terms of data needs, that can be used to correct estimates of L when foliage is clumped. Direct estimates of above ground and below-ground net primary production (NPPA and NPPB, respectively) are laborious, expensive and can only be carried out for small plots, yet there is a great need to obtain global estimates of NPP. Process models, driven by remotely sensed input parameters, are useful tools to examine the influence of global change on the metabolism of terrestrial ecosystems, but an incomplete understanding of carbon allocation continues to hamper development of more accurate NPP models. We summarize cal-bon allocation patterns for major terrestrial biomes and discuss emerging allocation patterns that can be incorporated into global NPP models. One common process model, light use efficiency or epsilon model, uses remotely sensed f(APAR), light use efficiency (LUE) and carbon allocation coefficients, and other meteorological data to estimates NPP. Such models require reliable estimates of LUE. We summarize the literature and provide LUE coefficients for the major biomes, being careful to correct for inconsistencies in radiation dry matter and carbon allocation tl nits.

Emphasis was placed on incorporating the effects of variations in the background signatures into the inversion process. The inversion methodology and the sources of error were tested using simulated reflectance data. One-parameter inversions using constant background signatures could not retrieve stand cover because a significant proportion of the total variance in the spectral data resulted from background variations. The spectral indices performed better than the one-parameter inversions because the indices partially reduced background effects, but could not provide estimates of cover. When the background signatures were varied in three- and four-parameter inversions, inversion performed better than the spectral indices, giving estimates of cover for the test stands. The biophysical basis of the results are examined. The results indicate that variations in the background signatures can be included in the inversion in certain situations, and should be included when these effects are important. Inversion may provide a more robust method for estimating forest characteristics from multispectral satellite data; however, further testing is needed.

Iron deficiency caused increases in the mean chlorophyll fluorescence lifetime. These increased chlorophyll fluorescence lifetimes occurred in dark-adapted leaves, during a sudden increase in light intensity and also at steady-state photosynthesis. Chlorophyll fluorescence lifetimes were correlated with the extent of nonphotochemical and/or photochemical quenching. During most of the photosynthetic induction period Fe-deficient leaves showed lower actual PSII efficiencies than control leaves, due to decreases in photochemical quenching and intrinsic PSII deficiency. During photosynthetic induction Fe deficiency decreased the proportion of light absorbed by the PSII antenna that is used in photochemistry and increased the proportion dissipated thermally within the PSII antenna, the later being well correlated with nonphotochemical quenching.

The Landsat Thematic Mapper sensor teas used because it has a good spatial resolution, a short wave infrared channel which is sensitive to grain size, and a thermal infrared channel. A first Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) scene was acquired on 24 April 1992 and a second one on II December 1992. A DEM (digital elevation model) was used to obtain the local incidence angles and the elevation of each snow pixel. The pixels were then grouped according to the CROCUS classification (range, elevation, slope, orientation), and the mean snore characteristics for each class were compared with the CROCUS results. The lower limit of snow and the surface grain size derived from TM data compared favorably with the model results even if those parameters were not always easy to define. Larger differences were found for the temperature because it caries rapidly and is very sensitive to shadowing by surrounding mountains and abo because ifs remote measurement is dependent on atmosphere conditions.

The 5-year-old pines ranged in height from 3 m to 6 m and formed an optically dense canopy. Variation in photosynthetic capacity was amplified by soil application of photosystem II herbicides diuron and bromacil to three of six experimental plots. Field measurements began on 23 August 1994 and continued through 20 December 1994. Canopy reflectance and leaf physiological data were acquired during mid to late morning for the sides of trees that generally received full sunlight. Net CO2 assimilation rate first regressed significantly with reflectance on 5 October at wavelengths near 700 nm. In the 5 October to 2 December period, assimilation rates approximated photosynthetic capacity. When data were combined over this period, the ration of reflectance at 701+/-2 nm with reflectance at 520+/-2 nm, or a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed from these values, regressed more strongly with photosynthetic capacity than first derivatives of spectral reflectance or wavelength at the read edge inflection point. The narrow band NDVI accounted for 17-29% more variability in the data than NDVI that were based on simulated TM, MSS, AVHRR, or SPOT bands. As a result of its linear relationship with assimilation rate, stomatal conductance to water vapor also regressed strongly with the narrow band ratio. These results are explained by the high sensitivity of reflectance near 700 nm to leaf chlorophyll content. The use of a narrow band centered near 700 nm along with a narrow or broad near infrared band in vegetation indices should provide increased accuracy in estimates of photosynthetic capacity and corresponding conductance for optically dense canopies. Evaluation of the influence of leaf area index on these relationships will require further study.

Exposing the too materials for different decomposition durations (0-378 days) visually yielded color sequences as the compost aged. Significant changes in the reflectance spectra of both materials were also observed during the composting period, which provided parameters for controlling the composting process. The slopes In the VIS-NIR region were found to be basic parameters for monitoring changes and were found to be highly correlated with other chemical parameters often used for assessing organic matter conditions in the field (such as the C/N ratio). It was found that during the initial composting stage (0-60 days) the slope parameters were strongly affected by the decomposition activity and, hence, errors in the assess ment of organic matter content of soils. using Slope (or band ratio) parameters are likely. Careful observation of the major spectral features reveals that the reflectance spectrum in the VIS-NIR-SWIR region is a very sensitive tool for monitoring slight changes. Application of the near-infrared analysis (NIRA) pathways revealed that OH and C-H groups combined with hygroscopic water starch, cellullose, and lignin are the components having the highest correlations with composting time within the conditions used. Because of the small number of samples in each testing group a complete NIRA employing validation tests could not be carried out. We conducted that the reflectance spectrum in the VIS-NIR-SWIR region is a promising tool for monitoring the composting process and that the composting process may provide invaluable spectral information about soil organic matter during its biochemical degradation.

Moreover loss of elements on a distributed array can distort its pattern. In these cases, one can extract the relative vertical antenna pattern from the SAR images of target areas that are uniform, on average. In this report, images taken from the Amazon rain-forest region are analyzed to yield an estimate of the inflight relative-gain vertical antenna pattern for the SIR-C.

As part of this process, a panel of 16 scientists met to review the utility of SAR for monitoring ecosystem processes. The consensus of this ecology panel was that the demonstrated capabilities of imaging radars for investigating terrestrial ecosystems could best be organized into four broad categories: 1) classification and detection of change in land cover; 2) estimation of woody plant biomass 3) monitoring the extent and timing of inundation; and 4) monitoring other temporally-dynamic processes. The major conclusions from this panel were: 1) Multichannel radar data provide a means to classify land-cover patterns because of its sensitivity to variations in vegetation structure and vegetation and ground-layer moisture. The relative utility of data from imaging radars versus multispectral scanner data has yet to be determined in a rigorous fashion over a wide range of biomes for this application. 2) Imaging radars having the capability to monitor variations in biomass in forested ecosystems. This capability is not consistent among different forest types. The upper levels of sensitivity for L-band and C-band systems such as SIR-C range between <100 t ha(-1) for complex tropical forest canopies to similar to 250 t ha(-1) for simpler forests dominated by a single tree species. Best performance for biomass estimation is achieved using lower frequency (P- and L-band) radar systems with a cross-polarized (HV or VH) channel. 3) Like-polarized imaging radars (HH or VV) are well suited for detection of flooding under vegetation canopies. Lower frequency radars (P- and L-band) are most optimal for detecting flooding under forests, whereas higher frequency radars (C-band) work best for wetlands dominated by herbaceous vegetation. 4) It has been shown that spaceborne radars that have been in continuous operation for several years [such as the C-band (VV) ERS-1 SAR] provide information on temporally dynamic processes, such as monitoring a) variations in flooding in nonwooded wetlands, b) changes in the frozen/thawed status of vegetation, and c) relative variations in soil moisture in areas with low amounts of vegetation cover. These observations have been shown to be particularly important in studying ecosystems in high northern latitudes.

F-test values are higher for sunlit reflectances than for shadow reflectances as well as for near-infrared reflectances than for visible reflectances. Reflectances of hardwood shadows are generally higher and more variable than the ones of conifer shadows. Building shadows generally have lower reflectances than hardwood shadows and similar reflectances as conifer shadows. These reflectances were used to calculated two vegetation indices (NDVI and ARVI). They are also affected by the surface and shadow types.

Regeneration of forest on previously cleared areas, however is a significant carbon sink. The strength of this carbon sink is dependent on the age and composition of the regenerating forest. The ability to identify regenerating forest classes that may differ in terms of carbon sink strength was investigated with Landsat TBI data of a test site near Manaus, Brazil. A number of forest age classes were defined from a time series of Landsat sensor data, and their separability in Landsat TM data was assessed by maximum likelihood classifications. A high level of class separability was observed with a weighted kappa coefficient of 0.8569 obtained for a classification of six forest regeneration classes. Of the classification errors observed most were found to be associated with the youngest forest age class. At the test site, however, two main successional pathways were followed and the differences between areas of forest of the same age but on different pathways was most apparent with the youngest forests. Splitting the regenerating forests by the successional pathway was found to increase classifications accuracy, with a weighted kappa coefficient of 0.9315 observed for an 11 class classification. A range of tropical forest classes that vary in strength as a carbon sink could therefore be identified accurately from Landsat TM data.

The uncertain class is used for those pixels whose signature is not clearly cloud-free land or cloud (e.g., pixels at cloud boundaries that often contain subpixel cloud and land information that has been averaged together by the integrating grating aperture function of the AVHRR instrument). Results show that the ASMC algorithm is neither regionally nor temporally specific and can be used over a large range of solar altitudes. Sensitivity of the segmentation and labelling steps to the choice of input variables also was studied. Results obtained with the ASMC algorithm also compare favorably with those obtained from a wide range of currently used algorithms to detect cloud over land in AVHRR data. Moreov;er, the ASMC algorithm can be adapted for use with data to be taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer-Nadir (MODIS-N).RP Simpson, JJ (通讯作者)，UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO,SCRIPPS INST OCEANOG,SCRIPPS SATELLITE OCEANOG CTR,DIGITAL IMAGE ANAL LAB,LA JOLLA,CA 92093, USA.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 34, 43, 45, 0, 2, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Both of these instruments provide rapid acquisition (similar to 1 s) of a spectrum in the visible to near-infrared region (similar to 0.4-1.1 mu m) and are field-portable. These evaluations included: spectral bandwidth, second-order effects suppression, signal to noise ratios, noise equivalent radiances, linearity of response with radiance and with integration time, temperature sensitivity, and polarization sensitivity In the configurations tested the SE590 instruments had a spectral bandwidth of about 16 nm full width at half-maximum the PS2 instruments, 3-4 nm. Neither of the instruments produced measurable second-order leakage. When viewing a barium-sulfate-coated integrating source internally illuminated with tungsten lamps, both instruments were able to obtain signal to noise ratios of 1000:1 or better between 500 m and 900 nm over most of the dynamic range provided by the sources when the integration time was optimized for the light level. Signal to noise dropped at shorter wavelengths in part due to the low energy provided by the source and at longer wavelengths due to the decrease in the detector response. In linearity tests all of the instruments generally agreed within 5% of the reference radiometer between 400 nm and 1000 nm; however, results were poorer at lower radiance levels and at wavelengths longer than 1000 nm or shorter than 400 nm. Both of the instruments rely on a shutter to measure their dark current, which is normally subtracted from the signal. However, closing the shutter on all of the instruments altered the dark current readings to some extent such that the dark current that teas subtracted was not correct. When the error in dark current is compensated for, she apparent linearity of the system improves considerably with weak signals. The SE590 systems showed significant polarization sensitivity of up to 25%, whereas the PS2 instruments did not.

These studies have been largely empirical in nature and the relationships among remotely sensed data, land surface properties, and land surface energy balance that produce this phenomenon remain unclear. We studied the relationship between radiometric surface temperature and NDVI over a tallgrass prairie in northeastern Kansas. The study site included a mix of landcovers, with fractional vegetation cover and exposed soil backgrounds over much of the site. We observed a persistent negative correlation between radiometric surface temperature and NDVI, but found that the relationship was highly date- and time-specific. In this context, the relationship between surface temperature and NDVI was observed to depend on landcover type, and a significant proportion of the total variance in both NDVI and radiometric surface temperature was explained by stratifying the data by landcover class. More importantly, our results show the relationship between surface temperature and NDVI to have little association with surface energy balance for data sets acquired from aircraft and helicopters on several dates during the growing seasons of 1987 and 1989. Based on results from a simulation model of the soil-canopy-sensor system, we hypothesize the observed covariance between radiometric surface temperature and NDVI to be largely caused by temperature differences between the soil background and vegetation canopy and by variation in fractional vegetation cover. This hypothesis is supported by evidence showing soil moisture to be an important secondary control on radiometric surface temperature due to its effect on soil thermal inertia, rather than as a limiting control on latent heat flux, as might be expected. These findings indicate that invertible surface energy balance models must account for the effects of landcover, soil background temperatures, and soil moisture before thermal infrared imagery can be effectively used to estimate land surface fluxes.', 'UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA,CTR REMOTE SENSING ENVIRONM OPT,SANTA BARBARA,CA 93106.

Model sensitivity analyses for these 21 stands showed that uncertainty in LAI and species composition caused errors in net canopy assimilation of as much as 42-70% and 14-36%, respectively, depending on forest type. The sensitivity of net canopy assimilation to species-dependent physiology was greater between needleleaf coniferous and broadleaf deciduous life forms than among species within life forms. A simple regression model that recognized stand differences in LAI and life-form type (needleleaf coniferous, broadleaf deciduous) accounted for 94% of the variation in simulated net canopy assimilation for the 21 stands. Expanding the model to include species composition rather than life-form type only accounted for an additional 1% of the variation in simulated net canopy assimilation. The statistical model was applied to a synthetic aperture radar scene that discriminated black spruce, white spruce, balsam poplar, and alder forests in a 76.8 km2 region near Fairbanks.

The absorption properties of C remain uncertain with two analysis techniques giving different results at shorter wavelengths and failing to find significant values at red wavelengths. The measured absorption of water closely matches reported laboratory results of Smith and Baker (1981). Tests showed that the calibrated R-model was slightly biased (less than 10%) with a standard deviation of +/- 6-16% depending on wavelength. When the model was used to solve for component concentrations, SM were found with a standard deviation of +/- 20%, C +/- 40%, and YS +/- 30%.', 'UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA, FAC FORESTRY, VANCOUVER V6T 1W5, BC, CANADA.', 'University of British ColumbiaRP GALLIE, EA (通讯作者)，LAURENTIAN UNIV, CTR MIN & MINERAL EXPLORAT RES, RAMSEY LAKE RD, SUDBURY P3E 2C6, ONTARIO, CANADA.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 46, 61, 66, 0, 8, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

A leaf canopy is a typical example of such media.  The leaf canopy is idealized example of such media.  The leaf canopy is idealized as a binary medium consisting of gaps (voids) and regions with phytoelements (turbid phytomedium).  Gaps through which photons travel unimpededly are assumed to be randomly distributed.  The mathematical approach for characterizing the structure of the host medium is considered in detail.  In this approach, the leaf canopy is represented by a combination of all possible open oriented spheres.  With rigorous definitions and notations, dependence of the extinction coefficient on the phase-space coordinates of the previous interaction center is shown to be a logical consequence.  Specifically, the extinction coefficient at any phase-space location in a leaf canopy is the product of the extinction coefficient in the turbid phytomedium and the probability of absence gaps at that location.  Using a similar approach, an expression for the differential scattering coefficient is derived.

Tawa reservoir water samples were collected on 20 October 1988 concurrent with IRSIA overpass.  The samples were analyzed to determine the concentration of total suspended matter, grain size, and mineralogy.  The results indicate that, in the concentration range between 10 mg/L and 50 mg/L, a positive functional relationship exists between the concentration of suspended solids and the visible wavelength Bands 1, 2, and 3 (0.45-0.68-mu-m).  It has been observed that mineralogy and grain size are the main factors which influence the reflected radiance at lower concentration level (10-50mg/L) of suspended solids.  It can be concluded that as the concentration of suspended solids in the 10-50 mg/L range increases the spectral response increases.

The Landsat imagery was evaluated on the basis of its spectral band combinations and spatial properties for differentiating among pine species, age groups, stocking rate, and hardwood acreage within the pine plantations.  The vector data utilized in the study included the transportation network, hydrography, and the compartment map of the districts.  The results revealed that TM imagery is inadequate for differentiating among pine species.  However, the differentiation among selected pine age groups was feasible using the band combination of TM Bands 5, 4, and 3.  High classification accuracies were achieved with most of the pine age classes for both forest districts.  Significant differences were found in differentiating among age groups between the two districts.  The 6-10, 11-20, and 21 plus age classes were the major contributors to the differences observed.  The small differences observed between the two TM band combinations (TM 5, 4, 3 and TM 5, 4, 3, 2) were not significant.

The results show that it is possible to use several TISIs amplifying different spectral channels to perform spectral analysis in the thermal infrared bands.  The pixels with low TISI1 and high surface temperature are generally bare soils while the pixels with high TISI1 and low surface temperature are vegetations or bare soils; this behavior is quite similar to that of NDVI(T(s)).

Bamboo forest is an essential forest type in subtropical China with a strong carbon sequestration capacity. In recent years, vegetation indices (VIs), which characterize canopy structural parameters, and solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), indicating the photosynthetic activity of vegetation, have provided new perspectives on plant phenology at regional and global scales. However, the best data sources and methods for extracting the phenology of bamboo forests remain to be explored. In this study, new vegetation indices were innovatively constructed by normalizing the VIs (enhanced vegetation index (EVI), two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv)) based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products and SIF products (GOSIF) based on OCO-2 satellites and then taking the mean values of the normalized VIs (EVI, EVI2 and NIRv) and SIF. We called the new indices SVs (SIF and VIs combined indices, including Se (SIF and EVI combined index), Se2 (SIF and EVI2 combined index), or Sn (SIF and NIRv combined index)). Two time series reconstruction methods (asymmetric Gaussian (AG) function fitting and double logistic (DL) function) and two extractive phenology parameter methods (dynamic threshold method (DT) and comparative threshold method (CT)) were employed to extract phenological information. The advantages of SVs for extracting bamboo forest phenology (BFP) were verified by comparing the extraction performance of VIs, SIF, and SVs on the SOS and EOS of bamboo forests. Thus, the best way to extract BFP was explored, and the spatial distribution and spatial-temporal variation characteristics of BFP in China from 2011 to 2020 were analyzed. The results are described as follows: (1) SVs are better able to extract BFP parameters compared with VIs and SIF, especially in bamboo forest-specific off-years and on-years; (2) SIF has better accuracy than VIs in extracting BFP, where both SOS and EOS values obtained from VIs are overestimated, and SIF can reflect BFP information earlier; and (3) the best data sources for extracting SOS and EOS in bamboo forests are Sn and Se, respectively, and the optimal methods are AG_CT and DL_DT, respectively. Compared with SIF, the R2 values of Sn and Se extracted SOS and EOS are improved by 40.7% and 7.7%, and the RMSE values are reduced by 24.7% and 0.7%, respectively; and (4) the SOS for bamboo forests in China from 2011 to 2020 was mainly concentrated in 80-100 days, with an overall advancing trend; the EOS was mainly concentrated in 300-320 days, with an overall delay. The results show that the SVs obtained by coupling VIs and SIF can better track the BFP information, providing a practical reference for macroscopic monitoring of BFP based on medium resolution time series data.', '[Xu, Yanxin; Li, Xuejian; Du, Huaqiang; Mao, Fangjie; Zhou, Guomo; Huang, Zihao; Fan, Weiliang; Chen, Qi; Ni, Chi; Guo, Keruo] Zhejiang A&F Univ, State Key Lab Subtrop Silviculture, Hangzhou 311300, Peoples R China.

Although gigantic icebergs have been the objects of many remote sensing studies, medium icebergs in the Southern Ocean have been rarely monitored or traced. In this study, we develop an iceberg detection and tracking tool particularly for medium and large icebergs (0.4-10 km2), by using Python programming language and Sentinel-1 (S1) imagery, based on Google Earth Engine (GEE). To detect icebergs, we employ the simple non-iterative clustering (SNIC) and region adjacency graph (RAG) merging for object-based image segmentation and train/test the support vector machine (SVM) model with 6432 labeled segments of iceberg or non-icebergs from 40 images of S1 (2019-2021). Radar backscatter features and morphological features of those segments are used as the inputs of the SVM model. After icebergs are detected in two image scenes of different dates, we track the displacements of detected icebergs by comparing their 1-D shape signals. Our model shows -99% of accuracy in detecting icebergs and - 93-98% of accuracy in tracking icebergs depending on the day difference between image scenes. When using our tool for the monitoring of icebergs in the Amundsen Sea, we find that the iceberg fraction varies from 2% to 8% in 2021 and most of icebergs move westward with a speed of <0.2 km/day.', '[Koo, Younghyun; Xie, Hongjie; Mahmoud, Hazem; Ackley, Stephen F.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.

Although LiDAR scanning has the potential to reduce the intensive labor required to estimate fractal dimensions with manual measurements, neither an accuracy assessment comparing with true dimensions nor a guide or method for accurately measuring the dimensions using LiDAR scanners has been presented. This study examined the accuracy of fractal dimensions estimated using terrestrial LiDAR scanning (TLS) and unmanned aerial LiDAR scanning (ULS) through computer simulations and developed an approach to reduce the estimation bias. The true fractal dimensions of digitized trees of red pine (Pinus densiflora), ubame oak (Quercus phillyreoides), and giant timber bamboo (Phyllostachys bambusoides) in 18 site scenarios were calculated by applying the box-counting method to the tree object data. The true fractal dimensions were compared with the estimated dimensions in four TLS and ULS scenarios. Furthermore, a method to reduce the estimation bias was developed by introducing sequential point decimation and modeling the acquisition rate decay, thereby extrapolating the number of voxels before decay. Simple box-counting on highly dense and precise TLS data collected from four positions could retrieve the true fractal dimensions for all 18 site scenarios. However, sparse and less accurate TLS underestimated fractal dimensions in 8 out of 18 cases, and ULS overestimated the dimensions in 29 of 36 cases. The change in the relationship between the number of voxels and mesh size on a log-log plot with sequential decimation could be used to judge whether a set of TLS data can retrieve accurate fractal dimensions by applying simple box-counting to the TLS data. The developed method improved the estimations of fractal dimensions for 30 of the 37 cases where the simple box-counting on the TLS and ULS data provided biased estimations. In contrast, the estimation bias increased in 27 of the 35 cases where the simple box-counting on the TLS and ULS data successfully retrieved the true fractal dimensions.', '[Moriguchi, Kai] Kochi Univ, Fac Agr & Marine Sci, 200 Otsu, Nankoku, Kochi 7838502, Japan.', 'Kochi UniversityRP Moriguchi, K (通讯作者)，Kochi Univ, Fac Agr & Marine Sci, 200 Otsu, Nankoku, Kochi 7838502, Japan.', 'k_moriguchi@kochi-u.ac.jpRI Moriguchi, Kai/AGB-5749-2022', 'Moriguchi, Kai/0000-0003-4827-7263', 'Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [18J01404, 21KK0113]', 'The editors and three referees provided valuable comments during the   reviewing process.

Consequently, the detection and quantification of major methane emitters are vital in addressing this issue effectively. Satellite sensors with shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands provide valuable information for monitoring methane emissions. For example, Sentinel-2 multispectral data have the capability to detect methane plumes of large point sources. As such, a wide range of quantification approaches have been developed to quantify methane source rates based on this dataset. Most of the existing methods, however, require auxiliary data, such as wind speed, and have large uncertainties. In this study, we introduce a novel approach based on deep learning models to enhance the precision of methane quantification using Sentinel-2 data without the reliance on external data sources. To train the proposed deep learning model, a comprehensive benchmark dataset has been generated, using Sentinel-2 data. This dataset is created by integrating simulated plumes and background noise extracted from real Sentinel-2 images. This approach ensures the integration of realistic environmental conditions within the simulated data, enhancing the robustness and reliability of our proposed model. The generated benchmark dataset is utilized in different deep learning architectures, namely VGG-19, ResNet-50, Inception-v3, DenseNet-121, Swin-T, and EfficientNet-V2L, to estimate methane source rate. The performance of deep models has been evaluated in three learning strategies, namely from scratch, transfer-learning, and fine-tuning. The fine-tuned EfficientNet-V2L achieves the highest accuracy with root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and Pearson R of 2101 kg h-1, 10.05%, and 95.70%, respectively. More importantly, the proposed model demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional physical-based quantification methods (e.g., integrated mass enhancement) and recently developed deep learning model techniques (e.g., MethaNet). In particular, the proposed model exhibits an improvement of approximately 1287 kg h-1 in terms of RMSE, a 3.92% reduction in MAPE, and a 5.01% enhancement in R compared to the IME method. These results highlight the advancements achieved by the proposed approach in accurately quantifying methane emissions using Sentinel-2 imagery. The generated benchmark dataset and the developed deep learning model presented in this study serve as a fundamental resource and constructive framework for future research, promoting extensive implementation across various methane monitoring scenarios on different satellites and in distinct geographic regions, which delivering greater effectiveness to global methane emission monitoring initiatives.', '[Radman, Ali; Mahdianpari, Masoud] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, St John, NF A1B 3X5, Canada.

Remote sensing, encompassing both active and passive techniques, offers a valuable and efficient approach for this purpose, enabling coverage of large areas while being costeffective. Passive remote sensing data could be affected by the presence of clouds, unlike active systems such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) which are relatively less affected. Therefore, this study aims to explore the utilization of bitemporal SAR data for windthrow detection in mountainous regions. Specifically, we investigated how the detection outcomes vary based on three factors: i) the SAR wavelength (X-band or C-band), ii) the acquisition period of the pre- and post-event images (summer, autumn, or winter), and iii) the forest type (evergreen vs. deciduous).

The new version of BESS (v2.0) integrated a newly developed ecosystem respiration module, an optimality-based maximum carboxylation rate (Vcmax) model, and extended the temporal coverage of flux datasets from 1982 to 2019. We evaluated BESS products against the FLUXNET2015 dataset at the site scale, and against several remote sensing and/or machine learning products on a global scale. At the site scale, BESS products agreed well with FLUXNET measurements, capturing 84%, 53%, 65%, 51% and 31% of daily variation in Rnet, ET, GPP, TER and NEE, respectively. Interannual variation in BESS NEE showed relatively low consistency with the FLUXNET measurements, while the rest fluxes explained approximately half of the interannual variation. On a global scale, we found marked discrepancies in spatio-temporal patterns between BESS and several benchmark products.

To address this problem, we proposed a generalized spectral LSR reconstruction method. First, short-term overlapping observation of the target sensor and a reference sensor currently in operation is utilized to generate a representative spectral LSR comparison dataset. Then, the differences in spectral LSR caused by spectral response functions (SRF) are explored to construct a spectral LSR reconstruction model, which can convert the reference sensor\'s spectral LSR to match the spectral LSR of the target sensor. Finally, long-term spectral LSR data of the reference sensor can be reconstructed for the target sensor to support the surface constraint for aerosol retrieval. We applied this method to the newly launched Particulate Observing Scanning Polarimeter (POSP) instrument onboard GaoFen-5 (02) satellite, using MODIS as the reference sensor. We used one-month concurrently overlapping observation of POSP and MODIS to quantify the differences in spectral LSR and built the spectral LSR reconstruction model. Four years of MODIS LSR data were then reconstructed to develop the multispectral surface constraint scheme (B2RE) for POSP, which enables POSP data for high-precision AOD retrieval. We retrieved the global AOD at 550 nm over land for December 2021 to February 2022.

However, the generality of both models has not been fully investigated, and it is not clear if inversion strategies of physically-based models can be transferred across datasets. In this study, we evaluated the generality of leaf spectroscopic models for predicting key foliar functional traits and compared the performance of physically-and empirically-based approaches. Two extensive datasets compiling a total of 3861 foliar samples were collected from 24 field sites in eastern United States and south China. The leaf radiative transfer model PROSPECT was coupled with COSINE (PROCOSINE) to retrieve foliar traits from leaf bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF). A commonly used empirically-based model, partial least squares regression (PLSR) was performed as a comparison. Results showed that both PROSPECT and PROCOSINE can accurately estimate leaf mass per area (LMA) and equivalent water thickness (EWT). Inversion strategies including the selection of optimal spectral domains and the use of prior information (IS3) greatly improved the estimation accuracy of leaf nitrogen, leaf chlorophyll a + b and carotenoids. The estimation accuracies were similar when transferring inversion strategies across datasets, indicating a high level of transferability of physically-based models. PLSR and interval PLSR (iPLSR, via feature selection) could predict foliar traits with high accuracies when cross-validation was performed, and iPLSR achieved higher accuracies. But both the empirical approaches demon-strated low transferability when applied to an independent dataset. Our findings highlight the importance of generalized traits models with respect to development and calibration of leaf radiative transfer model, as well as incorporating representative samples in training empirical models.

Moving ships are Doppler shifted by an amount proportional to their velocity. An offset between the ship and its wake is then produced during SAR processing. We present a novel automatic method for calculating the ship velocity. The method relies on multitask deep learning to estimate the offset and ship heading. From these parameters, the ship velocity can be obtained. A convolutional neural network is trained using a coupled loss function. The loss function allows both parameters to be estimated at the same time. We show the methods\' effectiveness for ships in Sentinel-1 SAR images. For this purpose, a large dataset of 30,000 AIS annotated SAR ship images is collected. These images have 20 x 22 m pixel resolution and ships do not have a clear wake. The AIS provides the true ship velocity and allows the method to be evaluated. As a result, we can determine the ship speed with an accuracy of 1.1 m/s. The offset disappears near the azimuth direction of the SAR image.

It is therefore urgent to use continuous and consistent observation and develop advanced tools to characterize and track the spatial and temporal change of coastal hypoxia. Satellite imagery with fine spatiotemporal resolution and global coverage has shown great potential for monitoring environmental changes, yet has rarely been applied to hypoxia mapping. To advance the understanding, we synthesized satellite-derived ocean color variables and dissolved oxygen measurements collected during 2014, and used random forest regression, lagged linear regression, and functional data analysis to estimate the spatiotemporal change of the hypoxia zone in the Gulf of Mexico. The three models achieved similar predictive accuracy (+/- 1.2-1.4 mg/L dissolved oxygen), but the random forest regression performed the best in estimating the bottom dissolved oxygen from satellite-derived variables. Our models also revealed time lags of roughly 0-5 and 16-19 days between the surface water process (e.g., algae bloom and ocean warming) and bottom water hypoxia, which was rarely considered in previous hypoxia studies using satellite data. Finally, our models showed that the area of Gulf hypoxia increased gradually from May and reached a peak during mid-July and mid-August in 2014, and the hypoxia zone occurred in the estuary of the Mississippi River and Suwannee River during roughly 25% of summer days. In addition to predicting the size of hypoxic zones, our study provides additional information on where, when, and how long hypoxic zones persist with greater spatial details and enables modeling hypoxic zones at near-real-time (e.g., days) temporal scales. More importantly, we demonstrate the great potential of applying satellite remote sensing for spatially explicit hypoxia mapping, which could promote more cost-effective coastal hypoxia monitoring and assessment practices.', '[Li, Yingjie; Liu, Jianguo] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Environm Sci & Policy Program, Ctr Syst Integrat & Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA.

The program is under increasing pressure to provide estimates over small areas, for which the precision of FIA estimates is limited by small sample sizes. Small area estimation (SAE) models can improve the precision of estimates by leveraging relationships between forest attributes and auxiliary data across multiple small areas of interest. SAE models with large model domains are challenged by requiring auxiliary data encompassing the large domain and by spatially varying relationships between the auxiliary data and forest attributes. We implement a Fay-Herriot SAE model that accounts for spatial variation to make estimates of forest above-ground biomass density (AGBD) within 64,000 hectare hexagons across the contiguous US. Model inference is conducted through a Bayesian paradigm, providing AGBD estimates and quantification of uncertainty through posterior standard deviations and credible intervals. We compare the utility of data from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) and the National Land Cover Database 2016 Tree Canopy Cover (TCC) product as auxiliary data within the model. Results show that models using GEDI data provide more precise estimates of AGBD than direct estimates using FIA plot data alone while giving accurate quantification of uncertainty. The model using only the TCC product as auxiliary data also reported more precise estimates, but a cross-validation study revealed the reported uncertainty to be overly optimistic for high-biomass areas. We demonstrate that accounting for spatial variation in the model is crucial, and that doing otherwise leads to poor quantification of uncertainty and locally biased estimates.

Although Triple Collocation Analysis (TCA) has been widely used to provide SM errors, the impact of rescaling technique on the TCA error estimates has not received major attention, which can lead to biased and inaccurate error estimates. Moreover, current knowledge about time-variant SM errors derived from TCA is still very limited, which hampers the advance of applying time-variant errors in data merging and data assimilation studies efficiently. Based on these considerations, this work aims to advance the use of the TCA for characterizing errors with a focus on the rescaling techniques, and validating TCA-based time-variant errors using global ground measurements in 759 grid cells. To this end, the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and four passive-based SM products, including Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity Level-3 (SMOS-L3), SMOS INRA-CESBIO (SMOS-IC), Soil Moisture Active Passive Level-3 (SMAP-L3), and SMAP INRAE BORDEAUX (SMAP-IB) SM products, were considered. The time-variant error term here denotes an aggregate error magnitude over a 101 -day moving-time-window. It is found that different selection of the rescaling technique considered in TCA led to TCA error estimates with significantly different accuracy when ground-based errors are regarded as the benchmark. The optimal combination strategy to implement TCA is applying TCA to SM anomalies and rescaling the errors by coefficients derived from the TCA model. Pearson\'s correlation with ground-based time-variant errors is 0.62, 0.72, 0.83, 0.89, and 0.93 for SMAP-IB, SMAP-L3, SMOS-IC, SMOS-L3, and ASCAT SM, respec-tively. Considering time-variant errors in applications is necessary since time-variant errors deviate from time -invariant errors by 50% when errors are rescaled by the TCA model parameters. Time-invariant errors are greater than time-variant errors when SM products are rescaled against a reference dataset while the opposite conclusion can be drawn when errors are rescaled by the TCA coefficients. TCA-and ground-based methods provide consistent evaluations in 74.7% (77.3%), 75.8% (79.8%), 79.6% (81.1%), and 78.6% (79.7%) of the analysis period on average (median) for the TCA implementations with SMAP-L3, SMAP-IB, SMOS-L3, and SMOS-IC SM, respectively. The error analysis reveals that TCA typically underestimated ASCAT errors while overestimated passive SM errors when considering ground-based evaluation as the benchmark. Moreover, TCA was found to have relatively less power to efficiently characterize SM errors in croplands when compared with other land cover types. This study validated TCA time-variant errors using ground measurements and compared TCA-and ground-based evaluation performances on a global scale. Our work arouses particular attention to the rescaling technique selection considered in TCA, which is crucial for accurately characterizing SM errors and efficiently using them in various hydrometeorological applications.', '[Wu, Kai; Hu, Zhongmin] Hainan Univ, Coll Ecol & Environm, Haikou 570000, Hainan, Peoples R China.

Intensified frozen soil collapse causes severe effects on ecosystem water and energy balance as well as on carbon cycle. Previous studies have focused on the direct effects of climate change on permafrost degradation. However, there is also growing evidence showing vegetation growth can affect regional climate system, and consequently we hypothesize that vegetation autumn phenology (i.e., the end of the growing season, EOS) may influence the start date of frozen (SOF) through feedbacks to regional climates. Using satellite greenness data derived EOS and the microwave remote sensing generated SOFESDR (freeze-thaw Earth system data record) over 2001-2018, we showed a dominant-negative (13.1% vs. 0.9%) relationship between SOFESDR and EOS, suggesting an earlier SOFESDR with a delayed EOS. We found that biogeophysical indicators served as potential connections, including surface al-bedo, soil temperature, soil water content, and evapotranspiration, for the observed relationship. We therefore proposed a new site-level SOFf(EOS)xESDR algorithm based on the EOS-SOF relationship. With ground SOFALT observed from the active layer thickness at 63 sites over Tibetan Plateau, the new model provided significantly improved estimates of SOF with Pearson\'s correlation coefficient (R) of 0.84 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.63 days, comapred with current remote sensing-based SOF product (R = 0.26, RMSE = 22.60 days). We further proposed a look-up table approach to map the SOF over TP and found an overall earlier SOF (24.0 +/- 15.8) than current SOFESDR products. Therefore, our results identified a significant correlation between the autumn phenology and the SOF variability, highlighting the importance of feedbacks of autumn phenology on climate change.', '[Li, Jialing; Wu, Mousong; Zhang, Yongguang] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.

Due to the increasing availability of remote sensing data and machine learning models like convolutional neural networks, forest maps can these days be created on large scales with high accuracy. Common methods usually predict a map from remote sensing images without deliberately considering intermediate semantic concepts that are relevant to the final map. This makes the mapping process difficult to interpret, especially when using opaque deep learning models. Moreover, such procedure is entirely agnostic to the definitions of the mapping targets (e.g., forest types depending on variables such as tree height and tree density). Common models can at best learn these rules implicitly from data, which greatly hinders trust in the produced maps. In this work, we aim at building an explainable deep learning model for forest mapping that leverages prior knowledge about forest definitions to provide explanations to its decisions. We propose a model that explicitly quantifies intermediate variables like tree height and tree canopy density involved in the forest definitions, corresponding to those used to create the forest maps for training the model in the first place, and combines them accordingly. We apply our model to mapping forest types using very high resolution aerial imagery and lay particular focus on the treeline ecotone at high altitudes, where forest boundaries are complex and highly dependent on the chosen forest definition. Results show that our rule-informed model is able to quantify intermediate key variables and predict forest maps that reflect forest definitions. Through its interpretable design, it is further able to reveal implicit patterns in the manually-annotated forest labels, which facilitates the analysis of the produced maps and their comparison with other datasets.', '[Nguyen, Thien-Anh; Kellenberger, Benjamin; Tuia, Devis] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Environm Computat Sci & Earth Observat Lab, Lausanne, Switzerland.

In this work, for the first time, we propose a new point cloud differencing methodology to detect land subsidence at basin scale, based on the multiscale model-to-model cloud comparison (M3C2) algorithm. This method is applied to two open-access airborne LiDAR datasets acquired in 2009 and 2016, respectively. First the internal edge connection errors in the different flight lines were addressed by means of a smoothing point cloud method. LiDAR datasets capture information from ground and non-ground points. Therefore, a method combining gradient filtering and cloth simulation filtering (CSF) algorithms was applied to remove non-ground points. The iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm was used for point cloud registration of both point clouds exhibiting a very stable and robust performance. The results show that vertical deformation rates are up to-14 cm/year in the basin from 2009 to 2016, in agreement with the displacement reported by previous studies. LiDAR results have been compared to the velocity measured by continuous GNSS stations and an InSAR dataset. For the GNSS-LiDAR and InSAR-LiDAR comparison, we computed a common 100 x 100 m grid in order to assess any similarities and discrepancies. The results show a good agreement between the vertical displacements obtained from the three different surveying techniques. Furthermore, LiDAR results were compared with the distribution of compressible soil thickness showing a clear relationship.

Improved assessment of SGD occurrences provides information to constrain current estimates of total freshwater discharges, which are crucial for evaluation of changes in the global water cycle. This study leverages SGD linkages to patterns in sea surface temperature (SST) and color. Typically, groundwater temperatures exhibit less variability than SST and tend to have temperature distinct from sea water. Consequently, thermally anomalous plumes often occur in coastal areas with SGD. Nutrient-enriched groundwater flows have been linked to changes in ocean color as a consequence of algae growth and of the presence of colored dissolved organic matter. Under such conditions, SGD presence may also manifest as plumes of different colors. Changes in SST and color can be captured through satellite imagery for the thermal infrared and visible bands, which are used here to detect potential SGD (PSGD) occurrences. A method based on clustering and spectroscopy techniques is applied to automatically detect PSGD plumes. SST data are clustered to map SST anomalies. Derivative analysis and angular distance are applied to identify a color signature linked to SGD. In a novel approach, SST and color are combined to identify PSGD through remote sensing. The methods presented in this study were applied to Landsat 7 and 8 imagery captured over southern Ireland and the west coast of the Island of HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, where past field surveys of radon isotopes activities and salinity have documented SGD occurrences. These selected sites are used as validation points. Derivative analysis and angular distance resulted in PSGD plumes in the vicinity of sampled locations, mainly locations with samples that are strong indicators of SGD. In general, the PSGD plumes derived from each method are compared as independent, parallel lines of evidence of PSGD occurrences. Results also show that PSGD pixels from derivative analysis and angular distance alone, without considering SST, can be obfuscated by confounding factors, such as low tides and unrelated chlorophyll enrichment, and that combining SST and color data reduces those effects. These results provide further evidence for PSGD occurrences along the south coast of Ireland and the west coast of the Island of HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, and showcase that satellite data can be used to better identify the location of PSGD occurrences over large areas.', '[Caineta, Julio] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Geol & Environm Sci, Computat Modeling & Simulat Program, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.

However, comprehensive inventories of foliar traits are important for understanding ecosystem responses to anthropogenic and natural disturbances, as inputs into ecosystem process models, and for quantifying spatial variation in functional diversity. Imaging spectroscopy has been demonstrated as a valuable tool for developing maps of ecologically important foliar traits at large scales, but its application to mapping foliar traits over the course of the growing season has been limited. We collected high-resolution imaging spectroscopy data over Blackhawk Island, Wisconsin, USA at eight time points during the 2018 growing season (May - October). Using partial least squares regression (PLSR) we developed predictive models applicable to all dates to produce canopy-level maps of eight traits related to ecophysiological function: chlorophyll content, leaf mass per area and concentrations of calcium, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, phenolics and lignin. The accuracy of our models varied across traits (R2: 0.25-0.86); traits with well-defined absorption features were retrieved with high accuracy including chlorophyll (R2: 0.86; %RMSE: 11.0) and total phenolics (R2: 0.86; %RMSE: 11.0). We also assessed how well our models estimated biochemistry on novel species and new dates using a cross-validation analysis. Chlorophyll and total phenolics were well estimated across withheld dates and species, whereas calcium was estimated poorly on both withheld species (R2: 0.08) and dates (R2: 0.07). Our canopy-level maps of macronutrients (N, P and K) showed general trends of decreasing concentration over the course of the year, reflecting dilution by carbon-rich compounds during the growing season and resorption during senescence. Conversely, recalcitrant compounds including lignin and calcium increased until late summer, after which they stabilized.

In the pastureland of Zhimei on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), a typical earthflow has drawn significant attention through social media. However, detailed knowledge of the deformation characteristics, internal hydrothermal regime, and structure is still scarce. In this study, we aim to enhance traditional satellite synthetic aperture radar interferometry to divide ground deformation into the seasonal oscillation and slope deformation components and identify the magnitude and spatial distribution of unstable slopes in frozen regions. Then, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) was combined with geophysical monitoring techniques to recognise the deformation dynamics from the pre- to post-failure stages. Sentinel-1 images, covering almost five years, highlighted that obvious creep behaviour dominated at the pre-failure stage, while a seasonal deformation pattern characterised by a piecewise distribution associated with the hydrothermal regime was observed at the post-failure stage. Fast retrogressive erosion on the head scarps at the post-failure stage was clearly identified by multidifferential digital surface models from the UAV observations. To better understand the internal structure, both electrical resistivity tomography and ground-penetrating radar were combined to determine the seasonal frozen thickness, underlying thawing materials, and vertical cracks, which controlled the kinematic evolution from the initial creep to the narrow and long oversaturated flow that represented the terminal portion of the landslide. Finally, by comparing in situ monitoring data with field investigations, the main driving factors controlling the movement mechanism are discussed. Our results highlight the specific kinematic behaviour of an earthflow and can provide a reference for slope destabilisation on the QTP under the influence of climate change.', '[Meng, Qingkai] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.

In arid and semi-arid regions water is the dominant driver of vegetation growth. However, few studies consider the fact that water can move laterally across the landscape as runoff via streams and floodplains, termed hydrologic connectivity. Using multiple observations alongside models and a hydromorphology dataset for Australia, we examine how ecosystems with high hydrologic connectivity differ in their vegetation response to water availability, soil properties, and interannual variability and extremes in vegetation productivity. We find that the average interannual variability of vegetation productivity is 21-34% higher in ecosystems with high hydrologic connectivity, with skewed annual anomalies showing larger extremes in carbon uptake. This is driven by a higher average and more variable surface soil moisture and significantly higher soil available water capacity and soil depth. These spatially small ecosystems, covering 14% of the study region, contribute 15-22% (median = 17%) to regionalscale carbon uptake through higher rates of gross photosynthesis, especially evident during wet years, and 3-37% (median = 19%) to annual anomalies. Current global land surface models do not reproduce the observed spatial patterns of interannual variability in carbon uptake over regions where hydrologic connectivity is high as they lack the mechanism of connectivity of water between discrete land surface elements. This study highlights the significant role of riparian and floodplain vegetation on the interannual variability and extremes of the regional carbon cycle.', '[Norton, Alexander J.; Parazoo, Nicholas C.; Baskaran, Latha] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.

Frequent cloud cover limits the application of optical remote sensing in timely mapping of forest changes. The freely available Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor provides an unprecedented opportunity to achieve more frequent mapping of forest harvesting than ever before (i.e., at monthly interval). The unique landscape pattern of forest harvesting from Sentienl-1 data (i. e., how a harvested patch contrasts to surrounding intact forests) holds critical information for harvesting mapping but have not been fully explored. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based (i.e., U-Net) approach using the landscape pattern from Sentinel-1 data to produce monthly maps of forest harvesting in two deforestation hotspots -California, USA and Rondo<SIC>nia, Brazil - for as long as three years. Our results show that (1) our proposed approach is reliable (mean F1 scores (the geometric mean of user\'s and producer\'s accuracies) 0.74-0.78; mean IoU (the area of intersection over union between the prediction part and target part) 0.59-0.65) for monthly forest harvesting mapping with Sentinel-1 data, outperforming the traditional object-based approach (0.38-0.43 in IoU). The varying harvesting pattern from Sentinel-1 data can be recognized by the U-Net bottleneck block as whole entities, which is the key advantage of our proposed approach; (2) multi-temporal SAR filtering is helpful for improving the accuracies of our proposed approach (increased F1 and IoU for 0.04 and 0.06, respectively); (3) our proposed model can be trained using samples collected during a particular time period over one location and be fine-tuned using sparse local samples from a new area to achieve optimal performance, and hence can greatly reduce training data collection effort when applied to new study sites; (4) forest harvesting maps produced using our approach revealed substantial variations in monthly harvesting activities: in Rondo<SIC>nia, most of the forest harvest occurred in July/August (the dry season) and about 14% of the dry season harvesting were followed by fires (i.e., slash-and-burn); in California, the rates of forest harvesting were relatively stable, but abnormally high values could occur due to salvage logging after big fires. Our novel approach for mapping forest harvesting at monthly interval represents an important step towards timely monitoring of forest harvesting and assisting stakeholders in developing sustainable strategy of forest management, especially for regions with frequent cloud cover.', '[Zhao, Feng; Wang, Mengyu] Cent China Normal Univ, Key Lab Geog Proc Anal & Simulat Hubei Prov, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

It is shown to appropriately estimate and detect regional precipitation patterns, and their spatial mean, while its performance can be improved over mountainous regions characterized by orographic precipitation, complex terrains, and for winter precipitation. Furthermore, despite IMERG\'s better performance compared to other satellite products in reproducing spatio-temporal patterns and variability of extreme precipitation, some limitations were found regarding the precipitation intensity. At the temporal scales, IMERG performs better at monthly and annual time steps than the daily and sub-daily ones. Finally, in terms of hydrological application, the use of IMERG has resulted in significant discrepancies in streamflow simulation. However, and most importantly, we find that each new version that replaces the previous one, shows substantial improvement in almost every spatiotemporal scale and climatic condition. Thus, despite its limitations, IMERG evolution reveals a promising path for current and future applications.', '[Pradhan, Rajani K.; Markonis, Yannis; Godoy, Mijael Rodrigo Vargas; Papalexiou, Simon Michael; Rahim, Akif; Hanel, Martin] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Kamyca 129, Prague 16500, Czech Republic.

Lakes are also productive ecosystems that provide habitats and influence global cycles. Chlorophyll concentration provides a common metric of water quality, and is frequently used as a proxy for lake trophic state. Here, we document the generation and distribution of the complete MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS; Appendix A provides a complete list of abbreviations) radiometric time series for over 2300 satellite resolvable inland bodies of water across the contiguous United States (CONUS) and more than 5,000 in Alaska. This contribution greatly increases the ease of use of satellite remote sensing data for inland water quality monitoring, as well as highlights new horizons in inland water remote sensing algorithm development. We evaluate the performance of satellite remote sensing Cyanobacteria Index (CI)-based chlorophyll algorithms, the retrievals for which provide surrogate estimates of phytoplankton concentrations in cyanobacteria dominated lakes. Our analysis quantifies the algorithms\' abilities to assess lake trophic state across the CONUS. As a case study, we apply a bootstrapping approach to derive a new CI-to-chlorophyll relationship, Chl(BS), which performs relatively well with a multiplicative bias of 1.11 (11%) and mean absolute error of 1.60 (60%). While the primary contribution of this work is the distribution of the MERIS radiometric timeseries, we provide this case study as a roadmap for future stakeholders\' algorithm development activities, as well as a tool to assess the strengths and weaknesses of applying a single algorithm across CONUS.', '[Seegers, Bridget N.; Werdell, P.

This indicates that requirement of complete global coverage on the daily basis has not been met. On the other hand, using synergistic observations from different radiometers seems promising to enhance the temporal resolution of observations in such areas, whereas cross-radiometer inter-calibration is essential prior to their synergism. For this purpose, conventional inter-calibration models are usually built based on linear relations of brightness temperature (TB) between different radiometers. However, the linear model has relatively poor performance in low latitudes primarily due to wet surface conditions. In this study, we propose an improved non-linear model for calibrating MWRI TB against AMSR-2 TB at 18.7 GHz and 23.8 GHz channels. Global land surface temperature (LST) is estimated using the post-calibration MWRI TB data and then validated against AMSR-2 based LST, MODIS based LST, and in situ near-surface air temperature datasets in low latitudes respectively. The validation results show that LST outcome based on the improved non-linear inter-calibration method has smaller global Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) below 3.5 K, compared with the RMSEs of-6 K obtained from the conventional linear inter-calibration method and from the results without inter-calibration. Further analysis also shows that synergistic observations between AMSR-2 and MWRI are capable of shortening the maximum global revisit cycle of AMSR-2 LST from-2 days to less than 1.2 days. These results indicate that the improved inter-calibration method is effective for obtaining daily LST datasets with quasi-complete global coverage and reliable accuracy.', '[Song, Peilin; Zhang, Yongqiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.', 'Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural   Resources Research, CASRP Zhang, YQ (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.', 'zhangyq@igsnrr.ac.cnRI YONGQIANG, ZHANG/C-5708-2008; Song, Peilin/AGQ-4274-2022', 'YONGQIANG, ZHANG/0000-0002-3562-2323; Song, Peilin/0000-0003-1756-6599', 'National Natural Science Foundation of China [42001304, 41971032,   52009127]; CAS Pioneer Talents Program; CAS Special Research Assistant   Funding Program', 'This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of   China (Grant No. 42001304, 41971032, 52009127), CAS Pioneer Talents   Program, and CAS Special Research Assistant Funding Program.

Widely-used MOD16 ET product (MOD-ET) is a representative of Penman-Monteith method coupled with MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) optic observations. Although MOD-ET has been extensively evaluated over the world, its accuracy under various cloud conditions remains unevaluated. Combining MODIS-observed cloud cover (Frc) and in-situ measurements at sixteen forests sites in East Asia, we evaluated 8-day MOD-ET and its primary MODIS inputs (i.e. LAI, FPAR and albedo) from clear to cloudy sky. A new satellite microwave ET method based on microwave Emissivity Difference Vegetation Index (EDVI-ET) was also compared with MODET. Results showed that the accuracy of MOD-ET was highly variable under the changing Frc over the forests. The largest bias ( 10%, while slight increase of Frc (10%-30%) reduced the bias (10%-20%). Further increase of Frc ( 13%) under similar sky conditions. A higher Taylor score (0.84) for EDVI-ET was found under Frc of 4% than MOD-ET (0.66), while two ET had close scores ( 0.81) under other sky conditions. Further investigation found that MOD-ET over four tropical coastal forests contributed most to the bias, especially under least cloudy sky. A case study at a tropical forest showed that MODIS LAI/FPAR and surface albedo products were overestimated, which could directly cause the overestimation of canopy-scale conductance and the underestimation of net solar radiation in MOD-ET method, respectively. Analysis showed that the bias in MOD-ET was significantly related to the bias in MODIS LAI under various Frc, but it was weakly related to that in MODIS albedo, suggesting that LAI-based conductance might dominate the overestimation of MOD-ET. During a consecutive cloud cover period when fewer reliable MODIS pixels are available, slight increase of clouds partly reduced MODIS-observed signals of LAI/FPAR and increased those of albedo over the tropical forest, resulting in the lower bias in MOD-ET. More clouds reduced surface MODIS albedo and might increase the uncertainty in all-sky shortwave radiation from reanalysis data, which deteriorated MOD-ET accuracy under overcast sky. Our study highlighted the importance of cloud impacts on the satellite ET estimation.', '[Wang, Yipu; Li, Rui; Hu, Jiheng; Kabeja, Crispin; Wang, Yu] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China.

We ran a total of three different inversion algorithms that are representative of commonly applied approaches and we used two different metrics to calculate functional diversity. In tandem with Sentinel-2 image-based estimation of plant traits, we measured Leaf Area Index (LAI), leaf Chlorophyll content (CAB), and Leaf Mass per Area (LMA) in-situ in a (semi-)natural heterogeneous landscape (Montesinho region) located in northern Portugal. Sampling plots were scaled and georeferenced to match the satellite observed pixels and thereby allowed for a direct one-to-one posterior ground truth validation of individual traits and functional diversity. Across approaches, we observe a reasonable correspondence between the satellite-based retrievals and the insitu observations in terms of the relative distribution of individual trait means and plant functional diversity across locations despite the heterogeneity of the landscape and canopies. The functional diversity estimates, based on a combination of canopy and leaf traits, were robust against estimation biases in trait means. Particularly, the convex hull volume estimate of functional diversity showed strong concordance with in-situ observations across all three inversion methods (Spearman\'s rho: 0.67-0.80). The remotely sensed estimates of functional diversity also related to in-situ taxonomic diversity (Spearman\'s rho: 0.55-0.63). Our work highlights the potential and challenges of RTM-based functional diversity metrics to study spatial community-level ecological patterns using currently operational and publicly available Sentinel-2 imagery. While further validation and assessment across different ecosystems and larger datasets are needed, the study contributes towards a further maturation of scalable, spatially, and temporally explicit methods for functional diversity assessments from space.', '[Hauser, Leon T.; van der Windt, Niels; Timmermans, Joris; Soudzilovskaia, Nadejda A.; van Bodegom, Peter M.] Leiden Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Dept Environm Biol, POB 9518, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.

The Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), launched in September 2018, carries the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) instrument capable of detecting individual photons reflected back from vegetation canopy. ICESat-2 data is delivering global estimates of forest structure; however, analysis of the performance of ICESat-2 on-orbit data across a range of forest conditions remains limited. This study derives structural estimates of (i) canopy height, (ii) canopy cover and (iii) canopy height variability from ICESat-2 data acquired in snow-free and low atmospheric scattering conditions over different boreal forest structural types in Ontario, Canada. ICESat-2 structural estimates were derived from the Global Geolocated Photon Data (ATL03) and Land and Vegetation Height (ATL08) data products and compared against single-photon detection airborne LiDAR (Leica SPL100). An extensive network of ground plots were used to stratify the study area into three distinct forest structural groups, each resulting from different stand development stages. ICESat-2 and SPL100 estimates of canopy height were compared at the ATL03 photon level, whereas estimates of height variability and canopy cover were compared for spatial analysis units (AU; mean size = 1287 m2). ICESat-2 photons returned from the top of the canopy underestimated canopy height relative to SPL100 by an average of 2.3 m overall and corresponded most strongly to the 90th percentile (P90) of coincident airborne SPL100 returns (root mean square difference (RMSD) = 2.9 m and correlation coefficient (r) = 0.84). The lowest average underestimation of SPL P90 was observed in homogeneous stands that were relatively simple, and singlelayered with a single dominant species (RMSD = 2.5 m, r = 0.84). We observed the least agreement of ICESat-2 and SPL forest structural metrics in over-mature stands with complex structure and greater variability in canopy heights (RMSD = 3.5 m, r = 0.64). For the AUs, the strength of the relationship between SPL100 and ICESat-2 canopy height percentiles increased with increasing height percentiles (e.g. P25 RMSD% = 77.8%; P95 RMSD% = 23.7%). ICESat-2 generally underestimated canopy height variability relative to the SPL100 data, with both data having similar absolute variability (standard deviation of canopy heights RMSD% = 26.8%, r = 0.75), but lower agreement in relative variability (coefficient of variation of canopy heights RMSD% = 33.9%, r = 0.45). Herein we propose the use of the vegetation fill index as a method to estimate canopy cover with ICESat-2. Comparison of SPL100 and ICESat-2 vegetation fill indices at the AU level resulted in strong agreement overall (RMSD% = 19.7%; r = 0.57). These observations and results contribute to the overall objective of building a comprehensive understanding of the performance of ICESat-2 for characterizing vegetation structure in boreal forest environments.', '[Queinnec, Martin; Coops, Nicholas C.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Resources Management, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.

The interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique can efficiently and quickly provide seismic deformation information. There is no clear relationship model between seismic deformation and the degree of building damage.   Considering the earthquake that hit Wenchuan (China) on May 12, 2008, in this work, a method to evaluate the degree of building damage based on coseismic deformation is presented. Based on 51 building area samples selected, taking the Deformation normalization index(DNI) as the independent variable and the earthquake damage index (EDI) of the field survey data provided by the China Earthquake Administration (CEA) as the dependent variable, the relationships between seismic damage survey data and the seismic deformation of adobe structures, brick-wood structures, brick-concrete structures and reinforced concrete frame structures are analysed. There are linear relationships between the normalized deformation indices of adobe and brick-concrete structure types and the EDIs of buildings. There are quadratic relationships between the normalized seismic deformation indices of brick-wood structures and reinforced concrete frame construction types and the EDIs of buildings. Additionally, the regional curve estimates of the comprehensive building damage index and the normalized index of seismic deformation show that there is a quadratic relationship between the comprehensive building damage index and the normalized index of seismic deformation. The validity of the modelling method was verified by data from the Yushu earthquake in 2010. The results can provide an accurate and reliable reference basis for post-earthquake rescue and decision making. The work represents a new concept and method for the rapid assessment of building damage data from the perspective of surface deformation movement by addressing methodological steps, highlighting the potential of using the coseismic deformation field obtained during building damage assessment, and discussing the potential and limitations of InSAR technology in the field of damage detection.', '[Li, Qiang; Wang, Jianfei; Zhang, Jingfa] Natl Inst Nat Hazards, Beijing 10085, Peoples R China.

This study aimed to obtain the spatio-temporal distribution of rice phenology using time series Sentinel-1A images. In this study, a systematic method for spatial and temporal phenological estimation was developed based on multi-temporal Sentinel data. This method consisted of: (1) the Spectral Similarity Measures (SSM) approach for rice mapping, and (2) the DTHT-PF approach, which includes a dynamic threshold algorithm (DT), a hierarchical tree (HT), and a particle filter (PF) used for phenology estimation. Thereinto, a dynamic threshold algorithm for transplanting date retrieval and a hierarchical tree for obtaining an initial phenology, which is then run through a PF, are proposed based on the SAR backscatter time series. In brief, we found that the VH backscatter has the potential to provide accurate phenological estimations for paddy rice. Furthermore, rice mapping at a high accuracy level of 92.97%, transplanting date retrieval, and initial phenology estimations lay a good foundation for understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of rice phenology. A determination factor (R2) and a root mean square error (RMSE) obtained using the DTHT-PF method were much higher (approximately 0.52 in the difference) and lower (approximately 14.67 in the difference), respectively, than those obtained using the PF approach with uniform initialization. R2 and RMSE values obtained using the real-time DTHT-PF method are slightly different from those obtained using the non-real-time DTHT-PF method. Map analysis revealed that the transplanting dates and the spatial distribution phenology were larger in the west and north of the study area near the South China Sea because of higher temperatures and earlier transplanting. Altogether, our results suggest that the DTHT-PF method and the VH backscatter obtained from the Sentinel-1A images have great potential for furthering our understanding of the spatio-temporal distribution of phenology estimation.

However, most ocean colour satellite sensors do not have UV bands, and the accurate retrieval of UV remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) from UV satellite data is still a challenge. In order to address this problem, this study proposes a hybrid approach for estimating UV Rrs from the visible bands. The approach was implemented with two popular ocean colour satellite sensors, i.e. GCOM-C SGLI and Sentinel-3 OLCI. In situ Rrs collected globally and simulated Rrs spectra were used to develop UV Rrs retrieval models, and UV Rrs values at 360, 380 and 400 nm were estimated from visible Rrs spectra. The performances of the established models were evaluated using in situ Rrs and satellite data, and applied to a semi-analytical algorithm for IOPs retrieval. The results showed that: (i) UV Rrs retrieval models had low uncertainties with mean absolute percentage differences (MAPD) less than 5%; (ii) the model assessment with in situ Rrs showed high accuracy (r = 0.92?1.00 and MAPD = 1.11%?10.95%) in both clear open ocean and optically complex waters; (iii) the model assessment with satellite data indicated that model-estimated UV Rrs were more consistent with in situ values than satellite-derived UV Rrs; and (iv) model-estimated UV Rrs may improve the decomposition accuracy of absorption coefficients in semi-analytical IOPs algorithm. Thus, the proposed method has great potentials for reconstructing UV Rrs data and improving IOPs retrieval for historical satellite sensors, and might also be useful for UV-based atmospheric correction algorithms.', '[Liu, Huizeng; Li, Qingquan; Wang, Junjie; Shi, Tiezhu; Hu, Zhongwen; Yang, Chao; Hu, Shuibo; Wu, Guofeng] Shenzhen Univ, MNR Key Lab Geoenvironm Monitoring Great Bay Area, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China.

In this study, we propose a novel semi-analytical method for estimating TSS in clear to extremely turbid waters from remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs). The proposed method includes three sub-algorithms used sequentially. First, the remotely sensed waters are classified into clear (Type I), moderately turbid (Type II), highly turbid (Type III), and extremely turbid (Type IV) water types by comparing the values of R-rs at 490, 560, 620, and 754 nm. Second, semi-analytical models specific to each water type are used to determine the particulate backscattering coefficients (b(bp)) at a corresponding single wavelength (i.e., 560 nm for Type I, 665 nm for Type II, 754 nm for Type III, and 865 nm for Type IV). Third, a specific relationship between TSS and b(bp) at the corresponding wavelength is used in each water type. Unlike other existing approaches, this method is strictly semi-analytical and its sub-algorithms were developed using synthetic datasets only. The performance of the proposed method was compared to that of three other state-of-the-art methods using simulated (N = 1000, TSS ranging from 0.01 to 1100 g/m(3)) and in situ measured (N = 3421, TSS ranging from 0.09 to 2627 g/m(3)) pairs of R-rs and TSS. Results showed a significant improvement with a Median Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 16.0% versus 30.2-90.3% for simulated data and 39.7% versus 45.9-58.1% for in situ data, respectively. The new method was subsequently applied to 175 MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and 498 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) images acquired in the 2003-2020 timeframe to produce long-term TSS time-series for Lake Suwa and Lake Kasumigaura, Japan.

This study assesses the emission characteristics of cities in the Northern Hemisphere during two winter seasons from December 2018 to March 2020 using a combination of CO2 observations from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (000-2) along with CO and NO2 observations from the Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPO-spheric Monitoring Instrument (S-5P TROPOMI). We calculate the estimates of urban enhancement concentrations of CO2, CO, and NO2 from anthropogenic emissions in cities. Moreover, using ratios of CO/CO2 and NO2/CO2 according to each city, we analyze the relationship between CO2 and air pollutants and find that cities show distinct emission patterns according to where they are located in different regions of the world. Our analysis shows that a positive relationship exists in the comparisons of CO/CO2 and NO2/CO2 ratios to city population and GDP. However, when cities in the Northern Hemisphere are divided into \"developed\" and \"developing\" regions, a difference in pattern is found where most developed cities show a smaller increase of both CO/CO2 and NO2/CO2 ratios with the increase of GDP, while developing cities show a larger increase of ratios per increase of GDP. Especially, developing cities facing rapid economic development like Mumbai and Tianjin show high emission ratios that almost match that of developed cities. The higher incline of increase in emission ratios in developing cities can be attributed to the low combustion efficiency of fossil fuels along with less stringent pollution control measures. This implies that pollution control measures are crucial for effective management of air quality degradation with economic advancement within these developing cities. The analysis also highlights the importance of urban geological features in cities such as that of Tehran and Milan which can trap air pollution under appropriate meteorological conditions. Despite the short period of analysis, our study demonstrates that satellite observations of CO2 and air pollutants together can provide clues about factors controlling the co-emission of air pollutants and carbon in cities and suggests that the application of the proposed methods with longer periods of observation will support coupled air quality and climate mitigation strategies.', '[Park, Hayoung; Jeong, Sujong; Park, Hoonyoung] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Environm Planning Dept, Gwanak Ro 1, Seoul 08826, South Korea.

Notably, the time-series vegetation trends vary unevenly over time. However, conventional linear methods based on the stationarity assumption, cannot detect the implicit characteristics of nonlinear and gradual vegetation changes. Meanwhile, characterizing the inherent features of nonlinearity and nonstationarity of climatic drivers remains a challenge. This study applied multidimensional ensemble empirical mode decomposition (MEEMD) and Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BEAST) algorithm to diagnose spatiotemporal evolution and abrupt change in vegetation secular trends based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data of the Hexi Corridor during 1982-2015. Geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) was used to address the spatiotemporal nonlinearity and nonstationarity of climatic drivers. A wide range of browning trends gradually evolved into greening trends from 1982 to 2015. Compared with ordinary least squares regression, MEEMD could adaptively decompose short-term trends of noise and seasonality and elucidate the entire evolutionary process of NDVI trends. Browning trends prevailed before abrupt changes, and greening trends widely expanded after 2006 due to drought before and intense precipitation during this year. GTWR addressed the nonequilibrium effect of the time dimension on climate drivers, and the R-squared achieved 0.86. The response processes between vegetation and climatic drivers showed significant spatiotemporal nonstationarity and aggregation characteristics based on three-dimensional visualization. In addition to the drivers of temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and potential evapotranspiration, the drying effect and mechanical stimuli of wind speed on vegetation could not be underestimated.

Ill-posedness of the model inversion problem leads to multiple interpretations of one satellite observation, and using prior information is a promising way to reduce the ill-posedness and increase the accuracy of land surface products. Tobler\'s first law of geography states that \"everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things\". Likewise, it is expected that the state of an object at a single moment is related to the state at every other moment, but temporally near attributes are more related than distant ones. This temporal autocorrelation is a vital source of prior information and can be used to improve the retrieval accuracy. In this study, we develop a retrieval framework that makes use of the temporal autocorrelation and dependence of land surface and atmospheric properties. We apply this retrieval algorithm to Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) satellite data to derive land surface biophysical variables with a focus on leaf area index (LAI) from top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance observations. The results from both a synthetic dataset and a real satellite dataset show that the use of the temporal continuity as a priori information improves the accuracy of the estimation of land surface properties, such as leaf chlorophyll content and LAI. Compared with the MODIS LAI products, much less unrealistic short-term fluctuations are found in the LAI retrievals from OLCI with the time-series retrieval approach across different land cover types including cropland, forest and savannah. Field measurements of LAI at two forest sites quantitatively confirm that the estimated LAI from OLCI is reasonably accurate with R-2 > 0.65 and RMSE < 1.00 m(2)m(-2). Overall, the time series retrieval results in more robust and smoother time series than standard retrievals of LAI from individual scenes, more stable retrievals than the MODIS LAI product, and values of LAI that match better with reported measurements in the field. The present retrieval framework can make better use of time series of spectral observations and potentially of multi-sensor observations.', '[Yang, Peiqi; Verhoef, Wout; Prikaziuk, Egor; van der Tol, Christiaan] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.', 'University of TwenteRP Yang, PQ (通讯作者)，Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.', 'p.yang@utwente.nlRI Prikaizuk, Egor/HHD-0985-2022', 'Prikaziuk, Egor/0000-0002-7331-7004', 'Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research [ALWGO.2017.018];   European Union\'s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under   the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [721995]', 'The first author (Peiqi Yang) was supported by the Netherlands   Organization for Scientific Research, grant ALWGO.2017.018.

However, monitoring the spatial and temporal variability in forest flowering at landscape scales is challenging (e.g. current monitoring is often highly localized and in-situ or for single dates). This study presents a method that combines drone and satellite images (PlanetScope) that can produce landscape-scale maps of flowering dynamics. This method is demonstrated in forest landscapes dominated by the eucalypt Corymbia calophylla (red gum or marri) in Western Australia. Dronederived images of flowering eucalypt canopies, available for restricted temporal and spatial extents, are used to label satellite image pixels with the proportion of a pixel footprint that is flowering. The pixels labelled with flowering proportion, the response variable, are combined with various metrics that characterize time series of spectral indices sensitive to the presence of green vegetation and cream-colored flowers, the predictor variables. A machine learning model then predicts daily pixel-level flowering proportions. The model is trained with data from two sites and is tested with data from three sites and various dates throughout the Corymbia calophylla season. The model is able to accurately predict pixel-level flowering proportion throughout the flowering season (RMSE <4% across all sites and dates), across sites with dense to sparse canopy, different background soil covers, and is robust to not detecting false positive flowering when no flowering events are occurring. Due to the spatiotemporal coverage of satellite images, this model can be deployed to generate regional maps of flowering dynamics in forest ecosystems that can be used for monitoring forest ecosystem condition and supporting research into drivers of eucalypt forest phenology.', '[Dixon, Dan J.; Callow, J.

The spatial resolution of MODIS time-series (i.e., 500 m), however, is too coarse for local monitoring. A feasible solution to this problem is to downscale the coarse MODIS images, thus creating time-series images with both fine spatial and temporal resolutions. Generally, the downscaling of MODIS images can be achieved by fusing them with fine spatial resolution images (e.g., Landsat images) using spatio-temporal fusion methods. Among the families of spatiotemporal fusion methods, spatial unmixing-based methods have been applied widely owing to their lighter dependence on the available fine spatial resolution images. However, all techniques within this class of method suffer from the same serious problem, that is, the block effect, which reduces the prediction accuracy of spatiotemporal fusion. To our knowledge, almost no solution has been developed to tackle this issue directly. To address this need, this paper proposes a blocks-removed spatial unmixing (SU-BR) method, which removes the blocky artifacts by including a new constraint constructed based on spatial continuity. SU-BR provides a flexible framework suitable for any existing spatial unmixing-based spatio-temporal fusion method. Experimental results on a heterogeneous region, a homogeneous region and a region experiencing land cover changes show that SUBR removes the blocks effectively and increases the prediction accuracy obviously in all three regions. SU-BR also outperforms two popular spatio-temporal fusion methods. SU-BR, thus, provides a crucial solution to overcome one of the longest standing challenges in spatio-temporal fusion.', '[Wang, Qunming; Peng, Kaidi; Tang, Yijie; Tong, Xiaohua] Tongji Univ, Coll Surveying & Geoinformat, 1239 Siping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.

These datasets are often derived using operator-biased and time-consuming manual delineation approaches, despite the recent emergence of semi-automatic mapping methods. These methods have used elevation or multispectral data, but the varying slope and mixed spectral signal of these dynamic features makes the transferability of these approaches particularly challenging. We develop three semi-automated and objective new approaches, based on the Spectral Curvature and Linear Spectral Unmixing of multispectral images, to map these features at a glacier to regional scale. The transferability of each method is assessed by applying it to three sites in the Himalaya, where debris-covered glaciers are widespread, with varying lithologic, glaciological and climatic settings, and encompassing different periods of the melt season. We develop the new methods keeping in mind the wide range of remote sensing platforms currently in use, and focus in particular on two products: we apply the three approaches at each site to near-contemporaneous atmospherically-corrected Pleiades (2 m resolution) and Sentinel-2 (10 m resolution) images and assess the effects of spatial and spectral resolution on the results. We find that the Spectral Curvature method works best for the high spatial resolution, four band Pleaides images, while a modification of the Linear Spectral Unmixing using the scaling factor of the unmixing is best for the coarser spatial resolution, but additional spectral information of Sentinel-2 products. In both cases ice cliffs are mapped with a Dice coefficient higher than 0.48. Comparison of the Pleiades results with other existing methods shows that the Spectral Curvature approach performs better and is more robust than any other existing automated or semi-automated approaches. Both methods outline a high number of small, sometimes shallow-sloping and thinly debris-covered ice patches that differ from our traditional understanding of cliffs but may have non-negligible impact on the mass balance of debris-covered glaciers. Overall these results pave the way for large scale efforts of ice cliff mapping that can enable inclusion of these features in debris-covered glacier melt models, as well as allow the generation of multiple datasets to study processes of cliff formation, evolution and decline.', '[Kneib, M.; Miles, E.

Light-fishing activities clearly showed spatial and seasonal patterns and a newly developed \"hotspot\" with the presence of many intensive lights observed in the open ocean during spring. These satellite observations are consistent with seasonal changes in the fishing grounds of a Chinese large-sized, falling-net fishing fleet based on catch monitoring records for a typical commercial fishing vessel and Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) data from this fleet. Catch monitoring records show that this type of vessel operates both on the northern shelf and in the oceanic waters, with apparent seasonal fishing patterns in the SCS. Dominant catches on the shelf include Carangids, Trichiurus japonicus, and Loligo spp., while Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis and Auxis spp. overwhelm catches in the oceanic waters. Furthermore, we compared VMS and Day Night Band (DNB) data to study fishing behaviors of this type of vessel, including match rates between VMS and nightly satellite images and the DNB radiance characteristics of the vessels. This study is valuable for delineating squid fishing grounds in the open SCS and provides an important basis for differentiating light fishing vessels of China from those of other countries, which may be useful for detecting illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities.

The crucial PSF effect has been neglected in existing SPM methods. This paper proposes a general model to reduce the PSF effect in SPM. The model is applicable to any SPM methods treating spectral unmixing as pre-processing. To demonstrate the advantages of the new technique it was necessary to develop a new approach for accuracy assessment of SPM. To-date, accuracy assessment for SPM has been limited to subpixel classification accuracy, ignoring the performance of reproducing spatial structure in downscaling. In this paper, a new accuracy index is proposed which considers SPM performances in classification and restoration of spatial structure simultaneously. Experimental results show that by considering the PSF effect, more accurate SPM results were produced and small-sized patches and elongated features were restored more satisfactorily. Moreover, using the novel accuracy index, the quantitative evaluation was found to be more consistent with visual evaluation. This paper, thus, addresses directly two of the longest standing challenges in SPM (i.e., the limitations of the PSF effect and accuracy assessment undertaken only on a subpixel-by-subpixel basis).', '[Wang, Qunming; Zhang, Chengyuan; Tong, Xiaohua] Tongji Univ, Coll Surveying & Geoinformat, 1239 Siping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.

As a result of the low operating cost, high flexibility, and the ability to achieve real-time data acquisition, UAV-borne hyperspectral systems have become an im-portant data source for remote sensing based agricultural monitoring. However, precise crop classification based on UAV-borne H2 imagery is a challenging task when faced with a number of different crop classes. The traditional hyperspectral classification methods, such as the spectral-based and object-oriented classification methods, have difficulty in classifying H2 imagery, faced with the problems of salt-and-pepper (SP) noise and scale selection. In this article, the deep convolutional neural network with a conditional random field classifier (CNNCRF) framework is proposed for precise crop classification with UAV-borne H2 imagery. In the proposed method, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to extract and fuse in-depth spectral and local spatial features, and the conditional random field (CRF) model further incorporates the spatial-contextual information to improve the problem of holes and isolated regions in the classification map. Meanwhile, virtual sample augmentation based on the hyperspectral imaging mechanism is used to lessen the issue of the limited labeled samples. To validate the results, a new dataset-the Wuhan UAV-borne hyperspectral image (WHU-Hi) dataset-has been built for precise crop classification. The experimental results obtained using the WHU-Hi dataset confirm the accuracy and visualization performance of the proposed CNNCRF classification method, which outperforms the previous methods. In addition, the WHU-Hi dataset could serve as a benchmark dataset for hyperspectral image classification studies.', '[Zhong, Yanfei; Hu, Xin; Luo, Chang; Zhang, Liangpei] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

A major issue with EW images is that the cross-polarized HV and VH channels have prominent additive noise patterns relative to low backscatter intensity, which disrupts tasks that require manual or automated interpretation. The European Space Agency (ESA) provides a method for removing the additive noise pattern by means of lookup tables, but applying them directly produces unsatisfactory results because characteristics of the noise still remain. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the magnitude of the additive noise dynamically depends on factors that are not considered by the ESA estimated noise field.   To address these issues we propose a quadratic objective function to model the mis-scale of the provided noise field on an image. We consider a linear denoising model that re-scales the noise field for each subswath, whose parameters are found from a least-squares solution over the objective function. This method greatly reduces the presence of additive noise while not requiring a set of training images, is robust to heterogeneity in images, dynamically estimates parameters for each image, and finds parameters using a closed-form solution.   Two experiments were performed to validate the proposed method. The first experiment simulated noise removal on a set of RADARSAT-2 images with noise fields artificially imposed on them. The second experiment conducted noise removal on a set of Sentinel-1 images taken over the five oceans. Afterwards, quality of the noise removal was evaluated based on the appearance of open-water.

This is the first work evaluating the potential use of CALIOP for ocean applications at regional scale in mid-latitude regions (i.e. Mediterranean, MED, and Black Sea, BS) and investigating the added information on ocean particles given by the column integrated depolarization ratio (delta(T)) parameter. We implemented and refined a retrieval procedure to estimate this parameter at 1/4 degree of spatial resolution, comparing 7 years of CALIOP observations (2011-2017) to the corresponding Copernicus multi-sensor L3 ocean colour products of the surface particle backscattering coefficient (b(bp)) and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a). This study pointed out that the current CALIOP sampling is inadequate to detect subtle day-night difference due to plankton diel variability for these basins. At a basin scale, delta(T) covaries with b(bp) for b(bp) >= 0.0015 m(-1). This is more evident for BS (R = 0.84) than for MED (R = 0.61). The analysis of seasonal distributions confirm this result for BS, where dT has a semi-annual cycle in very good agreement with bbp. In the MED, characterized by different trophic regimes, delta(T) shows also some similarities with Chl-a annual cycle. The combined characterization in the MED bioregions of the annual patterns of b(bp):Chl-a, delta(T):Chl-a and delta(T):b(bp) ratios suggested that delta(T) parameter can provide valuable information about the non-sphericity and the size of ocean particles.', '[Dionisi, Davide; Brando, Vittorio Ernesto; Volpe, Gianluca; Colella, Simone; Santoleri, Rosalia] Italian Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Marine Sci ISMAR, Rome, Italy.', 'Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Neuroscienze   (IN-CNR); Istituto di Scienze Marine (ISMAR-CNR)RP Dionisi, D (通讯作者)，Italian Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Marine Sci ISMAR, Rome, Italy.', 'davide.dionisi@cnr.itRI Dionisi, Davide/K-5461-2019; Brando, Vittorio/A-1321-2008', 'Dionisi, Davide/0000-0003-3854-521X; Brando,   Vittorio/0000-0002-2193-5695; VOLPE, GIANLUCA/0000-0002-3916-5393;   COLELLA, SIMONE/0000-0002-7727-7353', 'Ocean Colour Thematic Assembly Centre of the Copernicus Marine   Environment and Monitoring Service [77-CMEMS-TAC-OC]', 'The NASA Langley Research Center is acknowledged for providing CALIOP   version 4.1 Level 1 data through the Atmospheric Science Data Center   (https://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/HORDERBIN/HTML_Start.cgi).This work has   been performed in the context of the Ocean Colour Thematic Assembly   Centre of the Copernicus Marine Environment and Monitoring Service   (grant number: 77-CMEMS-TAC-OC).

This study focused on hurricane Maria\'s effect on Puerto Rico\'s forests as well as the effect of landform and forest characteristics on observed disturbance patterns. We used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to assess the severity of forest disturbance using a disturbance metric based on Landsat 8 satellite data composites with pre and post-hurricane Maria. Forest structure, tree phenology characteristics, and landforms were obtained from satellite data products, including digital elevation model and global forest canopy height. Our analyses showed that forest structure, and characteristics such as forest age and forest type affected patterns of forest disturbance. Among forest types, highest disturbance values were found in sierra palm, transitional, and tall cloud forests; seasonal evergreen forests with coconut palm; and mangrove forests. For landforms, greatest disturbance metrics was found at high elevations, steeper slopes, and windward surfaces. As expected, high levels of disturbance were also found close to the hurricane track, with disturbance less severe as hurricane Maria moved inland.

To ascertain the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of high-altitude river ice at the basin scale, we selected the Babao River basin as the study area, which is a typical river basin located in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Utilizing 447 available Landsat images during the river ice period from 1999 to 2018 and the classical normalized difference snow index (NDSI) algorithm, we monitored the river ice in a long time series at the Babao River basin. The average Khat of accuracy validation reached 0.973. The average area of river ice in the river ice period of this basin showed a weak decreasing trend and was negatively correlated with air temperature. We also found that gentle slopes and high elevations are beneficial for the development of river ice. The melting of river ice supplements river discharge in spring.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to enhance our knowledge about the effects of forest structure on albedo. Here, we present a global assessment of the links between forest structure and albedo at a 1-km spatial resolution using generalized additive models (GAMs). We used remotely sensed data to obtain variables representing forest structure, including forest density, leaf area index, and tree cover, during the peak growing season in 2005 with pure forest pixels that cover similar to 7% of the Earth\'s surface. Furthermore, we estimated black-sky albedo at a solar zenith angle of 38 degrees using the most recent collection of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS; version 6) at shortwave, near-infrared, and visible spectral regions. In addition, for the first time, we mapped the magnitude of the relationship between forest structure and albedo at each pixel with a 0.5-degree spatial resolution. Our results suggested that forest structure may modulate albedo in most of the sub-biomes. The response of shortwave albedo was always positive to the leaf area index and negative to the tree cover (except for deciduous broadleaf forests in mediterranean and temperate regions), while the response to forest density varied across space in 2005. The spatial map affirmed that the links between forest structure and albedo vary over geographical locations. In sum, our study emphasized the importance of forest structure in the surface albedo regulation.

We conducted two sets of model-only and data assimilation experiments using the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM), applying (over peatlands only) in one of them a peatland-specific adaptation (PEATCLSM). The evaluation against in-situ measurements of peatland groundwater table depth indicates the superiority of PEATCLSM model physics and additionally improved performance after assimilating SMOS Tb observations. The better performance of PEATCLSM over nearly all Northern Hemisphere peatlands is further supported by the better agreement between SMOS Tb observations and Tb estimates from the model-only and data assimilation runs.

However, this requirement is often compromised due to the complexity of the aviation environment. Satellite remote sensing (RS) provides a complementary means for tracing aircraft, but is often limited to finding motionless aircraft under specific scenarios (e.g., at airports). Here, based on the inter-band offsets due to hardware parallax in push-broom sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument or MSI), we develop a method for detecting flying aircraft in an automated fashion. Supported by a hybrid computation framework (based on Google Earth Engine computation and local computation) specifically designed to address the challenge of processing large volume of moderate resolution RS data at a global scale, the method is applied to more than 2.31 million MSI images to establish a map of the global distribution of flying aircraft. The detected flying aircraft coincide well with those determined using traditional techniques (e.g., Flightradar24), when both datasets co-exist. With the existing and future moderate-resolution data captured by push-broom satellite sensors, the method is believed to provide a robust and cost-effective means of detecting aircraft status at a global scale, thus supplementing the traditional methods for tracking flying aircraft. The same method is also used to estimate the inter-band and inter-granule time offsets in multi-band MSI and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images, which may provide critical information needed to correct artifacts in aquatic applications.', '[Liu, Yongxue; Xu, Bihua; Zhi, Weifeng; Dong, Yanzhu; Jin, Song; Lu, Yingcheng; Chen, Tianxin; Xu, Wenxuan; Liu, Yongchao; Zhao, Bingxue; Lu, Wanyun] Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

In addition, the instantaneous observation geometry (e.g. the sun and sensor zenith and azimuth angles) largely influences the observed TOC reflectance due to the changes in shadow fraction in the canopies. As a result, forest TOC reflectance is highly dynamic, following the seasonal patterns of optical and structural properties of vegetation.   From the above-mentioned factors, the leaf optical properties are the most important. They hold an information on leaf biochemical (e.g. chlorophyll and carotenoid contents), water content and structural (e.g., leaf thickness, distribution of pigments within a leaf) properties at the leaf-level. Whereas biochemical effects on leaf reflectance are well understood, the role of dorsiventral asymmetry leaf internal structure on two-sided leaf optical properties has not been paid much attention, assuming equal optical properties on both leaf sides. However, the internal structure of a dorsiventral leaf is highly asymmetric often having different surface structure, tissue density and pigment distribution. Moreover, leaf optical properties are rarely measured during phenological development with high time resolution. Typically, studies focus on peak growing season neglecting the dynamic seasonal change of optical properties for broadleaved vegetation of temperate forests.   In this study, we measured the seasonal course of leaf-level two-sided optical properties, biochemical and structural traits of five common broadleaved tree species of Central Europe (Betula pendula, Fagus sylvatica, Acer pseudoplatanus, Acer platanoides, and Sorbus aucuparia) with a typical dorsiventral, leaf anatomy without heliotropism. We link their leaf optical properties (e.g. reflectance difference of adaxial and abaxial sides, reflectance to transmittance ratio, fraction of specular component of leaf reflectance) with the laboratory analyses of inner leaf structure for contrasting leaf phenological stages from spring to fall. This allowed us to quantify both, species and seasonal differences of leaf dorsiventral optical properties and the role of inner leaf structure on leaf dorsiventral optical properties. Next, we up-scaled measured leaf-level dorsiventral optical properties to canopy level using Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer model (DART) for three contrasting seasonal phenological stages - early spring (day of the year; DOY 115), summer (DOY 212) and fall (DOY 285). The aim was to quantify the impact of leaf optical properties parametrization (i.e. assuming equal optical properties on both sides, or dorsiventral leaf optical properties asymmetry) for forest of different species composition, vegetation phenological stage and observation geometries. The biggest differences between simulations were observed in VIS and NIR regions, where the neglecting differences in abaxial side leaf reflectance may introduce relative difference up to 20%, causing the underestimation of \"one-sided\" scenario compared to \"two-sided\" one, especially for off-nadir backscattering viewing directions. This may lead to increase in uncertainty when interpreting remote sensing observations, namely the chlorophyll content retrievals from back-scattering observation geometries and canopy structural retrievals (e.g. leaf area index) for all viewing geometries. We, thus, suggest to account for leaf reflectance dorsiventral differences in the next generation of radiative transfer models.', '[Lukes, Petr; Janoutova, Ruzena] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Global Change Res Inst, Belidla 4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic.

The challenge is to then develop a simple and operational algorithm for accurate detection of cirrus clouds in Landsat 8 images.

Mapping the spatial distribution and cover of macrolichens with remote sensing can serve as an important approach for assessing the impact of disturbances (e.g. fire, grazing, trampling) on lichen cover at the landscape scale and for monitoring post-disturbance rates of recovery. Previous remote sensing-based efforts to retrieve the distribution and abundance of lichen have been restricted to particular regions and thus are not indicative of the potential for large extent mapping and monitoring. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of machine learning methods for retrieving lichen cover and change across different regions in northern Canada and Alaska using Landsat-5 images, topographic and climate data. Global and regional-scale models were evaluated to assess whether regionally specific analyses would improve performance. Of the models tested, the deep neural network was the most accurate for predicting lichen cover (model efficiency (ME) = 0.58, mean absolute error (MAE) < 7%). For the regional analysis, the performance was the best in north-central Canada (ME = 0.56, MAE = 8%) and the worst in north-eastern Canada (ME = 0.22, MAE < 4%) due to lower lichen cover, more exposed ground, and reduced sample quality and distribution. Analysis of trend-based change detection from 1984 to 2011 in the three regional test areas showed the expected directional response with declining lichen cover in north-western Canada in response to climate-induced shrub expansion, slow recovery to wildfire in north-central Canada, and declining lichen cover in north-eastern Canada related to caribou foraging/trampling and shrub expansion.', '[Kennedy, Blair; Pouliot, Darren; Manseau, Micheline; Duffe, Jason; Pasher, Jon] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Landscape Sci & Technol Div, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada.

During water-limited conditions, urban vegetation may be limited in its ability to provide ecosystem services, such as shading and evaporative cooling. While there has been extensive research on drought response in natural vegetation and agricultural systems using remote sensing, drought impacts on urban vegetation have remained understudied. With > 50% of people worldwide living in cities and the increased potential for future droughts, it is important to understand how urban vegetation will respond and to evaluate potential impacts. Here, we used repeat flights of NASA airborne imaging spectroscopy (AVIRIS and AVIRIS-NG) to quantify the responses of common urban tree species and turfgrass in downtown Santa Barbara, California, USA to the 2012-2016 California drought. The effects of the drought on vegetation were quantified using several spectral indicators: fractional cover from multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA), vegetation indices, and continuum removed absorption features. We used existing tree crown object polygons that were classified to species and had associated estimates of pre-drought leaf area index and biomass. We also included polygons of turfgrass parks and recreational fields. All tree species and turfgrass had four or more spectral indicators with significantly lower mean values (p < 0.05) during the drought in 2014, and evidence of recovery was observed for some species in 2017, which was after the drought had ended. In general, needleleaf and native trees were more affected than broadleaf and non-native trees, respectively, but with considerable interspecific variability. Based on the spectral indicators, turfgrass cover senesced in the middle of the drought but recovered soon after the drought ended, whereas the majority of tree species had not fully recovered. Mean green vegetation cover declined in most tree canopies during the drought, primarily exposing paved surfaces and/or non-photosynthetic vegetation, depending on the site type and tree patch size. Drought impacts as expressed in spectral indicators were generally more severe in tree patches with high pre-drought leaf area index, suggesting that denser, leafier canopies were more difficult for trees to maintain during the drought. Most spectral indicators were correlated with one another (R > 0.4), suggesting co-occuring adjustments of greenness, water content, and plant pigments.', '[Miller, David L.; Roberts, Dar A.; McFadden, Joseph P.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.

There are both physical and physiological controls of SIF measured at the surface and retrieved from remote sensing including satellite observations. In order to accurately use SIF for monitoring of plant physiology, the effects of physically-based radiation processes related to leaf and canopy structure, notably photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorption and SIF scattering and re-absorption, must be characterized. In this study, we investigate both PAR absorption and SIF scattering processes and find that although it is difficult to quantify their effects individually by using just reflectance, the combined effects of the two processes can be well approximated by a reflectance index. This index, referred to as FCVI (Fluorescence Correction Vegetation Index), is defined as the difference between near-infrared (NIR) and broad-band visible (VIS, 400-700 nm) reflectance acquired under identical sun-canopy-observer geometry of the SIF measurements. The development of the index was based on the physical connection between reflectance and far-red SIF, which was revealed by using the spectral invariant theory. The utility of FCVI to correct far-red SIF for PAR absorption and scattering effects, thus improving the link to photosynthesis, was tested with data from: (i) a field experiment for a growing season; and (ii) a numerical experiment which included a number of scenarios generated by a radiative transfer model. For both the observations and simulations, the FCVI provided a promising estimate of the impact of the physically-based radiation processes on far-red SIF of moderately dense canopies (i.e., FCVI >= 0.18). Normalizing the TOC far-red SIF by both the incident PAR (iPAR) and the FCVI provided a good estimate of the far-red fluorescence emission efficiency of the canopies examined. This approach enhances our ability to generalize retrievals for vegetation processes as they change through natural growth phases and seasons. Taken together, far-red SIF and FCVI may enable the assessment of the light partitioning of vegetation canopies, an essential step to facilitate the use of far-red SIF for tracking physiological processes.', '[Yang, Peiqi; van der Tol, Christiaan] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.

Although previous efforts have achieved inspiring results, hyperspectral image (HSI) destriping remains a challenging task, as the stripe degradations are sometimes more complicated than the predefined assumptions, i.e., the preselected reference, filter, or handcrafted priors. With the rapid advances in deep learning technologies, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide a new potential to learn essential priors in an automatic manner. However, the training of CNNs is highly reliant on a large high-quality standard dataset, which is difficult to acquire for hyperspectral spaceborne sensors. In this paper, an innovative approach termed the satellite-ground integrated destriping network (SGIDN) is proposed for HSIs. Rather than using self-training, a satellite-ground integrated strategy is proposed, for the first time, to mitigate the data dependency, so that a large set of striped-clean pairs is generated from the ground-based HSIs. Considering the varied stripes among different bands, a unique CNN architecture design, including the combination of 3D convolution and 2D convolution, residual learning, and supplementary gradient channels, is integrated to capture the intrinsic spectral-spatial features in the HSIs and the unidirectional property of stripe noise. Compared with the traditional methods, SGIDN can be flexibly extended to specific HSI destriping tasks, e.g., coexisting horizontal and vertical stripes, and generalizes well to different hyperspectral satellite sensors. Given the same study area (Shanghai, China), three HSIs acquired by the EO-1 Hyperion imaging spectrometer, the Chinese HJ-1A HSI sensor, and the wide-range hyperspectral imager onboard the Chinese SPARK spectral micro-nano satellite are adopted to assess the proposed SGIDN model. Both simulated and real-data experiments confirm that SGIDN can consistently outperform the benchmark methods, with a higher degree of efficiency. Moreover, the land-cover mapping results further demonstrate the necessity of destriping and the suitability of the destriped results for use in further applications.', '[Zhong, Yanfei; Li, Wenqing; Jin, Shuying; Zhang, Liangpei] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan, Peoples R China.

The increased information content of PolSAR provides more potential inputs for machine learning and classification applications; however, polarimetric parameters tend to be simply used as input variables and the optimum parameters to efficiently separate land classes and their physical meaning has received little attention. This research application proposes a Multitemporal Binary-Tree Classification framework (MBTC) to identify and integrate optimum scattering parameters and machine learning methods in a meaningful way. First, the optimum scattering mechanism that most effectively distinguishes pairs of land classes is derived by a Lagrange multiplier. Next, for each pair of classes, machine learning classifiers are trained by the optimum scattering power ratio and elevated by Out-Of-Bag (OOB) cross validation. Three machine learning algorithms- Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Neutral Network (NN)- are investigated. Finally, a multi-temporal binary-tree classifier is constructed, in which each pair of land classes are distinguished by the optimized machine learning algorithms. Two independent study sites in Canada are used for evaluating the MBTC framework using RADARSAT-2 observations. The London site with 6 classes is used to analyze the optimum scattering mechanisms and execute a simple classification. The Carman site with 10 classes allows for an indepdent and comprehensive assessment of the MBTC by comparing against an advanced Model-Based Decomposition (MBD). At the London site, the MBTC achieves the maximum power ratio with the optimum scattering mechanism between each pair of classes and high overall accuracy (OA) of 91% and kappa coefficient (Kappa) of 0.9. At the Carman site, comparisons indicate that MBTC significantly outperforms the MBD with NN and SVM classifiers but has a similar accuracy to the MBD for RF classifier with OA of 85% and Kappa of 0.82.

However, quantifying spatial patterns of key metrics, such as aboveground biomass, at landscape scales remains a challenge. This stems from difficulties in accurately estimating grassland biomass at fine scales over large areas and determining what spatial scale is most appropriate to monitor how grassland impacts (e.g., livestock grazing) affect spatial patterns of biomass (i.e., spatial heterogeneity). Here, we use lidar metrics (volume, max height, and intensity) in Random Forest models to quantify fine-resolution (pixel size 1.0668 m (3.5 ft)) aboveground biomass estimates (pseudo R-2 = 0.59; RMSD = 139.4 g m(-2)) across a bunchgrass prairie grassland system. To determine both the effects of grazing on the spatial heterogeneity of aboveground biomass and which pixel size is most sensitive to the effects of livestock grazing on grassland heterogeneity, we aggregated fine-resolution biomass maps to coarser pixel resolutions (3 m, 5 m, 8 m, 20 m, 30 m) across 23 pastures with varying levels of grazing intensity. Following aggregation to coarser pixel resolutions, we observed that semivariogram models produced statistically different (alpha = 0.05) measures of biomass heterogeneity. The range statistic was the only pasture-level semivariogram metric sensitive to grazing, and this relationship was only significant when using the finer-resolution datasets (similar to 1 m to 8 m pixels). Our results demonstrate 1) the applicability of lidar data for quantifying biomass in short-statured grasslands, 2) that grazing in pacific northwest bunchgrass prairie can decrease spatial heterogeneity of aboveground biomass and 3) that fine-resolution satellite data ( < 10 m pixel sizes) are necessary to effectively monitor the effects of grazing on the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation biomass, an indirect metric of biodiversity at management scales (pasture sizes ranged from 40 to 745 ha) in this grassland ecosystem.', '[Jansen, By V.

Images are collected one at the time with a given time-lag between observations. Under favorable conditions, spatio-temporal characteristics of propagating ocean surface waves can thus uniquely be retrieved. A method for surface current vector field reconstruction is then developed. Demonstrated over different deep ocean regions, the retrieved surface current fields well compare with medium-resolution ocean circulation model or derived-velocities from altimeter measurements. At finer scales, the surface wave-conservation law is recovered, with the associated relationship between current vorticity and wave-ray curvature. Over shallow water regions, the wave propagation properties well follow sea depth variations, consistent with ETOPO1 data. Finally, time-lag between detector bands can also be exploited to estimate speed and direction properties of detected surface wave breaking whitecaps. An analysis of velocity reconstruction errors further reveals that Sentinel-2 MSI inter-channel co-registration is realized with an accuracy better than 0.1 pixel.

Thaw depths are laborious point scale measurements that can be difficult to translate regionally. Since disturbances are present on the landscape across many temporal and spatial scales they can greatly affect the soil and vegetation regime. Furthermore, many areas are denied full assessment due to terrain complexity or limited accessibility. As such, a remotely sensed means for estimating surface thaw based on insular vegetation composition would be advantageous. A synoptic evaluation of this insulating layer could eventually benefit regional mapping of areas where vegetation cover helps regulate thaw depths during the local growing season. Herein, we present multi-year data collected from three terrain types in Interior Alaska that relates seasonal thaw depth to vegetative cover type. Field samples for spectral reflectance, vegetation, soil, elevation and seasonal thaw depths were obtained from surveyed 1 m(2) quadrats during the local growing season (late July, each summer from 2014 to 2017) across three lowland boreal landscapes. Statistical relationships between vegetation and samples were explored using CCA and showed vegetative cover distributions were highly correlated in two dimensions with the principal variables represented almost evenly by the soil variable pH and thaw depth. Class maps representing vegetation and associated thaw depth were derived from hyperspectral imagery using field and imagery training data. Map accuracy assessment, conducted using random points to establish truth data, yielded overall accuracies of > 85%. Regression analysis and root mean square error testing of the predictive capacity of the vegetation classes and thaw depth was variable but encouraging, ranging from 5 to 11 cm or between an 8 and 37% chance of error.

This paper provides a novel demonstration of the use of freely available Sentinel-2 data to estimate within-field wheat yield variability in a single year. The impact of data resolution and availability on yield estimation is explored using different combinations of input data. This was achieved by combining Sentinel-2 with environmental data (e.g. meteorological, topographical, soil moisture) for different periods throughout the growing season. Yield was estimated using Random Forest (RF) regression models. They were trained and validated using a dataset containing over 8000 points collected by combine harvester yield monitors from 39 wheat fields in the UK. The results demonstrate that it is possible to produce accurate maps of within-field yield variation at 10 m resolution using Sentinel-2 data (RMSE 0.66 t/ha). When combined with environmental data further improvements in accuracy can be obtained (RMSE 0.61 t/ha). We demonstrate that with knowledge of crop-type distribution it is possible to use these models, trained with data from a few fields, to estimate within-field yield variability on a landscape scale. Applying this method gives us a range of crop yield across the landscape of 4.09 to 12.22 t/ha, with a total crop production of approx. 289,000 t.', '[Hunt, Merryn L.; Rowland, Clare S.] Lancaster Environm Ctr, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Lib Ave, Lancaster LA1 4AP, England.

The approach has two major steps: deriving the total absorption coefficient of optically active constituents (OACs) and building the relationship between the total absorption coefficient and TSI. First, version 6.0 of the Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (QAA_V6, developed by Zhongping Lee) was implemented with Landsat 8 OLI data to derive the total absorption coefficients of the \'OACs. Second, we modeled TSI using the total absorption coefficients of OACs at 440 nm based on a large in situ measurement dataset. The total absorption coefficient of OACs at 440 nm gave satisfactory validation results for modeling TSI with a mean absolute percent error of 6% and a root-mean-square error of 5.77. Then, we performed this approach in three inland waters with various eutrophic statuses to validate its results, and the approach demonstrated a robust and satisfactory performance.

While land surface phenological changes in the Northern Hemisphere have been extensively studied from the widely used long-term AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) data, current knowledge on land surface phenological trends and the associated drivers remains uncertain for the tropics. This uncertainty is partly due to the well-known challenges of applying satellite-derived vegetation indices from the optical domain in areas prone to frequent cloud cover. The long-term vegetation optical depth (VOD) product from satellite passive microwaves features less sensitivity to atmospheric perturbations and measures different vegetation traits and functioning as compared to optical sensors. VOD thereby provides an independent and complementary data source for studying land surface phonology and here we performed a combined analysis of the VOD and AVHRR NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) datasets for the dry tropics (25 degrees N to 25 degrees S) during 1992-2012. We find a general delay in the VOD derived start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS) as compared to NDVI derived metrics, however with clear differences among land cover and continents. Pixels characterized by significant phenological trends (P < 0.05) account for up to 20% of the study area for each phenological metric of NDVI and VOD, with large spatial difference between the two sensor systems. About 50% of the pixels studied show significant phonological changes in either VOD or NDVI metrics. Drivers of phonological changes were assessed for pixels of high agreement between VOD and NDVI phenological metrics (serving as a means of reducing noise-related uncertainty). We find rainfall variability and woody vegetation change to be the main forcing variables of phenological trends for most of the dry tropical biomes, while fire events and land cover change are recognized as second-order drivers. Taken together, our study provides new insights on land surface phonological changes and the associated drivers in the dry tropics, as based on the complementary long-term data sources of VOD and NDVI, sensitive to changes in vegetation water content and greenness, respectively.', '[Tong, Xiaoye; Brandt, Martin; Zhang, Wenmin; Fensholt, Rasmus] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Copenhagen, Denmark.

Freezing and thawing of the active layer causes seasonal frost heave and thaw subsidence, while permafrost-related mass-wasting processes induce downslope ground displacements on valley sides. Displacement rate varies spatially and temporally depending on environmental factors. In our study, we apply Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) to investigate the magnitude, spatial distribution and timing of seasonal ground displacements in and around Adventdalen using TerraSAR-X StripMap Mode (2009-2017) and Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide Swath Mode (2015-2017) SAR images. First, we show that InSAR results from both sensors highlight consistent patterns and provide a comprehensive overview of the distribution of displacement rates. Secondly, two-dimensional (2D) TerraSAR-X InSAR results from combined ascending and descending geometries document the spatial variability of the vertical and east-west horizontal displacement rates for an average of nine thawing seasons. The remote sensing results are compared to a simplified geomorphological map enabling the identification of specific magnitudes and orientations of displacements for 14 selected geomorphological units. Finally, June to December 2017 6-day sampling interval Sentinel-1 time series was retrieved and compared to active layer ground temperatures from two boreholes. The timing of the subsidence and heave detected by InSAR matches the thawing and freeze-back periods measured by in-situ sensors.

Despite these pronounced consequences, the coupling of ecosystem functioning to extreme climate variability remains elusive due to the lack of complete understanding of hydrological connections. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal trends of Australia\'s hydrological and vegetation responses to three climate modes: El Nino-Southern Oscillation, the Indian Ocean dipole and the Southern Annular Mode, utilizing climate indices, satellite-derived total water storage anomaly (TWSA) from GRACE, precipitation from TRMM and vegetation greenness from MODIS. Using partial cross-correlation and vegetation sensitivity analyses to interpret the interactions among climate modes, water resources and vegetation across Australia, three hydroclimatic extreme events from 2002 to 2017 were analyzed: (i) a prolonged drought (2002-09, colloquially known as the \'big dry\'); (ii) a dramatic wet pulse (2010-11, the \'big wet\'); and (iii) another anomalous El Nino event (2015).   Our results showed the entire continent partitioned into three geographic zones with diverse drying and wetting trends in total water storage, precipitation and vegetation greenness, reflecting varying and fundamental influences from the individual climate modes. Ecosystem productivity was found to be better related and more sensitive to TWSA than precipitation across different hydroclimate zones and during both extreme dry and wet conditions. We also observed TWSA increased rapidly during wet extremes, and these gains in water resources persisted for an additional four years (i.e., TWSA remained positive until 2015 following the 2011 \'big wet\'). Lastly, findings from another hydroclimatic event (the 2015 El Nino drought) further confirmed the relationships among climate, water and ecosystems, demonstrating the feasibility of predicting ecohydrological implications of future hydroclimatic extremes in Australia.', '[Xie, Zunyi; Cao, Yanping; Qin, Fen] Henan Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Geospatial Technol Middle & Lower Yellow, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China.

Recently, most remote sensing studies on aerosol components detection are limited to the inversion of aerosol optical properties, integration of chemistry models or in situ observations. In this paper, an algorithm based on Effective Medium Approximations (EMA) and statistically optimized aerosol inversion algorithm was integrated for retrieving the surface mass concentration of BC aerosols from satellite signals. The sensitivity analyses for the developed forward model proved that the volume fraction of vertical BC is sensitive to the satellite observations and significantly improved especially over bright surface targets or under polluted atmospheric conditions. By updating the forward model and retrieved parameters of the statistically optimized inversion algorithm, three cases of high aerosol loading days were retrieved from Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectance for Atmospheric Sciences Coupled with Observations from a LiDAR (PARASOL) measurements, which shows a significant ability of BC aerosol detection. Additionally, the validation and closure studies of BC concentration retrievals also indicates an encouraging consistency with correlation (R) of 0.71, mean bias of 3.55, and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.75 when compared against the in-situ observations over South Asia. The accuracy of the retrievals also demonstrates different trends under different levels of aerosol loadings, which shows a higher accuracy in biomass burning seasons (R = 0.75, RMSE = 4.04, Bias = 3.27) while exaggerates the results in the case of clear conditions (R = 0.47, RMSE = 4.83, Bias = 4.00). Finally, the uncertainties of three assumptions, including proposing uniform vertical profile for BC, neglecting light-absorbing aerosols and using spherical EMA models were discussed in our manuscript. The maximum standard deviations caused by these uncertainties on low BC aerosol volume fractions (f(BC) < 1%) are 0.8%, 0.35% and 0.2% while these deviations will change to 0.25%, 0.05% and 1.5% respectively under higher BC fractions (f(BC) > 5%). This conclusion confirmed that the proposed algorithm for BC surface concentration retrieval extends the application of satellite remote sensing in monitoring the extreme biomass burning pollution.', '[Bao, Fangwen; Li, Ying; Gao, Jinhui] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ocean Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.

This paper presents a new downscaling approach, the Downscaling basEd oN gradient boosting deciSion trEe (DENSE) method to solve this problem. We analyzed 26 soil moisture related indices, derived from MODIS and a digital elevation model, to identify proxy variables for soil moisture variability. A gradient boosting decision tree regression links the aggregated soil moisture proxies and SMAP observations at a coarse scale to express the nonlinear relationships between them. High-resolution soil moisture products were generated by applying this built regression model to the optimal soil moisture proxies at a fine scale over the entire Tibetan Plateau during the years 2015-2017. In situ measurements were collected from the Ngari, Naqu, and Maqu networks, which represent different climatic and vegetation conditions. We evaluated the downscaled soil moisture against ground observations at the daily, point, and network scales. The results indicated that the DENSE method effectively infers the spatio-temporal variability of soil moisture; and at the same time, preserves SMAP soil moisture accuracy. The performance of the proposed method failed in the Maqu network as this area is covered by dense vegetation. Although further improvements are still needed to correct vegetation effects, nevertheless, the DENSE method improved the spatial resolution of SMAP soil moisture estimates, from 36 km to 1 km over the Tibetan plateau where high-resolution soil moisture products are necessary to support local and global hydrological applications.', '[Wei, Zushuai; Meng, Yizhuo; Zhang, Wen; Meng, Lingkui] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.

Monitoring SM at regional scale has become possible thanks to microwave remote sensing. In the past two decades, several satellites were launched carrying on board either radiometer (passive) or radar (active) or both sensors in different frequency bands with various spatial and temporal resolutions. Soil moisture algorithms are in rapid development and their improvements/revisions are ongoing. The latest SM retrieval products and versions of products that have been recently released are not yet, to our knowledge, comprehensively evaluated and inter-compared over different ecoregions and climate conditions. The aim of this paper is to comprehensively evaluate the most recent microwave-based SM retrieval products available from NASA\'s (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) satellite, ESA\'s led mission (European Space Agency) SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) satellite, ASCAT (Advanced Scatterometer) sensor on board the meteorological operational (Metop) platforms Metop-A and Metop-B, and the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) blended long-term SM time series. More specifically, in this study we compared SMAPL3 V4, SMOSL3 V300, SMOSL2 V650, ASCAT H111, and CCI V04.2 and the new SMOS-IC (V105) SM product. This evaluation was achieved using four statistical scores: Pearson correlation (considering both original observations and anomalies), RMSE, unbiased RMSE, and Bias between remotely-sensed SM retrievals and ground-based measurements from > 1000 stations from 17 monitoring networks, spread over the globe, disseminated through the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN). The analysis reveals that the performance of the remotely-sensed SM retrievals generally varies depending on ecoregions, land cover types, climate conditions, and between the monitoring networks. It also reveals that temporal sampling of the data, the frequency of data in time and the spatial coverage, affect the performance metrics. Overall, the performance of SMAP and SMOS-IC products compared slightly better with respect to the ISMN in situ observations than the other remotely-sensed products.', '[Al-Yaari, A.; Wigneron, J. -P.; Fan, L.] INRA, UMR1391, ISPA, Villenave Dornon, France.

For visible remote sensing sensors, clouds affect the quantity and quality of the observations, directly by hiding part of the scene and indirectly by their shadows. A certain level of confusion could occur for detection of clouds over turbid (i.e. bright) waters and for detection of their shadows over any kind of surface water. Some algorithms exist but their performance is not satisfactory, especially over turbid waters where cloud-free pixels are sometimes classified as cloud or land, leading to a loss of data. This is particularly important for medium spatial resolution observations such as those performed by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor on Landsat-8 or the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) on Sentinel-2 (a and b). In the frame of this study, we developed a two-step algorithm for the extraction of water pixels (referred to as WiPE) for these medium spatial resolution sensors. In contrast to other approaches based on the top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, this algorithm uses the Rayleigh-corrected TOA reflectance (rho(rc)(lambda)) as input parameter allowing the spectral signature of each object to be better characterized. The first step, based on the rho(rc)(lambda) spectral shape analysis of each object, allows water pixels to be discriminated from cloud, vegetation, barren land, and constructions pixels. The second step, in which the rho(rc)(lambda) spectra are transferred into the Hue-Saturation-Value space, greatly improves the detection of cloud shadow over waters. This second step, based on the processing of the whole image, does not require any knowledge on the location and altitude of clouds. Thin clouds are identified during the two steps of the algorithm. This algorithm has been successfully tested over a broad range of environments. WiPE, specifically designed for the extraction of water pixels, generally shows better performance over turbid waters than the standard algorithm developed for Landsat imagery (Fmask). This is explained by the fact that Fmask does not specifically focus on the detection of water pixels, but on the masking of cloud, cloud shadow, and snow over land and water.', '[Dat Dinh Ngoc; Chung Doan Minh] VAST, Space Technol Inst, 18 Hoang Quoc Viet, Hanoi, Vietnam.

However, despite water and carbon cycle coupling, there are few diagnostic global evapotranspiration models that have complete carbon constraint on water flux run at a high spatial resolution. Here we estimate 8-day global ET and gross primary production (GPP) at 500 m resolution from July 2002 to December 2017 using a coupled diagnostic biophysical model (called PML-V2) that, built using Google Earth Engine, takes MODIS data (leaf area index, albedo, and emissivity) together with GLDAS meteorological forcing data as model inputs. PML-V2 is well calibrated against 8-day measurements at 95 widely-distributed flux towers for 10 plant functional types, indicated by Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Bias being 0.69 min d(-1) and -1.8% for ET respectively, and being 1.99 g C m(-2) d(-1) and 4.2% for GPP. Compared to that performance, the cross-validation results are slightly degraded, with RMSE and Bias being 0.73 mm d(-1) and -3% for ET, and 2.13 g C m(-2) d(-1) and 3.3% for GPP, which indicates robust model performance. The PML-V2 products are noticeably better than most GPP and ET products that have a similar spatial resolution, and suitable for assessing the influence of carbon-induced impacts on ET. Our estimates show that global ET and GPP both significantly (p < 0.05) increased over the past 15 years. Our results demonstrate it is very promising to use the coupled PML-V2 model to improve estimates of GPP, ET and water use efficiency, and its uncertainty can be further reduced by improving model inputs, model structure and parameterisation schemes.', '[Zhang, Yongqiang; Kong, Dongdong; Gan, Rong; Chiew, Francis H.

The Finite-Scale Lyapunov Exponents provide a rigorous, quantitative tool to evaluate Lagrangian simulations with respect to real drifter trajectories. An accuracy threshold scale can be identified as the scale above which the error size, propagating along a numerical trajectory, grows no faster than the relative separation between real drifters. Below this threshold, the error growth rate tends to diverge linearly as the error decreases. The mean error growth speed, at early stage, is found to be related to the kinetic energy of the missing scales of motion, not resolved by the GlobCurrent products.

With marked regional variations, we observe that seasonality dominates variability representing up to 80% of total Chl variance in oceanic areas, whereas in shelf-sea regions high frequency variations may be dominant representing up to 49% of total Chl variance. Seasonal variations are typically characterized by a phytoplankton growing period occurring in spring and spanning on average 170 days in the western basin and 150 days in the eastern basin. The variations in peak Chl concentrations are higher in the western basin (0.88 +/- 1.01 mg m(-3)) compared to the eastern basin (0.35 +/- 1.36 mg m(-3)). Differences in the seasonal cycle of Chl are also observed between open ocean and coastal waters where more than one phytoplankton growing period are frequent (> 0.8 probability). During the study period, on average in the western Mediterranean basin (based on significant trends observed over similar to 95% of the basin), we show a positive trend in Chl of +0.015 +/- 0.016 mg m(-3) decade(-1), and an increase in the amplitude and duration of the phytoplankton growing period by +0.27 +/- 0.29 mg m(-3) decade(-1) and +11 +/- 7 days decade(-1) respectively. Changes in Chl concentration in the eastern (and more oligotrophic) basin are generally low, with a trend of -0.004 +/- 0.024 mg m(-3) decade(-1) on average (based on observed significant trends over similar to 70% of the basin). In this basin, the Chl peak has declined by -0.03 +/- 0.08 mg m(-3) decade(-1) and the growing period duration has decreased by -12 +/- 7 days decade(-1). The trends in phytoplankton Chl and phenology, estimated in this study over the period 1998-2014, do not reveal significant overall decline/increase in Chl concentration or earlier/delayed timings of the seasonal peak on average over the entire Mediterranean Sea basin.

In this paper, we presented a new approach to develop spatially and temporally consistent global urban maps from 1992 to 2013, using the DMSP/OLS NTL observations. First, potential urban clusters were delineated using the NTL data and a segmentation method. Then, a quantile-based approach was used to remove rural and suburban areas sequentially in the potential urban clusters. Finally, the derived series of urban extents in the entire study period (1992-2013) were improved for temporal consistency. We found the percentage of global urban areas relative to the world\'s land surface area increased from 0.23% in 1992 to 0.53% in 2013. Asia is the continent with the most significant urban growth, worldwide. The time series of global urban maps were evaluated for the spatial agreement and temporal consistency using a variety of widely used independent land-cover products. This evaluation indicates that the proposed approach is robust and performs well in deriving global urban dynamics across different spatial scales, i.e., cluster, province (or state), country, and region. Moreover, this quantile-based approach is advantageous, compared with other methods used in previous studies, because it does not require additional data for enhancement or calibration. The new time series of urban maps from this study offer a new dataset for studying global urbanization during the past decades and unique information to explore potential future trajectories of urban development, which appears to be distinct for different nations/regions, globally.

In particular, we present global maps at 500 m resolution of specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus content per dry mass, and leaf nitrogen/phosphorus ratio. The processing chain exploits machine learning techniques along with optical remote sensing data (MODIS/Landsat) and climate data for gap filling and up-scaling of in-situ measured leaf traits. The chain first uses random forests regression with surrogates to fill gaps in the database (> 45% of missing entries) and maximizes the global representativeness of the trait dataset. Plant species are then aggregated to Plant Functional Types (PFTs). Next, the spatial abundance of PFTs at MODIS resolution (500 m) is calculated using Landsat data (30 m). Based on these PFT abundances, representative trait values are calculated for MODIS pixels with nearby trait data. Finally, different regression algorithms are applied to globally predict trait estimates from these MODIS pixels using remote sensing and climate data. The methods were compared in terms of precision, robustness and efficiency. The best model (random forests regression) shows good precision (normalized RMSE <= 20%) and goodness of fit (averaged Pearson\'s correlation R = 0.78) in any considered trait. Along with the estimated global maps of leaf traits, we provide associated uncertainty estimates derived from the regression models. The process chain is modular, and can easily accommodate new traits, data streams (traits databases and remote sensing data), and methods. The machine learning techniques applied allow attribution of information gain to data input and thus provide the opportunity to understand trait-environment relationships at the plant and ecosystem scales. The new data products the gap-filled trait matrix, a global map of PFT abundance per MODIS gridcells and the high-resolution global leaf trait maps are complementary to existing large-scale observations of the land surface and we therefore anticipate substantial contributions to advances in quantifying, understanding and prediction of the Earth system.', '[Moreno-Martinez, Alvaro; Robinson, Nathaniel; Allred, Brady; Running, Steve W.] Univ Montana, NTSG, Coll Forestry & Conservat, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.

As this is directly linked to the electron transport chain in oxygenic photosynthesis, SIF is a powerful proxy for photosynthetic activity. SIF observations are relatively new and, while global scale measurements from satellites using high-resolution spectroscopy of Fraunhofer bands are becoming more available, observations at the intermediate canopy scale using these techniques are sparse.   We present a novel ground-based spectrometer system - PhotoSpec - for measuring SIF in the red (670-732 nm) and far-red (729-784 nm) wavelength range as well as canopy reflectance (400-900 nm) to calculate vegetation indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and the photochemical reflectance index (PRI). PhotoSpec includes a 2D scanning telescope unit which can be pointed to any location in a canopy with a narrow field of view (FOV = 0.7 degrees) PhotoSpec has a high signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution, which allows high precision solar Fraunhofer line retrievals over the entire fluorescence wavelength range under all atmospheric conditions using a new two-step linearized least-squares retrieval procedure.   Initial PhotoSpec observations include the diurnal SIF cycle of single broad leaves, grass, and dark-light transitions. Results from the first tower-based measurements in Costa Rica show that the instrument can continuously monitor SIF of several tropical species throughout the day. The PhotoSpec instrument can be used to explore the relationship between SIF, photosynthetic efficiencies, Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), and the impact of canopy radiative transfer, viewing geometry, and stress conditions at the canopy scale.', '[Grossmann, Katja; Hurlock, Stephen C.; Seibt, Ulrike; Stutz, Jochen] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.

However, understanding relationships between faunal diversity and measurable ecosystem quantities, such as heterogeneity and productivity, across continental scales can be complicated by disparate methods. We developed standardized approaches using lidar data and spectral greenness data (via NOVI; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) from 637 sampling plots across four sites in North America, Europe, and Asia to test the local effects of habitat heterogeneity and productivity on taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of breeding bird assemblages using boosted generalized additive models. Our results revealed the 3-D (three dimensional) vegetation structure (horizontal and vertical) to be of similar importance as NDVI in multiple biodiversity measures, and the importance of 3-D structure was higher for functional and phylogenetic biodiversity measures than for taxonomic measures. We found congruent responses between functional and phylogenetic diversity; however, patterns of taxonomic diversity differed from those of functional/phylogenetic diversity for most predictors. For example, NDVI had positive relationships with taxonomic diversity, but negative relationships with functional/ phylogenetic diversity. The effect of canopy density on taxonomic diversity was generally bell-shaped, whereas the relationship was U-shaped for functional and phylogenetic diversity. As a result, this study supports a silviculture strategy with a high variety of canopy densities and vertical variabilities across forest stands to create maximum benefits for regional biodiversity. Here, early succession stands and closed stands sustain functionally-rich bird assemblages, while stands with a medium canopy density promote species-rich assemblages.', '[Bae, Soyeon; Mueller, Joerg; Thorn, Simon] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, Bioctr, Field Stn Fabrikschleichach, Glashuettenstr 5, D-96181 Rauhenebrach, Germany.

Although the width of the river channels of the Lower Brahmaputra River (LBR) is similar to 1 km, the Upper Brahmaputra River (UBR) (which is part of the Yarlung Zangbo River of China) and the Middle Brahmaputra River (MBR) located in high-mountain regions have river widths that are generally less than 400 m. This poses considerable challenges for existing retracking algorithms to obtain accurately retrieved water levels. In this study, an improved approach for deriving water levels in high-mountain regions with complex terrain is proposed, comprising (1) an improved footprint selection and (2) an improved waveform retracking, called the 50% Threshold and Ice-1 Combined algorithm (TIC). It was applied to river channels of varying widths, ranging from 200 m in the UBR to more than 1 km in the LBR. Results show an increase in both the accuracy and sampling of water levels. Most of the derived water levels at 13 virtual stations (VSs) along the GBR agree reasonably well with gauged water levels (for VSs in the UBR) or published results (for VSs in the LBR). The standard deviation of the difference between the TIC-derived water levels and gauged data at the VSs ranges from 0.3 m to 0.8 m with the highest improvement percentage relative to the unretracked ranges reaching 80% in the UBR. In addition, the developed approach increases water level sampling by reasonably demarcating the buffer zone for footprint selection, thereby generating more water levels in the time series than the published results for VSs in the LBR. However, 3 out of the 13 virtual stations show poor performance for Envisat, primarily due to the extremely narrow river channels. Furthermore, TIC can potentially be applied to estimate water levels near ground tracks of altimetric missions, even where there is no crossover between the river and the track. It could also be applied to other altimetric missions, which would further contribute to monitoring water levels and potentially river discharge in high-mountain regions with narrow river channels.', '[Huang, Qi; Long, Di; Du, Mingda; Zeng, Chao; Li, Xingdong; Hong, Yang] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.

Considering the earthquake that hit L\'Aquila city (Italy) on April 6, 2009, this work assess the feasibility of producing damage maps at the scale of single building from Very High Resolution (VHR) optical images collected before and after the seismic event. We considered the European Macroseismic Scale 1998 (EMS-98) and assessed the possibility to discriminate between collapsed or heavy damaged buildings (damage grade DG equal to 5 in the EMS-98 scale) and less damaged or undamaged buildings (DG < 5 in the EMS-98).   The proposed approach relies on a pre-existing urban map to identify image objects corresponding to building footprints. The image analysis is carried out according to many different parameters with the objective of assessing their effectiveness in singling out changes associated to the building collapse.

The accuracy of these maps is often the primary piece of information used to make decisions about the mapping process or judge the quality of the final map. Variance is critical information when considering map accuracy, yet commonly reported accuracy metrics often do not provide that information. Various resampling frameworks have been proposed and shown to reconcile this issue, but have had limited uptake. In this paper, we compare the traditional approach of a single split of data into a training set (for classification) and test set (for accuracy assessment), to a resampling framework where the classification and accuracy assessment are repeated many times. Using a relatively simple vegetation mapping example and two common classifiers (maximum likelihood and random forest), we compare variance in mapped area estimates and accuracy assessment metrics (overall accuracy, kappa, user, producer, entropy, purity, quantity/allocation disagreement). Input field data points were repeatedly split into training and test sets via bootstrapping, Monte Carlo cross-validation (67:33 and 80:20 split ratios) and k-fold (5-fold) cross-validation. Additionally, within the cross-validation, we tested four designs: simple random, block hold-out, stratification by class, and stratification by both class and space. A classification was performed for every split of every methodological combination (100\'s iterations each), creating sampling distributions for the mapped area of each class and the accuracy metrics. We found that regardless of resampling design, a single split of data into training and test sets results in a large variance in estimates of accuracy and mapped area. In the worst case, overall accuracy varied between similar to 40-80% in one resampling design, due only to random variation in partitioning into training and test sets. On the other hand, we found that all resampling procedures provided accurate estimates of error, and that they can also provide confidence intervals that are informative about the performance and uncertainty of the classifier. Importantly, we show that these confidence intervals commonly encompassed the magnitudes of increase or decrease in accuracy that are often cited in literature as justification for methodological or sampling design choices. We also show how a resampling approach enables generation of spatially continuous maps of classification uncertainty. Based on our results, we make recommendations about which resampling design to use and how it could be implemented. We also provide a fully worked mapping example, which includes traditional inference of uncertainty from the error matrix and provides examples for presenting the final map and its accuracy.', '[Lyons, Mitchell B.; Keith, David A.; Mason, Tanya J.] UNSW Australia, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.

Previous attempts to correct SRTM elevations have used regression to predict vertical error from a small number of auxiliary data products, but these efforts have been focused on reducing error introduced solely by vegetative land cover. Here, we employ a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network to perform a 23-dimensional vertical error regression analyses, where in addition to vegetation cover indices, we use variables including neighborhood elevation values, population density, land slope, and local SRTM deviations from ICESat altitude observations. Using lidar data as ground truth, we train the neural network on samples of US data from 1-20 m of elevation according to SRTM, and assess outputs with extensive testing sets in the US and Australia. Our adjustment system reduces mean vertical bias in the coastal US from 3.67 m to less than 0.01 m, and in Australia from 2.49 m to 0.11 m. RMSE is cut by roughly one-half at both locations, from 5.36 m to 2.39 m in the US, and from 4.15 m to 2.46 in Australia. Using ICESat data as a reference, we estimate that global bias falls from 1.88 m to -0.29 m, and RMSE from 4.28 m and 3.08 m.

While recent advances have improved such retrievals, most methods have high uncertainties for very shallow (< 5 m) or very bright (e.g., carbonate sand) targets. Here, we present a two-stage process to improve IOP derivations from satellite-derived reflectance data, termed the Shallow Water Optimization with Resolved Depth (SWORD). Within this process, a raster bathymetry is first derived through multiple pixel-wise implementations of a spectral matching algorithm on mapped reflectance data. This bathymetry is then used as a fixed input in subsequent implementations of the algorithm, leading to improved IOP retrievals. The SWORD approach was developed and tested using a dataset of simulated reflectance spectra as well as MERIS reflectance data covering two optically shallow water environments. Bathymetries derived using this process showed strong agreement with those determined from soundings and coastal relief models. Although SWORD-derived raster albedo maps showed general concordance to benthic habitat surveys, we found limited benefit of fixing this parameter in spectral matching routines. IOP derivations from SWORD show expected spatiotemporal patterns in the Florida Keys region, consistent with local hydrodynamic processes, seasonal fluctuations, and known anomalous events. This approach is portable to multi spectral reflectance data from similar satellite instruments, allowing regular and ongoing assessment and monitoring of optical water quality for ecologically and economically important marine systems.', '[Barnes, Brian B.; Hu, Chuanmin] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.

In this paper, a new SSA retrieval algorithm based on a recently developed snow reflectance model is presented. In the reflectance model, the microstructure of snow medium is simulated by computer and the light scattering process is modeled by Monte Carlo ray tracing and radiative transfer theory. Validation shows the model can accurately simulate snow surface reflectance even at large incident or observation zenith angles. Three datasets were used to validate the SSA retrieval algorithm. The validation results show that the SSA can be accurately estimated using MODIS data. The difference of SSA by using reflectance of different wavelengths are studied by MODIS band 5 and band 6 data.

The OC-CCI project uses an optical classification scheme based on fuzzy logic (Moore et al. 2001), to assign product uncertainties on a pixel-by-pixel basis. In this study we show that the pre-existing set of optical water classes derived from in-water remote-sensing reflectance data are insufficient to classify all R-rs spectra present in satellite data at the global scale, particularly in oligotrophic regions. We generate a new set of optical water classes from millions of satellite-derived ocean-colour spectra, providing an improvement in distribution of cumulative class membership values. The use of these classes for uncertainty assignment are demonstrated for chlorophyll-a, utilising a large in situ database of measurements. In addition to being used for uncertainty assignment, performance of multiple chlorophyll algorithms is assessed within each of the classes and a method for blending algorithms while avoiding sharp boundaries, in order to improve final product quality, using class membership is illustrated.

Hence, understanding the spatial distribution and temporal variation of snow is crucial for proper management of limited water resources in this region. Since the in-situ measurements in the area are not sufficient, we used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products, for which their capabilities in providing a spatially distributed and accurate mapping of snow have been well demonstrated. In this analysis, we considered all the available MODIS acquisitions from both Aqua and Terra satellites for a total of 4873 daily tiles of MOD10A1 and MYD10A1 with 500-meters spatial resolution (version 5), collected during the winter seasons between years 2002 and 2015. The problem of cloud coverage, with serious constraints to the snow mapping in the area, is addressed by developing a sequential cloud removal algorithm, which applies different methods subsequently considering their performance in each month. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is able to reduce 94% of cloud coverage and preserve the accuracy of cloud-removed area by 93%. In addition, a clear decreasing trend in snow cover is observed in the region. For example, trend analysis (at 10% significance level) shows that 61% of areas between 2000 and 2300 m elevation levels experienced a reduction in duration of annual snow cover. Moreover, a general reduction in the duration of snow season is also evident over the entire study area. In spite of short duration (13 years) used in this research, outcomes indicate a severe snow cover reduction during recent years. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Monitoring the stability of tailings facility is therefore indispensable for sustainable mining development. Particularly, tailings experience gradual consolidation settlement as the pore pressure dissipates and the terrain subsides. However, field investigations and geotechnical analysis at tailings impoundment are limited by sparse field instrumentation due to high cost. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) can provide a full spatial view of settlement rate at millimeter-scale precision with bi-weekly or monthly updates. Here we integrate big remotely sensed data including multi-temporal and multi-spaceborne SAR images of ENVISAT, ALOS PALSAR-1, and Sentinel-1A, and SRTM DEM and LIDAR DEM, as well as water level data, to investigate the dynamics of consolidation settlement over the tailings impoundment area in the vicinity of Great Salt Lake, Utah. We show that the reclaimed south pond is experiencing enormous quasi-linear settlements with the largest rate of 200 + mm/yr around the low-permeable decant pond clay at the northeast corner during 2004-2011, and the rate decreases to 100 + mm/yr during 2015-2016. The nearly decadal InSAR measurements can be well-explained by geotechnical consolidation model, which reveals the long-term exponentially decaying settlement and predicts the settlement process in the near future. InSAR-derived displacement maps also highlight active motions of surrounding infrastructures, such as some highway segments. There is no clear evidence that the fluctuating deformation at those locations and seasonal varied water level are correlated. Our results demonstrate that high resolution surface displacement measurements from InSAR can significantly improve our understanding of tailings settlement process and facilitate the monitoring of dams/infrastructures stability.

Key carbonate producers including hard coral, crustose coralline algae, foraminiferal sand and Halimeda were mapped from satellite imagery (spatial resolution 2.5 m, mean overall accuracy = 81%) and an upscaling model was applied to estimate carbonate production. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the influence of employing different calcification rates for live coral on the upscaling model. Contemporary coral reef carbonate production for the 21 reef platforms of the Capricorn-Bunker Group (southern Great Barrier Reef) is estimated to be between 489,000 and 659,000 t per year based on seawater chemistry, community composition, calcification rates and reef structural complexity (rugosity). The upscaling model was relatively insensitive to different parameterisations of live coral calcification employed, probably due to live coral being a relatively minor contributor by area (approximately 18% of total reef area throughout the study region). This suggests regional scale seafloor characteristics, such as percentage of area dominated by substrates prone to dissolution (e.g. coral rubble), have a strong bearing on calcium carbonate production and need to be given greater consideration The upscaling framework presented provides a new method for quantifying regional carbonate production that could be applied globally, and provides a valuable baseline against which future changes to carbonate production in this region can be assessed.', '[Hamylton, Sarah M.; Carvalho, Rafael C.] Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.

This paper applies the Bayesian non-linear modeling concept to process small-footprint FW LiDAR data (the Bayesian decomposition) collected at a study site of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) to investigate its potential for waveform decomposition and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, several possible models suitable for fitting waveforms were assessed within the Bayesian framework, and the Gaussian model was selected to perform the Bayesian decomposition. Subsequently, we conducted performance evaluation and uncertainty analysis at the parameter, derived point cloud and surface model levels. Results of the model reasonableness show that the Gaussian model is superior to alternative models with respect to uncertainty, physical meaning and processing efficiency. After converting waveforms to discrete points, the model comparisons demonstrate that the Bayesian decomposition can be utilized for FW LiDAR data processing, and its results are comparable to the direct decomposition (DD), Gold and RL (Richardson-Lucy) approaches in terms of the root mean squared error (RMSE < 0.93 m) of the point distances between the waveform-based point cloud and the reference point cloud. Additionally, more points can be extracted from FW LiDAR data with these methods than discrete-return LiDAR data, especially at the mid-story of vegetation based on the results of height bins, percentile heights and canopy LiDAR density at the individual tree level. Moreover, uncertainty estimates from the Bayesian method enhance the credibility of decomposition results in a probabilistic sense to capture the true error of estimates and trace the uncertainty propagation along the processing steps. For example, results of the surface model yield larger RMSE values (1.38 m vs. 0.65 m) with a wider credible interval than quantile point clouds with a more compact distribution. In contrast to commonly used deterministic approaches, the Bayesian decomposition method can produce an ensemble of reasonable parameter estimates with probability through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from the posterior distribution of model parameters. These parameter estimates and corresponding derived products can be queried to provide meaningful interpretation of results and associated uncertainty. Both the flat priors and empirical priors can achieve good performance of the decomposition while the empirical priors tend to significantly speed up the model convergence. The Bayesian approach also renders an important insight into the uncertainty of the model performance evaluation using field data by generating reasonable prediction intervals to reduce inherent errors of field measurements.', '[Zhou, Tan; Popescu, Sorin C.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, LiDAR Applicat Study Ecosyst Remote Sensing LASER, College Stn, TX 77450 USA.', 'Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College StationRP Zhou, T (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, LiDAR Applicat Study Ecosyst Remote Sensing LASER, College Stn, TX 77450 USA.', 'tankwin0@tamu.eduRI Popescu, Sorin C/D-5981-2015; Zhou, Tan/U-3953-2019', 'Popescu, Sorin C/0000-0002-8155-8801; Zhou, Tan/0000-0002-9193-5113', 'NASA\'s ICESat-2 SDT [NNX15AD02G]; RAPID Response [NNX14AN99G]; NSF [DEB   1702008]', 'The authors gratefully acknowledge the support provided by NASA\'s   ICESat-2 SDT (Grant # NNX15AD02G) and RAPID Response (Grant #   NNX14AN99G), NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DEB 1702008),   and Texas A & M Institute for Genome Sciences and Society (TIGSS) for   providing computational resources and systems administration support for   the TIGSS HPC Cluster.

However, the lOPs of turbid coastal waters may independently vary with pigmented particles, suspended inorganic particles, and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). In turbid coastal waters standard AC algorithms often exhibit large inaccuracies that may lead to negative water-leaving radiances (L-w) or remote sensing reflectance (R-rs). We introduce a new atmospheric correction algorithm for coastal waters based on a multilayer neural network (MLNN) method. We use a coupled atmosphere-ocean radiative transfer model to simulate the Rayleigh-corrected radiance (L-rc) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and the R-rs just above the surface simultaneously, and train a MLNN to derive the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and R-rs directly from the TOA L-rc. The method is validated using both a synthetic dataset and Aerosol Robotic Network - Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) measurements. The SeaDAS NIR algorithm, the SeaDAS NIR/SWIR algorithm, and the MODIS version of the Case 2 regional water - CoastColour (C2RCC) algorithm are also included in the comparison with AERONET-OC measurements. The performance of the AC algorithms is evaluated with four statistical metrics: the Pearson correlation coefficient (R), the average percentage difference (APD), the mean percentage bias, and the root mean square difference (RMSD). The comparison with AERONET-OC measurements shows that the MLNN algorithm significantly improves retrieval of normalized L-w in blue bands (412 nm and 443 nm) and yields minor improvements in green and red bands compared with the other three algorithms. On a global scale, the MLNN algorithm reduces APD in normalized L-w by up to 13% in blue bands and by 2-7% in green and red bands when compared with the standard SeaDAS NIR algorithm. In highly absorbing coastal waters, such as the Baltic Sea, the MLNN algorithm reduces APD in normalized Lw by more than 60% in blue bands compared to the standard SeaDAS NIR algorithm, while in highly scattering coastal waters, such as the Black Sea, the MLNN algorithm reduces APD by more than 25%. These results indicate that the MLNN algorithm is suitable for application in turbid coastal waters. Application of the MLNN algorithm to MODIS Aqua images in several coastal areas also shows that it is robust and resilient to contamination due to sunglint or adjacency effects of land and cloud edges. The MLNN algorithm is very fast once the neural network has been properly trained and is therefore suitable for operational use. A significant advantage of the MLNN algorithm is that it does not need SWIR bands. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In certain environments, litter comprises a considerable portion of the canopy, impeding the quantification of living biomass. Decomposition incurs physical changes and the genesis of decay pigments over time, causing the optical properties of litter to evolve in tandem. In order to simulate the spectral evolution of decaying leaves and relate the spectra to meaningful quantities of the biochemical compounds present, knowledge of the in-situ absorption properties of decay pigments is required. To determine the specific absorption coefficients of decay pigments in monocot leaf litter, we developed a spectral data set of multiple species at various decay stages concurrent with quantities of foliar compounds from fiber and humic acid analysis. Utilizing leaf humic acid content, the specific absorption coefficients for initial and advanced decay pigments were estimated using the PROSPECT model. For a 70-sample evaluation data set, simulated litter spectra closely matched the Reflectance, Transmittance, and Absorptance of measured leaves, with an average %RMSE (400-2500 nm range) of 4.95. Inversion of the expanded PROSPECT model had a moderate relationship between measured gravimetric humic acid content and the model inverted sum of initial and advanced decay pigments, as indicated by the R-2 = 0.62 and index of agreement = 0.72 goodness of fit statistics. Integrating the specific absorption coefficients of decay pigments into the PROSAIL model permitted the canopy reflectance of grassland scenes of intertwined photosynthetic leaves and litter to be simulated. Model inversion results aligned well with changes in canopy chlorophyll and biomass, cumulating in an R2 = 0.69 between measured and predicted leaf area index. Sensitivity analysis further revealed that canopy level reflectance in the near infrared region for mixed green vegetation and litter scenes are driven mainly by advanced decay pigments. Hence, the inclusion of decay pigments\' specific absorption coefficients are of high importance for accurate simulation of mixed vegetation scenes. Further, the derived specific absorption coefficients can be utilized to quantify humic acid content in monocotyledon leaves as a proxy for decay stage and the carbon quality of litter.

Previous studies aimed at distinguishing tree species based on three dimensional tree structure metrics derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) point clouds or based on features from full-waveform (FW) laser scanning data provided by today\'s sensors. Classifications based on FW features mainly use echo amplitude, pulse energy (hereafter referred to as energy) and width, which are typically retrieved by waveform decomposition, often performed using the symmetric Gaussian distribution function.   However, for forested areas, the symmetry of the echo shape is potentially modified by multiple scattering and the distribution of scattering elements (e.g. leaves). We assess the potential of processing full-waveform ALS data such that the third and fourth statistical moments, i.e. the echo skewness and the echo kurtosis, can be retrieved in addition to the amplitude, energy and FWHM. We propose a waveform decomposition approach using the skew normal distribution (SND) function, which enables the modelling of skewed echoes. We investigate the difference of tree-crown aggregated SND derived FW features between seven tree species (969 individual trees) in a temperate mixed forest with the aim of detecting the most descriptive echo features. The such derived FW features are tested for species classification.   The results reveal that the largest differences across the tree species are in the mean energy of the first echoes (15 out of 21 species pairs show differences), followed by the mean amplitude of the first echoes and the mean skewness of all echoes originating from a single crown (14 out of 21 species pairs show differences against each other for both features).   The differentiation of coniferous and deciduous trees benefits from the features derived from the SND decomposition compared to the use of echo amplitude only (0.39 vs. 0.61 in Cohen\'s k). As the classification accuracy of the three dominant tree species within the test site only shows a small increase (0.20 vs. 0.26 in Cohen\'s k) by adding FW features, we propose the use of such features in combination with features from multispectral data for this purpose.   The SND decomposition is comparable to the Gaussian decomposition regarding the decomposition accuracy (RMSE = 4.45 vs. RMSE = 3.50) and computational cost. Hence, we propose the default use of the SND decomposition, as the SND is a more flexible function, allowing for the modelling of normally distributed echoes, as well as the fitting of skewed echoes, while no limitations regarding the direction of the skewness are introduced. We attribute the difficulties in the tree species classification to the relatively wide ranges of the crown aggregated features within one species, which for some features results in a considerable overlap of the feature ranges across the species.

Conventionally, large-scale monitoring of spring phenology is primarily detected by satellite-based vegetation indices (VIs), e.g. the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). However, these indices have long been criticized, as the derived GUD can be biased by snowmelt. To minimize the snowmelt effect in monitoring spring phenology, we developed a new index, Normalized Difference Phenology Index (NDPI), which is a 3-band VI, designed to best contrast vegetation from the background (i.e. soil and snow in this study) as well as to minimize the difference among the backgrounds. We examined the rigorousness of NDPI in three ways. First, we conducted mathematical simulations to show that NDPI is mathematically robust and performs superior to NDVI for differentiating vegetation from the background, theoretically justifying NDPI for spring phenology monitoring. Second, we applied NDPI using MODIS land surface reflectance products to real vegetative ecosystems of three in-situ PhenoCam sites. Our results show that, despite large snow cover in the winter and snowmelt process in the spring, the temporal trajectories of NDPI closely track the vegetation green-up events. Finally, we applied NDPI to 11 eddy-covariance tower sites, spanning large gradients in latitude and vegetation types in deciduous ecosystems, using the same MODIS products. Our results suggest that the GUD derived by using NDPI is consistent with daily gross primary production (GPP) derived GUD, with R (Spearman\'s correlation) = 0.93, Bias = 2.90 days, and RMSE (the root mean square error) = 7.75 days, which outcompetes the snow removed NDVI approach, with R = 0.90, Bias = 7.34 days, and RMSE = 10.91 days. We concluded that our newly-developed NDPI is robust to snowmelt effect and is a reliable approach for monitoring spring green-up in deciduous ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Root Mean Square (RMS) and Anisotropic Flat Index (AFX) parameters were used as BRDF shape indices to represent the overall BRDF shape. Australian vegetation structure and agro-climate regions were used to separate and analyse different BRDF shape patterns. The results confirmed earlier findings that the intra-annual variation of MODIS BRDF shape is stronger than the inter-annual. High variance in the shape parameters of the base BRDF model as well as poor quality data regions suggest that for spectral data correction, the data are better used as a spatial average of BRDF shape (e.g. over a vegetation structure/climate class patch). This can reduce the spatial variance of shape to similar levels observed in the local variance of spectral data. The within-and between-class variations as well as correlations between some BRDF shape indices and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) show that inter-annual relationships between BRDF parameters can be separated using strata based on vegetation structure (basically height, cover and dominant growth form). However, due to the different climate drivers involved, such as rainfall, light and temperature, the intra-annual variation is better analysed if the patches of vegetation structure classes are identified by climate zone for climatic homogeneity. It is found that if long term averages are used to represent stable focal points in the time series, significant relationships exist between BRDF indices and spectral indices such as NDVI. However, there is no satisfactory way to directly relate short term fluctuations of (e.g.) NDVI with short term BRDF changes. All of the indices are significantly related to rainfall, structural characteristics and biomass with lagged relationships providing a more suitable pathway to analysing short variations. It is concluded that for the situation where a high quality BRDF product is available, the best strategy would involve use of a set of vegetation structure class patches to increase the resolution of local differences in BRDF shape for inhomogeneous scenes as well as control the high variance in MODIS BRDF model shape parameters. The partial relationships found between some BRDF indices (in particular RMS) and average rainfall or stable (longer term) NDVI also provide a potential for empirically updating BRDF shape for climate variation in periods before MODIS data were available.

The spatial scale and characteristics of the ocean vortex train were analyzed using image datasets from five different high-resolution satellites, including optical imagery from the Satellite Pour l\'Observation de la Terre and the Formosat-2 satellites and synthetic aperture radar imagery from the European Remote Sensing Satellite, Advanced Land Observing Satellite, and Sentinel -1. Satellite altimetry data and a moored acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) were used to calculate the velocity of the Kuroshio Current. The ADCP data suggest that the velocity increases on the western side of the vortex train when it is formed on the leeward side of Green Island. Data from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) showed that the sea surface temperature of the recirculation water was over 2 degrees C colder and the chlorophyll-a concentration was two times higher than that of the surrounding waters. These phenomena suggested upwelling, mixing processes, and an island-mass effect. Wind forcing had a pronounced effect on the characteristics of the vortex train. High-resolution satellite images indicate that the averaged aspect ratio of the vortex train is 2.09 and the dimensionless width is 2.02 under southerly winds, compared to 1.91 and 2.76, respectively, under northerly winds.

SAR also allows persistent observations of the process of oil discharges, benefiting from (1) day and night observations, (2) independence of cloud cover and (3) high revisiting frequencies. The interpretation of 82 SAR scenes over the Lower Congo Basin for the 1994-2012 period allowed the recognition of 1400 natural seepage slicks associated with 102 individual seep sites. We acquired an additional SAR data set with a short revisit time over a selected prolific area. The data set consisted of 22 SAR scenes acquired over a 10-day period, meaning a maximum revisiting period of 12 h between subsequent SAR acquisitions. The short-term approach shows that seepage slicks were detected with wind speeds between 1.5 and 6.5 m/s (2.91 to 12.63 knots). Both long-term and short-term monitoring evidences that seepage events are intermittent, with the occurrence rate of oil release ranging from 5 to 80%. Short-term monitoring shows that the seepage pace is independent between seep sites, suggesting contrasted controlling factors. It also shows that the residence time of seepage slicks is systematically shorter than 12 h, which is far below reported values. Understanding the seepage slick residence time is essential to provide an accurate estimation of the fluid flow and to compute the volumetric outflow. The integration of in-situ mooring points measuring the current velocity 10 m below the sea surface, in addition to local wind field and slick length, allowed us to more accurately estimate the residence time of oil slicks at the sea surface before vanishing. The results show that the sea surface residence time of oil slicks is limited to a few hours, with a median value of 3 h 15 min. These new residence time estimations allowed us to propose a quantification of the regional oil output in the Lower Congo Basin, estimated at 4380 m(3)/year. This area may therefore be considered as the world\'s third biggest oil-supplying province from natural leakages. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation index (VI) product has been a primary data source for this purpose. To date, the MODIS team had released several versions of VI products that have widely used in global change studies and practical applications. In this study, we re-examined the global vegetation activity by comparing the recent MODIS Collection 6 (C6) VIs with Collection 5 (C5) VIs including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from Terra (2001-2015) and Aqua Satellites (2003-2015). We found substantial differences in global vegetation trends betweenTerra-C5 and -C6 VIs, especially EVI. From 2001 to 2015, global vegetation showed a remarkable greening trend in annual EVI from the Terra-C6 (0.28% year(-1) P < 0.001), in contrast to the decreasing EVI trend from the Terra-05 (-0.14% year(-1) P < 0.01). Spatially, large portions of the browning areas in tropical regions identified by Terra-05 VIs were not evident in Terra-C6 VIs. In contrast, the widespread greening areas in Terra-C6 VIs were consistent with Aqua C6 VIs and GIMMS3g NDVI. Our finding of a greening Earth supports the recent studies suggesting an enhanced land carbon sink. Our study suggests that most of the vegetation browning trends detected by MODIS Terra-C5 VIs were likely caused by sensor degradation, particularly for the period after 2007. Therefore, previous studies of temporal vegetation trends based solely on Terra-C5 VIs may need to be reevaluated. Our new analysis offers the most updated understanding of the global vegetation dynamics during the past 15 years and contributes to accurately understanding the role of vegetation played in the Earth\'s biogeochemical and climatic systems.

In contrast to field-observed phonological events that are defined by clearly evident organismal changes with biophysical meaning, current approaches to detecting transitions in LSP only determine the timing of variations in remotely sensed observations of surface greenness. Since activities to bridge LSP and field observations are challenging and limited, our understanding of the biophysical characteristics of LSP transitions is poor. Therefore, we set out to explore the scaling effects on LSP transitions at the nominal start of growing season (SOS) by comparing detections from coarse resolution data with those from finer resolution imagery. Specifically, using a hybrid piecewise-logistic-model-based LSP detection algorithm, we detected SOS in the agricultural core of the United States central Iowa at two scales: first, at a finer scale (30 m) using reflectance generated by fusing MODIS data with Landsat 8 OLI data (OLI SOS) and, second, at a coarser resolution of 500 m using Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) observations. The VIIRS SOS data were compared with OLI SOS that had been aggregated using a percentile approach at various degrees of heterogeneity. The results revealed the complexities of SOS detections and the scaling effects that are latent at the coarser resolution. Specifically, OLI SOS variation defined using standard deviation (SD) was as large as 40 days within a highly spatially heterogeneous VIIRS pixel; whereas, SD could be <10 days for a more homogeneous set of pixels. Furthermore, the VIIRS SOS detections equaled the OLI SOS (with an absolute difference less than one day) in >60% of OLI pixels within a homogeneous VIIRS pixel, but in <20% of OLI pixels within a spatially heterogeneous VIIRS pixel. Moreover, the SOS detections in a coarser resolution pixel reflected the timing at which vegetation greenup onset occurred in 30% of area, despite variation in SOS heterogeneities. This result suggests that (1) the SOS detections at coarser resolution are controlled more by the earlier SOS pixels at the finer resolution rather than by the later SOS pixels, and (2) it should be possible to well simulate the coarser SOS value by selecting the timing at 30th percentile SOS at the finer resolution. Finally, it was demonstrated that in homogeneous areas the VIIRS SOS was comparable with OLI SOS with an overall difference of <5 days. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, because of their large extent, remote location, and lack of consistent satellite data coverage prior to 2000, comparatively little is known about their disturbance and recovery patterns at the regional scale beyond the past 15 years. Spatial distribution of recovering forests in the boreal zone is highly important for quantifying the feedback of forest cover to the climate system through carbon cycling and surface albedo which are strongly related to stand age. This paper presents a new method to map stand age distribution of young recovering forests that are primarily dominated by larch in Siberia using Landsat data acquired during the data-rich post-2000 era. This approach is based on the assumption that the relationship between the spectral signature of a forest stand acquired by Landsat ETM + and TM sensors and stand age before and after the year 2000 is similar thus allowing for training the algorithm on the data from the post-2000 era and applying the algorithm to infer stand age for the pre-2000 era. The output map combines the modeled forest disturbances before 2000 (56% producer\'s and 81% user\'s accuracy for disturbances) and direct observations of forest loss after 2000 (80% producer\'s and 92% user\'s accuracy for disturbances) to deliver a 24-year stand age distribution map at 30-m resolution for the Siberian larch forests. This is the first dataset that focuses specifically on the mid-term stand age dynamics of these forests at the regional scale. Our results show that >10% of the forested area in the Siberian larch forests has experienced stand-replacing fires in the past 24 years. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

CCI-ACT was found to have the most number of pixels with the lowest errors, having a mean fRMSE(TC) of 0.7188, compared to 0.7705 for CO-COMBINED, 0.7828 for CCI-PAS and 0.8308 for SMOS-D. However, the error in CCI-ACT was highest in arid desert regions of western India. The error in CCI-COMBINED, CCI-PAS and SMOS-D grew with an increase in vegetation density. The fRMSE(TC) maps were analysed against the maps of the probability of occurrence of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), soil texture (percentage of clay, sand, and silt) and modified Koppen-Geiger climate classification. The climate classification map was used to classify fRMSE(TC) against the different homogeneous climate classes. The analysis of the maps revealed that the inconsistency in SMOS is because of the RFI events over India. However, a multiple linear regression based attribution study showed that SMOS-D is the least affected by vegetation (4%) and the spatial distribution of CO-ACT and CO-COMBINED error showed more affinity towards soil texture than vegetation density.

The comparison was based on a correlation analysis between soil moisture products and in situ data collated from three separate ground-based networks: OzFlux, OzNet and CosmOz. The correlation analysis was performed using both original data sets and temporal anomalies, and was supported by examination of the time series plots. The interrelationships between the products were also explored using cluster analyses. The products considered in this study include: Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS; both Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) and L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere (LMEB) algorithms), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2; both LPRM and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) algorithms) and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) satellite-based products, and WaterDyn, Australian Water Resource Assessment Landscape (AWRA-L), Antecedent Precipitation Index (API), Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI), Mount\'s Soil Dryness Index (MSDI) and CABLE/BIOS2 model based products. The comparison of the satellite and model data sets showed variation in their ability to reflect in situ soil moisture conditions across Australia owing to individual product characteristics. The comparison showed the satellite products yielded similar ranges of correlation coefficients, with the possible exception of AMSR2 JAXA. SMOS (both algorithms) achieved slightly better agreement with in situ measurements than the alternative satellite products overall. Among the models, WaterDyn yielded the highest correlation most consistently across the different locations and climate zones considered. All products displayed, a weaker performance in estimating soil moisture anomalies than the original data sets (i.e. the absolute values), showing all products to be more effective in detecting interannual and seasonal soil moisture dynamics rather than individual events. Using cluster analysis we found satellite products generally grouped together, whereas models were more similar to other models. SMOS (based on LMEB algorithm and ascending overpass) and ASCAT (descending overpass) were found to be very similar to each other in terms of their temporal soil moisture dynamics, whereas AMSR2 (based on LPRM algorithm and descending overpass) and AMSR2 (based on JAXA algorithm and ascending overpass) were dissimilar. Of the model products, WaterDyn and CABLE were similar to each other, as were the API/AWRA-L and KBDI/MSDI pairs. The clustering suggests systematic commonalities in error structure and duplication of information may exist between products. This evaluation has highlighted relative strengths, weaknesses, and complementarities between products, so the drawbacks of each may be minimised through a more informed assessment of fitness for purpose by end users.

Traditional retrieval algorithms are known to fail over highly turbid Case 2 waters because they were developed specifically for the open ocean (Case 1 waters). Landsat 8 provides an improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a new spectral coastal aerosol band in the blue. This additional information provides means to tackle this retrieval endeavor. A look-up-table (LUT) and spectrum matching methodology was implemented to simultaneously retrieve CPAs, taking advantage of Landsat 8\'s new features. A LUT of spectral remote-sensing reflectances (R-rs) with different concentrations of CPAs was produced using the in-water radiative transfer model HydroLight A model-based empirical line method (MoB-ELM) algorithm was developed to atmospherically correct the Landsat 8 imagery and allow direct comparison with the LUT of R-rs. This MoB-ELM atmospheric correction algorithm uses pseudo-invariant features (PIFs) from the image, ground-truth data and the HydroLight model. The retrieval algorithm was applied over three Landsat 8 scenes and shows a normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) of about 14% for chlorophyll-a, 11% for total suspended solids (TSS), and 7% for colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) when compared with ground truth data. The CPA concentration maps exhibit expected trends of low concentrations in clear water and higher concentrations in turbid water.   These results demonstrate that the developed algorithm allows the simultaneous mapping of concentration of all CPAs in Case 2 waters and over areas where the traditional algorithms fail or are not available due to spatial resolution. Therefore, this study shows that the Landsat 8 satellite can be utilized over Case 2 waters as long as a careful atmospheric correction is applied. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Detailed large-area single-season mosaics and time-series maps of ice flow were created using data spanning June 2013 to June 2015. The 12-bit radiometric quantization and 15-m pixel scale resolution of OLI band 8 enable displacement tracking of subtle snow-drift patterns on ice sheet surfaces at similar to 1 m precision. Ice sheet and snowfield snow-drift features persist for typically 16 to 64 days, and up to 432 days, depending primarily on snow accumulation rates. This results in spatially continuous mapping of ice flow, extending the mapping capability beyond crevassed areas. Our method uses image chip cross-correlation and sub-pixel peak-fitting in matching Landsat path/row pairs. High-pass filtering is applied to the imagery to enhance local surface texture. The current high image acquisition rates of Landsat 8 (725 scenes per day globally) reduces the impact of high cloudiness in polar and mountain terrain and allows rapid compilation of large areas, or dense temporal coverage of seasonal ice flow variations. The results rival the coverage and accuracy of interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) mapping. (C) 2015 The Authors.

We analyzed differences between Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 surface reflectances and cirrus cloud characterization to address how substitutable Landsat 8 observations are within this long archive. Comparison of surface reflectance estimates acquired near simultaneously during Landsat 8\'s underflight orbital placement shows that Landsat 8 surface reflectance is consistently darker in the blue, green, and red bands and brighter in the near infrared than in Landsat 7. Vegetation indices that rely on the visible and near infrared bands should be used with caution as individual biases in index components can be amplified to create large biases in vegetation indices. We also analyzed time series datasets from the Landsat Climate Data Record (CDR) surface reflectance product across four scenes that contained only Landsat 7 data, Landsat 7 data and only Landsat 8 data post launch, and Landsat 7 data and data from both sensors post-launch to investigate how sensor differences propagate in time series analysis. If left uncorrected or unexplained, the difference in reflectance between Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 creates spurious time trends in visible wavelengths and in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The introduction of Landsat 8 into time series of Landsat 7 data also biases the mean reflectance or vegetation index value as measured by a time series model intercept while increasing the Root Mean Squared Error of such models. We characterized the spectral reflectance of cirrus clouds in the underflight data that were omitted from Landsat 7 cloud masks but were detected in Landsat 8\'s cloud mask due to the use of the newly added cirrus band. While these cirrus cloud observations missed in Landsat 7\'s cloud mask are only slightly brighter in the visible bands, a simulation of time series containing Landsat 8 data that does not use the cirrus band shows that omission of cirrus clouds can result in anomalously brighter time series intercepts and positive time trends. Our results indicate that while Landsat 8 has improved on the legacy of previous sensors through increased radiometric resolution, better cloud identification, and better geometric accuracy, difference in reflectance between sensors in the current Landsat CDR product must be corrected or explained within time series analysis to avoid deleterious consequences. Future efforts should identify the contributions of target specific effects versus differences in atmospheric correction methods to better inform approaches to synthesize the two sensors.

In this project, high-resolution aerial images taken by a Helikite helium balloon-kite at 100 m altitude were used to develop a detailed flooding model and derive a spatially comprehensive map of ecological zones at the headwaters of a small tidal marsh creek at a forest-marsh boundary in North Inlet estuary, South Carolina. We constructed photomosaics from Helikite imagery over a 150 x 100 m area to identify ecological zones using an automated, maximum likelihood classification. In the same area, we developed a digital terrain model with +/- 2 cm overall vertical accuracy, primarily from waterlines at known tide height tracked by Helikite imagery and GPS. These are low-cost, easily implemented methods for studying marsh processes where access is often challenging. Quantifying frequency of inundation, an approximation of hydroperiod, using our terrain model and comparing it to ecological zones revealed that there is not a linear relationship between elevation and inundation above mean high tide. Ecological zones exhibit complex spatial patterns that neither elevation nor hydroperiod alone can explain. In the northwestern basin, adjacent to a forest-marsh boundary, inflow of low salinity groundwater from a large freshwater lens beneath the forest prevents the development of Salicornia virginica zones and allows the high-marsh plant Juncus roemarianus to be present at middle-to-low marsh elevations. Conversely, in the southwestern portion of the basin adjacent to a relict beach ridge underlain by a smaller freshwater lens, saltwater infiltration during spring tides and evapotranspiration during neap tides allows Salicornia virginica zones to develop in hypersaline soils. Many of the current numerical models for predicting salt marsh ecological zonation consider hydroperiod as the main factor; however, the asymmetry of the basin in both ecological zones and freshened groundwater discharge imply groundwater and surface-water inundation should both be considered in the distribution of ecological zones in a coastal salt marsh.

However, it displays a few significant limitations for hydrologic forecasting, such as the inability to distinguish dry snow from wet snow, which could be addressed by the use of a technology such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR). This study is based on the Nechako River basin, located in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia (Canada), where the snowpack can reach several meters in depth. Fifteen RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR Wide images were obtained in VV + VH polarization between the months of March and July 2012 and sixteen SENTINEL-1A IW images were obtained in W polarization between the months of February and June 2015. They were processed with an algorithm based on Nagler and Rott\'s methodology, but which employs a soft threshold to separate wet snow from dry snow instead of the -3 dB hard threshold used in their method. The wet snow probability maps from this technique correspond better to the uncertainties caused by the coniferous forest found throughout the river basin. They were combined with the MODIS snow-covered area (SCA) product to exploit its ability to accurately detect the snow cover extent. The wet snow probability was also cross-referenced with the MODIS SCA product to remove discrepancies caused by forested areas or waterlogged soil. When compared to the snow metamorphism model SURFEX-Crocus at the location of the snow pillows of the basin, the combined product improves the detection of snow from 81.7 to 915% compared to MODIS alone. It also reliably distinguishes wet snow, dry snow, and snow free conditions with an accuracy of 77.6%. Moreover, an agreement of 72.4% was established between this product and the MODIS Land Surface Temperature. As an example of the future application of this work for watershed management, the current dataset was used to successfully detect snowmelt and predict the peak inflow occurrence in the Nechako reservoir for the 2012 and 2015 winters.

Accurate and timely updated land cover map of Chile in detailed classification categories is highly demanded for many applications. A conclusive land cover map integrated from multi-seasonal mapping results and a seasonal dynamic map series were produced using Landsat 8 imagery mainly acquired in 2013 and 2014, supplemented by MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index data, high resolution imagery on Google Earth, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission DEM data. The overall accuracy is 80% for the integrated map at level 1 and 73% for level 2 based on independent validation data. Accuracies for seasonal map series were also assessed, which is around 70% for each season, greatly improved by integrated use of seasonal information. The importance of growing season imagery was proved in our analysis. The analysis of the spatial variation of accuracies among various ecoregions indicates that the accuracy for land cover mapping decreases gradually from central Chile to both north and south. More mapping efforts for those ecoregions are needed. In addition, the training dataset includes sample points spatially distributed in the whole country, temporally distributed throughout the year, and categorically encompassing all land cover types. This training dataset constitutes a universal sample set allowing us to map land cover from any Landsat 8 image acquired in Chile without additional ad hoc training sample collection.

The meteorological parameters from the re-analysis data of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) are applied to estimate the aerosol layer height (ALH) of the two-layer aerosol model via an automatic workflow. The estimated extinction coefficients near the surface by AOD/ALH over the single point of a lidar site in Shanghai agree well with those of the ground measurements from a visibility sensor, with a correlation coefficient of 0.86 and root mean squared error (RMS) of 0.19 km(-1) for the data set from April 18, 2008 to April 30, 2014. The season long spatial comparison demonstrates that most of the correlation coefficients (90%) are >0.6, and more than half of the samples (68%) have coefficients higher than 0.7 for the data set from January 1 to April 30, 2014. Dust transportation and higher relative humidity (RH) have been confirmed to be important factors in reducing the accuracy of estimated visibility, as these situations fail to meet the assumptions of the two-layer model. Additionally, the less-rigorous cloud mask algorithm of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/AOD might lead to overestimates of AOD, and further underestimating of the surface-level visibility. The spatial variation of temporal correlation coefficients shows that most comparison sites (>74%) of satellite estimations agree well with the surface-level visibility measurements, with correlation coefficients up to 0.6 during the study period. The northern area of Eastern China presented better agreement than the southern area. This may be related to the complex underlying surface characteristics and higher RH in the southern part. This work will significantly improve the quality of climate simulations and air quality forecasts in Eastern China. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Here, a ground based experiment is used to address some of these uncertainties. The experiment measured the brightness temperatures (BTs) of oil slicks (with different known thicknesses) and oil-free water as a function of time of the day for both clear and turbid waters. The BT differences (BTDs) between oil slicks and oil-free water were further simulated using a diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) model. The results demonstrate that: (1) for an oil slick that is in thermal equilibrium with the water, the optimal time for thermal detection is around local noon (positive BTDs) with midnight (negative BTs) being the next best time; the periods shortly before sunrise and after sunset are not suitable for the thermal detection of oil slicks; (2) a better linear relationship between slick thickness and BTD is found during daytime than night-time and the type of background water also plays a role in this; and (3) assuming a detection limit of 03 degrees C for a thermal sensor, the MDT at noon is approximately 40 mu m for both clear and turbid waters, while for other times of the day the MDT is higher (e.g., 75 and 150 pm for clear and turbid waters, respectively, at midnight). Detection limits for several existing satellite sensors and for other observation scenarios are also discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The algorithm is expected to estimate FVC from GF-1 WFV reflectance data with spatial resolution of 16 m and temporal resolution of four dates. The proposed algorithm is based on training back propagation neural networks (NNs) using PROSPECT + SAIL radiative transfer model simulations for GF-1 WFV canopy reflectance and corresponding FVC values. Green, red and near-infrared bands\' reflectances of GF-1 WFV data are the input variables of the NNs, as well as the corresponding FVC is the output variable, and finally 842,400 simulated samples covering various land surface conditions are used for training the NNs. A case study in Weichang County of China, having abundant land cover types, was conducted to validate the performance of the proposed FVC estimation algorithm for GF-1 WFV data. The validation results showed that the proposed algorithm worked effectively and generated reasonable FVC estimates with R-2 = 0.790 and root mean square error of 0.073 based on the field survey data. The proposed algorithm can be operated without prior knowledge on the land cover and has the potential for routine production of high quality FVC products using GF-1 WFV surface reflectance data.

However, the accuracy of net radiation derived from remote sensing data has been evaluated up to now over a limited number of in situ measurements and ecosystems. This study aims at evaluating estimates and uncertainties on net radiation derived from Landsat-7 images depending on reliability of the input surface variables albedo, emissivity and surface temperature. The later includes the reliability of remote sensing information (spectral reflectances and top of canopy brightness temperature) and shortwave and longwave incoming radiations.   Primary information describing the surface is derived from remote sensing observations. Surface albedo is estimated from spectral reflectances using a narrow-to-broadband conversion method. Land surface temperature is retrieved from top of canopy brightness temperature by accounting for land surface emissivity and reflection of atmospheric radiation; and emissivity is estimated using a relationship with a vegetation index and a spectral database of soil and plant canopy properties in the study area. The net radiation uncertainty is assessed using comparison with ground measurements over the Crau-Camargue and lower Rhone valley regions in France. We found Root Mean Square Errors between retrievals and field measurements of 0.25-033 (14-19%) for albedo, similar to 1.7 K for surface temperature and similar to 20 W.m(-2) (5%) for net radiation. Results show a substantial underestimation of Landsat-7 albedo (up to 0.024), particularly for estimates retrieved using the middle infrared, which could be due to different sources: the calibration of field sensors, the correction of radiometric signals from Landsat-7 or the differences in spectral bands with the sensors for which the models where originally derived, or the atmospheric corrections. We report a global uncertainty in net radiation of 40-100 W.m(-2) equally distributed over the shortwave and longwave radiation, which varies spatially and temporally depending on the land use and the time of year. In situ measurements of incoming shortwave and longwave radiation contribute the most to uncertainty in net radiation (10-40 W.m(-2) and 20-30 W.m(-2), respectively), followed by uncertainties in albedo (<25 W.m(-2)) and surface temperature (similar to 8 W.m(-2)). For the latter, the main factors were the uncertainties in top of canopy reflectances (<10 W.m(-2)) and brightness temperature (5-7 W.m(-2)). The generalization of these results to other sensors and study regions could be considered, except for the emissivity if prior knowledge on its characterization is not available.

These studies concentrated mostly on the effect of one feature (leaf type, leaf side or light type) on the leaf optical spectra. We have measured the diffuse reflectance and transmittance spectra of tobacco green leaves in combination of 4 variants: in normal and water infiltrated leaves, in collimated or diffuse incident light, on both the adaxial and abaxial leaf sides, and for the face or side chloroplast arrangement. A Simple Explicitly Non-Linear Empirical model for Leaf Optical Properties (SENLELOP model) is used to theoretically describe, simulate and fit the deviations from the Lambert-Beer\'s law causing nonlinearity in the measured spectral changes. It is shown that the incident diffuse light is captured by the leaf more effectively than the collimated light. The light incident from the adaxial leaf side is more effectively absorbed than the same light incident from the abaxial leaf side. The air in intercellular spaces of natural leaf increases about twice the beam path and strongly deepens the non-linearity of the absorption process when compared with water infiltrated leaf. The chloroplast arrangement in the palisade cells is reflected in most of the studied differences. The leaf absorbance changed in our case of tobacco leaves up to 30% when the chloroplasts moved from the face to the side position. This change depends strongly on the wavelength and quite slightly on the character of incident light. Further analysis predicts that in practice the effect of chloroplast rearrangement on the reflectance spectra is in dependence on the wavelength of the light about 2-5% in our case of fully developed green leaves but can be higher in some cases. Thus it can affect values of some of the indices used in the remote sensing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Existing FAPAR products from satellite observations are spatially incomplete and temporally discontinuous, and also insufficiently accurate to meet the requirements of various applications. In this study, a new method is proposed to calculate high quality, accurate FAPAR from the Global [And Surface Satellite (GLASS) leaf area index (LAI) to ensure physical consistency between LAI and FAPAR retrievals. As a result, a global FAPAR product (denoted by GLASS) was generated from the GLASS LAI data from 2000. With no missing values, GLASS FAPAR product is spatially complete. Comparison of the GLASS FAPAR product with the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Geoland2/BioPar version 1 (GEOV1), and the Seaviewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) FAPAR products indicates that these FAPAR products exhibit similar spatial distribution pattern. However, there were relatively large discrepancies between these FAPAR products in equatorial forest regions and around 50-60 N, where the SeaWiFS FAPAR values were lower than the other products and GLASS FAPAR product showed the largest values. Temporal consistency analysis indicates that GLASS FAPAR product has continuous trajectories, while MODIS FAPAR product shows more unstable profiles, especially during the growing season. Direct comparison with ground-based estimates demonstrated that GLASS FAPAR values were more accurate (R-2 = 0.9292 and RMSE = 0.0716) than GEOV1 (R-2 = 0.8681 and RMSE = 0.1085), MODIS (R-2 = 0.8048 and RMSE = 0.1276) and SeaWiFS FAPAR values (R-2 = 0.7377 and RMSE = 0.1635).

However, our understanding of vegetation seasonality is mostly limited to the mechanisms and attributes of phenological events, such as spring emergence and fall senescence. Here we have investigated the seasonal evolution of vegetation growth from winter dormancy to summer maturity of four forest types in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) temperate and boreal forests for 1982-2011. The present study assesses large-scale variations in the vegetation green-up rate (VG(rate)) and its connection to temperature variability using remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface air temperature. The average of the VG(ate) of the analysis period increases with latitude, which indicates that the canopy develops more rapidly from dormancy to maturity for vegetation in higher-latitude or colder climate zones. VG(rate) and precedent temperature also show a positive correlation (r) over temperate and boreal forests (67% of the forest area in the NH), indicating that increased temperatures lead to faster canopy development within the same climate zone or latitude band. Responsiveness of VG(rate) to temperature variability shows that despite the same magnitude of local temperature variability during extremely cold and warm years, the magnitude of VG(rate) acceleration in warm years (0.07 (15-day)(-1)) is larger than the VG(rate) deceleration in cold years (-0.03 (15-day)(-1)), suggesting that the response of VG(rate) to temperature variability is nonlinear. Among the four forest types examined in this study, the nonlinear responses are most clearly observed in deciduous broadleaf forests indicating that forest composition may regulate the large-scale response of canopy development to temperature variability. Overall, our results suggest that anomalous seasonal warming will significantly affect canopy developments over wide deciduous forest areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Using these data to estimate crop yields for individual fields would benefit both crop management and scientific research, especially for areas where reliable ground-based estimates are not currently made. Here we introduce a generalized approach for mapping crop yields with satellite data and test its predictions for yields across more than 17,000 maize fields and 11,000 soybean fields spanning multiple states and years in the Midwestern United States. The method, termed SCYM (a scalable satellite-based crop yield mapper), uses crop model simulations to train statistical models for different combinations of possible image acquisition dates, and these are then applied to Landsat and gridded weather data within the Google Earth Engine platform, where the Landsat is composited to find the \"best\" dates of observations on a pixel-by-pixel basis. SCYM estimates successfully captured a significant fraction of maize yield variation in all state-years, with a range of 14-58% and an average of 35% for this particular study region and crop. Similar results were observed for soybean, with an average of 32% of yield variation captured. The multi-year yield estimates were also used to examine the temporal persistence of yield advantages for the top yielding fields in different counties, which is one measure of how important factors such as farmer skill are in explaining yield gaps. The strength of the SCYM approach lies in its ability to leverage physiological knowledge embedded in crop models to interpret satellite observations in a scalable way, as it can be readily applied to new crops, regions, and types and timing of remote sensing observations without the need for ground calibration.

Particularly the forests in the region are threatened by large-scale infrastructure developments, the expansion of agriculture and trading of timber products. In view of these developments, this study provides an updated view of the current state of the forest resources in the region and the change they have undergone throughout the last decade. Annual maps of percent tree cover, herbaceous cover, and barren land for the years 2001-2011 were derived from 500 m MODIS data, and formed the basis for a tree cover specific identification of changes utilising long-term statistics on inter-annual prediction variability. Furthermore, the temporal patterns shown in the tree cover history of each pixel for the observation period, allowed a differentiation to be made between permanent forest cover conversions and temporary forest losses, as well as between areas of abrupt and more gradual forest dynamics. Average gross forest loss for the Lower Mekong Basin was estimated at a rate of 0.4% per year. When considering permanent forest losses only, the highest annual loss rates were evident for Vietnamese Basin area (1.1%), followed by the respective national areas of Cambodia (0.7%), Laos (0.4%), and Thailand (0.2%). Extensive areas of forests and forest regrowth within Laos and Vietnam have been affected by temporal losses that have been mostly attributed to shifting-cultivation practices and the conversion of natural forests to forest plantations. Furthermore, it could be shown that temporal patterns of change may possibly reveal information about the underlying causes of forest cover reduction. Forest clearance related to large-scale mechanised clear cutting, e.g. by the agroindustry, generally showed very abrupt decreases in canopy cover, while forest losses related to small-scale agricultural clearings or more selective logging where characterised by more gradual decreases.

APEX is a dispersive pushbroom imaging spectrometer covering the solar reflected wavelength range between 372 and 2540 nm with nominal 312 (max. 532) spectral bands. APEX is calibrated using a combination of laboratory, in-flight and vicarious calibration approaches. These are complemented by using a forward and inverse radiative transfer modeling approach, suitable to further validate APEX data. We establish traceability of APEX radiances to a primary calibration standard, including uncertainty analysis. We also discuss the instrument simulation process ranging from initial specifications to performance validation. In a second part, we present Earth science applications using APEX. They include geometric and atmospheric compensated as well as reflectance anisotropy minimized Level 2 data. Further, we discuss retrieval of aerosol optical depth as well as vertical column density of NOx, a radiance data-based coupled canopy atmosphere model, and finally measuring sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (Fs) and infer plant pigment content. The results report on all APEX specifications including validation. APEX radiances are traceable to a primary standard with <4% uncertainty and with an average SNR of >625 for all spectral bands. Radiance based vicarious calibration is traceable to a secondary standard with <= 65% uncertainty. Except for inferring plant pigment content, all applications are validated using in-situ measurement approaches and modeling. Even relatively broad APEX bands (FWHM of 6 nm at 760 nm) can assess Fs with modeling agreements as high as R-2 = 0.87 (relative RMSE = 27.76%). We conclude on the use of high resolution imaging spectrometers and suggest further development of imaging spectrometers supporting science grade spectroscopy measurements. (C) 2014 The Authors.

This work investigates the interoperability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical datasets for the purpose of large-scale and operational forest monitoring. Using a discriminant technique known as canonical variate analysis, we investigate the level of discrimination (between forest and non-forest training sites) achieved by different datasets, thereby providing an assessment of complementarity between Landsat data and SAR data acquired at C-band (RADARSAT-2) and L-band (ALOS PALSAR), as well as related texture measures. Spatio-temporal methods developed as part of Australia\'s Land Cover Change Program (an established forest mapping and carbon accounting scheme operating at continental scale) are subsequently used for the integration of Landsat and (segmented) PALSAR data. To highlight specific operational aspects of the multi-sensor framework, this approach is demonstrated over the Australian state of Tasmania (approximately 6.8 million ha), one of several national demonstrator sites defined by the Forest Carbon Tracking task of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO-FCT). In terms of complementarity, the combination of Landsat and L-band SAR data is found to provide most of the forest discrimination, while texture information and single-date C-band SAR data are found to provide only limited additional discrimination improvement in the frame of the considered monitoring system. The interoperability of optical and SAR data is assessed by comparison of forest maps resulting from the spatio-temporal processing under different scenarios, including: i) Landsat-only time series, ii) PALSAR-only time series, and iii) mixed Landsat-PALSAR tithe series. A comparison of the single-date optical and SAR-based forest classifications indicates a good agreement over Tasmania, with some bias towards forest in the PALSAR classifications. Significant differences are evident when considering the case of forest conversion (deforestation and afforestation) over large areas, thereby compromising the full interoperability of SAR and optical data within the framework of Australia\'s carbon accounting system.

This work investigates microwave emission processes that are important to link L-band brightness temperatures with soil freeze/thaw states and the presence and the state of snow. To this end, a ground snow radiative transfer (GS RT) model has been developed on the basis of the \"Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks\" (MEMLS). Our model sensitivity study revealed that L-band emission of a freezing ground can be affected significantly by dry snow, which has been mostly disregarded in previous studies. Simulations suggest that even dry snow with mostly negligible absorption at the L-band can impact L-band emission of winter landscapes significantly. We found that impedance matching and refraction caused by a dry snowpack can increase or decrease L-band emission depending on the polarization and the observation angle. Based on the performed sensitivity study, these RT processes can be compensatory at vertical polarization and the observation angle of 50 degrees. This suggests the use of vertical polarized brightness temperatures measured at around 50 degrees in order to achieve segregated information on soil-frost. Furthermore, our simulations demonstrate a significant sensitivity of L-band emission at horizontal polarization with respect to the density of the lowest snow layer as the result of refraction and impedance matching by the snowpack.

Our assessment both addresses the scientific and operational question of whether a nationwide SAR-based monitoring of ground motion would succeed in Great Britain, and helps to understand controlling factors and possible solutions to overcome the limitations of undertaking SAR-based imaging of the landmass. This is the first time such a nationwide assessment is performed in preparation for acquisition and processing of SAR data in the United Kingdom, and any other country in the world. Analysis of the ERS-1/2 and ENVISAT archives reveals potential for multi-interferogram SAR Interferometry (InSAR) for the entirety of Britain using ERS-1/2 in descending mode, with 100% standard image frames showing at least 20 archive scenes available. ERS-1/2 ascending and both ENVISAT modes show potential for non-interferometric and single-pair InSAR for the vast majority of Britain, and multi-interferogram only for 13% to 38% of the available standard frames. Based on NEXTMap (R) Britain Digital Terrain Model (DTM) we simulate SAR layover, foreshortening and shadow to the ERS-1/2 and ENVISAT Lines-Of-Sight (LOS), and quantify changes of SAR distortions with variations in mode, LOS incidence angles and ground track angles, local terrain orientation, and the effect of scale due to the input DIM resolution. The simulation is extended to the similar to 230,000 km(2) landmass, and shows limited control of local topography on the radar terrain visibility. According to the 50 m to 5 m DTM-based simulations, similar to 1.0-1.4% of Great Britain could potentially be affected by shadow and layover in each mode. Only similar to 0.02-0.04% overlapping between ascending and descending mode distortions is found, this indicating the negligible proportion of the landmass that cannot be monitored using either imaging mode. We calibrate the CORINE Land Cover 2006 (CLC2006) using Persistent Scatterer (PS) datasets available for London, Stoke-On-Trent, Newcastle and Bristol, to quantify land cover control on the PS distribution and characterise the CLC2006 classes in terms of the potential PS density they could provide. Despite predominance of rural land cover types, we predict potential for over 12.8 M monitoring targets for each acquisition mode using a set of image frames covering the entire landmass. We validate our assessment by processing with the Interferometric Point Target Analysis (IPTA) 55 ERS-1/2 SAR scenes depicting South Wales between 1992 and 1999. Although absolute differences between predicted and observed target density are revealed, relative densities and rankings among the various CLC2006 classes are found constant across the calibration and validation datasets. Rescaled predictions for Britain show potential for a total of 2.5 M monitoring targets across the landmass. We examine the use of the topographic and land cover feasibility maps for landslide studies in relation to the British Geological Survey\'s National landslide Database and DiGMapGB mass movement layer. Building upon recent literature, we finally discuss future perspectives relating to the replication of our feasibility assessment to account for higher resolution SAR imagery, new Earth explorers (e.g.   , Sentinel-1) and improved processing techniques, showing potential to generate invaluable sources of information on land motions and geohazards in Great Britain.

As such, there is a need for broadly applicable tools to detect and monitor controls on combustion such as surface peat moisture and water-table position. A field portable spectroradiometer was used to measure surface reflectance of two Sphagnum moss-dominated peatland experiments, one being an experimental study utilizing a factorial experiment of vegetation and water-table manipulations and the other being a field site located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan that is broadly representative of northern peatland ecosystems. Relationships were developed correlating spectral indices to surface moisture as well as water-table position using the surface reflectance data. Spectral convolutions, or integrations of the hyperspectral data with the relative spectral response curves of multispectral sensors, were also applied to represent spectral sensitivity of commonly used Earth observing sensors. Band ratios previously used to monitor surface moisture with these sensors were assessed. Strong relationships with surface moisture and water-table position are evident for both the narrow-band indices as well as broad-band indices. This study also revealed a dependence of spectral relationships on changes in vegetation cover, particularly ericoid shrubs, within the vegetation manipulation experiment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

One of these bio-optical model is PHYSAT, which is a global method applied for oceanic Case I water and used to identify in satellite pixels specific dominant phytoplankton groups, such as nanoeukaryotes, Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, diatoms, Phaeocystis-like and coccolithophores. Here, we present a regionalized version of the PHYSAT method that has been specifically developed for the Mediterranean Sea due to the peculiarities of phytoplankton assemblages and succession than can be found in the basin and its particular optical properties. The updated version of the method, the so called PHYSAT-Med, has been validated successfully with large in situ datasets available for this oceanic region, mainly for nanoeukaryotes, Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and diatoms. PHYSAT-Med allows to include a much higher number of pixels for the Mediterranean than PHYSAT does, through the use of a new Look-Up-Table created specifically for this oceanic region. Results provided by PHYSAT-Med showed the dominance of Synechococcus versus prochlorophytes throughout the year at the basin level, although nanoeukaryotes were more abundant during winter months. In addition, PHYSAT-Med data identified a rise in the eukaryote biomass (mainly diatoms) during the spring period (March to April), especially in the Ligurian and Adriatic seas. PHYSAT-Med represents a useful tool for the spatio-temporal monitoring of different dominant phytoplankton functional types in Mediterranean surface waters at a high resolution.

While global climate studies can leverage albedo datasets from MODIS, VIIRS, and other coarse-resolution sensors, many applications in heterogeneous environments can benefit from higher-resolution albedo products derived from Landsat We previously developed a \"MODIS-concurrent\" approach for the 30-meter albedo estimation which relied on combining post-2000 Landsat data with MODIS Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) information. Here we present a \"pre-MODIS era\" approach to extend 30-m surface albedo generation in time back to the 1980s, through an a priori anisotropy Look-Up Table (LUT) built up from the high quality MCD43A BRDF estimates over representative homogenous regions. Each entry in the LUT reflects a unique combination of land cover, seasonality, terrain information, disturbance age and type, and Landsat optical spectral bands. An initial conceptual WT was created for the Pacific Northwest (PNW) of the United-States and provides BRDF shapes estimated from MODIS observations for undisturbed and disturbed surface types (including recovery trajectories of burned areas and non-fire disturbances). By accepting the assumption of a generally invariant BRDF shape for similar land surface structures as a priori information, spectral white-sky and black-sky albedos are derived through albedo-to-nadir reflectance ratios as a bridge between the Landsat and MODIS scale. A further narrow-to-broadband conversion based on radiative transfer simulations is adopted to produce broadband albedos at visible, near infrared, and shortwave regimes. We evaluate the accuracy of resultant Landsat albedo using available field measurements at forested AmeriFlux stations in the PNW region, and examine the consistency of the surface albedo generated by this approach respectively with that from the \"concurrent\" approach and the coincident MODIS operational surface albedo products. Using the tower measurements as reference, the derived Landsat 30-m snow-free shortwave broadband albedo yields an absolute accuracy of 0.02 with a root mean square error less than 0.016 and a bias of no more than 0.007. A further cross-comparison over individual scenes shows that the retrieved white sky shortwave albedo from the \"pre-MODIS era\" LUT approach is highly consistent (R-2 = 0.988, the scene-averaged low RMSE = 0.009 and bias = -0.005) with that generated by the earlier \"concurrent\" approach. The Landsat albedo also exhibits more detailed landscape texture and a wider dynamic range of albedo values than the coincident 500-m MODIS operational products (MCD43A3), especially in the heterogeneous regions. Collectively, the \"pre-MODIS\" LUT and \"concurrent\" approaches provide a practical way to retrieve long-term Landsat albedo from the historic Landsat archives as far back as the 19805, as well as the current Landsat-8 mission, and thus support investigations into the evolution of the albedo of terrestrial biomes at fine resolution.

Incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is required by nearly all terrestrial ecosystem models. Although several global radiation products from numeric models and satellite observations have been released, their coarse spatial resolutions and low accuracy, especially at high altitude regions, limit their applications in land community. In this study, the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) ISR and PAR products are developed based on an improved look-up table method from 2008 to 2010 at a 5 km spatial resolution and a 3 hour temporal resolution, the first global radiation products at such high resolutions, from multiple polar-orbiting and geostationary satellite data, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG2) SEVIRI, the Multi-functional Transport Satellite (MTSAT)-1R, and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Imager. The look-up table algorithm primarily considers the influences of surface elevation, atmospheric water vapor because sensitivity experiments indicate that ISR and PAR are more sensitive to surface elevation, and less sensitive to atmospheric profiles and ozone amount. The water vapor absorption has strong impact on ISR but weak on PAR. Moreover, the surface bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is taken into account to retrieve spatially and temporally continuous surface reflectances from the geostationary satellite observations, which is an input parameter in the revised look-up table method. Ground-based measurement data from 34 sites are used to validate the improved algorithm and the GLASS products. The validation results of the instantaneous ISR and PAR products at all validation sites are notably good with coefficient of determination values of 0.83 and 0.84, respectively, and root mean square error values of 115.0 Wm(-2) and 49.0 Wm(-2), respectively. We also aggregate the GLASS ISR product for comparing with the corresponding ISCCP and CERES data at 7 SURFRAD sites and demonstrate that the GLASS ISR product is more accurate.

Bi-directional reflectance distribution measurements in the principal scattering plane were recorded for sand samples prepared near minimum and maximum relative densities.

However, sands are usually composite materials, and we observed that reflectance can actually decrease with increasing density when the dominant constituents of the sand are semi-translucent, and a darker fraction with typically smaller grains is also present.

The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Aqua platform (AMSR-E) has made significant contributions to this application. As the result of agency and individual initiatives, several approaches for the retrieval of soil moisture from AMSR-E have been proposed and implemented. Although the majority of these are based on the same Radiative Transfer Equation, studies have shown that the resulting soil moisture estimates can differ significantly. A primary goal of this investigation is to understand these differences and develop a suitable approach to potentially improve the algorithm currently used by NASA in producing its operational soil moisture product In order to achieve this goal, the theoretical basis of several alternative soil moisture retrieval algorithms are examined. Analysis has focused on five established approaches: the operational algorithm adopted by NASA, which is referred to as the Normalized Polarization Difference algorithm, the Single Channel Algorithm, the Land Parameter Retrieval Model, the University of Montana soil moisture algorithm, and the HydroAlgo Artificial Neural Network algorithm. Previous comparisons of these algorithms in the literature have typically focused on the retrieved soil moisture products, and employed different metrics and data sets, and have resulted in differing conclusions. In this investigation we attempt to provide a more thorough understanding of the fundamental differences between the algorithms and how these differences affect their performance in terms of range of soil moisture provided. The comparative overview presented in the paper is based on the operating versions of the source codes of the individual algorithms. Analysis has indicated that the differences between algorithms lie in the specific parameterizations and assumptions of each algorithm. The comparative overview of the theoretical basis of the approaches is linked to differences found in the soil moisture retrievals, leading to suggestions for improvements and increased reliability in these algorithms.

The wide swath of the SNPP Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) observed a historic event: 3 typhoons that all hit China mainland within 5 days. The Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) provides critical supports to the SNPP instrumental validation and verification efforts. For example, the CRTM helped to verify image striping in the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) upper atmosphere channels. The CRTM has also been used to characterize the ATMS radiometric bias and has led to the development of a complementary cloud screening method. Using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) 6 h analysis data as inputs to the CRTM, we can statistically quantify the spectral bias for each field of view (FOV) of the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS). The CRTM is also a very useful tool for cross-sensor verifications. Using the double difference method, it can remove the biases caused by slight differences in the spectral response and geometric angles between two instruments. The CRTM helps our understanding on radiometric and spectral calibrations. It is the CRTM simulations that enable us to determine the root cause of the VIIRS shortwave infrared band image striping during daytime. The CRTM is operationally used at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) for weather forecasting and monitoring satellite radiance biases and standard deviation.   This study also demonstrated the CRTM capability for Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) radiance simulations. The first result showed a good agreement between the measurement and simulation. The CRTM for OMPS limb sensing, and Clouds and the Earth\'s Radiant Energy System (CERES) shortwave radiation and long-wave radiation flux simulation capability need to be extended.

Whereas biogeographic phenological patterns and shifts have received much attention in temperate ecosystems, much less is known about the phenology of savannas, despite their sensitivity to climate change and their coverage of approximately one eighth of the global land surface. Savannas are complex assemblages of multiple tree, shrub, and grass vegetation strata, each with variable phenological responses to seasonal climate and environmental variables. The objectives of this study were to investigate biogeographical and inter-annual patterns in savanna phenology along a 1100 km ecological rainfall gradient, known as North Australian Tropical Transect (NATT), encompassing humid coastal Eucalyptus forests and woodlands to xeric inland Acacia woodlands and shrublands. Key phenology transition dates (start, peak, end, and length of seasonal greening periods) were extracted from 13 years (2000-2012) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA).   Two distinct biogeographical patterns in phenology were observed, controlled by different climate systems. The northern (mesic) portion of the transect, from 12 S, to around 17.7 degrees S, was influenced by the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (IT) seasonal monsoon climate system, resulting in strong latitudinal shifts in phenology patterns, primarily associated with the functional response of the C4 grass layer. Both the start and end of the greening ( enhanced vegetation activity) season occurred earlier in the northern tropical savannas and were progressively delayed towards the southern limit of the Eucalyptus-dominated savannas resulting in relatively stable length of greening periods. In contrast, the southern xeric portion of the study area was largely decoupled from monsoonal influences and exhibited highly variable phenology that was largely rainfall pulse driven. The seasonal greening periods were generally shorter but fluctuated widely from no detectable greening during extended drought periods to length of greening seasons that exceeded those in the more mesic northern savannas in some wet years. This was in part due to more extreme rainfall variability, as well as a C3/C4 grass-forb understory that provided the potential for extended greening periods. Phenology of Acacia dominated savannas displayed a much greater overall responsiveness to hydroclimatic variability. The variance in annual precipitation alone could explain 80% of the variances in the length of greening season across the major vegetation groups. We also found that increased variation in the timing of phenology was coupled with a decreasing tree-grass ratio. We further compared the satellite-based phenology results with tower-derived measures of Gross Ecosystem Production (GEP) fluxes at three sites over two contrasting savanna classes. We found good convergence between MODIS EVI and tower GEP, thereby confirming the potential to link these two independent data sources to better understand savanna ecosystem functioning.

In this paper, typical continental glaciers, the Dongkemadi and its neighbouring glaciers in the central area of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, are monitored using multi-sensor C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. The study includes analysis of the alternating processes of ablation and freezing, the glacier zones detected on SAR images, and the changing snow/firn line across different days, seasons, and years. Experiments show that in late summer the wet snow-/firn-ice boundary, which is termed the late summer wet snow/firn line (WSFL) is easily detected on SAR images and it is relatively stable over multiple days. Also, the detected late summer WSFL, and the recorded yearly equilibrium line which reflects glacier mass balance, are close in a positive mass balance year, but the detected late summer WSFL is lower than the equilibrium line in a negative mass balance year. By combining pit and SAR observations it was found that the firn can be divided into two parts on the glaciers; the thick firn that lies in the neve basin is distinct on SAR images in winter, but the fins surrounding the basin with thickness ranging from 0 to 20 cm is difficult to recognize. The thick firn line (the lower boundary of neve basin) is stable in observations eight years apart. Based on the C-band VV polarization SAR image experiments, field work, and existing records, the spatiotemporal backscatter signature specific to the typical continental glacier is identified. The spatiotemporal backscatter signature helps to understand mass balance proxies and surface melt patterns of the glaciers in SAR images. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Though numerous studies have been adopted and developed based on remote sensing technology to make a more accurate prediction of regional ET distribution, there has been still degree of uncertainty due to high spatio-temporal variability of the ecohydrologic parameter. This study suggested the revised remote sensing-based Penman-Monteith (Revised RS-PM) model and Trapezoid Interpolation Model (TIM) using only remotely sensed data as input data to assess applicability over complex topography in East Asia. Ground observations at the two flux sites having different land surface conditions were used to evaluate intra-annual seasonality in 2008. Both models represented temporal compatibility yielding biases of -74.25-38.79 W m(-2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of 68.96-90.90 W m(-2) while the models consistently overestimated ET at the forests due to large amount of interception relatively restraining sufficient water supply to the plants. The revised RS-PM showed slight overestimation due to the overvalued Leaf Area Index (LAI) as an input parameter and classified parameterization in transpiration calculation. This algorithm was developed for global mapping of ET so that errors occurring from vegetation parameterization are inevitable. TIM reproduced higher ET than the measurements in a non-growing season since remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as an input parameter could be affected by cloud contamination. In contrast to the dormant season, the revised RS-PM estimated a larger amount of ET distribution than TIM in the growing season. A conservative estimation of TIM was mainly caused by the structural characteristics. Relationships between the land surface temperature and NDVI were contextually used to determine both maximum and minimum limits of the Priestley-Taylor parameters in the image data. Determination of the contextual relationship should be carefully conducted to achieve reliable estimations. Results of a sensitivity analysis shows that the net radiation (R-N) plays the most significant role in both models (+/- 17-20% for ET by +/- 20% change of R-N). Variation of LAI impacted ET mostly in the revised RS-PM in a dormant season due to a logarithmic relationship between canopy conductance and LAI. TIM, on the other hand, was barely affected by LAI because of the simple structure of the algorithm including the Priestley-Taylor equation. The results suggest that the models can be applied to a regional scale with heterogeneous topography over long term periods if the input data handling is carefully conducted. In particular, the models can be usefully applied where ground ancillary data are not readily available. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Land cover areas obtained from unadjusted classifiers with unbalanced misclassification between different classes could result in erroneously identifying trends. The aim of our work is to describe a novel approach to obtaining LUCC maps with balanced misclassification errors and therefore unbiased predicted areas for each class. We achieve this by numerically minimizing the differences between area proportions obtained with unbiased statistical reference estimates, which is measured by a quantity we refer to as the Sum of Squared Class Unbalancedness (SSCU). We assess the proposed methods in the context of land cover classification with support vector machine classifiers at four points in time between 1975 and 2010 in the Maipo river basin (Central Chile) based on Landsat imagery. In this study, the optimization reduced the SSCU (theta) by 94% on average compared to unadjusted classification. The classifier adjustment also slightly increased the accuracy of the resulting LUCC maps. The amount of bias in classified land cover area and the degree of unbalancedness of misclassification errors differed among the land cover classes. Agricultural land showed the largest reduction in mean relative differences from 27% to 2% compared to the unbiased statistical area estimates. The greatest increase in User\'s Accuracy was obtained for urban land cover in 1999, where an increase from 56% to 85% was achieved. Qualitative improvements in the classification were visible in difficult classification areas such as dry floodplains. The proposed method is especially recommended for studies that aim to provide multitemporal comparisons. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

However, the potential of kernel-based regression techniques for quantitatively analyzing urban composition has not yet been fully explored. To a great extent, this can be explained by difficulties in deriving quantitative training information that reliably represents pairs of spectral signatures with associated land cover fractions needed for empirical modeling. In this paper we present an approach to circumvent this limitation by combining support vector regression (SVR) with synthetically mixed training data to map sub-pixel fractions of single urban land cover categories of interest. This approach was tested on Hyperspectral Mapper (HyMap) data acquired over Berlin, Germany. Fraction estimates were validated with extensive manual mappings and compared to fractions derived from multiple, endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA). Our regression results demonstrate that the sets of multiple mixtures yielded high accuracies for quantitative estimates for four spectrally complex urban land cover types, i.e., fractions of impervious rooftops and pavements, as well as grass- and tree-covered areas. Despite the extrapolation uncertainty of SVR, which resulted in fraction values below 0% and above 100%, physically meaningful model outputs were reported for a clear majority of pixels, and visual inspection underpinned the quality of produced fraction maps. Statistical accuracy assessment with detailed reference information for 92 urban blocks showed linear relations with R-2 values of 0.86, 0.58, 0.81 and 0.85 for the four categories, respectively. Mean absolute errors (MAE) ranged from 6.4 to 12.8% and block-wise sums of the four individually modeled category fractions were always around 100%. Results of MESMA followed similar trends, but with slightly lower accuracies. Our findings demonstrate that the combination of SVR and synthetically mixed training data enable the use of empirical regression for sub-pixel mapping. Thus, the strengths of kernel-based approaches for quantifying urban land cover from imaging spectrometer data can be well utilized. Remaining uncertainties and limitations Were related to the known phenomena of spectral similarity or ambiguity of urban materials, the spectral deficiencies in shaded areas, or the dependency on comprehensive and representative spectral libraries. Therefore, the suggested workflow constitutes a new flexible and extendable universal modeling approach to map land cover fractions. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The aim is to assess the performance of the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) normalised water-leaving reflectance (rho(w)), aerosol and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) products from the 2nd and 3rd reprocessing as well as the case 2 Regional (C2R) processor. Confidence flags indicated that the ocean colour products from the 2nd reprocessing were not reliable over the sampling site during the study period. Standard MERIS rho(w) products from the 3rd reprocessing gave good returns from 490 to 560 nm, with absolute percentage difference (APD) of 10-16%, whilst underestimations in the red ranged from 124 to 215% compared to in situ data. Adjacency correction with the improved contrast between ocean and land (ICOL) processor leads to a decrease in APD. The C2R gave mostly low correlation coefficient values with a positive bias; APD ranged from 9 to 13% in the blue, whilst the poorest performing waveband was 620 nm with an APD of 67% compared to in situ data. The 3rd reprocessing with ICOL correction Angstrom exponent showed the best correlation (R-2 = 0.951) with in situ data. The Chl-a product for case 1 waters from the 3rd reprocessing, Algal1, had the best agreement with in situ data, with a correlation coefficient of 0.796 and an APD of 54%. The Algal2 and C2R Chl-a products had low correlation coefficients and APD ranging from 72 to 103%. A dynamic per pixel classification technique for applying optimal MERIS Chl-a algorithms in the KwaZulu-Natal Bight or similar south-east African water types is described and evaluated in conjunction with the MERIS fluorescence line height product.

By combining the benefits of location-specific mixture models with standardized spectral indices, standardized mixture models offer consistency, simplicity, inclusivity and applicability. We construct a globally representative mixing space using a spectrally diverse collection of 100 Landsat ETM+ (Thematic Mapper 8: Enhanced Thematic Mapper+) subscenes. Global composites of 100,000,000 Landsat spectra, constructed from both exoatmospheric reflectance and atmospherically corrected surface reflectance, represent the spectral diversity of a wide range of terrestrial environments. Principal Component (PC) Analysis of the global composite shows that 99% of the spectral variance can be represented in a 3-dimensional mixing space of the low order PCs. Within this 3D space 98% of spectra are contained within a tetrahedral hull bounded by a continuous plane of substrates, and well-defined apexes corresponding to vegetation and dark endmembers. Suites of individual substrate, vegetation and dark endmember spectra are used to derive mean endmembers and to quantify the effects of endmember variability on fractions estimated from a standardized Substrate, Vegetation, and Dark (SVD) linear mixture model. Maximum endmember variability introduces less than 0.05 difference in S, V, and D fractions for most SVD models constructed from individual pixel endmember spectra giving less than 0.05 model misfit for more than 97% of pixels in the global composite. The mean SVD endmembers define a standard global mixture model for Landsat spectra. These SVD endmembers can be used to model mixed reflectance spectra from other sensors with similar spectral responses to Landsat ETM+. Comparisons of endmember fractions estimated from coincident acquisitions of Landsat TM and ETM + and WorldView-2 imagery show strong linear scaling for vegetation and dark fractions. Substrate fractions do not scale as linearly for the urban validation sites because the Landsat substrate endmember does not accurately represent the impervious surfaces imaged by World View-2. Comparisons of Landsat and WorldView-2 unmixed with the same Visible-Near Infrared (VNIR) endmembers derived from the global Landsat endmembers are also strongly correlated but with reduced bias. This linear scaling suggests that the Landsat global endmembers may provide a basis for standardized mixture models for WorldView-2 and other broadband sensors with spectral response similar to Landsat TM and ETM+. Comparisons of vegetation fractions with vegetation indices for the global composite show strong linear correspondence for Tasseled Cap Greenness and Enhanced Vegetation Index, with some degree of saturation at high fractions for the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index and a wide range of responses for the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index.

CBD locations play a decisive role in the spatial arrangement of functions and exposures within cities. However, while past research underscores the importance of their spatial detection, delineation and cartographic representation, the definitions used are mostly functional and qualitative. Objective pre-defined methods/thresholds for the semi-automated spatial classification of CBDs, based on a quantitative approach, do not yet exist. This paper presents,a conceptual framework to define the CBD using physical and morphological parameters, and tests the approach using 3-D city models of three European test sites (Canary Wharf in London, La Defense in Paris, and Levent in Istanbul). From these case studies, we develop a transferable method to detect and delineate CBDs over larger areas from a combination of Cartosat-1 digital surface models and multispectral Landsat ETM+ imagery. Applying this wide-area method to the entire extents of the three European megacities of London, Paris and Istanbul, we detect CBDs with a user accuracy of 75.7% and spatially delineate them with overall accuracies of 82.9%. Finally, we apply spatial metrics to analyze and compare the location and distribution of CBDs across the three mega cities, finding many similarities between London and Paris, but showing that Istanbul features a more complex urban footprint, and a different spatial CBD pattern.

Monitoring volcanoes with any single sensor system can only provide a limited perspective on the nature of such activity because of trade-offs between spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. Spaceborne observations of volcanoes are thus optimized by utilizing data from different and complementary sensing instruments. This study examines the combined use of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) for analyzing thermal anomalies from four separate volcanoes: Erta \'Ale (Ethiopia), Kilauea (Hawai\'i), Lascar (Chile) and Kliuchevskoi (Russia). MODIS provides a high temporal resolution (daily) but low spatial resolution (similar to 1 km) dataset and is used to measure volcanic thermal radiance. ASTER provides relatively high spatial resolution (similar to 90 m) image data and is used to define the size of thermal features, albeit at a poorer temporal frequency. Erta \'Ale and Kilauea have been erupting continuously over the 11-year study period and their thermal emission signatures reveal a persistent baseline on which occasional increases in thermal output, associated with more profuse effusions of lava, are superimposed. Kliuchevskoi also displays occasional peaks in thermal activity due to the eruption of lava however intervening periods are characterized by weak or absent thermal anomalies. Lascar, on the other hand, provides an example of volcanic activity that is difficult for MODIS-type sensors to detect. It is characterized by fumarolic activity that is too low in temperature and too spatially limited to be readily detectable with its coarser instantaneous field of view (i.e., pixel size). However, high resolution data from ASTER can be used to supplement and complement the MODIS dataset Beyond characterizing the size of thermal anomalies ASTER can also provide constraints on their shape, location and orientation and is capable of detecting relatively subtle thermal anomalies given its high spatial resolution thermal infrared wavebands. These qualities permitted the identification of a thermal precursor to lava flows at Kliuchevskoi. The precursor, which was associated with a rising lava lake, is characterized as an increase in the size and intensity of ASTER-detected thermal anomalies situated in the active crater. Wavelet analysis of the MODIS dataset was also carried out. This revealed the time scales over which radiant output waxed and waned during individual eruptive episodes as well as the repose time between episodes. Such information might be useful in forecasting the likely duration and onset of future eruptions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Murphy, S. W.; Souza Filho, C.

A novel snow depth/water equivalent (SWE) data retrieval algorithm from passive microwave brightness temperature is proposed based on a priori snow characteristics, including the grain size, density and temperature of the layered snowpack. The layering scheme was established based on the brightness temperature difference (TBD) at two different frequencies, which indicates volume scattering, whereas the snow grain size and density of each layer were parameterized according to the age of the snow cover, and the snow temperature and temperature at the snow/soil interface were determined by the air temperature and snow depth. Furthermore, the microwave emission model of layered snowpacks (MEMLS) was used to simulate the brightness temperature at 10 GHz, 18 GHz and 36 GHz based on the a priori snow characteristics including snow grain size, density, depth and snow layering. Finally, three look-up tables (one layer, two layers and three layers) were generated for each day, which represent the relationship between the brightness temperatures at 10 GHz, 18 GHz and 36 GHz and snow depth. To avoid underestimation caused by the saturation of the microwave signal at 36 GHz, the TBD1 (the difference of brightness temperature at 18 and 36 GHz) was used to estimate the snow depth if TBD1 was less than 40 K, and TBD2 (the difference of the brightness temperature at 10 and 18 GHz) was used if TBD1 was greater than 40 K. The snow depth and SWE determined by this new algorithm were validated by snow measurements at thirteen meteorological stations in Xinjiang, China from 2003 to 2010 and compared with existing SWE products from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), the Environmental and Ecological Science Data Center for West China (WESTDC), the European Space Agency (ESA) and measurements with a snow course. The results showed that the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the bias from this new algorithm were greatly reduced compared to NSIDC, moderately reduced compared to ESA and slightly reduced compared to WESTDC. The understanding of a priori local snow characteristics can improve the accuracy of snow depth and snow water equivalent estimation from passive microwave remote sensing data. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Recently cloud-free imagery useful for tropical forest mapping from the Phased Array Type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) has become available. We used PALSAR 50-m orthorectified mosaic imagery in 2009 and a decision tree method to conduct land cover classification and generate a 2009 forest map, which was evaluated using 2106 field photos from the Global Geo-referenced Field Photo Library (http://www.eomf.ou.edu/photos). The resulting land cover classification had a high overall accuracy of 93.3% and a Kappa Coefficient of 0.9. The PALSAR-based forest map was then compared with three existing forest cover products at three scales (regional, national, and continental): the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Forest Resources Assessments (FRA) 2010, Global Land Cover Map with MERIS (GlobCover) 2009, and the MODIS Terra + Aqua land Cover Type product (MCD12Q1) 2009. The intercomparison results show that these four forest datasets differ. The PALSAR-based forest area estimate is within the range (6.1-9.0 x 10(5) km(2)) of the other three products and closest to the FAO FRA 2010 estimate. The spatial disagreements of the PALSAR-based forest, MCD12Q1 forest and GlobCover forest are evident: however, the PALSAR-based forest map provides more details (50-m spatial resolution) and high accuracy (the Producer\'s and the User\'s Accuracies were 88% and 95%, respectively) and PALSAR can be used to evaluate MCD12Q1 2009 and GlobCover 2009 forest maps. Given the higher spatial resolution, PALSAR-based forest products could further improve the modeling accuracy of carbon cycle in tropical forests. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In situ snow measurements of water equivalent, depth and density collected from field surveys during 1996-2004 snow seasons were collocated with gridded SSM/I brightness temperatures. Sub-grid lake fraction was computed from a high-resolution land cover map derived from LANDSAT imagery. Another dataset was created consisting of multi-year time series of SSM/I and AMSR-E brightness temperatures and computed lake fraction. Consistent with other studies, it was found that lake fraction was negatively correlated with in situ snow depth and snow water equivalent and positively correlated with snow density, which indicates that lakes have a direct effect on snow cover distribution: They accumulate less but denser snow than surrounding land areas. Additionally, lake fraction was positively correlated with the brightness temperature measurements at 18 GHz and above, but negatively correlated with the AMSR-E brightness temperatures at low frequency channels (6 and 10 GHz), with the highest correlation values for the SSM/I (r = 0.57) and AMSR-E (r = 0.65) at 37 GHz dominating the response. Brightness temperature-based lake fraction algorithms were derived using stepwise regression. Performance assessment showed that the AMSR-E algorithm was superior to the SSM/I algorithm due to the use of the low frequency measurements not available from the SSM/I instrument. Combined lake fraction- and SSM/I brightness temperature-based snow depth and snow water equivalent algorithms were also derived using stepwise regression, with improved performance compared to conventional brightness temperature-based algorithms.

They are common features emanating from parasitic vents on the flanks of polygenetic volcanoes and in dominantly \'flat-lying\' intraplate volcanic fields. The Auckland Volcanic Field (AVF) is a volcanic field that has been active for the last ca. 250 ka, hosting at least 50 monogenetic volcanoes. Morphometric parameters of lava flows, such as volume, length, thickness and area, were used to quantify the potential lava-flow inundation susceptibility to New Zealand\'s most densely populated area, the City of Auckland based on an airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) Digital Surface Model (DSM). The morphometric parameters of fifteen studied flows included: average length of 2.5 km (range 0.7-6.5 km), overall average thickness of 14.8 m (range 3.4-43.8 m), average of maximum thicknesses of 48.2 m (range 18.3-180.5 m), average area occupied of 5.1 km(2) (range 0.4-25.1 km(2)) and average volume of 0.12 km(3) (range 0.005-1 km(3)). Based on these parameters and a LiDAR-derived DSM, the present topography was classified into: sea, topographic depressions; low-lying areas prone to inundation by an average lava flow; buffer zones prone to inundation only by extremely thick lava flows; and peaks or ridges, which are unlikely to be overtopped. In monogenetic fields, each new vent occurs in a new location, creating uncertainty around the spatial location of the volcanic hazard. Thus, this research provides a general vent location-independent approach to describe the lava flow susceptibility for a potentially active monogenetic volcanic field. What this analysis reveals is that the City of Auckland can be divided into two distinct areas with strongly different susceptibility to lava flow inundation. The southern part of the City is predominantly flat, without hindrance to lava flow, whereas the hilly northern and central part has many ridges that can limit or channelise lavas. These contrasting properties must be accounted for in scenario-based or probabilistic hazard and risk models developed for the AVF. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) deformation images, InSAR coherence maps, SAR backscattering intensity images, and a DEM gradient map are combined to detect active landslides by setting individual thresholds. More than 50 active landslides covering a total of about 40 km(2) area are detected. Then the short baseline subsets (SBAS) InSAR method is applied to retrieve time-series deformation patterns of individual detected landslides. Down-slope landslide motions observed from adjacent satellite tracks with slightly different radar look angles are used to verify InSAR results and measurement accuracy. Comparison of the landslide motion with the precipitation record suggests that the landslide deformation correlates with the rainfall rate, with a lag time of around 1-2 months between the precipitation peak and the maximum landslide displacement. The results will provide new insights into landslide mechanisms in the Pacific Northwest, and facilitate development of early warning systems for landslides under abnormal rainfall conditions. Additionally, this method will allow identification of active landslides in broad areas of the Pacific Northwest in an efficient and systematic manner, including remote and heavily vegetated areas difficult to inventory by traditional methods.

For the segmentation approach, image processing techniques are developed to extract information about the spatial features of the ITCZ in both hemispheres for each satellite image. These features serve as input to a temporal classification algorithm that is based on a combination of hidden semi Markov model (HsMM) and support vector machine (SVM) methods. The performance of the proposed method is competitive with human experts and the methodology can thus be used to conduct an in-depth analysis of the dITCZ. Such an analysis could provide precise information for refining existing weather and climate models over the sparsely observed east Pacific where the dITCZ is greatly over-represented in most models.

Therefore, it is important to know how the lake carbon content has changed over the last decades. In situ long time data series about the amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in lakes are rare. The only potential way to study retrospectively the changes in lake carbon over the last decades is by means of remote sensing data provided there are sensors that can provide data about coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in lakes over long periods. Landsat data archive contains images from 1984 to nowadays and covers the whole Earth. Although the sensors were not designed for remote sensing of aquatic environments it is still tempting to utilise the long data series. Landsat 4, Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 imagery available in free Landsat image archive was compared with time series of CDOM in situ data from 19 sampling stations available in the Swedish University of Natural Sciences lake monitoring database. There was no correlation between the image and in situ data when all the above mentioned data were used. Low radiometric resolution of the sensor, small size of many lakes (= large adjacency effects) and high concentration of CDOM (negligible water leaving radiation) could be the reasons. The results were more promising (R-2 = 0.62) when Lake Malaren stations were analysed separately. The lake is sufficiently large and with variable, but not extremely high. CDOM content. The Lake Malaren in situ data showed very different trends in CDOM concentrations in different basins of the lake over the last 45 years. Although the correlation between the image and in situ data was a bit low for accurate daily estimation of CDOM concentrations from Landsat data it could allow detecting general trends in lake CDOM content. Unfortunately, there is currently a gap in Landsat archive (for our study sites) between 1988 and 1998 which makes calculations of long time trends unreasonable for the time being.

A simple approach is to use a regression model to estimate crop LAI from a vegetation index derived from optical remote sensing data. However, variations of interference factors in the signal path could induce variations in spectral reflectance, leading to uncertainty in LAI estimation. A semi-empirical equation was implemented to estimate green LAI of field crops from Landsat-5/7 data using a few vegetation indices, including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), the two band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) and the modified triangular vegetation index (MTVI2). Data were collected during several growing seasons, from 1999 to 2006, over corn, soybean, and spring wheat fields in an experimental farm in Ottawa (ON, Canada). LAI estimated for corn, soybean and wheat from Landsat data using the vegetation indices was compared to ground LAI. Except for NDVI, comparable results were obtained from the other three vegetation indices, with a coefficient of determination above 0.83 and a root mean square error (RMSE) not more than 0.60. The performance of NDVI was less satisfactory (RMSE>0.66). The uncertainties in LAI estimation induced by variations in soil reflectance, leaf optical properties. canopy structure, and atmospheric conditions were assessed through a global sensitivity analyses using the PROSPECT leaf model coupled to the SAIL canopy model along with the 6S atmospheric transmission model. The sensitivity analyses show that different indices are affected differently by the various interference factors. Comparatively, NDVI is the most influenced by leaf chlorophyll but the least affected by leaf inclination. OSAVI and the narrow band MTVI2 are more efficient in reducing soil effects, and EVI2 has a better performance in reducing aerosol perturbation. At high LAI, the uncertainty of NDVI is the smallest, but the uncertainty propagated to LAI estimation is the largest due to saturation. In this case, vegetation indices that are less prone to saturation should be considered, such as EVI2 and MTVI2. When MTVI2 is used on multispectral data, its ability to reduce soil and leaf chlorophyll perturbation is similar to EVI2 but weaker than when it is used on hyperspectral data. These results show that vegetation indices can be used in a simple regression model to generate baseline green LAI product for seasonal crop growth monitoring, however it is important to be aware of the sources of uncertainty and their relative amplitudes when using the product.

With nearly 40 years of continuous observation - since launch of the first satellite in 1972 - the Landsat program has benefited from insightful technical specification, robust engineering, and the necessary infrastructure for data archive and dissemination. Chiefly, the spatial and spectral resolutions have proven of broad utility and have remained largely stable over the life of the program. The foresighted acquisition and maintenance of a global image archive has proven to be of unmatched value, providing a window into the past and fueling the monitoring and modeling of global land cover and ecological change. In this paper we discuss the evolution of the Landsat program as a global monitoring mission, highlighting in particular the recent change to an open (free) data policy. The new data policy is revolutionizing the use of Landsat data, spurring the creation of robust standard products and new science and applications approaches. Open data access also promotes increased international collaboration to meet the Earth observing needs of the 21st century. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

The theoretical upper boundary condition of TTME is determined by solving for temperatures of the driest bare surface (T-s,T-max) and the driest fully vegetated surface (T-c,T-max) both implicit in radiation budget and energy balance equations. Air temperature (T-a) constitutes the lower boundary of TTME. T-rad of a pixel within the f(c)-T-rad space is decomposed into temperature components (T-c and T-s) by interpolating the slope of the theoretical boundaries and interpreting variation in T-rad with f(c) for each isopiestic line going across the pixel. Vegetation transpiration and soil surface evaporation are then separately parameterized. TTME was applied to the Soil Moisture-Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (SMACEX) site in central Iowa, U.S., on three days in 2002 during the period of rapid growth in corn and soybean when three scenes of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images and one scene of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) image were acquired. Results indicate that TTME is capable of reproducing latent heat flux (LE) with a mean absolute percentage difference (MAPD) of similar to 10%, and a root mean square difference (RMSD) of 45.6 W m(-2) and 63.1 W m(-2) for Landsat TM/ETM+ and ASTER images, respectively. Comparison of TTME with other one-source and two-source models using the same data set suggests that TTME shows comparable accuracy as the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB), but requires relatively fewer inputs and obviates the computation of resistance networks in the modeling domain and the overestimation of vegetation transpiration incurred by using the Priestley-Taylor equation. Sensitivity analysis suggests that TTME is most sensitive to T-rad and T-a, but not sensitive to a range of meteorological observations and variables and parameters derived/specified.

However, it is usually underestimated by existing algorithms due to surface conditions, especially in case of young ice types. Evaluation of those algorithms identifies errors in concentration estimates but does not necessarily link them to the adverse surface conditions. The present study is an attempt to establish those links for young ice (<25 cm) thick It uses measurements of microwave emission from artificially grown sea ice in an outdoor tank and calculates ice concentration using five established algorithms: NT, Bootstrap (BSA), NT2, ASI and ECICE. Since the actual concentration is known (100%), then any deviation from this value is considered an error and can be linked to the observed surface conditions, which are usually caused by weather events. Those conditions were acquired on hourly or daily basis. Results identify key conditions that lead to underestimation of ice concentration. They include surface refreezing, slush, snow settling following fresh snowfall, and falling precipitation in different forms. The study shows also that NT and NT2 are most affected by surface processes while BSA performs better. ASI is much less affected because it uses the high frequency channel (e.g. SSM/I 85 GHz), which is sensitive only to processes within the top snow layer. ECICE, with its probabilistic and ensemble approach shows also good results under most surface conditions. Dry or wet snow does not lead to significant difference in ice concentration estimate. The study also aims at validation of ECICE. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Shokr, Mohammed] Environm Canada, Sci & Technol Branch, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada.

SLSTR is planned for launch in 2013 on Sentinel-3, with two concurrently operating satellites planned for daily global coverage. Here we review the aspects of the SLSTR instrument design specifically targeted at biomass burning events, including operation of the SWIR channels at night and the inclusion of low-gain middle infrared and thermal IR channels that will minimise saturation over even high intensity fires. We detail the active fire detection and fire radiative power dataset to be provided from these SLSTR observations, which will be part of the SLSTR land product suite aimed at supporting both Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) operational services and scientific applications. We describe in detail the pre-launch active fire product algorithm, which uses data from the SLSTR near-nadir scan. The algorithm detects pixels containing actively burning fires, and uses the MIR radiance method to estimate their fire radiative power (FRP). We test the algorithm using a series of EOS MODIS scenes covering a range of fire-affected forest and savannah environments, comparing performance to that of the existing MODIS MOD14 \'Fire and Thermal Anomaly\' products. Across 385 scenes covering Africa, South America and Australia, we find that the SLSTR algorithm applied to MODIS data detects in total 20% more fire pixels than does the MOD14 algorithm applied to the same data. Some scenes show very large differences, while others showed no differences, and some of the extra detections made by SLSTR maybe false alarms. For a better evaluation, we use the simultaneous high spatial resolution active fire detections made from ASTER to provide an independent accuracy assessment. Across 45 separate geographical regions covered simultaneously by ASTER and MODIS, we find that the SLSTR algorithm in fact detects 13% more correctly identified clusters of active fire pixels than the MOD14 algorithm, and that these contain 36% more active fire pixels. In particular, the SLSTR algorithm shows increased detection probabilities at small/low FRP fires, mainly due to the more liberal characteristics of its potential fire pixel detection stage. This performance enhancement comes, however, at the expense of a small (<2%) increase in commission error (i.e. false alarm rate) when compared to MOD14. The SLSTR algorithms ability to better detect low FRP fires maybe important, since these are usually the most common component of a region\'s fire regime. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In situ optical instruments, i.e. hemispherical photography and a SunScan device, were used to acquire ground LAI measurements. Spectral vegetation indices (Vls) extracted from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM +) and Systeme Probatoire d\'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) reflectance data were used, along with mean annual precipitation (MAP), as explanatory variables of LAI variation. The results indicate that LAI significantly increases with increasing MAP for woody biomes. Implementing long-term MAP as a second predictor variable into the VI-LAI models significantly improved LAI predictions by up to 10% using the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI 2) and 2-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI 2). Varying forest disturbances and agricultural management practises may have contributed to observed discrepancies of LAI with MAP across biomes. The importance of altitudinal gradients is yet to be explained fully with more study required. However, LAI appears to be higher in low-altitude forests compared to forests at higher altitudes. Our results indicate that SPOT and Landsat-derived Vls, in combination with long-term MAP, may be a suitable tool to develop landscape maps of LAI in Eastern Africa. This study also presents the in situ LAI measurements for further validation of global products for areas that are currently under-represented in Earth Observation (EO) global validation networks.

The results show it is possible to accurately estimate the wavelength of spectral absorption features to an RMSE of +/- 3.8 nm in the 2000-2500 nm spectral region over multiple sampling intervals and resolutions in sensors with signal-to-noise greater than 500:1.

GOSAT short-wave infrared (SWIR) radiance spectra detected over the ocean surface were shown to be strongly affected by atmospheric light-scattering. In particular, retrievals of column-averaged CO2 dry-volume mixing ratios (XCO2) were characterised by steady negative bias and significant scatter when optical path modification due to high variability of clouds and aerosols was neglected. Considering that the ocean surface in SWIR is dark in all directions except that of sun-glint observation, PPDF radiative transfer modelling was simplified by neglecting the contribution of photons that interacted with both aerosols/cloud particles and the ocean surface. This permitted implementation of an atmospheric correction technique based on simultaneous retrievals of CO2 concentrations and two PPDF parameters: effective altitude of the aerosol layer and relative layer reflectivity. Using this correction, both bias and scatter of carbon dioxide retrievals were significantly reduced. The retrieval results of XCO2 statistically agreed (both spatially and temporally) with those predicted by the atmospheric transport model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Detailed physical snow measurements within the radiometer footprints were made to relate the microwave signatures to the seasonal evolution of the snowpack, and provide inputs for model simulations with the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) snow emission model. Large differences in depth, density, and grain size were observed between the three land cover types. Plot-scale simulations with the HUT model showed a wide range in simulation accuracy between sites and frequencies. In general, model performance degraded when the effective grain size exceeded 2 mm and/or there was an ice lens present in the pack. HUT model performance improved when simulations were run regionally at the satellite scale (using three proportional land cover tiles: open, forest, and lake) and compared to Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) measurements. Root mean square error (RMSE) values ranged from approximately 4 to 16 K depending on the frequency, polarization, and land cover composition of the grid cell. Snow water equivalent (SWE) retrievals produced using forward T-B simulations with the HUT model in combination with AMSR-E measurements produced RMSE values below 25 mm for the intensive study area. Retrieval errors exceeded 50 mm when the scheme was applied regionally. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Potential synergies between VSWIR and TIR data are explored using analogous airborne data acquired over the Santa Barbara metropolitan region in June, 2008. These data were analyzed at both their native spatial resolutions (7.5 m VSWIR and 15 m TIR), and aggregated 60 m spatial resolution similar to HyspIRI. A spectral library of dominant urban materials (e.g., grass, trees, soil, roof types, roads) was developed from field and airborne-measured spectra using Multiple-Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) and used to map fractions of impervious, soil, green vegetation (CV, e.g., trees, lawn) and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV). Land Surface Temperature (LST) and emissivity were also retrieved from the airborne data. Co-located pixels from the VSWIR and TIR airborne data were used to generate reflectance/emissivity spectra for a subset of urban materials. MESMA was used to map GV, NPV, soil and impervious fractions at the different spatial resolutions and compare the fractional estimates across spatial scales. Important surface energy parameters, including albedo, vegetation cover fraction, broadband emissivity and surface temperature were also determined for and evaluated for 14 urban and natural land-cover classes in the region. Fractions were validated using 1 m digital photography.   Fractions for GV and NPV were highly correlated with validation fractions at all spatial scales, producing a near 1:1 relationship but with a <10% overestimate of CV from MESMA. Similar, high correlations were observed for impervious surfaces, although impervious was significantly underestimated in most urban areas and soil overestimated. Comparison of fractions across scales showed high correlation between CV and NPV at 7.5 and 60 m resolution, suggesting that HyspIRI will provide accurate measures of these two measures in urban areas. An inverse relationship between vegetation cover and LST was observed. Albedo proved to be highly variable and poorly correlated with LST. Broadband emissivity was far less variable with high emissivity surfaces (similar to 0.95) including vegetation, water and asphalt, and low emissivity surfaces (<0.95) including selected roof types, beach sands and senesced grasslands. Residential and commercial areas showed a general pattern of increasing LST with increasing impervious fraction with the highest impervious fractions mapped in commercial areas, roads and roofs. Fine scale spatial structure in cover fractions and LST demonstrated important departures from a simple inverse relationship between CV and LST, even at 60 m. The results demonstrate the utility of HyspIRI data for urban studies and provide an insight of what will be possible on a global scale when HyspIRI data become available. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Using SPOT-5 data from 2005 to 2009, impervious surface was estimated at a subpixel level for the area of Can Tho province in the Mekong Delta, based on a Support Vector Regression model. Training data comprised a set of SPOT-5 reflectance values each associated with an individual value of subpixel imperviousness as their respective labels. The latter were obtained on the basis of a land cover map, which in turn was derived from a pansharpened QB subset by means of an object-oriented image classification approach. In addition, by varying different sets of training data in the model building process the spectral interrelationships between the urban land cover classes (water, bare soil, vegetation, and impervious surface) and their effect on the estimation of subpixel imperviousness could be examined. In order to exclude irrelevant areas (natural/undeveloped land) from the impervious surface estimation process, single-polarised TerraSAR-X data were used to delineate settlement areas by an object-oriented image classification approach. Furthermore, a change detection method was applied for the respective time period in order to test the suitability of the approach for the automated detection of structural developments within the urban topography. Settlement areas were correctly identified with overall accuracies between 81% and 94%, whilst the comparison of the modelled impervious estimates to the training values gave an absolute mean error below 15%. The results prove the suitability of the approach for an area-wide but selective mapping and monitoring of impervious surface cover within settlement areas only. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Various methods have been developed based on temporal trajectory analysis to characterize, classify and detect changes in ecosystem dynamics. Although time series similarity measures play an important role in these methods, a quantitative comparison of the similarity measures is lacking. The objective of this study was to provide an overview and quantitative comparison of the similarity measures in function of varying time series and ecosystem characteristics, such as amplitude, timing and noise effects. For this purpose, the performance was evaluated for the commonly used similarity measures (D), ranging from Manhattan (D-Man), Euclidean (D-E) and Mahalanobis (D-Mah) distance measures, to correlation (D-CC), Principal Component Analysis (PCA; D-PCA) and Fourier based (D-FFT,D-xi, D-Fk) similarities. The quantitative comparison consists of a series of Monte-Carlo simulations based on subsets of global MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) data. Results of the simulations reveal four main groups of time series similarity measures with different sensitivities: (i) D-Man, D-E, D-PCA. D-Fk quantify the difference in time series values, (ii) D-Mah accounts for temporal correlation and non-stationarity of variance, (iii) D-CC measures the temporal correlation, and (iv) the Fourier based D-FFT and D-xi show their specific sensitivity based on the selected Fourier components. The difference measures show relatively the highest sensitivity to amplitude effects, whereas the correlation based measures are highly sensitive to variations in timing and noise. The Fourier based measures, finally, depend highly on the signal to noise ratio and the balance between amplitude and phase dominance. The heterogeneity in sensitivity of each D stresses the importance of (i) understanding the time series characteristics before applying any classification of change detection approach and (ii) defining the variability one wants to identify/account for. This requires an understanding of the ecosystem dynamics and time series characteristics related to the baseline, amplitude, timing, noise and variability of the ecosystem time series. This is also illustrated in the quantitative comparison, where the different sensitivities of D for the NDVI, EVI, and LAI data relate specifically to the temporal characteristics of each data set. Additionally, the effect of noise and intra- and interclass variability is demonstrated in a case study based on land cover classification. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We develop a population-based statistical framework to examine how the spatial unit chosen affects the outcome of an accuracy assessment. The population is conceptualized as a difference map created by overlaying a complete coverage reference classification and the target map being evaluated. The per-class areas of agreement and disagreement derived from this population are summarized by a population error matrix and accuracy parameters (e.g., overall, user\'s and producer\'s accuracies). The population and values of the accuracy parameters are strongly affected by the protocols implemented for the response design which include the choice of spatial unit, how within-unit homogeneity is addressed when assigning class labels, and the definition of agreement between the reference and map classification. Several complete coverage populations are used to illustrate how accuracy results are affected by the spatial unit chosen for the assessment and also to evaluate how spatial misregistration of the map and reference locations impacts accuracy results for different spatial units. The sampling design implemented for accuracy assessment does not change the population or values of the accuracy parameters, but the choice of spatial unit will influence decisions regarding use of strata and clusters in the design. A universally best spatial assessment unit does not exist, so it is critical to recognize how the population, values of the accuracy parameters, and sampling design are impacted by the choice of spatial unit.

As well as our previous version (Zege et al., 2008, 1998), the new algorithm is based on the analytical solution for snow reflectance within the asymptotic radiative transfer theory. The SGSP algorithm does not use any assumptions on snow grain shape and allows for the snow pack bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). The algorithm includes a new atmospheric correction procedure that allows for snow BRDF. This SGSP algorithm has been thoroughly validated with computer simulations. Its sensitivity to the atmosphere model has been investigated. It is shown that the inaccuracy of the snow characteristic retrieval due to the uncertainty in the aerosol and molecular atmosphere model is negligible, as compared to that due to the measurement errors at least for aerosol loads typical for polar regions. The significant advantage of the SGSP over conventional algorithms, which use a priori assumptions about particle shape and (or) not allow for the BRDF of the individual snow pack, is that the developed retrieval still works at low sun elevations, which are typical for polar regions.

(2001) and Devred et al. (2006a). The total phytoplankton absorption coefficient at multiple wavelengths is expressed as the weighted sum of the absorption coefficients of each class at those wavelengths. The resultant system of equations is solved under some constraints to derive the fraction of each class present in any given sample of seawater, given the spectrum of total phytoplankton absorption coefficient. When applied to a large database, the results compare well with phytoplankton size-classes derived from pigment composition, so that we can assume that the three phytoplankton classes derived from absorption coefficients are representative of the pico-, nano- and microphytoplankton size classes. A modification is proposed to the pigment-based phytoplankton size classification of Uitz et al. (2006) to account for the effect of fucoxanthin associated with nanophytoplankton. Comparison between satellite and in situ data demonstrates the potential of satellite ocean-color data to yield the distribution of phytoplankton size classes from space. The algorithm is applied to phytoplankton absorption coefficients derived from remotely-sensed reflectance values collected by SeaWiFS over the Northwest Atlantic in 2007. Monthly composites for April. August and November, representative of Spring, Summer and Fall, give synoptic views of the phytoplankton community structure: a Spring bloom dominated by microphytoplankton is followed by a second, less intense, bloom in the Fall dominated by nanophytoplankton.

However, vegetation also contains a series of trace elements which present unique narrowband spectral emission lines in the visible and near infrared wavelength range when the biomass is heated to high temperatures during the process of flaming combustion. These spectral lines can be discriminated by detector systems that are less costly than the longer wavelength, actively cooled instruments more typically used in EO-based active fire studies. The main trace element resulting in the appearance of spectral emission lines appears to be potassium (K), with features at 766.5 nm and 769.9 nm. Here we study K-emission line spectral signature in laboratory scale fires using a field spectrometer, at a series of moderately-sized woodland and shrubland fires using airborne imagery from a new compact hyperspectral imager (HYPER-SIM.GA) operating at a relatively fine spectral sampling interval (1.2 nm), and at large open wildfires using the EO-1 satellite\'s Hyperion sensor. We derive a metric based on band differencing of the spectral signal both close to and outside of the K-line region in order to quantify the magnitude of the K-emission signature, and find that variations in this metric appear to track quite well with the commonly used measures of fire radiometric temperature and fire radiative power (FRP). We find that substantial flaming activity is required to generate a potassium emission signature, but that once present this can be detected using airborne remote sensing even through a substantial smoke layer that apparently obscures fire across the remainder of the VIS spectral range. Being specific to flaming combustion, detection of the K-emission line signature could prove useful in refining estimates of the gases released in open wildfires, since trace gas emission factors can vary substantially between flaming and smouldering stages. Finally, we demonstrate the first identification of the K-emission line signature from space using the EO-1 Hyperion instrument, but find it detectable only in certain instances. We conclude that a finer spectral and spatial resolution than that offered by Hyperion is required for improved detection performance. Nevertheless, our results point to the potential effectiveness of airborne and spaceborne K-emission signature detection as a complement to the more common thermal remote sensing approaches to wildfire detection and analysis. Sensors targeting this application should consider careful placement of the measurement wavelengths around the location of the K-line wavelengths, in part to minimise influences from the nearby oxygen A-band features.

In this study, we have further improved the ET algorithm in Mu et al. (2007a, hereafter called old algorithm) by 1) simplifying the calculation of vegetation cover fraction; 2) calculating ET as the sum of daytime and nighttime components; 3) adding soil heat flux calculation; 4) improving estimates of stomatal conductance, aerodynamic resistance and boundary layer resistance; 5) separating dry canopy surface from the wet; and 6) dividing soil surface into saturated wet surface and moist surface. We compared the improved algorithm with the old one both globally and locally at 46 eddy flux towers. The global annual total ET over the vegetated land surface is 62.8 x 10(3) km(3), agrees very well with other reported estimates of 65.5 x 10(3) km(3) over the terrestrial land surface, which is much higher than 45.8 x 10(3) km(3) estimated with the old algorithm. For ET evaluation at eddy flux towers, the improved algorithm reduces mean absolute bias (MAE) of daily ET from 0.39 mm day(-1) to 033 mm day(-1) driven by tower meteorological data, and from 0.40 mm day(-1) to 0.31 mm day(-1) driven by GMAO data, a global meteorological reanalysis dataset. MAE values by the improved ET algorithm are 24.6% and 24.1% of the ET measured from towers, within the range (10-30%) of the reported uncertainties in ET measurements, implying an enhanced accuracy of the improved algorithm. Compared to the old algorithm, the improved algorithm increases the skill score with tower-driven ET estimates from 0.50 to 0.55, and from 0.46 to 0.53 with GMAO-driven ET.

Currently planned lidar missions will collect transects of data with contiguous observations along each transect: transects will be spread over swaths of multiple kilometers, a sampling pattern that results in high sampling density along track and low sampling density across track. In this work we demonstrate the advantages of a hybrid spatial sampling approach that combines a single conventional transect with a systematic grid of observations. We compare this hybrid approach to traditional lidar sampling that distributes the same number of observations into five transects. We demonstrate that a hybrid sampling approach achieves benchmarks for the spatial distribution of observations in approximately 1/3 of the time required for transect sampling and results in estimates of ecosystem height that have half the uncertainty as those from transect sampling. This type of approach is made possible by a suite of technologies, known together as Electronically Steerable Flash Lidar. A spaceborne sensor with the flexibility of this technology would produce estimates of ecosystem structure that are more reliable and spatially complete than a similar number of observations collected in transects and should be considered for future lidar remote sensing missions.

Traditional pixel-based analysis of remotely sensed data results in inaccurate identification of some crops due to pixel heterogeneity, mixed pixels, spectral similarity, and crop pattern variability. These problems can be overcome using object-based image analysis (OBIA) techniques, which incorporate new spectral, textural and hierarchical features after segmentation of imagery. We combined OBIA and decision tree (DT) algorithms to develop a methodology, named Object-based Crop Identification and Mapping (OCIM), for a multi-seasonal assessment of a large number of crop types and field status.   In our approach, we explored several vegetation indices (VIs) and textural features derived from visible, near-infrared and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands of ASTER satellite scenes collected during three distinct growing-season periods (mid-spring, early-summer and late-summer). OCIM was developed for 13 major crops cultivated in the agricultural area of Yolo County in California, USA. The model design was built in four different scenarios (combinations of three or two periods) by using two independent training and validation datasets and the best DTs resulted in an error rate of 9% for the three-period model and between 12 and 16% for the two-period models. Next, the selected DT was used for the thematic classification of the entire cropland area and mapping was then evaluated applying the confusion matrix method to the independent testing dataset that reported 79% overall accuracy. OCIM detected intra-class variations in most crops attributed to variability from local crop calendars, tree-orchard structures and land management operations. Spectral variables (based on VIs) contributed around 90% to the models, although textural variables were necessary to discriminate between most of the permanent crop-fields (orchards, vineyard, alfalfa and meadow). Features extracted from late-summer imagery contributed around 60% in classification model development, whereas mid-spring and early-summer imagery contributed around 30 and 10%, respectively. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to identify the main groups of crops based on the presence and vigor of green vegetation within the fields, contributing around 50% to the models. In addition, other VIs based on SWIR bands were also crucial to crop identification because of their potential to detect field properties like moisture, vegetation vigor, non-photosynthetic vegetation and bare soil. The OCIM method was built using interpretable rules based on physical properties of the crops studied and it was successful for object-based feature selection and crop identification.

This paper describes an effort to aid the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service in developing and assessing MODIS-based gypsy moth defoliation detection products and methods that could be applied in near real time without intensive field survey data collection as a precursor. In our study, MODIS data for 2000-2006 were processed for the mid-Appalachian highland region of the United States. Gypsy moth defoliation maps showing defoliated forests versus non-defoliated areas were produced from temporally filtered and composited MOD02 and MOD13 data using unsupervised classification and image thresholding of maximum value normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) datasets computed for the defoliation period (June 10-July 27) of 2001 and of the entire time series. These products were validated by comparing stratified random sample locations to relevant Landsat and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) reference data sets. Composites of 250 m daily MOD02 outperformed 16-day MOD13 data in terms of classifying forest defoliation, showing a lower omission error rate (0.09 versus 0.56), a similar Kappa (0.67 versus 0.79), a comparable commission error rate (0.22 versus 0.14), and higher overall classification agreement (88 versus 79%). Results suggest that temporally processed MODIS time-series data can detect with good agreement to available reference data the extent and location of historical regional gypsy moth defoliation patches of 0.25 km(2) or more for 250-meter products. The temporal processing techniques used in this study enabled effective broad regional, \"wall to wall\" gypsy moth defoliation detection products for a 6.2 million ha region that were not produced previously with either MODIS or other satellite data. This study provides new, previously unavailable information on the relative agreement of temporally processed, gypsy moth defoliation detection products from MODIS NDVI time series data with respect to higher spatial resolution Landsat and ASTER data. These results also provided needed timely information on the potential of MODIS data for contributing near real time defoliation products to a USDA Forest Service Forest Threat Early Warning System.

Assessing and evaluating these changes requires consistent data over time at appropriate scales as provided by remote sensing imagery. Given the availability of small and large-scale observation systems that provide the required long-term records, it is important to understand the specific characteristics associated with both observation scales. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potentials and limits of remote sensing time series for change analysis of drylands. We focussed on the assessment and monitoring of land change processes using two scales of remote sensing data. Special interest was given to the influence of the spatial and temporal resolution of different sensors on the derivation of enhanced vegetation related variables, such as trends in time and the shift of phenological cycles. Time series of Landsat TM/ETM+ and NOAA AVHRR covering the overlapping time period from 1990 to 2000 were compared for a study area in the Mediterranean. The test site is located in Central Macedonia (Greece) and represents a typical heterogeneous Mediterranean landscape. It is undergoing extensification and intensification processes such as long-term, gradual processes driven by changing rangeland management and the extension of irrigated arable land. Time series analysis of NOAA AVHRRR and Landsat TM/ETM+ data showed that both sensors are able to detect this kind of land cover change in complementary ways. Thereby, the high temporal resolution of NOAA AVHRR data can partially compensate for the coarse spatial resolution because it allows enhanced time series methods like frequency analysis that provide complementary information. In contrast, the analysis of Landsat data was able to reveal changes at a fine spatial scale, which are associated with shifts in land management practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In most of current LUE-based models, maximal LUE (epsilon(max)) heavily relies on land cover types and is considered as a constant, rather than a variable for a certain vegetation type or even entire eco-region. However, species composition and plant functional types are often highly heterogeneous in a given land cover class; therefore, spatial heterogeneity of epsilon(max) must be fully considered in GPP modeling, so that a single cover type does not equate to a single epsilon(max) value. A spatial dataset of epsilon(max) accurately represents the spatial heterogeneity of maximal light use would be of significant beneficial to regional GPP models. Here, we developed a spatial dataset of epsilon(max) by integrating eddy covariance flux measurements from 14 field sites in a network of coordinated observation across northern China and satellite derived indices such as enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and visible albedo to simulate regional distribution of GPP. This dynamic modeling method recognizes the spatial heterogeneity of epsilon(max) and reduces the uncertainties in mixed pixels. Further, we simulated GPP with the spatial dataset of epsilon(max) generated above. Both epsilon(max) and growing season GPP show complex patterns over northern China that reflect influences of humidity, green vegetation fractions, and land use intensity. \"Green spots\" such as oasis meadow and alpine forests in dryland and \"brown spots\" such as build-up and heavily degraded vegetation in the east are clearly captured by the simulation. The correlation between simulated GPP and EC measured GPP indicate that the simulated GPP from this new approach is well matched with flux-measured GPP. Those results have demonstrated the importance of considering epsilon(max) as both a spatially and temporally variable values in GPP rnodeling. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The daily Er was calculated by multiplying net radiation flux derived from remote sensing products with EF. We then evaluated the model performance by comparing modeled ET with the data at 24 AmeriFlux sites in 2006. We found that the ANNs predicted daily ET well (R-2 = 0.52-0.86).

Numerous studies have developed frameworks to estimate net radiation or its components (upwelling or downwelling longwave and/or shortwave radiation) from remote sensing data for clear sky conditions. Application of existing methodologies to estimate net radiation for cloudy sky conditions from remote sensing sensors remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present a framework to estimate instantaneous and daily average net radiation under all sky conditions from using the data from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), onboard from the Terra satellites. Bisht et al. (2005) methodology is used for the clear sky portion of the MODIS overpass; while for cloudy portion of the MODIS overpass an extension of Bisht et al. (2005) methodology is applied. The extension of Bisht et al. (2005) methodology utilizes the MODIS cloud data product (MOD06_L2) for cloud top temperature, cloud fraction, cloud emissivity, cloud optical thickness and land surface temperature for cloudy days. The methodology is applied over the Southern Great Plains (SGP) for a time period covering all seasons of 2006. During the MODIS-Terra overpasses in 2006 over the SGP, only 24% of day-overpasses and 9% of night-overpasses had 75% or more of the study region as cloud free. Thus, this proposed study is applicable to a large portion of the MODIS-Terra overpasses. The root mean square errors (RMSE) of instantaneous and daily average net radiation estimated under cloudy conditions using the MOD06_L2 product, comparing to ground-based measurements are 37 W m(-2) and 38 W m(-2), respectively. The strength of the proposed methodology is that it can rely exclusively on remote sensing data in the absence of ancillary ground observations, thus it has a potential to estimate surface energy budget globally.

Our purpose was to test nearest neighbor imputation by the k-Most Similar Neighbor (k-MSN) and the Random Forest (RF) methods for the simultaneous estimation of species, DBH, height and stem volume using ALS data. The predictors included computational alpha shape metrics and variables based on the height and intensity distributions in the ALS data. Separate data sets covering 1898 and 1249 dominant to intermediate trees in a typical Scandinavian stand structure were used for training and validation, respectively. RF proved to be a flexible method with an ability to handle 1846 predictors with no need for their reduction. Classification of Scots pine, Norway spruce and deciduous trees showed an accuracy of 78%, and the estimates of DBH, height and volume had root mean square errors of 13%, 3%, and 31%, respectively, when evaluated against the validation data. The two selection strategies implemented here reduced the number of candidate variables effectively without any substantial effect on the accuracy relative to the use of all predictors. Differences in k-MSN and RF imputations were marginal when the reduced sets of variables were used. Estimation accuracies could be maintained practically unchanged with only 12.5% of the initial reference data (237 trees), provided the distribution of the observations was similar in the reference and target data. Since we used information collected in the field for extracting the ALS point clouds for individual trees, our results represent an optimal case and should nevertheless be validated against automated tree delineation.

Three AERONET-OC European coastal sites exhibiting different atmospheric and marine optical properties were considered for the study: the Acqua Alta Oceanographic Tower (AAOT) in the northern Adriatic Sea representing Case-1 and Case-2 moderately sediment dominated waters; and, the Gustaf Dalen Lighthouse Tower (GDLT) in the northern Baltic Proper and the Helsinki Lighthouse Tower (HLT) in the Gulf of Finland, both characterized by Case-2 waters dominated by colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The analysis of MODIS derived normalized water-leaving radiance at 551 nm, L-WN(551), has shown relatively good results for all sites with uncertainties of the order of 10% and biases ranging from -1 to -4%. Larger uncertainty and bias have been observed at 443 nm for the AAOT (i.e., 18 and -7%, respectively). At the same center wavelength, results for GDLT and HLT have exhibited much larger uncertainties (i.e., 56 and 67%, respectively) and biases (i.e., 18 and 25%, respectively), which undermine the possibility of presently using remote sensing L-WN data at the blue center wavelengths for bio-optical investigations in the Baltic Sea. An evaluation of satellite derived aerosol optical thickness, tau(a), has shown uncertainties and biases of the order of tens of percent increasing with wavelength at all sites. Specifically, MODIS derived tau(a) at 869 rim, has shown an overestimate of 71% at the AAOT, 101% at GDLT and 91% at HLT, respectively. This result highlights the effects of a limited number of aerosol models for the atmospheric correction process, and might also indicate the need of applying a vicarious calibration factor to the remote sensing data at the 869 nm center wavelength to remove the effects of uncertainties in the atmospheric optical model and the space sensor radiometric calibration. Similar results have been obtained from the analysis of SeaWiFS data. Finally, in view of illustrating the possibility of increasing the accuracy of satellite regional radiometric products, AERONET-OC data have been applied to reduce systematic errors in MODIS and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) L-WN data likely due to the atmospheric correction process. Results relying on MODIS match-ups for the Baltic Sites (i.e., GDLT and HLT) and MERIS matchups for the AAOT, have indicated a substantial reduction of both uncertainty and bias in the blue and red center wavelengths.

Air quality forecasting requires dynamic fire emission estimates that are generated in a timely manner to support real-time operations. In the regulatory and planning realm, emission inventories are essential for quantitatively assessing the contribution of wildfire to air pollution. The development of wildland fire emission inventories depends on burned area as a critical input. This study presents a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) - direct broadcast (DB) burned area mapping algorithm designed to support air quality forecasting and emission inventory development. The algorithm combines active fire locations and single satellite scene burn scar detections to provide a rapid yet robust mapping of burned area. Using the U.S. Forest Service Fire Sciences Laboratory (FiSL) MODIS-DB receiving station in Missoula, Montana, the algorithm provided daily measurements of burned area for wildfire events in the western U.S. in 2006 and 2007. We evaluated the algorithm\'s fire detection rate and burned area mapping using fire perimeter data and burn scar information derived from high resolution satellite imagery. The FiSL MODIS-DB system detected 87% of all reference fires >4 km(2), and 93% of all reference fires >10 km(2). The burned area was highly correlated (R-2 = 0.93) with a high resolution imagery reference burn scar dataset, but exhibited a large over estimation of burned area (56%). The reference burn scar dataset was used to calibrate the algorithm response and quantify the uncertainty in the burned area measurement at the fire incident level. An objective, empirical error based approach was employed to quantify the uncertainty of our burned area measurement and provide a metric that is meaningful in context of remotely sensed burned area and emission inventories. The algorithm uncertainty is +/-36% for fires 50 km(2) in size, improving to +/-31% at a fire size of 100 km(2). Fires in this size range account for a substantial portion of burned area in the western U.S. (77% of burned area is due to fires >50 km(2), and 66% results from fires >100 km(2)). The dominance of these large wildfires in burned area. duration, and emissions makes these events a significant concern of air quality forecasters and regulators. With daily coverage at 1-km(2) spatial resolution, and a quantified measurement uncertainty, the burned area mapping algorithm presented in this paper is well suited for the development of wildfire emission inventories. Furthermore, the algorithm\'s DB implementation enables time sensitive burned area mapping to support operational air quality forecasting. Published by Elsevier Inc.', '[Urbanski, S. P.; Salmon, J.

Medium spatial resolution sensors, like MERIS, exhibit a significant potential to study these dynamics over large areas because of their spatial, spectral and temporal resolution. However, the spatial resolution provided by MERIS (300 m in full resolution mode) is not appropriate to monitor heterogeneous landscapes, where typical length scales of these dynamics rarely reach 300 m. We, therefore, motivate the use of data fusion techniques to downscale medium spatial resolution data (MERIS full resolution, FR) to a Landsat-like spatial resolution (25 m). An unmixing-based data fusion approach was applied to a time series of MERIS FR images acquired over The Netherlands. The selected data fusion approach is based on the linear mixing model and uses a high spatial resolution land use database to produce images having the spectral and temporal resolution as provided by MERIS, but a Landsat-like spatial resolution. A quantitative assessment of the quality of the fused images was done in order to test the validity of the proposed method and to evaluate the radiometric characteristics of the MERIS fused images. The resulting series of fused images was subsequently used to compute two vegetation indices specifically designed for MERIS: the MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI) and the MERIS global vegetation index (MGVI). These indices represent continuous fields of canopy chlorophyll (MTCI) and of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy (MGVI). Results indicate that the selected data fusion approach can be successfully used to downscale MERIS data and, therefore, to monitor vegetation dynamics at Landsat-like spatial, and MERIS-like spectral and temporal resolution.

Monitoring over several change periods needs to account for increased variability resulting from possible combinations of atmosphere, sensor, and surface conditions. Training a change method for each monitoring period (i.e. a dynamic approach) is an option, but can be costly to develop the needed training datasets and many not be warranted if sufficient accuracy can be obtained without retraining (i.e. a statis approach). In this research the potential of change detection using a static approach suitable for near-real time annual monitoring was evaluated. The research assessed the influence of feature set size, radiometric normalization, incorporation of temporal information, and change object size and sub-pixel fraction on accuracy. The static approach was based on a decision tree developed using 250 m MODIS data from 2005 to 2006 and applied annually for the period 2001-2005. Change results between years were combined and compared to reference data representing change from 2001 to 2005 to evaluate monitoring performance. Results revealed high accuracy for the decision tree change model development from 2005 to 2006 (bootstrap cross-validation KAPPA = 0.91), with lower accuracy (KAPPA = 0.80) when applied for monitoring from 2001 to 2005. Radiometric normalization increased monitoring accuracy (KAPPA = 0.86). Further improvement was achieved with the incorporation of temporal contextual tests to combine the 2001-2005 inter-annual change maps (KAPPA = 0.90), but required a time lag of 1 year. An alternative temporal test that was not restricted by the 1 year time lag produced slightly lower accuracy (KAPPA = 0.88). Evaluation of the effect of object size on detection accuracy showed that accuracy for objects less than 7 pixels was strongly related to object size, with objects less than 3 pixels having low detection rates. The effect of sub-pixel change fraction was found to be dependent on object size with larger objects reducing detection error across the range of fractions evaluated.

Previous research indicates that susceptibility to mountain pine beetle is a function of a tree\'s physiological vigor and the intensity of attack. Trees able to produce >= 80 g (g) of wood per m(2) of projected leaf area annually are highly resistant, because they are able to shift resource allocation locally from wood to resin production to isolate blue-stain fungi introduced by attacking beetles. Typically, the leaf area of susceptible stands must be reduced by two-thirds to permit most residual trees to increase their vigor to a safe level. We evaluate whether Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery (30 x 30 m) provides a means to assess the maximum leaf area index (LAI) of unthinned stands and the extent that thinning reduces LAI. The extent that residual trees in thinned stands may have increased their resistance to attack from mountain pine beetle is predicted from a non-linear relationship between % maximum LAI and mean tree vigor.   We investigated the merits of this approach in the vicinity of Parson, British Columbia using four stands of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl), two of which were heavily thinned (stands were spaced to 4 and 5 m, approximately 70% reduction in stand density). An analysis of archived Landsat TM imagery indicated that prior to thinning in 1993, all four stands had full canopy, which, for mature stands, would translate to mean tree vigor between 40 and 70 g of annual wood production per m(2) of foliage. By 1995, based on estimated changes in LAI derived from a second data of Landsat TM imagery. stand vigor in the unthinned stands had not changed; however, in the thinned stands, a nearly two third reduction in LAI resulted in a predicted increase in vigor to between 100 and 160 g wood m(-2) of leaf area. A subsequent assessment in 2001 indicated that stand vigor remained higher in the thinned stands relative to the control stands. Following an infestation of mountain pine beetle in the study area in 2002, mortality data indicated that the thinned stands experienced no mortality relative to the unthinned stands which experienced 5.5% mortality in the initial years of the attack. In the larger area surrounding the study site, a general relationship was found between predicted stand vigor and mountain pine beetle-induced mortality as estimated from aerial overview survey data (r(2) = 0.43. p <0.01).

In order to optimize quantitative image analysis, we looked for the optimal spatial resolution to map natural vegetation in a Mediterranean environment. The optimal spatial resolution was then related to the spatial characteristics of the scene and the mapped parameters. Based on the relation between airborne hyperspectral imagery and field dataset consisting of 227 measured plots of Leaf Area Index (LAI) and aboveground biomass, we found an optimal pixel size of 55 and 95 m for the mapping of LAI and aboveground biomass, respectively. The optimal spatial resolution we found is determined by the spatial structure of the mapped parameters on the one hand, and by the effects of shading patterns and gaps in the canopy on the other. The spatial properties of scene elements influencing the optimal spatial resolution can be detected effectively using average local variance functions and variograms, provided that these are studied at a wide spatial range. The use of an optimally sized mapping unit instead of the original 5 m pixels resulted in an improvement of mapping accuracy of 7 to 17%. It is therefore recommended that the image support used is considered carefully in all quantitative mapping projects based on remotely sensed imagery. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The annual PRODES data were used to calibrate the MODIS annual change indicator data in estimating forest loss for Brazil. Results indicate that MODIS data may be useful in Providing a first estimate of national forest cover change on an annual basis for Brazil. When directly compared with PRODES change at the MODIS grid scale for all years of the analysis, MODIS change indicator maps accounted for 75% of the PRODES change. This ratio was used to scale the MODIS change indicators to the PRUDES area estimates. A sliding threshold of percent PRODES forest and 2000 to 2005 deforestation classes per MODIS grid cell was used to match the scaled MODIS to the official PRODES change estimates, and then to differentiate MODIS change within various sub-areas of the PRODES analysis. Results indicate significant change outside of the PRODES-defined intact forest class. Total scaled MODIS change area within the PRODES historical deforestation and forest area of study is 120% of the official PRODES estimate. Results emphasize the importance of synoptic monitoring of all forest change dynamics, including the cover dynamics of intact humid forest, regrowth, plantations, and cerrado tree cover assemblages. Results also indicate that operational MODIS-only forest cover loss algorithms may be useful in providing near-real time areal estimates of annual change within the Amazon Basin.

Based on a statistical analysis of 100 ASTER scenes, we established omission and commission error rates for nine different regions. In most regions the probability of detection was between 0.8 and 0.9. Probabilities of false alarm varied between 9 x 10(-8) (India) and 2x10(-5) (USA/Canada). In most cases, the majority of false fire pixels were linked to clusters of true fire pixels, suggesting that most false fire pixels occur along ambiguous fire boundaries. We next consider fire characterization, and formulate an empirical method for estimating fire radiative power (FRP), a measure of fire intensity, using three ASTER thermal infrared channels. We performed a preliminary evaluation of our retrieval approach using four prescribed fires which were active at the time of the Terra overpass for which limited ground-truth data were collected. Retrieved FRP was accurate to within 20%, with the exception of one fire partially obscured by heavy soot. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Seismicity increased three weeks prior to the large eruption, which produced a 12-15 kin above sea level (ASL) ash column. We present field observations from 27 December 2006 and 2 March 2007, combined with satellite data collected from 8 October 2006 to 11 April 2007 by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), as part of the instrument\'s rapid-response program to volcanic eruptions. Pixel-integrated brightness temperatures were calculated from both ASTER 90 m/pixel thermal infrared (TIR) data as well as 30 m/pixel short-wave infrared (SWIR) data. Four days prior to the eruption, the maximum TIR temperature was 45 degrees C above the average background temperature (-33 degrees C) at the dome, which we interpret was a precursory signal, and had dropped to 8 degrees C above background by 18 March 2007. On 20 December 2006, there was also a clear thermal signal in the SWIR data of 128 degrees C using ASTER Band 7 (2.26 mu m). The maximum SWIR temperature was 181 degrees C on the lava dome on 4 January 2007, decreasing below the detection limit of the SWIR data by 11 April 2007. On 4 January 2007 a hot linear feature was observed at the dome in the SWIR data, which produced a maximum temperature of 700 degrees C for the hot fraction of the pixel using the dual band technique. This suggests that magmatic temperatures were present at the dome at this time, consistent with the emplacement of a new lava lobe following the eruption. The eruption also produced a large, 6.5 km long by up to 425 m wide pyroclastic flow (PF) deposit that was channelled into a valley to the south-southeast. The PF deposit cooled over the following three months but remained elevated above the average background temperature. A second field investigation in March 2007 revealed a still-warm PF deposit that contained fumaroles. It was also observed that the upper dome morphology had changed in the past year, with a new lava lobe having in-filled the crater that formed following the 9 May 2006 eruption. These data provide further information on effusive and explosive activity at Bezymianny using quantitative remote sensing data and reinforced by field observations to assist in pre-eruption detection as well as post-eruption monitoring.

Here, the potential of radiative transfer modeling to predict LAI and leaf and canopy chlorophyll contents in a heterogeneous Mediterranean grassland is investigated. The widely used PROSAIL model was inverted with canopy spectral reflectance measurements by means of a look-up table (LUT). Canopy spectral measurements were acquired in the field using a GER 3700 spectroradiometer, along with simultaneous in situ measurements of LAI and leaf chlorophyll content. We tested the impact of using multiple solutions, stratification (according to species richness), and spectral subsetting on parameter retrieval. To assess the performance of the model inversion, the normalized RMSE and R-2 between independent in situ measurements and estimated parameters were used. Of the three investigated plant characteristics, canopy chlorophyll content was estimated with the highest accuracy (R-2 = 0.70, NRMSE = 0.18). Leaf chlorophyll content, on the other hand, could not be estimated with acceptable accuracy, while LAI was estimated with intermediate accuracy (R-2 = 0.59, NRMSE = 0.18). When only sample plots with up to two species were considered (n = 107), the estimation accuracy for all investigated variables (LAI, canopy chlorophyll content and leaf chlorophyll content) increased (NRMSE=0.14, 0.16, 0.19, respectively). This shows the limits of the PROSAIL radiative transfer model in the case of very heterogeneous conditions. We also found that a carefully selected spectral subset contains sufficient information for a successful model inversion. Our results confirm the potential of model inversion for estimating vegetation biophysical parameters at the canopy scale in (moderately) heterogeneous grasslands using hyperspectral measurements.

Because of the potential impact on forests in this area, multiple government agencies are currently focusing their efforts on developing new technologies to detect, monitor and control this insect pest. Previous work has shown that hyperspectral remote sensing technologies can produce detailed maps of forest health and species abundance on a landscape scale. This study examines the capability of a commercially available sensor (SpecTIR VNIR) to map ash decline due to exotic EAB infestations in Michigan and Ohio. A 6-term linear regression equation based on known stress- and chlorophyll-sensitive indices was able to predict decline on a continuous 0- to 10 scale with an r-squared of 0.71 and an average jackknifed residual of 0.61. Treated as an integer, decline was predicted to within one class with 97% accuracy. The ability of this instrument to assess decline below class 4 (when dieback and transparency reach levels first noticeable in the field) is based upon pre-visual reductions in chlorophyll content and function that are characteristic of early stress. The identification of early stress is critical in containing newly introduced exotics such as EAB. While this decline prediction technique is not stress- or species-specific, it will enable land managers to assess and monitor detailed forest health across the landscape. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

However, observations of the spatial extent of ponding are rare. To address this, a MODIS surface reflectance product is used to derive the daily melt pond cover over sea ice in the Beaufort/Chukchi Sea region through the summer of 2004. For this region, the estimated pond cover increased rapidly during the first 20 days of melt from 10% to 40%. Fluctuations in pond cover occurred through summer, followed by a more gradual decrease through late August to 10%. The rapid initial increase in pond cover occurred later as latitude increased and melt progressed northward.   A surface campaign at Barrow in June 2004 provided pond and ice spectral reflectance needed by the MODIS algorithm to deduce pond coverage. Although individual pond and ice reflectance varies within the comparatively small region of measurement, the mean values used within the algorithm ensured that relevant values (i.e. concurrent with satellite observations) were being applied.   Aerosonde unpiloted aerial vehicles (UAVs) were deployed in June 2004 from Barrow, Alaska, to photograph the sea ice so melt pond cover could be estimated. Although the agreement between derived pond cover from UAV photos and estimates from MODIS varies, the mean estimates and distribution of pond coverages are similar, suggesting that the MODIS technique is useful for estimating pond coverage throughout the region. It is recommended that this technique be applied to the entire Arctic through the melt season. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Current methods of measuring residue cover are inadequate for characterizing the spatial variability of residue cover over large fields. The objectives of this research were to determine the effects of water content on the remotely sensed estimates of crop residue cover and to propose a method to mitigate the effects of water content on remotely sensed estimates of crop residue cover. Reflectance spectra of crop residues and soils were measured in the lab over the 400-2400 nm wavelength region. Reflectance of scenes with various residue cover fractions and water contents was simulated using a linear mixture model. Additional spectra of scenes with mixtures of crop residues and soil were also acquired in corn, soybean, and wheat fields with different tillage treatments and different water content conditions. Crop residue cover was linearly related to the cellulose absorption index (CAI), which was defined as the relative intensity of an absorption feature near 2100 nm. Water in the crop residue significantly attenuated CAI and changed the slope of the residue cover vs. CAI relationship. Without an appropriate correction, crop residue covers were underestimated as scene water content increased. Spectral vegetation water indices were poorly related to changes in the water contents of crop residues and soils. A new reflectance ratio water index that used the two bands located on the shoulders of the cellulose absorption feature to estimate scene water conditions was proposed and tested with data from corn, soybean, and wheat fields. The ratio water index was used to describe the changes in the slope of crop residue cover vs. CAI and improve the predictions of crop residue cover. These results indicate that spatial and temporal adjustments in the spectral estimates of crop residue cover are possible. Current mutispectral imaging systems will not provide reliable estimates of crop residue cover when scene water content varies. Hyperspectral data are not required, because the three narrow bands that are used for both CAI and the scene moisture correction could be incorporated in advanced multispectral sensors. Thus, regional surveys of soil conservation practices that affect soil carbon dynamics may be feasible using either advanced multispectral or hyperspectral imaging systems.

The method is based on the Integral Equation Model (IEM) which predicts the normalized radar cross-section (MRCS) of randomly rough dielectric surfaces. The data used for this analysis were acquired in the German Bight of the North Sea by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band SAR (SIR-C/X-SAR) in 1994. In-situ measurements of the root-mean-squared (rms) height and the correlation length of the sand ripples clearly demonstrate a relationship between these roughness parameters and the C-band NRCS determined from an ERS SAR image. Using the IEM we have calculated NRCS isolines for the three frequency bands deployed by SIR-C/X-SAR (L, C, and X band), as a function of the rms height and the correlation length of the sand ripples. For each SIR-C/X-SAR image pixel these two roughness parameters were determined from the intersections of the NRCS isolines at different radar bands, and they were used for a crude sediment classification for a small test area at the German North Sea coast. Comparing our results with available sediment maps, we conclude that the presented method is very promising for tidal flat classification by using data from presently existing airborne and future spaceborne mufti-frequency SAR systems.

Consequently, our capacity of analyzing forest dynamics over large areas and long periods of time is somewhat limited. This study proposes a new method for retrospectively reconstructing plot-wise average dominant tree height based on a time series of high-resolution canopy height maps, termed canopy height models (CHMs). The absolute elevation of the canopy surface, or digital surface model (DSM), was first reconstructed by applying image-matching techniques to stereo-pairs of aerial photographs acquired in 1945, 1965, 1983, and 2003. The historical CHMs were then created by subtracting the bare earth elevation provided from a recent lidar survey from the DSMs. A method for estimating average dominant tree height from these historical CHMs was developed and calibrated for each photographic year. The accuracy of the resulting remote sensing height estimates was compared to age height data reconstructed based on dendrometric measurements. The height bias of the remote sensing estimates relative to the verification data ranged from 0.52 in to 1.55 m (1.16 m on average). The corresponding root-mean-square errors varied between 1.49 m and 2.88 m (2.03 m average). Despite being slightly less accurate than historical field data, the quality of the remote sensing estimates is sufficient for many types of forest dynamics studies. The procedures for implementing this method, with the exception of the calibration phase, are entirely automated such that forest height growth curves can be reconstructed and mapped over large areas for which recent lidar data and historical photographs exist.

In particular, we highlight the individual and combinatorial influence of spectral and temporal components of MODIS reflectance data in land cover classification. Our study relies on an annual time series of twelve MODIS 8-days composited images (MOD09Al) monthly acquired during the year 2000, at a 500 in nominal resolution. As our aim is not to propose an operational classifier directed at thematic mapping based on the most efficient combination of reflectance inputs - which will probably change across geographical regions and with different land cover nomenclatures - we intentionally restrict our experimental framework to continental Portugal. Because our observation data stream contains highly correlated components, we need to rank the temporal and the spectral features according not only to their individual ability at separating the land cover classes, but also to their differential contribution to the existing information. To proceed, we resort to the median Mahalanobis distance as a statistical separability criterion. Once achieved this arrangement, we strive to evaluate, in a classification perspective, the gain obtained when the dimensionality of the input feature space grows. We then successively embedded the prior ranked measures into the multitemporal and multispectral training data set of a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. In this way, we show that, only the inclusion of the approximately first three dates substantially increases the classification accuracy. Moreover, this multitemporal factor has a significant effect when coupled with combinations of few spectral bands, but it turns negligible as soon as the full spectral information is exploited. Regarding the multispectral factor, its beneficence on classification accuracy remains more constant, regardless of the number of dates being used. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The average elevations of the dominant plant classifications found in CSM (e.g., Salicornia virginica,Jaumea carnosa, and salt-grass mix, a mixture of multiple marsh plant species) occurred within a 17 cm range, a vertical change that resulted in a 7% difference in the period of tidal inundation.

The MODIS algorithm computes GPP as a simple function of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and a regionally assigned light-use conversion efficiency (LUE) that is reduced if temperature or atmospheric vapor pressure deficits are suboptimal. We compared MODIS-derived GPP estimates for forested areas across the United States of America (U.S.A.) with those generated by the 3-PGS (Physiological Principles Predicting Growth using Satellite data) model, the latter of which considers spatial variation in available soil water storage capacity (ASWC) and nitrogen content. We expected seasonal and annual MODIS GPP values to be in close agreement with those derived from the 3-PGS model in regions with adequate precipitation, soil water storage, and moderately fertile soils. 3-PGS was initially run with STATSGO-derived soils information provided by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The analysis was expanded to include sensitivity analyses with ASWC set at 50, 100, 300, and 400 mm to identify areas within nine major ecoregions where drought might prove to be a major limitation on GPP. The majority of forests across the U.S.A. were relatively insensitive to large variations in ASW storage. In areas where ASWC was assumed < 200 mm and average annual rainfall was < 100 mm yr(-1), GPP was predicted to be reduced by > 60%. There was generally good agreement (within 20%) between MODIS and 3-PGS estimates of forest GPP across the U.S.A. GPP predicted by the MODIS model was generally higher in ecoregions with substantial drought and with relatively low soil fertility. The latter, which influences LUE, was more than twice as important as soil drought. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', 'Oregon State Univ, Coll Forestry, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.

The third, less common form of reporting, is the transition error matrix. This paper discuses the relation between these matrices. First, it is shown that the transition error matrix implicitly measures temporal correlation in classification errors. Based on two assumptions (no correlation, maximum correlation), the single date error matrices can be used to obtain a most pessimistic and most optimistic estimate of the transition accuracy. Next, it is shown that the change/no change error matrix does not quantify certain classification errors. It is shown that change/no change error matrix can be used complementary to the full transition error matrix in efforts to improve transition detection accuracy. Despite its advantages, the transition error matrix is only very rarely reported, while it is of interest to all those interested in the accuracy of transitions (from-to) in change detection.

The accuracy of the MODIS operational cloud mask was 90.72% for the 32 partly cloudy scenes and 93.37% for the 25 completely clear and overcast scenes. An automated, simple threshold algorithm based on three features extracted from MISR radiances and the MODIS operational cloud mask agreed with each other for 74.91% of the pixels in the 32 partly cloudy scenes and 78.44% of the pixels in the 25 completely clear and overcast scenes. These subsets of pixels had, relative to the expert labels, classification accuracies of 96.53% for the 32 partly cloudy scenes and 99.05% for the 25 completely clear and overcast scenes. Fisher\'s quadratic discriminate analysis (QDA) trained on expert labels from the 32 partly cloud scenes was applied to MISR radiances, three features based on MISR radiances, MODIS radiances, and the six features of the MODIS operational cloud mask with accuracies ranging from 87.51% to 96.43%. Accuracies increased to about 97% when QDA with expert labels was applied to combined radiances or features from both MISR and MODIS. Operational QDA-based classifiers were developed using as training labels those pixels for which the MISR automated, simple threshold and MODIS operational cloud mask algorithms agreed. Training the QDA classifier on these automatic labels using MISR radiances, three features based on MISR radiances, MODIS radiances, and the six features of the MODIS operational cloud mask led to accuracies ranging from 85.23% to 93.62% for the 32 partly cloudy scenes. Classification accuracies increased to 93.74% (93.40%) when combined MISR and MODIS radiances (features) were used. The highest accuracy attained with any operational algorithm tested on all 57 scenes was 94.51%. These results suggest that both MISR and MODIS radiances are sufficient for cloud detection in daytime polar regions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Bird species richness was summarized from 10-min point counts conducted at 12 points within 42 plots (108 ha each) from 1996 to 1998. We calculated 14 first- and second-order texture measures in eight different window sizes on a set of digital orthophotos acquired in 1996. For each of the 42 plots, we summarized mean and standard deviation of each texture value within multiple window sizes. The relationship between image texture and average bird species richness was assessed using linear regression models. Single image texture measures such as the standard deviation described up to 57% of the variability in species richness. Coupling multiple measures of texture or coupling elevation with a single texture measure described up to 63% of the variability in bird species richness. Models incorporating two measures of texture and coarse habitat type described 76% of the variability in bird species richness. These results show that image texture analysis is a very promising tool for characterizing habitat structure and predicting patterns of species richness in semi-arid ecosystems. This method has several advantages over methods that rely on classified imagery, including cost-effectiveness, incorporation of within-habitat vegetation variability, and elimination of errors associated with boundary delineation.

This paper explores thermal features and their relationship with biophysical descriptors in an urban environment by analyzing multitemporal ASTER images. Linear spectral mixture analysis was used to unmix the five thermal infrared bands of ASTER into hot-object and cold-object fraction images and to unmix the nine visible, near-infrared, and shortwave-infrared bands into impervious surface, green vegetation, and soil fractions. Land surface temperatures (LSTs) were computed from band 13 (10.25-10.95 mu m) of the ASTER. Correlation analysis was then conducted to examine the relationship between LST and the five derived fraction variables across the spatial resolution of the pixels from the ASTER images, which ranged from 15 m to 90 m. Multiple regression models were further developed to reveal how LSTs were related to urban biophysical descriptors (i.e., impervious surface, green vegetation, and soil) and to the thermal feature fractions (i.e., hot-object and cold-object). Results indicate that impervious surface was positively correlated while vegetation was negatively correlated with LST. Hot objects displayed a more significant role in influencing LST patterns than cold objects. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Strong seasonal patterns of variation were observed in NDWI and Red/Green ratio from MODIS NBAR. Correlations between fine (3 and 30 m) and coarse (1 km) scale indices for a small region around the flux tower site were moderately good for Red/Green ratio, but poor for NDWI. Hymap NDWI values for the understorey canopy were much lower than values for the tree canopy. MODIS NDWI was negatively correlated with CO2 fluxes during warm and cool seasons. The correlation indicated that surface reflectance, affected by a spectrally bright grassland understorey canopy, was decoupled from growth of trees with access to deep soil moisture. The application of physiologically-based indices at earth observation scale requires careful attention to applicability of band configurations, contribution of vegetation components to reflectance signals, mechanistic relationships between biochemical processes and spectral indexes, and incorporation of ancillary information into any analysis.

The area impacted by the current mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, has increased 40-fold over the previous 5 years, with approximately 8.5 million ha of forest infested in 2005. As a result of the spatial extent and intensity of the outbreak, new technologies are being assessed to help detect, map, and monitor the damage caused by the beetle, and to inform mitigation of future beetle outbreaks. In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of high spatial resolution QuickBird multi-spectral imagery to detect mountain pine beetle red attack damage. ANOVA testing of individual spectral bands, as well as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and a ratio of red to green reflectance (Red-Green Index or RGI), indicated that the RGI was the most successful (p < 0.001) at separating non-attack crowns from red attack crowns. Based on this result, the RGI was subsequently used to develop a binary classification of red attack and non-attack pixels. The total number of QuickBird pixels classified as having red attack damage within a 50 in buffer of a known forest health survey point were compared to the number of red attack trees recorded at the time of the forest health survey. The relationship between the number of red attack pixels and observed red attack crowns was assessed using independent validation data and was found to be significant (r(2)=0.48, p < 0.001, standard error=2.8 crowns). A comparison of the number of QuickBird pixels classified as red attack, and a broader scale index of mountain pine beetle red attack damage (Enhanced Wetness Difference Index, calculated from a time series of Landsat imagery), was significant (r(2)=0.61, p < 0.001, standard error=1.3 crowns). These results suggest that high spatial resolution imagery, in particular QuickBird satellite imagery, has a valuable role to play in identifying tree crowns with red attack damage. This information could subsequently be used to augment existing detailed forest health surveys, calibrate synoptic estimates of red attack damage generated from over-view surveys and/or coarse scale remotely sensed data, and facilitate the generation of value-added information products, such as estimates of timber volume impacts at the forest stand level.

The conventional methods for estimating NSSR rely on broadband satellite data such as Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) wide-field-of-view planetary albedo. The spatial resolution of the current ERBE satellite data having nadir footprints larger than 30 kin is too coarse. The primary objective of this study is to estimate NSSR using multispectral narrowband data such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. A direct method was developed for narrowband-to-broadband albedo conversion, which links the narrowband apparent reflectance at the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) to shortwave broadband albedo for clear and cloudy skies without performing any surface angular modeling. The conversion coefficients were derived as functions of the secant Viewing Zenith Angle (VZA) for a given Solar Zenith Angle (SZA) and a given interval of Relative Azimuth angle (RAA). The result of comparing the values of estimated MODIS TOA shortwave broadband albedos with those of the Clouds and the Earth\'s Radiant Energy System (CERES) data indicated that this direct method could predict TOA shortwave broadband albedo accurately with Root Mean Square (RMS) error between CERES observations and the estimated instantaneous MODIS TOA albedos less than 0.02. Based on more accurate radiative transfer model MODTRAN 4, the parameterization coefficients of Masuda et al. for the estimation of the NSSR from TOA broadband albedo were recalculated. The result showed that the coefficients should be categorized by land surfaces, ocean surface and snow/ice surface, respectively. Finally, the NSSR estimated from MODIS data was compared with the measurements of meteorological data for an extended period of time covering all seasons in a year 2003. The RMS error is less than 20 Win 2 for clear skies and 35 Win 2 for cloudy skies. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we focused on the bandpass filter differences and empirically investigated cross-sensor relationships of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and reflectance. The specific objectives were: 1) to understand the systematic trends in cross-sensor relationships of the NDVI and reflectance as a function of spectral bandpasses, 2) to examine/ identify the relative importance of the spectral features (i.e., the green peak, red edge, and leaf liquid water absorption regions) in and the mechanism(s) of causing the observed systematic trends, and 3) to evaluate the performance of several empirical cross-calibration methods in modeling the observed systematic trends. A Level 1A Hyperion hyperspectral image acquired over a tropical forest-savanna transitional region in Brazil was processed to simulate atmospherically corrected reflectances and NDVI for various bandpasses, including Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), NOAA-14 Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVERR), and Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). Data were extracted from various land cover types typically found in tropical forest and savanna biomes and used for analyses. Both NDVI and reflectance relationships among the sensors were neither linear nor unique and were found to exhibit complex patterns and bandpass dependencies. The reflectance relationships showed strong land cover dependencies. The NDVI relationships, in contrast, did not show land cover dependencies, but resulted in nonlinear forms. From sensitivity analyses, the green peak (similar to 550 nm) and red-NIR transitional (680-780 nm) features were identified as the key factors in producing the observed land cover dependencies and nonlinearity in cross-sensor relationships. In particular, differences in the extents to which the red and/or NIR bandpasses included these features significantly influenced the forms and degrees of nonlinearity in the relationships. Translation of MODIS NDVI to \"AVHRR-like\" NDVI using a weighted average of MODIS green and red bands performed very poorly, resulting in no reduction of overall discrepancy between MODIS and AVHRR NDVI. Cross-calibration of NDVI and reflectance using NDVI-based quadratic functions performed well, reducing their differences to +/- .025 units for the NDVI and +/- .01 units for the reflectances; however, many of the translation results suffered from bias errors. The present results suggest that distinct translation equations and coefficients need to be developed for every sensor pairs and that land cover-dependency need to be explicitly accounted for to reduce bias errors.

Measurement analysis suggested a spectral invariance of the specular component, the directional shape of which was mainly driven by leaf surface roughness. A three-parameter physically based model was fitted on the BRDF at each wavelength, confirming the spectral invariance of the specular component in the VIS, followed by a slight deterioration in the NIR. Due to this component, the amount of reflected light which did not penetrate into the leaf, could be considered as significant at wavelengths of chlorophyll absorption. Finally, by introducing the PROSPECT model, we proposed a five-parameter model to simulate leaf spectral and bidirectional reflectance in the VIS-NIR. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

This study aims to derive such information from space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Estimates of the backscattering coefficient were extracted from ERS-1 SAR and ERS-2 SAR PRI imagery of four intertidal flats in the Westerschelde (southwest Netherlands). They were related to field measurements of surface roughness, moisture conditions and sediment texture. The field data were also used as input to the backscattering model IEM. The data and model predictions show that on the intertidal flats, backscattering depends mainly on vertical surface roughness, with rougher surfaces associated with more backscattering. Surface roughness, mainly determined by the ripple structure of the bed, decreased with the amount of mud in the sediment. This resulted in a significant negative correlation between backscattering and mud content, and a significant positive correlation between backscattering and median grain-size of the sediment. Sediment texture was also correlated with the volumetric moisture content of the sediment, with finer sediments being associated with higher moisture contents. However, moisture contents were generally high, and therefore the backscatter signal was not sensitive to differences in moisture content. The relationships allowed the development of regression models for the prediction of surface characteristics from SAR imagery, from which maps of, for example, mud content, have been derived.

Micrometeorology-based broadband NDVI was calculated from observed upward and downward photosynthetically activity radiation (PAR) and global radiation measurements. The composite satellite-derived NDVI time series were smoothed with a best index slope extraction method (BISE) and adjusted Fourier transform (AFT) in order to downscale from the compositing period to daily scale.   The broadband and satellite-derived NDVIs were highly correlated during the main growth period (Julian days 90-270), but poorly correlated when the entire year was considered, i.e., large differences occurred during winter. High correlations were also found between the seasonal courses for broadband NDVI and daily air temperature. The analysis revealed that the onset of greenness in spring was consistently determined from broadband NDVI time series in different years, but that fluctuations in NDVI during the late season transition to winter dormancy prevented reliable prediction of the termination in physiological activity. Efforts to retrieve the same relationships during spring from satellite-derived NDVI failed.   After comparing the smoothed time series from different NDVI determinations, we examined the relationship between NDVI, gross primary production (GPP) and FAPAR. An obvious exponential relationship is found between broadband NDVI and GPP (R-2=0.72 for clear weather conditions; also detectable from the satellite sensors), while a linear relationship occurs between broadband NDVI and FAPAR (R-2=0.79). FAPAR in relation to satellite-derived NDVI is best described with a logistic curve under clear weather conditions, but the level of correspondence is low (R-2=0.53). Overall, broadband NDVI is a good index to describe physiological activity of the pine forest during certain periods, i.e. provides a means for obtaining other physiological parameters that are required by ecosystem models. However, during the late season, broadband NDVI estimated over the pine stand is influenced by more than vegetation physiological activity. Though satellite-derived NDVI is more difficult to link to GPP, it may still provide useful information under clear weather conditions. Satellite-derived NDVI remains our only choice for generalization in large-scale investigations. Thus, intensified examination of the influences of smoothing and downscaling of satellite-derived NDVI is inevitable. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

LAI retrieval using spectral vegetation indices (SVI) from optical remotely sensed data usually requires site-specific calibration values from the surface or the use of within-scene image information without surface calibrations to invert radiative transfer models. An evaluation of LAI retrieval methods was conducted using (1) empirical methods employing the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and a new SVI that uses green wavelength reflectance, (2) a scaled NDVI approach that uses no calibration measurements, and (3) a hybrid approach that uses a neural network (NN) and a radiative transfer model without site-specific calibration measurements. While research has shown that under a variety of conditions NDVI is not optimal for LAI retrieval, its continued use for remote sensing applications and in analysis seeking to develop improved parameter retrieval algorithms based on NDVI suggests its value as a \"benchmark\" or standard against which other methods can be compared. Landsat-7 ETM+ data for July I and July 8 from the Soil Moisture EXperiment 2002 (SMEX02) field campaign in the Walnut Creek watershed south of Ames, IA, were used for the analysis. Sun photometer data collected from a site within the watershed were used to atmospherically correct the imagery to surface reflectance. LAI validation measurements of corn and soybeans were collected close to the dates of the Landsat-7 overpasses. Comparable results were obtained with the empirical SVI methods and the scaled SVI method within each date. The hybrid method, although promising, did not account for as much of the variability as the SVI methods. Higher atmospheric optical depths for July 8 leading to surface reflectance errors are believed to have resulted in overall poorer performance for this date. Use of SVIs employing green wavelengths, improved method for the definition of image minimum and maximum clusters used by the scaled NDVI method, and further development of a soil reflectance index used by the hybrid NN approach are warranted. More importantly, the results demonstrate that reasonable LAI estimates are possible using optical remote sensing methods without in situ, site-specific calibration measurements.

In this paper, laboratory measurement confirmed a relationship between leaf water status and the normalized difference water index (NDWI), derived from near-infrared and shortwave-infrared spectral data. Two results were confirmed: (a) NDWI is related to equivalent water thickness, and, (b) in addition to NDWI, the quantity of leaf material must be known in order to estimate vegetation dryness. Based on these findings, the authors developed a vegetation dryness index (VDI) to estimate global vegetation water content. VDI values, calculated by using SPOT/VEGETATION data, were applied to data from a 1998 forest fire in the Russian Far East. This led to two results: (a) VDI was useful for detecting areas with a high potential for ignition, and (b) VDI may have been able to detect the fire-spread direction. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Two laser acquisitions were carried out on a test site using a Toposys-1 laser scanner. Three-dimensional canopy height models were calculated for both data sets using raster-based algorithms. Object-oriented algorithms were developed for detecting harvested and fallen trees, and for measuring forest growth at plot and stand levels. Out of 83 field-checked harvested trees, 61 could be automatically and correctly detected. All mature harvested trees were detected; it was mainly the smaller trees that were not. Forest growth was demonstrated at plot and stand levels using an object-oriented tree-to-tree matching algorithm and statistical analysis. The precision of the estimated growth, based on field checking or statistical analysis, was about 5 cm at stand level and about 10-15 cm at plot level. The authors expect that the methods may be feasible in large area forest inventories that make use of permanent sample plots. Together with methods for detecting individual sample trees, the methods described may be used to replace a large number of permanent plots with laser scanning techniques. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The scheme has been applied to remotely sensed imaging spectroscopy data acquired by the Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) instrument. This approach was used to identify the minerals calcite, epidote, and chlorite in the upper Animas River watershed, Colorado. The study was motivated by the need to characterize the distribution of calcite in the watershed and assess its acid-neutralizing potential with regard to acidic mine drainage. Identification of these three minerals is difficult because their diagnostic spectral features are all centered at 2.3 mum, and have similar shapes and widths. Previous studies overestimated calcite abundance as a result of these spectral overlaps. The use of a reference library containing synthetic mixtures of the three minerals in varying proportions was found to simplify the task of identifying these minerals when used in conjunction with a rule-based expert system. Some inaccuracies in the mineral distribution maps remain, however, due to. the influence of a fourth spectral component, sericite, which exhibits spectral absorption features at 2.2 and 2.4 mum that overlap the 2.3-mum absorption features of the other three minerals. Whereas the endmember minerals calcite, epidote, chlorite, and sericite can be identified by the method presented here, discrepancies occur in areas where all four occur together as intimate mixtures. It is expected that future work will be able to reduce these discrepancies by including reference mixtures containing sericite. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Abandoned central-pivot agricultural fields in the Manix Basin of southeastern California have introduced deflationary surfaces into the otherwise stable, armored desert surface. This has resulted in sand plumes, eroded from the fields by wind, transported by saltation, and deposited downwind of the fields. Grain size analysis of this wind-transported material reveals a fractionation by size within the plume, with smaller effective particle size toward the toe of the plume. This fractionation results from the greater mobility of smaller particles, and the longer saltation paths they take once airborne. Radiative transfer modeling of quartz grains with absorbing rinds indicates that the differences in grain size observed in the field should be revealed in apparent surface reflectance and are resolvable within the noise-equivalent delta-reflectance of the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) instrument. Analysis of AVIRIS-derived apparent surface reflectance demonstrates the expected negative correlation between effective grain size of sand in the plume and reflectance, with the most significant correlations in the short-wave infrared. The change in reflectance per mm change in particle diameter was -0.06 at lambda similar to 1.7 mum and -0.08 at lambda similar to 2.2 mum with R-2 = 0.89 and 0.93, respectively.

The five-band, I in panchromatic and 4 in multispectral measurements have the potential to provide a source of measurements to evaluate subpixel land cover variability in measurements from observatories such as Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Terra MODIS sensor. The IKONOS observations are at a spatial scale equivalent to field measurements typically carried out in ecological and land cover research. As such, the IKONOS observations may serve as a source of \"virtual\" ground measurements, for the lower spatial resolution, global observatories.   In this study we examine how well IKONOS sensor observations replicate Landsat 7 ETM+ visible/near infrared observations for selected Earth Observation System (EOS) validation sites in the United States. The sites examined-Beltsville, MD, Konza Prairie, KS, and Sevilleta, NM-sample the east-west moisture gradient across the United States. Observations for each site were acquired, as nearly time-coincident as possible, from ETM+ and the IKONOS sensor, several times over the growing season. This was done to insure that we compared these two sensors over the widest range of observing conditions possible.   We also examined IKONOS imagery from Phoenix, AZ, where Space Imaging had and had not applied a modulation transfer function compensation (MTFC) process. The MTFC is their standard product. We found that this product, at the original 4 in spatial resolution, appears to have minor radiometric artifacts as a result of the process. When the IKONOS observations were aggregated to 30 in, this problem was essentially absent, allowing us to proceed with the remainder of our, study.   We processed the IKONOS sensor and ETM+ measurements to produce close approximates of each other. Our processing steps included ortho-rectification, calibration to planetary reflectance, pixel alignment and pixel aggregation. We initially found radiometric differences between the two sensors that increased with increasing wavelength. Space Imaging updated their calibration information, based on analyses from NASA Stennis Space Center staff, which removed much of this discrepancy. We now find that the IKONOS red and near infrared measurements differ between the two sensors, with IKONOS generally producing higher reflectance in the red band and lower reflectance in the near infrared band than the Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor. This results in the IKONOS sensor producing lower spectral vegetation index measurements, for the same target, than ETM+, a measurement variation that has been observed between other sensors.   We also encountered far more cirrus cloud (and shadow) contamination in these paired observations that we had expected. After careful initial selection, we lost over half of our image pairs from the analysis because of cirrus cloud contamination. We do not know whether this is simply because of the paired, comparative design of this study or whether it relates to the increased spatial and radiometric resolution of the IKONOS sensor. The results of this study not only provide a baseline assessment of IKONOS versus Landsat 7 ETM+ visible and near infrared measurements but also suggest some of the issues that need more attention when comparing other sensor systems as well as developing the design of future land observatories.

For modeling an image using MESMA, a parsimonious set of endmembers is desirable for computational efficiency and operational simplicity. This paper presents a method of selecting endmembers from a spectral library for use in MESMA. Endmember average root mean square error (EAR) uses MESMA to determine the average error of an endmember modeling spectra within its land cover class. The minimum EAR endmember is the most representative endmember for a land cover class within the spectral library and can be used to model the larger image.   These techniques were used to map land cover, including four dominant vegetation species, soil, and senesced grass, in the Santa Ynez Mountains above Santa Barbara, CA, USA. Image spectra were extracted from a 20-m resolution airborne visible infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) reflectance image using reference polygons and combined into a library of 915 spectra. Possible confusion between land cover classes was determined using the class average RMSE (CAR). EAR was used to select the single most representative endmember within each land cover class. The six minimum EAR endmembers were used to map the AVIRIS image. Land cover class accuracy was assessed at 88.6%. Using a fractional accuracy assessment, undermodeling of dominant land cover classes and overmodeling of absent land cover classes was found at the pixel scale. Land cover mapped using the minimum EAR endmembers represents a substantial improvement in accuracy over previous efforts. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

It requires a vegetation reflectance model and an inversion method that are accurate and efficient. Usually, the complexity of reflectance models implies to use specific inversion methods (e.g., look-up table and neural network). Unfortunately, these methods are valid only for the view-sun directions for which they are designed. A developed look-up table based inversion method avoids this limitation: it generalizes any look-up table for any view-sun direction, and more generally for any input parameter value. It uses a look-up table made of c(i) coefficients of any analytical expression h that fits a set of reflectance values simulated by the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model. Interpolation on coefficients ci allows h to give reflectance values for any input parameter value. We settled some options of the inversion method with sensitivity studies: tree covers are simulated with 4-tree scenes, expression h has six coefficients c(i) and the interpolation is the continuous first derivative interpolation method. Moreover, the robustness of the inversion method was validated. The ability to generalize a took-up table for any view-sun direction was successfully tested with the inversion of SPOT images of Fontainebleau (France) forest.

Ground-level hyperspectral reflectance signals were collected in a field experiment containing plots of soybean and plots containing soybean intermixed with pitted morningglory in a conventional tillage system. The collected hyperspectral signals contained mixed reflectances for vegetation and background soil in each plot. Pure reflectance signals were also collected for pitted morningglory, soybean, and bare soil so that synthetically mixed reflectance curves could be generated, evaluated, and the mixing proportions controlled. Wavelet detail coefficients were used as features in linear discriminant analysis for automated discrimination between the soil + soybean and the soil + soybean + pitted morningglory classes. A total of 3 6 different mother wavelets were investigated to determine the effect of mother wavelet selection on the ability to detect the presence of pitted morningglory. When the growth stage was two to four leaves, which is still controllable with herbicide, the weed could be detected with at least 87% accuracy, regardless of mother wavelet selection. Moreover, the Daubechies 3, Daubechies 5, and Coiflet 5 mother wavelets resulted in 100% classification accuracy. Most of the best wavelet coefficients, in terms of discriminating ability, were derived from the red-edge and the near-infrared regions of the spectrum. For comparison purposes, the raw spectral bands and principal components were evaluated as possible discriminating features. For the two-leaf to four-leaf weed growth stage, the two methods resulted in classification accuracies of 83% and 81%, respectively. The wavelet-based method was shown to be very promising in detecting the presence of early season pitted morningglory in mixed hyperspectral reflectances. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Monitoring vegetation change in these remote but ecologically sensitive regions is an important task for which satellite remote sensing is well suited. Further difficulties are imposed by the highly dynamic nature of arctic phenology, and by the difficulty of obtaining accurate official data on land cover in arctic Russia even where such data exist. We have approached the problem in a novel fashion by combining a conventional multispectral analysis of satellite imagery with data on current and historical land use gathered by the techniques of social anthropology, using a study site in the Nenets Autonomous Okrug (NAO). A Landsat-7 ETM+ image from the year 2000 was used to generate a current land cover classification. A Landsat-5 TM image was used to generate a land-cover classification for 1988, taking due account of phenological differences and between the two dates. A cautious comparison of these two classifications, again taking account of possible effects of phenological differences, shows that much of the study area has already undergone a notable transformation to grass-dominated tundra, almost certainly as a result of heavy grazing by reindeer. The grazing pattern is quite heterogeneous, and may have reached unsustainable levels in some areas. Finally, we suggest that this situation is unlikely to be unique to our study area and may well be widespread throughout the Eurasian tundra zone, particularly in the west.

Advances in sensor technology continually improve the information content of imagery for airborne, as well as space-borne, systems. This paper investigates whether vegetation associations can be differentiated using hyperspectral reflectance in the visible to shortwave infrared spectral range, and how well species can be separated based on their spectra. For this purpose, the field reflectance spectra of 27 saltmarsh vegetation types of the Dutch Waddenzee wetland were analysed in three steps. Prior to analysis, the spectra were smoothed with an innovative wavelet approach.   In the first stage of the analysis, the reflectance spectra of the vegetation types were tested for differences between type classes. It was found that the reflectance spectra of saltmarsh vegetation types are statistically significantly different for various spectral regions.   Secondly, it was tested whether this statistical difference could be enhanced by using continuum removal as a normalisation technique. For vegetation spectra, continuum removal improves the statistical difference between vegetation types in the visible spectrum, but weakens the statistical difference of the spectra in the near-infrared and shortwave infrared part of the spectrum.   Thirdly, after statistical differences were found, it was determined how distant in spectral space the vegetation type classes were from each other, using the Bhattacharyya (BH) and the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance measures. We selected six wavelengths for this, based on the statistical analysis of the first step. The potential of correct classification of the saltmarsh vegetation types using hyperspectral remote sensing is predicted by these distance measures.   It is concluded that the reflectance of vegetation types is statistically different. With high quality radiometric calibration of hyperspectral imagery, it is anticipated that vegetation species may be identified from imagery using spectral libraries that were measured in the field during the time of image acquisition.

A generalized soil-adjusted vegetation index (GESAVI), theoretically based on a simple vegetation canopy model, is introduced. It is defined in terms of the soil line parameters (A and B) as: GESAVI=(NIR - BR - A)/(R + Z), where Z is related to the red reflectance at the cross point between the soil line and vegetation isolines. As Z is a soil adjustment coefficient, this new index can be considered as belonging to the SAVI family. In order to analyze the GESAVI sensitivity to soil brightness and soil color, both high resolution reflectance data from two laboratory experiments and data obtained by applying a radiosity model to simulate heterogeneous vegetation canopy scenes were used. VIs (including GESAVI, NDVI, PVI and SAVI family indices) were computed and their correlation with LAI for the different soil backgrounds was analyzed. Results confirmed the lower sensitivity of GESAVI to soil background in most of the cases, thus becoming a very efficient index. This good index performance results from the fact that the isolines in the NIR-R plane are neither parallel to the soil line (as required by the PVI) nor convergent at the origin (as required by the NDVI) but they converge somewhere between the origin and infinity in the region of negative values of both NIR and R. This convergence point is not necessarily situated on the bisectrix, as required by other SAVI family indices.

Modeling results were validated against real satellite observations employing AVHRR/NOAA-14 and -15 and MODIS, with a very good agreement. It is shown that for identical atmospheric state and similar surface spectral reflectance, the NDVI and spectral reflectances are sensitive to the sensor\'s SRF. Relative to a reference SRF for AVHRR/NOAA-9, the differences in reflectance among the AVHRRs range from - 25% to 12% for visible channel (red) and from - 2% to 4% for near-infrared (NIR) channel. Absolute change in NDVI among various AVHRRs ranged from - 0.02 to 0.06. The most significant difference was observed for the AVHRR/3. Consistent results were obtained with the AVHRR sensors aboard the following afternoon satellites: NOAA-9, -11, and -12, whereas important discrepancies were found for other AVHRRs aboard NOAA-6 and -10 and especially those launched more recently (NOAA-15 and -16). Reflectance and NDVI measured by MODIS channels I and 2 also exhibit significant differences (up to 30-40%) relative to AVHRR. GLI and VGT have some specific features that should be taken into account when intercomparing surface or top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectance as well as NDVI. Sensitivity of the SRF effect to variable atmospheric state (water vapor, aerosol, and ozone) was also investigated.

The residual aerosol effects result from the assumptions and characteristics of the dark target (DT) approach used to estimate aerosol optical properties in the atmospheric correction scheme (referred to as the dark target-based atmospheric correction, DTAC). The performances of two atmospheric resistant VIs, the atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), were evaluated and compared with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI). The atmospheric resistant VIs successfully minimized the residual aerosol effects, resulting in a 60%, reduction of the errors from the NDVI and SAVI when a proper aerosol model was used for the estimation and correction of aerosol effects. The reductions were greater for thicker aerosol atmosphere (larger aerosol optical thickness, AOT). The atmospheric resistant VIs, however, resulted in having larger bias errors than the NDVI and SAVI when an improper aerosol model was used.

Additional underwater optical measurements and water quality data from Lakes Erie and Michigan and several boreal takes in northern Ontario, as well as comparable data from the European takes Krasnoye, Zug, and Lucerne are utilized to illustrate both the validity of the model, as well as the universality of its application. It was found that, due to the limited availability of specific spectral scattering and absorption properties (optical cross-section spectra) for CPA indigenous to natural water bodies on a global scale, the use of optical cross-section spectra appropriate to the CPA indigenous to Lake Ontario and those appropriate to the CPA indigenous to Lake Ladoga provided a more-than-adequate surrogate for the water bodies considered herein (inclusive of river systems in the British Columbia Canadian Cordillera for which results of a study relating river water color to hydrographic basin features are also revisited). Similarities among the optical cross-section spectra pertinent to freshwater biota and similarities among the optical cross-section spectra pertinent to freshwater dissolved organic matter would appear to allow such a liberal use of site-specific aquatic optical properties. However., greatest discrepancies in indigenous inland water CPA optical cross-section spectra are consequences of global geologic diversities. A compensation for geologic diversities is illustrated by the use of Lake Ladoga cross-section spectra with the European lakes and the Lake Ontario cross-section spectra with the North American lakes., also providing validation of both the radiometric model and its universality. Such geologic similarities could alleviate labor-, time-, and cost-intensive determinations of optical cross-section spectra for many inland water bodies. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

We believe that this is the first observation of internal soliton packets determined from remotely sensed upwelled radiance. We hypothesize that the lineations were produced by changes in the upwelling radiance from the interior of the water column: not by changes in surface reflectance. Using a simulation, it is demonstrated that such lineations carl be produced by vertical modulation of the inherent optical properties (IOPs) during the passage of the internal soliton packet. Since surface manifestations ale not always present, this opens the potential for broadly based inventories of internal solitons in coastal waters.

Therefore? accuracy of the measurement of surface albedo directly affects the results of a climate model. Satellite remote sensing techniques provide a more accurate pixel-level estimation of surface: albedo for climate models than traditional field measurements. However, atmospheric effects and band pass limits of satellite sensors are two factors that limit accurate estimation of surface albedo from satellite data. Furthermore, comparative or global studies require a physically based model that is not optimized on one specific satellite scene, test site, and object class. Atmospheric code 6S can play this important role. Therefore, this payer develops a method for making atmospheric and spectral corrections for estimating surface albedo from satellite data using 6S code. The reliability of this method was tested in Kushiro Mire, Japan using comparisons of estimated and observed albedos. The results show that the satellite-inferred albedos agree well with the field-observed albedos, with the average error found to he about 6%. For spectral-to-broadband albedo conversion (spectral correction), results show that compensated band pass limits are better than extended bond pass limits; thp average error was reduced from 25% to 6%. Results also indicate that a higher spectral resolution sensor is necessary? to more accurately estimate surface albedo. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

The MS-NFI utilises NFI field plot data, optical area satellite images and digital maps and produces forest variable estimates from the single pixel level up to the national level. The most important parameters to be selected are: the distance metric, the number of the nearest neighbours, ii, parameters related to the digital elevation model, stratification of the image data, as well as the width of the moving geographical horizontal and vertical reference areas (HRAs and VRAs). The root mean square errors (RMSEs) and significance of biases at pixel level were evaluated in order to find optimal parameters. A leave-one-out cross-validation method was applied. The emphasis is placed on the search for moving geographical HRAs and VRAs, as well as in the stratification of the field plots and the satellite images on the basis of auxiliary data. Stratification reduces the bias of the estimates significantly within each strata. With the current sampling intensity of the Finnish national forest inventory, a geographical HRA with a radius of 40-50 km was found optimal for the total volume estimates and for volumes by tree species in the mineral land map stratum. On the average, there was a sufficient number of field plots to cover the variation of forest variables within the image area to be analysed. The inclusion of field plot data beyond this area introduced bias to the estimates. For the peatland strata, a wider reference area, 60-90 km, was needed. A VRA together with topographic correction of the digital values of images, reduced the standard error of the volume estimates in Northern Finland. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

The introduction of the balsan woolly adelgid (Adelges piceae) to the Great Smoky Mountains in the late 1950s resulted in widespread mortality of Fraser fir (Abies fraseri), prompting the need for research on disturbance and regeneration. Drawing from methods in spherical statistics, the extended CVA technique measured absolute angular changes and total magnitude of Tasseled Cap indices (brightness, greenness, and wetness). Polar plots and spherical statistics summarized change vectors to quantify and visualize both magnitude and direction of change. Results separated vectors for forest stands by extent a,ld time interval since infestation, as found along the crest of Smokies Range. Changes in the greenness-wetness plane improved prediction of fir class more than brightness-greenness change. Linear discriminant functions found that magnitude and vector angles combined to predict change class 72% correct with three classes and 57% correct in six spruce-fir classes. The technique demonstrates the ability of change vectors in multiple biophysical dimensions to differentiate forest disturbance and regeneration trends as an alternative to nominal forest or land cover classifications.

The knowledge of land cover distribution over large areas is increasingly more important for numerous scientific and policy purposes. Unless a complete detailed map is necessary, a sampling approach is the best strategy for determining the relative proportions of individual cover types because of its cost-effectiveness and speed of application. With coarse resolution land cover maps at continental or global scales increasingly becoming available, the possibility arises of using such maps synergistically with a sample Of high resolution satellite coverage. The goal of such synergy would be to obtain accurate estimates of land cover composition over large areas as well as the knowledge of local spatial distribution. We evaluated PSA performance for sample selection over a 136,432 km(2) area (domain) in the BOREAS Region Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Canada. Two maps were prepared for the domain, one based on NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR, 1 km pixels) and one on LANDSAT Thematic Mapper (TM, 30 m). After dividing the area into 134 tiles, a PSA sample was selected using the AVHRR tiles. A random sample was also selected for comparison. The domain AVHRR cover type fractions were then corrected using TM maps for the selected tiles, following the method of Walsh and Burk (1993). The land cover composition obtained through the combined \"domain AVHRR/sample TM\" data was then compared with the domain TM coverage. We found that PSA provided a representative sample to correct the AVHRR map, particularly for small sample sizes. Compared to the random selection, PSA yielded more accurate results at all tested sampling fractions (up to 30% of all tiles). With a PSA sample of 7% (18%), the average absolute difference per class between the correct and the estimated fraction was 0.058% (0.043%). For the same sample fractions, the average relative error per class runs 16.1% (9.8%) for PSA and 24.5% (18.7%) for random selection. The difference between PSA and random selections was significant at the 0.001 probability level. It is concluded that the PSA strategy is an effective way to combine coarse and fine resolution satellite data to obtain expedient and cost-effective land cover information over large areas. An important benefit of the synergistic combination of the two maps is knowledge of land cover distribution at the landscape level. This is because the coarse resolution map provides the overall distribution patterns across the domain, while the fine resolution map supplies the average composition of the coarse resolution pixels in each cover type. Thus, each coarse pixel can be statistically divided into the component high resolution classes.

A database of top of canopy BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function) of homogeneous canopies was built using simulations by the SAIL, PROSPECT, and SOILSPECT radiative transfer models for a large range of input variables (LAI, mean leaf inclination angle, hot spot parameter, leaves and soil optical properties, date and latitude of observations) considering the accumulation of observations during an orbit cycle of 26 clays. Walthall\'s BRDF model was used to estimate nadir (rho(0)) and hemispherical reflectance (rho(h)). Results showed that rho(0) and rho(h) were estimated with a good accuracy (RMSE = 0.02) even when few observations within a sequence were available due to cloud masking. The rho(0) and rho(h) estimates in the blue (445 nm), the red (645 nm), near-infrared (835 nm), and middle infrared (1665 nm) were then used as inputs to neural networks calibrated for estimation of the canopy biophysical variables using part of the data base. Performances evaluated over he rest of the database showed that variables such as nadir gap fraction (approximate to P-0(58 degrees)approximate to P-0(theta(s))approximate to fAPAR) were accurately estimated by neural networks (relative RMSE<0.05). Results of the estimation of LAI (approximate to LAI.Cab) was less satisfactory since the level of reflectance saturates for high values of LAI (relative RMSE<0.08). The estimation of the directional variation of the gap fraction tons not accurate because the amount of directional information contained in the input variables of the neural network was not sufficient. We also investigated the problem of mixed pixels due to the low spatial resolution associated with large swath sensors. Results showed that variables such as nadir gap fraction were not as sensitive to high levels of heterogeneity in pixels as variables such as leaf area index.

Monitoring outbreaks, and estimating the areas affected, is therefore important for both forest managers and forest ecologists. The objective of our study teas to classify jack pine budworm defoliation levels in Landsat TM imagery recorded precious to and during the 1990-1995 outbreak In our 450,000 ha study area in northwestern Wisconsin (USA). Many precious studies correlated insect defoliation and remotely sensed imagery with moderate to good success, but it often remained unclear if actual defoliation effects or other forest attributes correlated with defoliation were defected. For example, a larger deciduous component in mixed jack pine stands will limit budworm populations and thereby defoliation. The deciduous component in stands is a determining factor for insect defoliation, whereas needle discoloration and tree mortality are their effect. We used pre-outbreak Landsat TM data (1987) to identify determining factors for jack pine budworm population levels and peak-outbreak imagery (1993)for detecting actual defoliation. Our satellite data were atmospherically corrected using a radiative transfer model (5S). Spectral mixture analysis was performed using spectrometer measurements of jack pine needles and bark as representations of surface materials (\"endmembers\"), The explanatory power of the resulting fraction images was evaluated using jack pine budworm population data collected at 33 sampling points. Near-infrared reflectance (NIR) increased in defoliated stands between 1987 and 1993, but single date NIR in each year was negatively correlated with budworm levels in 1993 (r= -0.69 and -0.47). This was because hardwood trees within jack pine stands caused higher NIR reflectance but limited jack pine budworm populations. The 10% NIR difference between pure and mixed jack pine stands outweighed the 3-5% increase in NIR due to defoliation and necessitated stratification of the satellite data by tree species. Spectral mixture analysis performed on pure jack pine stands resulted in a strong negative correlation between the 1993 green needle fraction and the 1993 budworm population data (r=-0.94). This study was, to our knowledge, the first that applied spectral mixture analysis for forest damage detection, and also the first to use insect population measurements as independent field data. These methods and the separation of determinants and effects of jack pine budworm defoliation, enabled us to detect actual defoliation with high accuracy.

Recent advances in computer-aided technology (digital photogrammetry, computerized image processing, and geographical information systems) have opened new possibilities for the extraction of data on vegetation changes from aerial photographs. In this study we describe a computer-based approach for studying landscape-scale, long-term vegetation dynamics, using historical aerial photographs as a major data source. The method we employ consists of four main steps: 1) image scanning and preprocessing (rectification, georeferencing, spectral corrections and mosaicking), 2) image classification and construction of vegetation maps, 3) field validation, and 4) statistical analysis of vegetation changes. We applied our approach by analyzing changes in tree cover over a period of 32 years in a mountainous landscape dominated by Mediterranean maquis in northern Israel and discuss the main limitations and potential error sources of each stage of our analysis. We conclude that digital processing of historical aerial photographs may serve as a powerful tool for the detection, quantification, and analysis of landscape-scale patterns of vegetation dynamics. This conclusion is a important because aerial photographs provide the largest source of information available today for research of long-term vegetation dynamics, and are the only source of information on vegetation dynamics that combines high spatial resolution, large spatial extent, and long-term coverage.

In the past decade, the number of studies have reported strong correlations between the reflectance spectra of vegetation canopies and their foliar biochemical content. However, these studies have commonly employed multiple regression techniques or spectral indices to determine biochemical content, which have been found to be highly sensitive to variation in canopy architecture [such as leaf area index (LAI) and canopy closure] and understory. To date, these effects combined with the low signal-to-noise ratios of airborne spectrometers have inhibited the development of robust and portable spectral techniques for the estimation of canopy biochemical content. This paper reports on a theoretical study in which a leaf model, LIBERTY (leaf incorporating biochemicals exhibiting reflectance and transmittance yields), characterized specifically for conifer needles, was coupled with a hybrid geometric/radiative transfer bidirectional reflectance distribution function FLIGHT (forest light) model. By varying leaf biochemical content, LAI, canopy closure and understory, we analyzed the simulated canopy reflectance spectra to determine if the biochemical adsorption features in leaf spectra were preserved at the canopy scale. Absorption features or wavelength regions that were both related to a specific biochemical of interest (water, lignin-cellulose) and persistent at the scale of both the leaf and the canopy were identified at a number of wavelengths or wavelength regions.

In this study, the effects of changing from the SSM/I F11 to the F13 satellite are examined for a 5-month overlap period. In terms of hemispheric averages of mean ice concentration, the biases introduced by the switch from F11 to F13 are slight and are not statistically significant in most areas, although relatively large and significant differences are seen in some regions. Furthermore, differences in sea ice extent and total ice covered area between the two platforms were found to be statistically significant. Previous efforts to reduce such differences in geophysical parameters between earlier SSM/Is have focused on, Establishing relationships between the brightness temperatures. However, we find the relations between the F11 and F13 brightness temperatures to be highly sensitive to the region chosen for the analysis. Consequently, the choice of sample has a substantial effect on the sensor-to-sensor adjustment and on the resulting sea ice concentrations. Furthermore, analysis of ice concentrations between F8 and F11 and between F11 and F13 shows that current attempts at a relative calibration of the true instruments do not offer a significant improvement in corresponding ice fractions.

BEPS uses principles of FOREST biogeochemical cycles (FOREST-BGC) (Running and Coughlan, 1988) for quantifying the biophysical processes governing ecosystems productivity, but the original model is modified to better represent canopy radiation processes. A numerical scheme is developed to integrate different data types: remote sensing data a 1-km resolution in lambert conformal conic projection, daily meteorological data in Gaussian or longitude-latitude gridded systems, and soil data grouped in polygons. The processed remote sensing data required int he model are leaf area index (LAI) and land-cover type. The daily meteorological data include air temperature, incoming shortwave radiation, precipitation, and humidity. The soil-data input is the available water-holding capacity. The major outputs of BEPS include spatial fields of net primary productivity (NPP) and evapotranspiration. The NPP calculated by BEPS has been tested against biomass data obtained in Quebec, Canada. A time series of LAI over the growing season of 1993 in Quebec was derived by using 10-day composite normalized difference vegetation index images acquired by the advanced very high resolution radiometer at 1-km resolution (resampled). Soil polygon data were mosaicked, georeferenced, and rasterized in a geographic information system (ARC/INFO). With the use of the process-based model incorporating all major environmental variables affecting plant growth and development, detailed spatial distributions of NPP (annual and four seasons) in Quebec are shown in this paper. The accuracy of NPP calculation is estimated to be 60% for single pixels and 75% for 3x3 pixel areas (9 km(2)). The modeled NPP ranges from 0.6 kg C/m(2)/year at the southern border to 0.01 kg C/m(2)/year at the northern limit of the province. The total annual NPP in Quebec is estimated top be 0.24 Gt C in 1993, which is about 0.3-0.4% of the global NPP.

The main physical characteristics to consider are surface roughness, soil moisture, and morphology. Color compositions show differences between the two dates. Recently deposited lahars may have high or low roughness at the surface and are wet. Running lahars have a tumultuous rough surface. Recently deposited or running lahars have high backscatter values which differ from low values of more ancient flat smooth-surfaced dry lahar sediments or lahars covered by shallow quiet water. Shallow quiet waters covering more ancient rough lahar surfaces are also detected. Anastomotic streams, fanlike patterns, closure or infilling of lakes, and migration of streams are also morphologic expressions of lahar deposits. Flooded areas during typhoons can be recognized from their location in large coastal plains, while lahars occur along main river beds and nearby.

PCM is an agricultural management system designed to target crop ann soil inputs according to within-field requirements to optimize profitability and protect the environment. Progress in PCM has been hampered by a lack of timely, distributed information an crop and soil conditions. Based on a review of the information requirements of PCM, eight areas were identified in which image-based remote sensing technology could provide in formation that is currently lacking or inadequate. Recommendations were made for applications with potential for near-term implementation with available remote sensing technology and instrumentation. We found that both aircraft- and satellite-based remote sensing could provide valuable information for PCM applications. Images from aircraft-based sensors have a unique role for monitoring seasonally variable crop/soil conditions and for time-specific and time-critical crop management; current satellite-based sensors have limited, but important, applications; and upcoming commercial Earth observation satellites mall provide the resolution, timeliness, and high quality required for many PCM operations. The current limitations for image-based remote sensing applications are mainly due to sensor attributes, such as restricted spectral range, coarse spatial resolution, slow turnaround time, and inadequate repeat coverage. According to experts in PCM, the potential market for remote sensing products in PCM is good. Future work should be focused on assimilating remotely sensed information into existing decision support systems (DSS), acid conducting economic and technical analysis of remote sensing applications with season-long pilot projects.

The model corresponds to the Scattering by Arbitrary Inclined Leaves (SAIL) model (Verhoef, 1984) in which the term for first order scattering is corrected for hot-spot and leaf specular reflectance. Leaf optical properties are calculated using the PROSPECT model (Jacquemoud and Baret, 1990). Experimental data correspond to a two-year experiment and express a large variability of leaf area index, chlorophyll concentration and soil background optical properties. In the first data set, reflectance was measured about midday under vertical viewing in five optical Thematic Mapper bands. In the second data set, bath vertical and oblique measurements (zenith angle 45 degrees, four azimuth angles) were performed from sunrise to sunset in the three SPOT bands. Except for leaf cuticle reflectance, structure and optical variables were measured in the field or adjusted to field measurement, independently of reflectance calculations. Although the structure of sugar beet canopies departs strongly from a turbid medium, a good agreement with measurements was obtained in the case of vertical, north and south view directions. However, the model underestimated the measurements close to the hot-spot direction. In the near infrared, there was also some underestimation of canopy reflectance in the opposite direction to the hot-spot. Possible reasons for these differences are discussed.

It is based on Shannon and Wiener information theory. In the case of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar images, we propose to compute redundancy either at the radiometric level, according to the error bar on measurement, or at the class level, according to supervised or unsupervised classification results. The advantage of the comparison at the class level is that both polarimetric information and spatial neighborhood information are considered, and therefore the comparison is performed at a higher level of information.   This measurement has been applied to the study of redundancy between L and C bands from spaceborne imaging radar C images of the Orgeval test site, located in the east of Paris (France), versus incidence angle. It is shown that the redundancy between the two bands increases from about 20% to 30% when incidence angle increases from 44 degrees to 57 degrees. Based on the analysis of classification results in terms of redundancy with ground truth, an interpretation of this result is proposed. Finally, the great complementarity between the two bands is used to improve classification results, by performing data fusion between the two bands.

The propelled dust is deposited on the adjacent vegetation where it may cause detrimental effects to the plants of the highly fragile tundra. During a field experiment in 1991, all meteorological parameters as well as the size distribution of the deposited dust particles were measured. This data was used to calculate the dust distribution pattern and the amount of dust transferred into the vegetation at specific locations along the Dalton highway. The scope of this article is to identify and, as far as possible, to quantify this dust deposition pattern along the Dalton Highway by multispectral SPOT imagery. The Spatial distribution of the dust on both sides of the road is distinctly visible in the XS3 channel (0.79-0.89 mu m) of a SPOT satellite image. On the basis of the ground reflectance and the reflectances of pure dust and pure vegetation, the dust load can be calculated. The dust load depends on the particle size distribution, which can be derived from the size spectra measured in the field experiment. The spatial dust load obtained from the SPOT data is compared with the distribution computed with the simulation model. As the simulation is based on only a limited number of days, the dust load scaling is arbitrary. Taking this fact into account, the general shapes of the two distributions agree remarkably well within a strip of about 1 km width along the road. Apart from this application on a local scale, suspended dust might also be detected on larger scales, for example, as volcanic ash or as tropospheric or stratospheric aerosols.RP KELLER, J (通讯作者)，PAUL SCHERRER INST,CH-5232 VILLIGEN,SWITZERLAND.RI Keller, Johannes/C-7732-2009', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 16, 31, 38, 0, 11, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE PUBL CO INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Reflectance of fresh, green vegetation in the 1.0-2.5 mu m region is dominated by liquid water absorption and also weakly affected by absorption due to biochemical components, such as protein, lignin, and cellulose. We have developed both the nonlinear and linear least squares spectrum-matching techniques for deriving equivalent water thickness (EWT) of vegetation from AVIRIS data in the 1.0 mu m and 1.6 mu m regions. EWT values are compared with in situ canopy measurements in Harvard Forest, Massachusetts. Seasonal variations of EWTs over an agricultural area in Greeley, Colorado are determined. EWTs from the 1.0 mu m region are generally greater than those from the 1.6 mu m region. This is because the absorptivity of water near 1.0 mu m is much less than that at 1.6 mu m-resulting in a greater mean absorption path length in the 1.0 mu m region. After fitting the AVIRIS data with a reflectance spectrum of water, a weak lignin-cellulose absorption feature centered at 1.72 mu m is seen in the difference spectra. We map the depth of the 1.72-mu m feature, which can be considered as an index of abundance of those compounds in the canopy. AVIRIS data for the Harvard Forest, Massachusetts were analyzed and compared with laboratory chemical analysis of the foliage.

The four structural parameters (N, LAI, theta(l) and s) were poorly estimated, indicating instability in the inversion process; however, the two biochemical parameters (C-ab and C-w) were evaluated reasonably well, except over very bright soils. In a second attempt, three of the four structure variables were assigned a fixed value corresponding to the average observed in the experiment. Inversions performed to retrieve the remaining structure variable, leaf area index, and the two biochemical variables showed large improvements in the accuracy of LAI, but slightly poorer performance for C-ab and C-w. Here again, poor results were obtained with very bright soils. The compensations observed between the LAI and C-ab or C-w led us to evaluate the performance of two more-synthetic variables, canopy chlorophyll content or canopy water content; for these the inversions produced reasonable estimates.

As a result of frequent rainfall, drought stress never occurred. However, exposure to herbicide rapidly induced plant stress. By day 4, the ratio of variable to maximum of leaf fluorescence (F-v/F-m) decreased and leaf water potentials (psi(w)) increased in the herbicide treated soybean, indicating damage to the photosynthetic apparatus and stomatal closure. Also, Munsell leaf color had increased from approximately 5GY 4.6/5.7 to a lighter green-yellow value. Canopy reflectances at 670 nm , 694 nm, and in the 410-740 nm band (R(vis)), as well as reflectance at 694 nm divided by reflectance at 760 nm (R(694)/R(760)), detected stress simultaneously with the physiological measurements and increased consistently with stress through day 7. Reflectances at 420 nm and 600 nm, together with R(600)/R(760) and R(vis)/R(760), did not increase until leaves were yellow or brown and wilted and canopies had begun to collapse on day 7. None of the reflectance or reflectance ratio images detected stress prior to visible color changes. This was attributed primarily to the rapid inducement of chlorosis by the herbicide. Reflectance in narrow wavebands within the 690-700 nm region and its ratio with near-infrared reflectance should provide earlier detection of stress-induced chlorosis compared with broad band systems or narrow bands located at lesser wavelengths.RP CARTER, GA (通讯作者)，NASA, EARTH OBSERVAT RES OFF, BAY ST LOUIS, MS 39529 USA.RI 黄, 建荣 J/B-8070-2011', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 34, 192, 207, 0, 39, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

This study examined the potential for the satellite-based TM sensor to serve as a regular monitoring tool. Atmospherically corrected TM digital data acquired on four dates over summer 1990/91 and concurrent field measurements collected at the time of the satellite over-pass over the Peel-Harvey Estuarine System (32 degrees 30\'S lat. 115 degrees 40\'E long.) were used to obtain multitemporal, empirical algorithms for predicting pigment concentration, Secchi disk depth (SDD), and salinity.

Yet, unambiguous detection has proven an elusive goal. This article presents new thermal infrared spectra of oil slicks made from five different crude oil samples with a wide range of API gravities and compositions. After a brief outgassing phase, all oil slick spectra are quite similar and little affected by thickness, extended exposure to air or sunlight, and even by emulsification with seawater (mousse formation). Thus, oil slicks provide a remarkably unvarying spectral signature as remote sensing targets in the thermal infrared compared to other regions of the spectrum. This spectral signature in the 8-14 mum atmospheric window is flat, with an average reflectance of 4%. Seawater, on the other hand, has a spectrum that varies in reflectance with wavelength in the 8-14 mum window from 0.90 to 3.65%. In addition, we show that sea foam displays a reflectance spectrum quite similar to that of seawater in the 8-14 mum region, because the very high absorption coefficient of water in this wavelength region prevents volume scattering in foam bubbles. This results in a relatively uniform spectral background, against which oil slicks can be detected, based on their different spectral signature.

Results of this study show quantitatively for the first time that the spectra Of particulate mixtures of silicate minerals in this wavelength region combine linearly by volume within a very small error, as long as particles are much larger than the wavelength so that volume scattering is insignificant compared to surface scattering. Results here apply specifically to mineral samples in the 75-250 mum size range. They imply that we can predict the spectral response of a rock if the constituent minerals and their abundances are known. More importantly, our results indicate that the relative quantities of minerals in simple mixtures can be predicted to within 12% in the worst case, and more typically to within 5%. Consequently, geologists should be able to unmix the composite spectra Of rocks to determine mineral abundances.

To address these issues, \'a theoretical optical model was used to simulate Landsat MSS data, upon which chromaticity analyses were performed. The model was calibrated for Chilko Lake materials, and was tested using water samples taken at the same time as two MSS images of the lake. The study showed that the use of brightness and chromaticity X separated the effect of SM from that of C and YS, but that C and YS could not be separated because their absorption spectra were similar. Thus it may be possible to measure SM and a combined C and YS variable (CYS) simultaneously, but it is not possible to measure all three variables simultaneously using MSS imagery. The study also showed that the V-shaped locus, which is unlike those previously reported, is the natural consequence of a SM gradient as it approaches zero when atmospheric radiance is included in the image signal. The shape of the locus is not unique to Chilko Lake, but probably has not been reported before because most chromaticity studies have not encountered such low SM concentrations. Classified maps for SM and CYS were produced for Chilko Lake. As expected, highest SM concentrations were found at the months of creeks carrying glacial meltwater. Highest CYS concentrations were associated with known sites of high YS or with the western shore and south end of the lake.

This enables them to be estimated and mapped from sparse sample data by kriging. These properties (primary variables) are usually related to the radiation they reflect: They are coregionalized with it. In many circumstances the primary variables can be estimated more precisely by measuring, in addition, the radiation sparsely, using a ground-based radiometer and combining the two by cokriging. The coregionalization must be formalized in a coherent set of variograms, one for the primary variable, one for each variable derived from the radiometry, and the cross variograms between all pairs of variables involved in the estimation. Given this set, it is possible to determine estimation variances for any configuration of sampling and to design an optimal scheme that will achieve a desired precision for least effort. The formulae for cokriging are presented, as are the conditions for a coherent model of the coregionalization, and the article shows how these can be used to design sampling schemes that combine survey of the primary variables and radiation to best advantage.

Results suggest that trend surface techniques can be effective in removing region-scale variation in image radiances that are related to uneven illumination, intermittent cloud cover, and variation in the surface temperature field. The dominant effects of illumination in Channel 2 (visible) data, caused by variable sun angle and proximity of the scene to the terminator, can be minimized by removing (subtracting) the first- and second-order trend surfaces from the raw image. These low-order surfaces also remove regional variation in the surface temperature field, which leads to marginal improvement in binary images derived from Channel 4 (infrared) data. Optimum results for both Channel 2 and Channel 4 data are achieved when the third- and fourth-order surfaces are subtracted to remove local temperature and illumination anomalies that occur at smaller spatial scales, primarily in the vicinity of clouds. Application of higher order surfaces fails to improve image quality. There is some indication that the topography of these higher-order surfaces in part maps regional variation in lead density. Use of a best fit criterion based on a strict variance technique (such as the least-squares method) to define the trend surface limits the effectiveness of the technique in this application. Criteria that allow for data to be weighted based on their distance from the plane about which they cluster are more appropriate to the structure of AVHRR radiance data typical of images that show sea ice.

The aim of this research was to determine the effect of a second leaf pigment, red amaranthin, on the relationship between red edge and chlorophyll concentration.  The red edge, chlorophyll concentration, and amaranthin concentration were recorded for 163 amaranth leaves in the laboratory.  Experimental treatments with nitrate and salts caused a very concentration (0-20 mg / g), and amaranthin concentration (0-0.47 mg / g).  There was a near-linear relationship between red edge and chlorophyll concentration for leaves with low amaranthin concentration (< 0.075 mg / g).  This relationship was strongest for leaves from vegetative plants and was similar in form to that observed for a canopy.  By contrast the red edge was at longer wavelengths and independent of chlorophyll concentration for leaves with high amaranthin concentration (> 0.075 mg / g), as a result of the strong absorption of visible light by amaranthin and the resultant movement of the red / near infrared boundary to longer wavelengths at higher amaranthin concentrations.  This is the first reported study on the effect of a second leaf pigment on the relationship between red edge and chlorophyll concentration.  The results suggest that the presence of a second leaf pigment would limit the use of a remotely sensed red edge for the estimation of chlorophyll concentration.', 'NASA,AMES RES CTR,TGS TECHNOL INC,MOFFETT FIELD,CA 94035.

In this paper, the availability, data quality, and quantity of a number of spaceborne radar altimetry missions (including Topex/Poseidon (TP), ERS-2, Envisat, Jason-1/-2/-3, CryoSat-2, Saral, and Sentinel-3) are investigated. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first paper to investigate the influences of onboard trackers, satellite flying directions, and land contamination on Level-1 waveforms and Level-2 measurements over large mountainous lakes. The analyses were conducted over eight Tibetan lakes, which are of varying sizes from ca. 93 to 1046 km2 and are sampled by multiple altimeters. From the results presented in this paper, it is demonstrated that the previous generation of altimeters, such as TP, Jason-1, ERS-2, and Envisat, shows a higher percentage of data unavailability and lower valid observation rates. Investigations of Level-1 waveforms show onboard tracker failing in locking on the lake surface, resulting in data loss or invalid measurements. In addition, the onboard tracking systems are sometimes unstable, resulting in larger along-track standard deviations (SD) (SD > 15 cm). In contrast, the recent generation of altimeters, i.e., Jason-3 and Sentinel-3 with open-loop tracking mode, significantly increases the data availability (> 90% passes and > 60% individual observations) and delivers higher precision measurements (SD around 10 cm). Moreover, the waveform leading edge is very consistent, indicating more stable onboard tracking. Higher quality Jason-3 and Sentinel-3 data allow monitoring of sub-and quasi-monthly lake variations, which are not revealed by e. g., TP and ERS-2 data due to poorer signal-to-noise ratios. Exceptionally, Saral Ka-band altimeter, operated in closed-loop tracking mode, is less affected by flying directions and land contamination (topography and land-scapes), delivering high quality measurements (SD around 7 cm for 40 Hz).This study provides a comprehensive comparison of multiple altimeters in monitoring lakes in mountainous areas, and demonstrates the substantial improvements achieved in the past decades. However, care has to be taken when merging data from old generation altimetry missions over mountainous lakes. The lessons learned from these Tibetan lakes can be taken across to other mountain lakes.', '[Jiang, Liguang] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.

Satellite-derived estimates of surface PM2.5 developed from a combination of satellites, simulations, and ground monitor data are relied upon for health impact studies. The ability to develop satellite-derived PM2.5 estimates requires the continued availability of aerosol optical depth (AOD) sources. This work examines the impact of the addition or loss of satellite AOD data sources on global PM2.5 estimation and the impact of continuing the longterm record with AOD from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi-National Polar orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite after the loss of the MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and MISR (Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer) instruments on board the Terra and Aqua satellites. We find that the addition of VIIRS S-NPP AOD products to geophysical PM2.5 estimates from satellites and simulations causes regional differences that correspond to differences in the VIIRS and MODIS Deep Blue AOD algorithms and sampling. Changes in long-term trends and timeseries due to the addition or loss of AOD data sources are generally within their uncertainties. Statistical fusion with ground monitor data partially corrects for changes due to sampling differences when introducing the VIIRS AOD products, but uncertainty remains over desert regions where ground monitor coverage is sparse. This work provides promise for the sustained development of global satellite-derived PM2.5 estimates, despite discontinuities in instruments and retrieval methods.', '[Hammer, Melanie S.; van Donkelaar, Aaron; Bindle, Liam; Martin, Randall V.] Washington Univ, Dept Energy Environm & Chem Engn, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.

However, mountain settlements are often omitted from global land cover analyses due to the low spatial resolution of satellite images, which cannot resolve the small scale of mountains settlements. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the potential of deep learning to detect human settlements in mountains at the sub-pixel level, based on Landsat satellite imagery. We hypothesized that adding spatial and temporal features could improve the detection of mountain settlements since spectral information alone led to inaccurate results. For spatial features, we compared a U-shaped neural network (U-Net), a deep learning algorithm that automatically learns spatial features, with a simple random forest (RF) algorithm. Then, we assessed whether temporal features would increase accuracy by comparing two input datasets, multispectral imagery and temporal features from the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm. We evaluated each method by calculating the accuracies of (1) the binary settlement footprint, (2) the subpixel estimates of impervious surfaces, and (3) urban growth. We tested the accuracies using visually interpreted datasets from time-series Google Earth images across the Hindu Kush Himalaya that were not used for training to evaluate model transferability. The U-Net successfully improved mountain settlement mapping compared to the random forest, with a substantial discrepancy in small settlements. The time-series results from the U-Net successfully captured long-term urban growth but fewer short-term changes. Contrary to expectations, the CCDC temporal features reduced the accuracy of mountain settlement mapping due to frequent cloud cover in hilly areas. Our subpixel analysis reveals that the built-up area of the Hindu Kush Himalaya has expanded at a rate of 61 km2 per year from 1990 to 2020, which is about twice the estimate of the Global Human Settlement Layer using binary urban/non-urban classifications.', '[Chen, Tzu-Hsin Karen; Pandey, Bhartendu; Seto, Karen C.] Yale Univ, Yale Sch Environm, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.

This suggests that the application of FF-SAR altimetry might give potential gains over unfocused SAR (UF-SAR) altimetry to resolve and mitigate small-scale interferers in the along-track direction to improve the accuracy and precision of the geophysical estimates.   The objective of this study is to assess the applicability of FF-SAR-processed Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich (S6-MF) coastal altimetry data to obtain SWH estimates as close as possible to the coast.   We have developed a multi-mission FF-SAR processor and applied the coastal retracking algorithm CORALv2 to estimate SWH. We assess different FF-SAR and UF-SAR processing configurations, as well as the baseline Level-2 product from EUMETSAT, by comparison with the coastal, high-resolution SWAN-Kuststrook wave model from the Deltares RWsOS North Sea operational forecasting system. This includes the evaluation of the correlation, the median offset, and the percentage of cycles with high correlation as a function of distance to the nearest coastline. Moreover, we analyse the number of valid records and the L2 noise of the records. The case study comprises five coastal crossings of S6-MF that are located along the Dutch coast and the German coast along the East Frisian Islands in the North Sea.   We observe that accurate and precise SWH records can be estimated in the nearshore zone within 1-3 km from the coast using satellite SAR altimetry. We find that the FF-SAR-processed dataset with a Level-1b posting rate of 140 Hz shows the greatest similarity with the wave model. We achieve a correlation of similar to 0.8 at 80% of valid records and a gain in precision of up to 29% of FF-SAR vs UF-SAR for 1-3 km from the coast. FF-SAR shows, for all cycles, a high correlation of greater than or equal to 0.8 for 1-3 km from the coast. We estimate the decay of SWH from offshore at 30 km to up to 1 km from the coast to amount to 26.4% +/- 3.1%.', '[Schlembach, Florian; Passaro, Marcello; Dettmering, Denise; Seitz, Florian] Tech Univ Munich DGFI TUM, Deutsch Geodat Forsch Inst, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.

As global warming accelerates, it is widely acknowledged that extreme precipitation will become more frequent and intense, calling for more accurate historical and projected precipitation estimation. Identifying extreme pre-cipitation events is understudied particularly on the global scale, given that most studies only focus on pixel-by -pixel characteristics while ignoring the space-time continuity and evolution of extreme events. This study utilizes an object-based tracking method to track the precipitation system objects in time, extracting spatiotemporal attributes of precipitation events and investigates variable definitions of extremes for a better understanding of the performance of existing precipitation datasets. Five satellite and two reanalysis precipitation products (IMERG, GSMaP, PERSIANN-CCS, TRMM 3B42, CMORPH, ERA5, and ERA-Interim) are involved to investigate (1) the difference and similarity of those datasets in depicting the global pattern of extreme precipitation, (2) the impact of various definitions of extreme events, and (3) the trend of global extreme precipitation events. Results show that the object-based method can capture the motion of precipitation events. Different extreme definitions have a large impact on the distribution, trend, and features of extreme precipitation. The inter-comparison of extreme precipitation events from different products shows low correlation, indicating that accurately capturing the evolution of extreme events is still challenging. Reanalysis product-based analysis shows variable trends (magnitudes and signs) based on different attributes of precipitation objects and notable scale effect. Satellite precipitation products exhibit distinct inter-annual variability which could affect their hydrometeorological applications.

However, the maximum fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (Max-FPAR) compositing strategy of the Collection 6 (C6) products dictates that the main or backup algorithm is always triggered by observations of different quality, which indirectly causes the observed instability in the LAI time-series. Based on MODIS daily LAI retrievals, this study develops a prior knowledge time-series compositing algorithm (PKA) using a linear kernel driven (LKD) model. Our results show that the newly proposed PKA can significantly improve the LAI composites compared to the Max-FPAR strategy using ground-based observations for validation. We found that the PKA performs better than Max-FPAR in various aspects (different sites, seasons, and retrieval index (RI) ranges), with R2 increasing from 0.69 to 0.76 and root means square error (RMSE) decreasing from 1.01 to 0.84 compared to GBOV ground truth. The same improvement was shown for the ground truth LAIs measured at the Honghe and Hailun sites in northeastern China, with R2 increasing from 0.23 to 0.41 and RMSE decreasing from 1.27 to 1.25. In addition, three newly proposed temporal uncertainty metrics (time-series stability, TSS and time -series anomaly, TSA and reconstruction error metric, RE (the proximity to the main RT-based retrievals)) were applied to compare the stability of LAI time-series before and after PKA implementation. We found that the time series stability of PKA LAI was improved, the time series anomalies were reduced, and the retrieval rates of the main algorithm were also greatly enhanced compared to Max-FPAR LAI. A case intercomparison for Max-FPAR-MODIS, Max-FPAR-VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite), and PKA-MODIS LAIs in the Amazon Forest region showed that the PKA is also effective in improving the LAI retrieval over large regions with few qualified observations due to poor atmospheric conditions (RE decreased from 2.37/2.35 (Max-FPAR-MODIS/Max-FPAR-VIIRS) to 2.25 (PKA-MODIS) and RI increased from 61.94%/59.62% to 66.88%). The same improvement was seen in the BELMANIP 2.1 sites for almost all biomes except deciduous broadleaf forest, where the RE decreased from 1.85/2.13 to 1.15 overall.

These wetlands provide important ecosystem services, such as providing habitat for fish and wildlife, enhancing water quality, ameliorating flooding impacts, supporting coastal food webs, and protecting upslope areas from erosion. Mapping irregularly flooded wetlands is challenging given their expansive coverage and dynamic nature. Furthermore, coastal wetlands are expected to change over the coming century due to sea-level rise and changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme storms. Consequently, coastal managers need baseline information on the spatial distribution of wetlands along with efficient and repeatable methods for observing changes. In this study, we used coastal wetlands from existing land use land cover data, best available lidar-derived digital elevation models, and Monte Carlo simulations to incorporate elevation un-certainty to create a probabilistic map of irregularly flooded wetlands along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast (USA). Our approach integrated findings from a review of coastal wetland elevation error in lidar datasets and an analysis of spatial autocorrelations of wetland elevation. We found a positive correlation (r = 0.563, p < 0.0001) when comparing the probability estimated from a digital elevation model and in situ elevation observations. The differences in probability had a mean bias error of-0.04 (i.e., digital elevation model-based probability tends to be slightly lower), a mean absolute error of 0.20, and a root mean square error of 0.26. Beyond this overall validation, we explored error metrics for land cover classes and lidar collection details. To quantify areal coverage of the probabilistic output, we classified the probability values into equal bins using an interval of 0.33. The areal coverage of the lowest probability bin (\"unlikely\"; probability <= 0.33) was separated into the upper and lower portions of the irregularly flooded wetland zone. Of the coastal wetlands along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast about 38% were classified as unlikely and low with the greatest coverage in south Louisiana and the Ev-erglades and around 33% were classified as unlikely and high with the greatest coverage in the Everglades and Texas. The relative coverage within the highest probability bin (\"likely\"; probability >0.66) covered around 13%, with the greatest coverage in south Florida, south Louisiana, and Texas. The framework developed in this study can be transferred to other coastal wetland areas and updated to observe changes with sea-level rise.', '[Enwright, Nicholas M.] US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, 700 Cajundome Blvd, Lafayette, LA 70506 USA.

However, the earliest satellite-based land cover maps typically date back to the 1980s only, after 30-m Landsat data became available. Our goal was to develop a methodology to automatically map land cover for large areas using high-resolution panchromatic Corona spy satellite imagery for 1964. Specifically, we a) conducted a comprehensive analysis on the feature selection and parameter setting for largearea classification processes for 2.5-m historical panchromatic Corona imagery for a full suite of land cover classes, b) compared the pixel-based and object-oriented methods of classifying the land cover, and c) examined the benefits of adding a digital elevation model for the pixel-based and object-oriented land cover classifications. We mapped land cover in parts of the Caucasus Mountains (158,000 km2), a study area with great variability in land cover types and illumination conditions. The overall accuracies of our pixel-based and object-oriented land cover maps were 63.0 & PLUSMN; 5.0% and 67.3 & PLUSMN; 4.0%, respectively, showing that object-oriented classifications performed better for Corona satellite data. Incorporating the digital elevation model improved the overall accuracy to 75.3 & PLUSMN; 3.0% and 78.7 & PLUSMN; 2.5%, respectively. The digital elevation model was especially useful for differentiating forest and snow-and-ice from lakes in mountainous areas affected by cast shadows. Our results highlight the feasibility of accurately and automatically classifying land cover for large areas based on Corona spy satellite imagery for the 1960s. Such land cover maps predate the earliest 30-m Landsat land cover classifications by two decades, and those from high-resolution satellite imagery by four decades. As such, we demonstrate here that Corona imagery can make important contributions to global change science.', '[Rizayeva, Afag; Radeloff, Volker C.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, SILVIS Lab, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

However, data gaps, resulting from clouds and other factors, reduce coverage unevenly (to just about 20%) and make it difficult to analyze the temporal variability of Chl and SST on sub-seasonal time scales. Here, we present a MOving Standard deviation Saturation (MOSS) method to enable the analysis of sparse time series (with as little as 10% of the data). We apply the method to identify the dominating (sub-annual) timescales of variability, zd, for SST and Chl in every region. We find that zd values for Chl and SST are not consistent or correlated with each other over large areas, and in general, SST varies on longer timescales than Chl, i.e. zd(SST) >zd(Chl). There is a threefold variability in zd for SST and Chl even within regions that are traditionally considered to be biogeographically homogeneous. The largest zd for Chl is generally found on the equatorial side of the trade wind belts, whereas the smallest zd are found in the tropical Pacific and near coasts, especially where upwelling is common. If the temporal variability in Chl and SST were driven largely by ocean dynamics or advection by the flow, regional patterns of zd for SST and Chl should co-vary. This is seen in coastal upwelling zones, but more broadly, the lack of coherence between zd(Chl) and zd(SST) suggests that biological processes, such as phytoplankton growth and loss, decouple the timescales of Chl variability from those of SST and generate shorter term variability in Chl.', '[Jonsson, Bror F.; Atwood, Elizabeth C.; Sathyendranath, Shubha] Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth, England.

As a consequence, surface water extent estimates and their temporal variations remain challenging especially in equatorial river basins. Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) L-band signals recorded onboard Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) mission, composed of 8 Low Elevation Orbit (LEO) satellites, provide infor-mation on surface properties at high temporal resolution from 2017 up to now. CYGNSS bistatic observations were analyzed for detecting permanent water and seasonal floodplains over the full coverage of the mission, from 40 degrees S to 40 degrees N. We computed CYGNSS reflectivity associated to the coherent component of the received power, that was gridded at 0.1 degrees spatial resolution with a 7-day time sampling afterwards. Several statistical metrics were derived from CYGNSS reflectivity, including the weighted mean and standard deviation, the median and the 90th percentile (respectively rmean, rstd, rmedian and r90%) in each pixel. These parameters were clustered using the K -means algorithm with an implementation of the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) similarity measure. They were compared to static inundation maps, and to dynamic estimations of surface water extent both at the global and regional scales, using the Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites (GIEMS) and MODIS-based products. The difference between r90% and rmedian shows the best sensitivity to the presence of water. The river streams and lakes are correctly detected, and a strong seasonality is identified in CYGNSS reflectivity over the largest floodplains, with the exception of the Cuvette Centrale of Congo which is covered by dense vegetation. This seasonal reflectivity signal correlates well with inundation maps: Pearson\'s correlation coefficient between rmedian and surface water extent from both GIEMS and MODIS is over 0.8 in the largest floodplains. The spatial patterns of reflectivity are consistent with static inundation maps: at the time of maximum flooding extent, a spatial correlation coefficient around 0.75 with rmedian is obtained for several basins. We also evaluated the dependence of CYGNSS-derived clusters and reflectivity on the dominant land cover type and on the density of Above Groud Biomass (AGB) in the pixel. On the one hand, misclassifications of flooded pixels were observed over vegetated regions, probably due to uncertainties related to the attenuation by the vegetation in both CYGNSS and reference datasets. On the other hand, flooded pixels with a mean AGB up to similar to 300 Mg/ha were correctly detected with the clustering. High reflectivity values are also observed over rocky soils in arid regions and create false alarms. Finally, strong winds on large lakes cause surface roughness, and lower reflectivity values are observed in this case which weaken the detection of open water. While these constraints are to be taken in account and corrected in a future model, a pan-tropical mapping of surface water extent dynamics using CYGNSS can be envisaged.', '[Zeiger, Pierre] Univ Paul Sabatier Ups, Lab Etud Geophys & Oceanog Spatiale LEGOS, Toulouse, France.

Although SWIM shows a reasonable performance for capturing spectral peak, the accuracy of mean wave periods (MWPs) computed directly from the SWIM spectra is not satisfying due to the high noise level of the spectra. SWIM can also provide good-quality simultaneous wind speed (U10) and significant wave height (SWH) like an altimeter. The MWP can also be estimated using a U10-SWH look-up table presented in previous studies. However, the accuracy of this method is also limited as the U10-SWH look-up table is only applicable for wind-sea-dominated conditions. The two MWP retrieval methods are independent of each other, and their error properties are complementary to each other. Therefore, this study further presents a merged MWP retrieval model combining the nadir U10-SWH and the MWP from the off-nadir spectrum of SWIM using a simple artificial neural network. After training against some buoy data, the model reaches unprecedented accuracy for MWP retrievals (RMSEs of similar to 0.36 s for zero up-crossing periods, similar to 0.41 s for mean periods, and similar to 0.60 s for energy periods), demonstrating the usefulness of SWIM in the studies of ocean waves.', '[Jiang, Haoyu; Song, Yuhao; Yang, Zheng] China Univ Geosci, Hubei Key Lab Marine Geol Resources, Wuhan, Peoples R China.

Accurate and timely information on PG distribution is essential for the strategic planning of modern agriculture as well as the projection of the environmental impacts. However, PG mapping over a large area has been a long-term challenge. Compared with classifier-based methods, index-based methods have the advantages of fast speed and convenience, which are very suitable for rapid large-scale mapping. The existing PG indices face the diversity of PG types and background environments, and the seasonal variation of PG spectra. To solve these problems, this study proposes a novel spectral index using Sentinel-2 images, namely the Advanced Plastic Greenhouse Index (APGI), to map PGs at a large scale. Four typical PG planting regions in the world, including Almeria (Spain), Anamur (Turkey), Weifang (China), and Nantong (China), were selected as study areas. Based on the spectral analysis, some common spectral characteristics of PGs (i.e., high reflectance in NIR wavelengths and strong absorption in red and SWIR2 wavelengths) were observed and used in the APGI for highlighting PG areas. Besides, the coastal aerosol band and the red band were selected as optimal indicators to distinguish PG from other land covers which share similar spectral characteristics with PG. The experimental results indicate that the APGI has obvious advantages in enhancing PG information and suppressing non-PG backgrounds in various scenes compared with the existing indices. The APGI achieved the PG mapping accuracy with an OA of 90.63% 97.50% and an F1 score of 80.56% - 96.20% in all study cases. Furthermore, the APGI also showed its robustness in seasonal variations and different datasets.', '[Zhang, Peng; Du, Peijun; Guo, Shanchuan; Zhang, Wei; Tang, Pengfei; Zheng, Hongrui] Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Geog Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Land Satellite Remote Sensing Applicat,Min, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

Commonly AC algorithms are validated by establishing a mean retrieval error from match-up analysis, which compares the satellite-derived surface reflectance with concurrent ground radiometric observations. Pixel-based reflectance uncertainties however, are rarely provided by AC algorithms and those for the operational Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) marine reflectance product are not yet recommended for use. AC retrieval errors and uncertainties directly determine the quality with which ocean colour products can be estimated from the marine surface reflectance. Increasingly there is also the need for reflectance uncertainty products to be used as data assimilation inputs into biogeochemical models.   This paper describes the development of a new coastal AC algorithm for Sentinel-3 OLCI that provides pixel based estimation of the inherent model inversion uncertainty and sensor noise propagation. The algorithm is a full-spectral model-based inversion of radiative transfer (RT) simulations in a coupled atmosphere-ocean system using an ensemble of artificial neural networks (ANN) that were initialized differently during the training process, but composed of the same network architecture. The algorithm has been validated against in-situ radiometric observations across a wide range of optical water types, and has been compared with the latest EUMETSAT operational Level 2 processor IPF-OL-2 v7.01.   In this analysis we found that the ensemble ANN showed improved performance over the operational Level 2 processor with a band-averaged (412-708 nm) mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 16% compared to 37% and a four-times lower band-averaged bias of -0.00045 sr(-1).   In the ensemble inversion process we account for three uncertainty components: (1) the total model variance that describes the variance of the data from the different ANNs, (2) the prediction variance of the mean, which is based on calculations of the RT simulations and (3) the instrument noise variance of the mean by propagating the OLCI spectral signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). To study algorithm performance and to quantify the contribution of the different uncertainty components to the total uncertainty, we applied the algorithm to an optically complex full resolution (FR) test scene covering coastal waters of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The uncertainties associated with the instrument noise variance were found to be two orders of magnitude lower than the uncertainty components of the prediction and total model variances. The overall largest uncertainty component in our uncertainty framework is attributed to the total model inversion error from averaging the responses of the slightly different adapted networks in the ensemble. The algorithm is made publicly available as a Python/C plugin for the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP).', '[Schroeder, Thomas; Blondeau-Patissier, David] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.

These protocols are based on design-based inference and provide unbiased estimators of various dimensions of accuracy. Current procedures consider the spatial and temporal dimension when obtaining the independent reference data used to assess accuracy, commonly based on the Landsat imagery archive as the basic source. The protocol in which the temporal dimension is addressed in the reference data impacts the accuracy metrics. For example, the 8-16-day sampling units usually recommended in Stage 3 BA validation protocols may result in confounding of spatial and temporal classification errors. However, both errors have different implications from a user\'s perspective, depending on whether the spatial detection or the temporal dating are relevant. While maintaining the fundamentals of current validation protocols, this study presents a new approach based on long temporal reference units (> 48 days) to diminish the influence of temporal reporting (i.e., dating errors) on the spatial accuracy estimates. This methodology is applied to estimate the accuracy of several global BA products for the period 2017-2019, including two European BA products, the FireCCI51 and C3SBA10, and NASA\'s standard BA product, the MCD64A1 collection 6 (MCD64C6). Global estimates showed similar performance for the three products; BA commission errors ranged from 17.2% +/- 1.1% for C3SBA10 to 19.4% +/- 1.1% for FireCCI51, and BA omission errors ranged from 43.1% +/- 1.9% for FireCCI51 to 49.3% +/- 2.2% for MCD64C6 (+/- values are one standard error). The total burned area was consistently underestimated in all products. These errors are much lower relative to those obtained in recent Stage 3 validation exercises based on short temporal reference units, which estimated global commission and omission errors greater than 40% and 70%, respectively. Thus, this study demonstrates that using long reference units provides a method to address the impact of BA product dating errors on estimates of spatial accuracy metrics, particularly for those products with lower temporal resolution or for areas with greater cloud coverage.

Different interpreters may assign different reference class labels to the same sample unit. This interpreter variability is typically not accounted for in variance estimators applied to area estimates of land cover. A simple measurement model provides the basis for an estimator of the total variance (V-Total) that takes into account both sampling variance and interpreter variance. This method requires two or more reference class interpretations (i.e., repeated measurements) obtained by analysts, working independently of each other, for the full sample or a random subsample of the full sample. Estimators of the total variance ((V) over cap (Total)) and the variance component attributable to interpreters ((V) over cap (1)) were obtained for the case of two reference class interpretations per repeated sample unit. To evaluate the effect of interpreter variability on variance estimation, we used land cover reference data interpreted by seven analysts who each interpreted the same 300 sample pixels from a region of the Pacific Northwest of the United States. From these data, we estimated the contribution of interpreter variance to the total variance (i.e., (V) over cap/(V) over cap (Total)) and the relative bias of the standard simple random sampling variance estimator ((V) over cap (stand)) as an estimator of V-Total, defined as 100%*((V) over cap (stand) - (V) over cap (Total))/(V) over cap (Total). For each of five land cover classes, we computed (V) over cap (1), (V) over cap (Total), and (V) over cap (stand) using the sample data from each of the 21 possible pairwise combinations of the seven interpreters, and then calculated the mean of (V) over cap (1)/(V) over cap (Total) and the mean of the estimated relative bias of (V) over cap (stand) over these 21 pairs. Based on the mean of (V) over cap (1)/(V) over cap (Total) per class, interpreter variance contributed from 25% (cropland) to 76% (grass/shrub) of the total variance, indicating that interpreter variance was a non-negligible component of the total variance. Typically, the standard variance estimator, (V) over cap (stand), underestimated the total variance with the mean estimated relative bias ranging from 3% (cropland) to 33% (grass/shrub). Classes with greater inconsistency between pairs of interpreters had larger contributions of interpreter variance to the total variance ((V) over cap (1)/(V) over cap (Total)) and larger negative estimated relative bias of (V) over cap (stand). Given that interpreter variance can contribute substantially to the total variance, the repeated measurements approach offers a practical way to incorporate this variability into an estimator of the total variance.', '[V.

Accurate mapping of tidal wetland composition is crucial and urgently required for the conservation and management of coastal ecosystem, as well as for maximizing their associated services. However, remote sensing of tidal wetlands is still challenge due to periodic tidal fluctuations, frequent cloud cover, and similar spectral characteristics with terrestrial land cover types. Previous approaches to mapping the tidal wetlands have been restricted to small study regions or have focused on an individual tidal wetland type, thus limiting their ability to consistently monitor the composition of tidal wetlands over large geographic extents. To address the above issues, we proposed a novel algorithm on Google Earth Engine, called Multi-class Tidal Wetland Mapping by integrating Tide-level and Phenological features (MTWM-TP), to simultaneously map mangroves, salt marshes and tidal flats for specifying large-scale tidal wetland composition. The MTWM-TP algorithm firstly generates several noise-free composite images with different tide levels and phenological stages and then concatenates them into a random forest classifier for further classification. The usage of tide-level and phenological features eliminates inland landscapes and help to distinguish deciduous salt marshes and evergreen mangroves, leading to a statistically significant improvement in accuracy. We applied the algorithm to 10,274 Sentinel-2 images of East Asia and derived a 10-m resolution multi-class tidal wetland map with an overall accuracy of 97.02% at a sub-continental scale. We found that tidal wetlands occupied 1,308,241 ha of areas in East Asia in 2020, of which 89.12% were tidal flats, 9.39% were salt marshes, and only 1.49% were mangroves. This spatially explicit map of tidal wetland composition will provide valuable guidance for coastal biodiversity protection and blue carbon restoration. In addition, the proposed MTWM-TP algorithm can serve as a reliable means for monitoring sub -continental-or larger-scale tidal wetland composition more broadly.', '[Zhang, Zhen; Li, Yangfan; Li, Yi] Xiamen Univ, Coll Environm & Ecol, Minist Educ, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci,Key Lab Coastal, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China.

Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing is considered to be the most efficient way to obtain accurate LST, both regionally and globally. Currently, many LST retrieval algorithms have been developed, including the up-to-date SW-TES (SW: split window; TES: temperature-emissivity separation) method, which is claimed to be able to accurately derive LST without the need for atmospheric information and land surface emissivity (LSE) based on the selected multiple TIR channel configuration. However, this hybrid method is actually not applicable to observations with large viewing angles and was only preliminarily evaluated in Australia. In this study, this method was extended for application to global TIR measurements with different viewing angles. Additionally, the performance of this extended SW-TES method was assessed globally for different seasons by using the MODIS LST product as a reference, and was also validated using in-situ LST measurements from the SURFRAD (SURFace RADiation budget network) sites. The results showed that the LST retrievals using the extended SW-TES method were comparable to the MODIS LST product, with discrepancies of <2.7 K and < 1.8 K for global daytime and nighttime observations, respectively. Validations based on the SURFRAD in-situ LST measurements indicated that the extended method could be used to retrieve LST accurately with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of approximately 3.6 K during the daytime and 2.4 K during the nighttime. However, special attention should be paid when applying the extended method to daytime observations on grasslands and shrublands during hot seasons, considering the relatively large discrepancy when using this method compared with that obtained with the MODIS LST product (>4.0 K). Overall, in this study, the SW-TES method was extended, and the performance was comprehensively evaluated at the global scale, which may help in facilitating its potential applications.', '[Zheng, Xiaopo; Wang, Tianxing; Huang, Huabing] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geospatial Engn & Sci, Guangzhou 519082, Guangdong, Peoples R China.

Yet, the production of spatial information on these crops are often overlooked in favor of annual food crops. Remote sensing detection of coffee faces a particular set of challenges due to persistent cloud cover in the tropical \"coffee belt,\" hilly topography in coffee growing regions, diversity of coffee growing systems, and spectral similarity to other tree crops and agricultural land. Looking at the major coffee growing region in Dak Lak, Vietnam, we integrate multi-temporal 10 m optical Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR data in order to map three coffee production systems: i) open-canopy sun coffee, ii) intercropped and other shaded coffee and iii) newly planted or young coffee. Leveraging Google Earth Engine (GEE), we compute five sets of features in order to best enhance separability between coffee and other land cover and within coffee production systems. The features include Sentinel-2 dry and wet season composites, Sentinel-1 texture features, Sentinel-1 spatiotemporal metrics, and topographic features. Using a random forest classification algorithm, we produce a 9-class land cover map including our three coffee production classes and a binary coffee/non-coffee map. The binary map has an overall accuracy of 89% and the three coffee production systems have user accuracies of 65, 56, 71% for sun coffee, intercropped coffee and newly planted coffee, respectively. This is a first effort at large-scale distinction of within-crop production styles and has implications across many applications. The binary coffee map can be used as a high-resolution crop mask, whereas the detailed land cover map can inform monitoring of deforestation dynamics, biodiversity, sustainability certification and implementation of climate adaptation strategies. This work offers a scalable approach to integrating optical and radar Sentinel data for production of spatially explicit agricultural infor-mation and contributes particularly to tree crop and agroforestry mapping, which often is overlooked in between agricultural and forestry sciences.', '[Maskell, Gina; Chemura, Abel; Gornott, Christoph] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany.

Current seismic catalogs are based on the inversion of seismic wave data. The accuracy of their source parameters, which reflect the quantity and layout of seismic stations, and the crustal velocity model used, are often highly uncertain. The open source and popularization of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) deformation data offer the potential to provide more accurate source parameters for earthquake catalogs. In this study, we used same-source InSAR data and a consistent processing approach (i.e., the same sampling, inversion algorithm, and processing flow) to obtain the fault slip models and source parameters of 56 earthquakes, covering most of earthquakes observed by the Sentinel-1 since 2014; these were then used to form a unified InSAR earthquake catalog (U-InSAR). We then compiled a second InSAR earthquake catalog (C-InSAR) based on the source parameters of an additional 164 earthquakes inverted using InSAR deformation data from various sources by previous studies, among which 45 earthquakes included additional Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data. The C-InSAR catalog was used to evaluate the impact of data sources and processing approach on the consistency of InSAR catalogs; we found no significant differences between the U-and C-InSAR catalogs. Secondly, the combined U-and C-InSAR catalogs were compared with seismological catalogs, and showed significantly improved seismic source locations, depths, moment magnitudes, fault strikes, fault dips, and fault rakes. Our results confirm the rationality and feasibility of constructing earthquake catalogs using source parameters from a variety of InSAR data sources and inversion algorithms. We emphasize that InSAR catalogs can provide an important supplement, improvement, and/or correction to seismological catalogs, and can provide important basic data for more refined and reliable research on earthquake mechanisms and hazard assessments. Finally, we set up a preliminary sharing and distribution system for InSAR-based catalogs.', '[Zhu, Chuanhua; Wang, Chisheng; Zhang, Bochen; Qin, Xiaoqiong] Shenzhen Univ, Minist Nat Resources MNR, Key Lab Geoenvironm Monitoring Great Bay Area, Shenzhen 518000, Peoples R China.

This paper employed remote sensing estimates of f(PV) and f(NPV) from five case study sites from Australia\'s vegetated dunefields to observe (a) vegetation growth response to rainfall \'pulses\' and subsequent transition to nonphotosynthetic dormancy or senescence; (b) multiple time scales of antecedent climatic influence on vegetation cover; (c) the susceptibility of dunes to wind-blown sand drift during periods of low cover; and (d) the implications of image resolution choice when ground cover is heterogeneous.   A spectral unmixing model for Australia\'s arid zone (termed \'AZN\') was first developed by generating endmembers from a dataset of 1405 field surveys; Landsat time series estimates of f(PV) and f(NPV) were subject to a Seasonal-Trend decomposition by Loess (STL); Time series components were correlated with rainfall (P) and aridity at various accumulation periods; Fire maps were used to compare the climatic response of unburnt and burnt vegetation; Landform maps were used to isolate dune vegetation cover from the adjacent interdunes; and Landsat estimates of erodible area were compared with Sentinel-2 and WorlView-3 data.   The new AZN model yielded Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) estimates of 14.5% (f(BS)), 6.5% (f(PV)) and 15.8% (f(NPV)) during cross validation. The AZN model also compared favourably to an existing continental-scale model when evaluated with independent reference data. Rainfall pulse responses of dune vegetation were detected initially as f(PV), and 3-9 months later as a peak in f(NPV). Components of f(PV) responded to P accumulated over 3-9-months (intra-annual), and 12-15-months (trend). The long-term build-up of f(NPV), if left unburnt, was influenced by rainfall patterns over the preceding 45-114 months. Fires reduced both the depth and strength of antecedent rainfall\'s influence on vegetation, and vegetation was often more sensitive to P than to aridity. Erodibility (total cover <14%) and partial erodibility (cover <35%) were more common at the driest sites but did not universally match aridity levels, due to fires and differing vegetation. The targeting of dune crest regions highlighted their enhanced susceptibility to sand drift (in most cases), and, given their occurrence on relatively narrow ridges (similar to 30 m), the importance of estimating cover at Landsat resolutions or better (e.g. Sentinel-2).', '[Shumack, Samuel; Hesse, Paul P.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.

UA and PA improved to 28% and 34% when agreement was defined as the change being detected by the map and reference data within a +/- 2-year window. Change accuracy was higher in the eastern United States compared to the western US. UA was 49% (+/- 0.3) and PA was 54% (+/- 0.3) for the footprint of change (defined as the area experiencing at least one land cover change from 1985 to 2017). For class-specific loss and gain when agreement was defined as an exact year match, UA and PA were generally below 30%, with Tree Cover loss being the most accurately mapped change (UA = 25%, PA = 31%). These accuracy results provide users with information to assess the suitability of LCMAP data and information to guide future research for improving LCMAP products, particularly focusing on the challenges of accurately mapping annual land cover change.', '[V.

In addition to conventional altimeter-derived parameters such as significant wave height (SWH) and the normalized radar cross-section (NRCS) sigma0, the spatial (along-track) SWH gradient and SWH standard deviation (STD) for standard 1-s altimetry data are assumed to be responsible for random wave field dynamics and, thus, for the observed characteristic mean wave period. A comparison with in situ measurements of wave buoys shows higher accuracy of the novel DNN models by using these new parameters. The wave period estimation from DNN model is also consistent with the latest wave reanalysis and indicates less bias when compared to the buoys. The global mean wave steepness distribution from the DNN model shows good agreement with those provided by the wave reanalysis. The sensitivity of input variables sigma0, SWH, SWH gradient, and SWH STD on the results of the DNN model are also investigated. Perspectives on the DNN method for developing universal mission-independent wave period models are discussed. Objectives of the work: The mean wave period is an important parameter for characterizing wave properties and can be retrieved from altimeter observations. Considering random wave field dynamics, we present a deep neural network (DNN) model for mean wave period retrieval by introducing the SWH gradient and standard deviation as the inputs. The mean wave period estimation of the DNN model shows good agreement with the latest wave reanalysis and less bias compared to buoys.

The spatial and temporal coverage of radar and imaging systems have significant advantage over other sensors and platforms. However, these systems are often are challenged in certain environmental conditions to produce accurate elevations as compared to what might achieved with laser altimetry. Radar derived DEM (Digital Elevation Model) elevation accuracy is often less in vegetated regions, as the wavelengths associated with radar mapping missions do not fully penetrate the canopy. Elevation errors are also substantial over dynamic topography. Correction models using airborne lidar reference datasets can be effective for localized studies to improve the DEM but often the data is not readily available or seasonally/temporally irrelevant. This work presents an automated method for correcting digital terrain models derived from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) elevation products using NASA\'s newest Earth observing laser altimeter, the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2). ICESat-2 elevations, in concert with Landsat 8 (global imagery), create a model based correction strategy for the SRTM derived elevations using geographically correlated canopy cover and surface slope information. The results are validated at the study site using high-resolution, high fidelity airborne lidar datasets as a reference surface. The application of the correction model on the radar measurements results in nearly 50% improvement in elevation accuracy for this region. Additionally this established proof of concept provides a starting point for further research in how this method, with ICESat-2 data, can be extended to other environmental regions, other radar or image derived elevation products and inform future techniques for similar application at the global scale.', '[Magruder, Lori; Neuenschwander, Amy; Klotz, Brad] Univ Texas Austin, Appl Res Labs, Geospatial Laser Applicat & Measurements, Austin, TX 78713 USA.', 'University of Texas System; University of Texas AustinRP Magruder, L (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Appl Res Labs, Geospatial Laser Applicat & Measurements, Austin, TX 78713 USA.', 'magruder@arlut.utexas.edu; amyn@arlut.utexas.edu;   brad.klotz@arlut.utexas.eduRI Klotz, Brad/GVS-8658-2022; Magruder, Lori/AAA-1634-2022', 'Magruder, Lori/0000-0001-7564-1193; Neuenschwander,   Amy/0000-0001-8184-5707', 'National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency through BAA [HM047618C0040]', 'This work was supported by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency   through BAA contract #HM047618C0040 and approved for public release,   20-520.', 35, 24, 28, 4, 31, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

SIF is the most direct measure of photosynthesis and is therefore considered important to advance capacity for the monitoring of gross primary production (GPP) while it has also been suggested that its yield facilitates the early detection of vegetation stress. However, due to the influence of different confounding effects, the apparent SIF signal measured at canopy level differs from the fluorescence emitted at leaf level, which makes its physiological interpretation challenging. One of these effects is the scattering of SIF emitted from leaves on its way through the canopy. The escape fraction (f(esc)) describes the scattering of SIF within the canopy and corresponds to the ratio of apparent SIF at canopy level to SIF at leaf level. In the present study, the fluorescence correction vegetation index (FCVI) was used to determine f(esc) of farred SIF for three structurally different crops (sugar beet, winter wheat, and fruit trees) from a diurnal data set recorded by the airborne imaging spectrometer HyPlant. This unique data set, for the first time, allowed a joint analysis of spatial and temporal dynamics of structural effects and thus the downscaling of far-red SIF from canopy (SIF760canopy) to leaf level (SIF760leaf). For a homogeneous crop such as winter wheat, it seems to be sufficient to determine f(esc) once a day to reliably scale SIF760 from canopy to leaf level. In contrast, for more complex canopies such as fruit trees, calculating f(esc) for each observation time throughout the day is strongly recommended. The compensation for structural effects, in combination with normalizing SIF(760 )to remove the effect of incoming radiation, further allowed the estimation of SIF emission efficiency (epsilon(SIF)) at leaf level, a parameter directly related to the diurnal variations of plant photosynthetic efficiency.', '[Siegmann, Bastian; Herrera, David; Jedmowski, Christoph; Junker-Frohn, Laura Verena; Muller, Onno; Rademske, Patrick; Quiros-Vargas, Juan; Rascher, Uwe] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Bio & Geosci, IBG 2 Plant Sci, Wilhelm Johnen Str, D-52428 Julich, Germany.

Distinguished from existing regional validations, this study used ground soil temperature observations of approximately 800 stations from 5 sparse and 15 dense networks worldwide to fully assess six model-and satellite-based surface ST products from April 2015 to December 2017. The products consist of five model-based ST from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), the Goddard Earth Observing System Model version 5 Forward Processing (GEOS-5 FP), the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) Noah, the ERA-Interim and the newly released ERA5 produced by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and one satellite-based ST retrieved from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) by using the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM). The accuracy of these products was comprehensively assessed per availability of ground networks, soil temperature interval, soil moisture interval, land cover, climate zone, and elevation. The results show that the GEOS-5 exhibits the smallest averaged unbiased root mean square difference (ubRMSD) of 1.84 K among all the surface ST products. All model-based products show a high skill in capturing the temporal trend of ground observations with an averaged correlation coefficient larger than 0.97. The ERA5 surface ST obtains visible improvements compared to its predecessor ERA-Interim by showing smaller ubRMSD and absolute bias values. All model-based surface ST products generally show lower values than ground ST, while their bias tends to be warmer as soil temperature and soil moisture increase except for the highest temperature and moisture conditions. Moreover, unstable performance of most model-based products in shrubland and grassland, tropical, arid and cold climate, and high elevation regions is also demonstrated by larger ubRMSD values. The averaged ubRMSD of the satellite-based LPRM ST is 3.04 K, and more attentions should be paid to the impacts of elevations and underlying surfaces on improving this product. These new findings will be valuable for future refinement of ST datasets, algorithms used to estimate soil moisture from satellite data, and applications in various disciplines.', '[Ma, Hongliang; Zhang, Xiang; Chen, Nengcheng] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

Currently, VOD is mainly retrieved from passive microwave data and few studies focused on VOD retrievals from active microwave data. The Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) provides long-term C-band backscatter data at Vertical-Vertical (VV) polarization. In this study, a new ASCAT INRAE Bordeaux (IB) VOD (hereafter, IB VOD), was developed based on the Water Cloud Model (WCM) coupled with the Ulaby linear model for soil back scattering. The main features of IB VOD are that (i) the ERA5-Land soil moisture (SM) dataset was used as an auxiliary SM dataset in the retrievals, (ii) pixel-based soil model parameters were mapped using Random Forest (RF), and (iii) the vegetation model parameter was calibrated for each day. The IB VOD product was retrieved over Africa during 2015-2019, and its performances were evaluated in space and time by comparing with aboveground biomass (AGB), lidar tree height (TH), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and leaf area index (LAI). Results were inter-compared with three other VOD products at the same frequency. In terms of spatial correlation with AGB (R = 0.92) and TH (R = 0.89), IB VOD outperforms the other VOD products, suggesting IB VOD has a strong ability to capture spatial patterns of AGB and TH. By comparing all VOD products against NDVI, EVI and LAI, we found that the highest temporal correlation with NDVI (EVI, LAI) was obtained with IB VOD over 29.94% (36.65%, 30.19%) of the study region. Considering all three vegetations indices, highest temporal correlation values with IB VOD could be particularly noted for deciduous broadleaf forests, woody savannas and savannas.', '[Liu, Xiangzhuo; Wigneron, Jean-Pierre; Frappart, Frederic; Li, Xiaojun; Wang, Mengjia; Moisy, Christophe] Univ Bordeaux, INRAE, UMR1391, ISPA, F-33140 Villenave Dornon, France.

The most common method used in estimating AGB with remotely sensed data is based on the relationship between field AGB measurements and vegetation indices (VIs); however, the existing VIs do not deliver adequate results due to the soil background and spatial, temporal and sampling size variability. In this study, the AGB estimation model with the normalized difference phenology index (NDPI) was evaluated in terms of model robustness and spatial and temporal scalability based on comparisons with the widely used ratio vegetation index (RVI), difference vegetation index (DVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), and optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI). The field measurements of AGB of the natural grassland in Inner Mongolia, China, collected in 2013, 2016, and 2017 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance products were used for analysis. The results based on training and independent validation data showed the following: (1) The R2 value between AGB and the NDPI was the highest (0.73) among all VIs, followed by soil-line-adjusted VIs, while the R2 values of the RVI and DVI were the lowest; (2) The NDPI-based model had the best robustness for different sampling sizes; (3) The NDPI-based model also had superior spatial and temporal scalability. The results from simulation experiments using the PROSAIL model also support the superiority of the NDPI in estimating AGB. The simulation analysis further reveals that the overall superiority of the NDPI originates from the fact that the NDPI overcomes the adverse impacts of the heterogeneity of the soil background and accounts for changes in the leaf water content that contribute substantially to AGB in grassland. These findings suggest that the NDPI-based AGB estimation model is advantageous for monitoring AGB in large grasslands with significant spatial-temporal heterogeneity.', '[Xu, Dawei; Wang, Cong; Shen, Beibei; Yan, Ruirui; Yan, Yuchun; Wang, Xu; Chen, Baorui; Xin, Xiaoping] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Natl Field Sci Observat & Res Stn Hulunbuir Grass, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning,Key Lab Agr Rem, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.

Airborne data are often either acquired using multiple overlapped flight lines to provide complete coverage of an area of interest, or using transects to sample a given population. Spaceborne lidar datasets are unique to each sensor and are sample- or profile-based with characteristics driven by acquisition mode and orbital parameters. To leverage the wealth of accurate vegetation structural data from these lidar systems, a number of approaches have been developed to extend these observations over broader areas, from local landscapes to the globe. In this review we examine studies that have utilised modelling approaches to extend air- or space-based lidar data with the aim of communicating methods, outcomes, and accuracies, and offering guidance on linking lidar metrics and lidar-derived forest attributes with broad-area predictors. Modelling approaches are developed for a variety of applications. In some cases, generation of spatially-exhaustive layers may be useful for forest management purposes, driving management and inventory decisions over smaller focus areas or regions. In other cases, outputs are designed for monitoring at regional or global scales, and may be - due to the spatial grain of the structural estimates - insufficiently accurate or reliable for management. From the reviewed studies, we found height, aboveground biomass and volume, derived from either upper proportions of a large-footprint full-waveform lidar profiles, or statistically modelled from discrete return small-footprint lidar point clouds, to be the most commonly extended forest attributes, followed by canopy cover, basal area and stand complexity. Assessment of the accuracy and bias of the extrapolated forest attributes varied with both independent and model-derived estimates. The coefficient of determination (R2) was the most often reported, followed by absolute and relative (i.e., as a proportion of the mean) root mean square error (RMSE and RMSE% respectively). Compilation of the stated accuracies suggested that the variance explained in predictions of forest height ranged from R2 = 0.38 to 0.90 (mean = 0.64), RMSE from 2 to 6m and RMSE% from 12 to 34%. For volume, R2 ranged from 0.25 to 0.72 (mean = 0.53) and RMSE from 60 to 87 m3/ha and for aboveground biomass (AGB) R2 ranged from 0.35 to 0.78 (mean = 0.55) and RMSE from 28 to 44 Mg/ha. There was no consensus on the level of accuracy required to support successful extension over larger areas. Ultimately, the review suggests that the information need motivating the spatial extension over larger areas drives the choice of the type of lidar data, spatial datasets and related grain. We conclude by discussing future directions and the outlook for new approaches including new lidar-derived response variables, advances in modelling approaches, and assessment of change.', '[Coops, Nicholas C.; Tompalski, Piotr; Goodbody, Tristan R.

For Chl a, five algorithms were tested using MODISA data, and OC3-CI performed best, which was subsequently used to compute NPP. Of three NPP algorithms tested, a Wavelength Resolved Model (WRM) was the most accurate, and was therefore used to estimate NCP with an empirical relationship between NCP with NPP and sea surface temperature (SST). A perturbation analysis was deployed to quantify the range of uncertainties introduced in satellite NCP from input parameters. The largest reductions in the uncertainty of satellite NCP came from MODIS-A derived NPP using the WRM (40%) and MODIS-A Chl a using OC3-CI (22%).   The most accurate NCP algorithm, was used to generate a 16 year time series (2002 to 2018) from MODIS-A to assess climate and environmental drivers of NCP across the South Atlantic basin. Positive correlations between wind speed anomalies and NCP anomalies were observed in the central South Atlantic Gyre (SATL), and the Benguela Upwelling (BENG), indicating that autotrophic conditions may be fuelled by local wind-induced nutrient inputs to the mixed layer. Sea Level Height Anomalies (SLHA), used as an indicator of mesoscale eddies, were negatively correlated with NCP anomalies offshore of the BENG upwelling fronts into the SATL, suggesting autotrophic conditions are driven by mesoscale features. The Agulhas bank and Brazil-Malvinas confluence regions also had a strong negative correlation between SLHA and NCP anomalies, similarly indicating that NCP is forced by mesoscale eddy generation in this region. Positive correlations between SST anomalies and the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) in the SATL, indicated the influence of El Nino events on the South Atlantic Ocean, however the plankton community response was less clear.', '[Ford, Daniel; Tilstone, Gavin H.; Kitidis, Vassilis] Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England.

Routine observations afforded by spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) allows for high-fidelity monitoring of agricultural parameters at the field scale. Here we evaluate the approach to be used for generating NASA\'s upcoming NASA ISRO SAR (NISAR) mission\'s L-band cropland product using Sentinel-1C-band data. This study uses all ascending Sentinel-1A/B data collected over the conterminous United States in 2017 to compute the coefficient of variation (CV) at 150 m x 150 m resolution and evaluates the overall accuracy (OA) of CV-based crop/non-crop classifications at 100 one-by-one degree tiles. We calculate accuracies using two approaches: (a) using a literature-recommended constant CV threshold of 0.5 (CVthr_0.5) and (b) determining optimal CV thresholds for every tile using Youden\'s J statistic (YJS), CVthr_YJS. These accuracy comparisons are important for determining (1) the viability of using a computationally inexpensive and straightforward approach for cropland classification over large spatial scales/diverse land covers (i. e., can accuracies >= 80% be routinely achieved?), (2) how closely OA0.5 compares to the performance ceiling (OAYJS). This information will help determine whether approach (a) is appropriate and how much potential room of improvement there could be in modifying it. Results for OA0.5 and OAYJS are 81.5% and 86.8%, respectively. A breakdown by census geographic region, showed that OA0.5 (OAYJS) exceeded 80% (90%) in the South and Midwest, but was only 76.1% (73.5%) in the West. The improvement in OAYJS mainly stems from tiles with >40% crop prevalence having about 10% greater OA values. To better examine the potential of the approach for land cover classification, results of approach (b) were also stratified by crop. Approach (b) accurately detected most non-crop classes as non-crop (>80%), but with low OAYJS values for grasslands/pasture, especially in the West. CV values for crop were distinct from non-crop indicating that the approach is suitable for crop/non-crop classifications. Because results CV values have substantial overlap within crop/non-crop classes, indicating the approach is poorly suited for land cover classifications. We also detected a strong geographic dependence of CVthr_YJS: values ranged from about 0.2 at the coasts and gradually increase to about 0.6 in the Central United States, most often falling close to 0.3 and 0.5.', '[Rose, Shannon; Kraatz, Simon; Siqueira, Paul] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 113 Knowles Engn Bldg,151 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.

This greening has been primarily attributed to climate change and CO2 concentrations, but recent research studies have emphasized the large role of human land use in this process, especially agricultural land abandonment (ALA). The aim of this study was to investigate whether long-term gradual greening of agricultural land can aid in mapping abandoned land across Poland. Trend estimation and temporal segmentation were applied to the 1986-2019 annual Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series to detect periods of long-term greening and to assess its relationship with actual information on ALA. The results show that long-term greening is widespread in Poland (covering up to 60% of its territory), regardless of former and current land uses, most of which has stemmed from modifications within stable land use classes (as they cover 91% of Poland). The highest greening rates and intensities were observed due to conversions from agricultural to non-agricultural land use, which strongly suggests land abandonment and the proceeding succession. However, some proportion of managed agricultural land has also experienced high-intensity greening, and a large proportion of abandoned agricultural land is not greening intensively. Thus, setting an exact greening intensity threshold allowing to clearly distinguish the status of land was not possible. This study also presents the consistency of the Landsat annual time series and its good performance for long-term greening detection, indicating that temporal segmentation may better capture ALA patterns than trend estimation', '[Kolecka, Natalia] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Geog & Spatial Management, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland.', 'Jagiellonian UniversityRP Kolecka, N (通讯作者)，Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Geog & Spatial Management, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland.', 'natalia.kolecka@uj.edu.plRI Kolecka, Natalia/AAK-3979-2020', 'Kolecka, Natalia/0000-0001-6143-0870', NULL, NULL, 116, 25, 25, 4, 74, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Furthermore, the global coverage of SAR data provides an opportunity to generate global scale flood records that are essential for improving our understanding of flood risks worldwide and of how these risks are changing over time. In this study, we introduce an automatic change-detection based method that allows global-scale flood records to be generated using the readily and freely available ENVISAT-ASAR data collection. It consists of the following three steps: (i) flood image identification; (ii) reference image selection; (iii) floodwater detection. As a test case, this study uses all available ENVISAT-ASAR images from eight different orbital tracks that were acquired over the United Kingdom over the period 2005?2012. Due to a lack of large-scale ground truth data, the evaluation of the results is carried out using different data sources. First, subsets of the flood maps over the Severn River basin are evaluated using a flood extent map that was manually digitized from very high-resolution aerial imagery. According to our results, the overall accuracy of both flood maps? subsets is higher than 85% while the user accuracy of the flood class is above 88%. Next, for the regions and images without available ground truth data, a visual inspection is carried out using simulations generated by the hydraulic model LISFLOOD-FP, as well as LANDSAT 7 ETM+ images obtained with a 30 m spatial resolution. Meanwhile, by comparing the acquisition dates of identified flood SAR images, the LISFLOOD-FP model results and optical data, a good agreement has been found. The experimental results over the United Kingdom indicate that the proposed method has strong potential for the generation of a global flood data record from the ENVISAT-ASAR archive.', '[Zhao, Jie; Pelich, Ramona; Hostache, Renaud; Matgen, Patrick; Chini, Marco] Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Res & Innovat, 5 Ave Hauts Fourneaux, L-4362 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg.

Here we use Sentinel-1 satellite imagery for the Imperial Valley, California, over the period of 2015-2019 to explore how factors specific to land surface changes may impact InSAR time series and to resolve time-varying deformation due to tectonic processes and geothermal energy production. We examine the temporal variability of data quality, via interferometric phase coherence, at high spatial resolution, taking into account the observation that some agricultural fields lie fallow for long time intervals punctuated by periods of cultivation. This strategy allows us to better distinguish signals and noise associated with agricultural activities, shoreline changes, or surface soil conditions. A series of masking, interpolation, and filtering steps facilitate phase unwrapping, and the unwrapped, unfiltered product is then recovered, reducing artifacts from spatial filtering. We adopt model-based tropospheric corrections to improve time series results, particularly in regions with high topographic relief, along with the use of distributed reference points to render a more uniform error structure. We validate InSAR observations with continuous GPS where available and find that the estimates of average line-of-sight (LOS) velocity over the valley from InSAR and GPS agree to similar to 3 mm/yr in areas with good data coverage. Discrepancies between the two estimates often exist in areas with lower InSAR data quality; in better-constrained areas, they appear to reveal signals attributable to surficial processes occurring in the uppermost soil layers. We observe a diverse suite of natural signals over multiple spatial scales, including steady interseismic deformation, seasonal lake-level-modulated signals at the southeastern Salton Sea shore, and transient slow slip on the Superstition Hills fault. In addition, we observe complex deformation at four geothermal fields within the valley. Extensive subsidence at the Salton Sea geothermal field suggests spatial overlap of anthropogenic and tectonic deformation, interspersed with potential surficial signals. Geothermal sites at East Mesa, North Brawley, and Heber exhibit smaller-amplitude, more localized deformation, often with nonlinear temporal trends. Our analysis demonstrates the need to assess whether InSAR signals result from surficial changes or deeper sources, and produces robust ground deformation data in support of efforts to study subsurface processes, manage geothermal operations, and improve hazard assessments.', '[Jiang, Junle; Lohman, Rowena B.] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.

Aerosols are co-emitted with CO from both fires and anthropogenic sources but with a shorter lifetime than CO. A combined trend analysis of CO and aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from space helps to diagnose the drivers of regional differences in the CO trend. We use the long-term records of CO from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) and AOD from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. Other satellite instruments measuring CO in the thermal infrared, AIRS, TES, IASI, and CrIS, show consistent hemispheric CO variability and corroborate results from the trend analysis performed with MOPITT CO. Trends are examined by hemisphere and in regions for 2002 to 2018, with uncertainties quantified. The CO and AOD records are split into two sub-periods (2002 to 2010 and 2010 to 2018) in order to assess trend changes over the 16 years. We focus on four major population centers: Northeast China, North India, Europe, and Eastern USA, as well as fire-prone regions in both hemispheres. In general, CO declines faster in the first half of the record compared to the second half, while AOD trends show more variability across regions. We find evidence of the atmospheric impact of air quality management policies. The large decline in CO found over Northeast China is initially associated with an improvement in combustion efficiency, with subsequent additional air quality improvements from 2010 onwards. Industrial regions with minimal emission control measures such as North India become more globally relevant as the global CO trend weakens. We also examine the CO trends in monthly percentile values to understand seasonal implications and find that local changes in biomass burning are sufficiently strong to counteract the global downward trend in atmospheric CO, particularly in late summer.', '[Buchholz, Rebecca R.; Worden, Helen M.; Park, Mijeong; Francis, Gene; Deeter, Merritt N.; Edwards, David P.; Emmons, Louisa K.; Gaubert, Benjamin; Gille, John; Martinez-Alonso, Sara; Tang, Wenfu] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Atmospher Chem Observat & Modeling Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.

In this research, taking Hengshui City of Hebei Province as the study area and winter wheat as the research crop, based on the WOFOST crop model and the proposed VW-4DEnSRF algorithm, a crop yield assimilation system was successfully constructed after parameter sensitivity analysis and parameter calibration of the crop model. Supported by the field-measured crop yield data and based on the effective validation of the yield assimilation system at a single point scale and in a typical experimental area, the scale optimization of grid size for regional yield estimation was effectively selected. Finally, combining the WOFOST model and inverted remotely sensed LAI, the regional winter wheat yield simulation under the optimal grid size of 500 m was carried out effectively through comparison with the field-measured yield data and official statistical yield data at the county level. Among them, the R-2, adjusted R-2 and RMSE between the simulated yield and ground-measured yield were 0.481, 0.471 and 801.4 kg.ha(-1), respectively. The mean value of the estimated yield of winter wheat in Hengshui City was 6787 kg.ha(-1), and the RMSE and RE between the estimated yield and official yield were 416.7 kg.ha(-1) and 4.56%, respectively.

Gradient-boosted regression trees serve as the method of maximizing the relationship between satellite data and flux measurements. Several flux networks are used to train and validate the model over varying land cover types, which strengthens the robustness of the model.

Although several studies comparing the different fusion methods have been conducted, selecting the suitable fusion methods is still challenging, as inevitable influential factors tend to be neglected. To address this problem, this study compared six typical spatiotemporal fusion methods, including the Unmixing-Based Data Fusion (UBDF), Linear Mixing Growth Model (LMGM), Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), Fit-FC (regression model Fitting, spatial Filtering and residual Compensation), One Pair Dictionary-Learning method (OPDL), and Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF), based on simulation experiments and theoretical analysis considering three influential factors between sensors: geometric misregistration, radiometric inconsistency, and spatial resolution ratio. The results indicate that Fit-FC achieved the best performance with the strongest tolerance to geometric misregistration when radiometric inconsistency was negligible; thus, it is the first recommended algorithm for blending normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) imagery. Instead, the FSDAF could generate the best results if radiometric inconsistency was non-negligible. These findings could help users determine the method that is appropriate for different remote sensing datasets, and provide guidelines for developers in the future development of novel methods.', '[Zhou, Junxiong; Chen, Jin; Chen, Xuehong; Qiu, Yuean; Zhang, Chishan; Cao, Xin; Cui, Xihong] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Inst Remote Sensing Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

However, in areas such as densely vegetated and irrigated regions, obtaining accurate SSM remains challenging. Before using satellite and model-based SSM estimates over these areas, we should understand the accuracy and error characteristics of various SSM products. Thus, this study aimed to compare the error characteristics of global-scale SSM over vegetated and irrigated areas as obtained from active and passive satellites and model-based data: Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA5), and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). We employed triple collocation analysis (TCA) and caluclated conventional error metrics from in-situ SSM measurements. We also considered all possible triplets from 6 different products and showed the viability of considering the standard deviation of TCA-based numbers in producing robust results.   Over forested areas, it was expected that model-based SSM data might provide more accurate SSM estimates than satellites due to the intrinsic limitations of microwave-based systems. Alternately, over irrigated regions, observation-based SSM data were expected to be more accurate than model-based products because land surface models (LSMs) cannot capture irrigation signals caused by human activities. Contrary to these expectations, satellite-based SSM estimates from ASCAT, SMAP, and SMOS showed fewer errors than ERA5 and GLDAS SSM products over vegetated conditions. Furthermore, over irrigated areas, ASCAT, SMOS, and SMAP outperformed other SSM products; however, model-based data from ERA5 and GLDAS outperformed AMSR2. Our results emphasize that, over irrgated areas, considering satellite-based SSM data as alternatives to model-based SSM data sometimes produces misleading results; and considering model-based data as alternatives to satellite-based SSM data in forested areas can also sometimes be misleading. In addition, we discovered that no products showed much degradation in TCA-based errors under different vegetated conditions, while different irrigation conditions impacted both satellite and model-based SSM data sets.   The present research demonstrates that limitations in satellite and modeled SSM data can be overcome in many areas through the synergistic use of satellite and model-based SSM products, excluding areas where satellite-based data are masked out. In fact, when four satellite and model data sets are used selectively, the probability of obtaining SSM with stronger signal than noise can be close to 100%.', '[Kim, Hyunglok; Lakshmi, Venkataraman] Univ Virginia, Dept Engn Syst & Environm, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.

Radiative transfer (RT) models that simulate top of atmosphere (TOA) radiance are essential tools to derive accurate LST from thermal infrared (TIR) signals of Earth observation (EO) satellites. DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) is one of the most accurate and comprehensive three-dimensional models that simulate RT in the Earth-atmosphere system. Up to version 5.7.3, the mean absolute error (MAE) of DART atmospheric TIR radiance of six standard atmospheres (USSTD76, TROPICAL, MIDDLATSUM, MIDDLATWIN, SUBARCSUM, SUBARCWIN) over 3.5 mu m 20 mu m was 3.1 K compared to the reference atmospheric RT model MODTRAN, which is much larger than the 1 K accuracy needed by most LST applications. Also, the radiance error reached 2.6 K for some TIR bands whereas the noise equivalent differential temperature (NeDT) of satellite TIR sensor is usually less than 0.4 K. Recently, the DART atmospheric RT modelling was greatly improved by (1) introducing the equivalent absorption cross-section of five most absorbing gases (H2O, CO2, O-3, CH4, N2O), and (2) implementing a double-layer thermal emission method. The MAE of DART atmospheric TIR radiance of six standard atmospheres and actual atmospheres over France and the Mediterranean Sea is now better than 1.0 K. The band radiance error is less than 0.2 K in the EO satellite TIR bands. DART is still accurate if the temperature profiles of standard atmospheres are offset by less than 6 K and if the viewing zenith angle is less than 50 degrees. In short, the improved DART meets the requirements of both LST applications, and present and future TIR EO satellite missions.

Accurate quantification of lake evaporation dynamics is of high importance for understanding lake energy budgets, land-atmosphere interactions, as well as regional water availability. However, the accurate quantification of lake evaporation has been hindered by the complexity involved with addressing the heat storage of water bodies. In this study, a new model-the Lake Temperature and Evaporation Model (LTEM)-was developed to simulate lake water temperature profiles, which were then used to calculate heat storage changes and evaporation rates. Inputs for the LTEM include the meteorological and bathymetric data, as well as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) water surface temperature (WST)-which is the land surface te`mperature (LST) over water. The MODIS WST was leveraged to constrain the hydrodynamic simulations. Model results over 11 lakes around the world show robust performance of LTEM. The long term average temperature biases range from-0.5 degrees C to 0.5 degrees C, and the evaporation rate biases range from-0.19 mm/day to 0.28 mm/day. In particular, it is found that LTEM significantly improves the simulation of the seasonality of lake evaporation rates. The validation results suggest that the averaged coefficient of determination (R2) for the evaporation rate is 0.84, which is 0.28 higher than that obtained when the conventional Penman equation (without heat storage) is used. The volumetric evaporation time series was then calculated as a product of the monthly evaporation rate and lake surface area (derived from MODIS near-infrared image classifications). This study provides an end-to-end framework for quantifying volumetric evaporation for the world\'s lakes and reservoirs. It also provides the capability to investigate the thermal dynamics of lake systems, and thus can benefit the various water resources applications across scales.', '[Zhao, Gang; Gao, Huilin] Texas A&M Univ, Zachry Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.

Commercial satellite platforms offer fine spatial resolution, an important consideration in patchy seagrass ecosystems. Currently, no consistent protocol exists for image processing of commercial data, limiting reproducibility and comparison across space and time. Additionally, the radiometric performance of commercial satellite sensors has not been assessed against the dark and variable targets characteristic of coastal waters. This study compared data products derived from two commercial satellites: DigitalGlobe\'s WorldView-2 and Planet\'s RapidEye. A single scene from each platform was obtained at St. Joseph Bay in Florida, USA, corresponding to a November 2010 field campaign. A reproducible processing regime was developed to transform imagery from basic products, as delivered from each company, into analysis-ready data usable for various scientific applications. Satellite-derived surface reflectances were compared against field measurements. WorldView-2 imagery exhibited high disagreement in the coastal blue and blue spectral bands, chronically overpredicting. RapidEye exhibited better agreement than WorldView-2, but overpredicted slightly across all spectral bands. A deep convolutional neural network was used to classify imagery into deep water, land, submerged sand, seagrass, and intertidal classes. Classification results were compared to seagrass maps derived from photointerpreted aerial imagery. This study offers the first radiometric assessment of WorldView-2 and RapidEye over a coastal system, revealing inherent calibration issues in shorter wavelengths of WorldView-2. Both platforms demonstrated as much as 97% agreement with aerial estimates, despite differing resolutions. Thus, calibration issues in WorldView-2 did not appear to interfere with classifi-cation accuracy, but could be problematic if estimating biomass. The image processing routine developed here offers a reproducible workflow for WorldView-2 and RapidEye imagery, which was tested in two additional coastal systems.

While the significance of rock glacier contribution to streamflow remains uncertain, the contribution is likely to be important for certain parts of the world. High-resolution remote sensing data has permitted the creation of rock glacier inventories for large regions. However, due to the spectral similarity between rock glaciers and the surrounding material, the creation of such inventories is typically conducted based on manual interpretation, which is both time consuming and subjective. Here, we present a novel method that combines deep learning (convolutional neural networks or CNNs) and object-based image analysis (OBIA) into one workflow based on freely available Sentinel-2 optical imagery (10 m spatial resolution), Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence data, and a digital elevation model (DEM). CNNs identify recurring patterns and textures and produce a prediction raster, or heatmap where each pixel indicates the probability that it belongs to a certain class (i.e. rock glacier) or not. By using OBIA we can segment the datasets and classify objects based on their heatmap value as well as morphological and spatial characteristics. We analysed two distinct catchments, the La Laguna catchment in the Chilean semi-arid Andes and the Poiqu catchment in the central Himalaya. In total, our method mapped 108 of the 120 rock glaciers across both catchments with a mean overestimation of 28%. Individual rock glacier polygons howevercontained false positives that are texturally similar, such as debris-flows, avalanche deposits, or fluvial material causing the user\'s accuracy to be moderate (63.9-68.9%) even if the producer\'s accuracy was higher (75.0-75.4%). We repeated our method on very-high-resolution Pleiades satellite imagery and a corresponding DEM (at 2 m resolution) for a subset of the Poiqu catchment to ascertain what difference image resolution makes. We found that working at a higher spatial resolution has little influence on the producer\'s accuracy (an increase of 1.0%), however the rock glaciers delineated were mapped with a greater user\'s accuracy (increase by 9.1% to 72.0%). By running all the processing within an object-based environment it was possible to both generate the deep learning heatmap and perform post-processing through image segmentation and object reshaping. Given the difficulties in differentiating rock glaciers using image spectra, deep learning combined with OBIA offers a promising method for automating the process of mapping rock glaciers over regional scales and lead to a reduction in the workload required in creating inventories.', '[Robson, Benjamin Aubrey] Univ Bergen, Dept Geog, Bergen, Norway.

This study developed and evaluated a novel method for analysis of multispectral data to map the relative cover of spotted knapweed in a heterogeneous grassland community. The method developed in this work, termed metapixel-based image analysis, segments the image into a grid of metapixels for which grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based statistics can be computed as descriptive features. Using RPAS-acquired multispectral imagery and plant species inventories performed on 1m(2) quadrats, a random forest classifier was trained to predict the qualitative degree of spotted knapweed ground cover within each metapixel. The best mean cross-validation score achieved was 71.3% when describing relative ground cover of spotted knapweed, with an accuracy of 66.0% when applied to an independent validation dataset.

It provides the longest time series of Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) from space over the global ocean. However, the SSS retrieval at high latitudes is a challenge because of the low sensitivity L-Band radiometric measurements to SSS in cold waters and to the contamination of SMOS measurements by the vicinity of continents, of sea ice and of Radio Frequency Interferences. In this paper, we assess the quality of weekly SSS fields derived from swath ordered instantaneous SMOS SSS (so called Level 2) distributed by the European Space Agency. These products are filtered according to new criteria. We use the pseudo-dielectric constant retrieved from SMOS brightness temperatures to filter SSS pixels polluted by sea ice. We identify that the dielectric constant model and the sea surface temperature auxiliary parameter used as prior information in the SMOS SSS retrieval induce significant systematic errors at low temperatures. We propose a novel empirical correction to mitigate those sources of errors at high latitudes.   Comparisons with in-situ measurements ranging from 1 to 11 m depths spotlight huge vertical stratification in fresh regions. This emphasizes the need to consider in-situ salinity as close as possible to the sea surface when validating L-band radiometric SSS which are representative of the first top centimeter.   SSS Standard deviation of differences (STDD) between weekly SMOS SSS and in-situ near surface salinity significantly decrease after applying the SSS correction, from 1.46 pss to 1.28 pss. The correlation between new SMOS SSS and in-situ near surface salinity reaches 0.94. SMOS estimates better capture SSS variability in the Arctic Ocean in comparison to TOPAZ reanalysis (STDD between TOPAZ and in-situ SSS = 1.86 pss), particularly in river plumes with very large SSS spatial gradients.', '[Supply, Alexandre; Boutin, Jacqueline; Reverdin, Gilles] Sorbonne Univ, Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, Lab Oceanog & Climat Experimentat & Approches Num, CNRS,IRD,MNHN, Paris, France.

The environmental performance of cover crops is affected by choice of species, planting date, planting method, nutrient inputs, temperature, and precipitation. The Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) oversees an agricultural cost-share program that provides farmers with funding to cover costs associated with planting winter cover crops, and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) have partnered with the MDA to develop satellite remote sensing techniques for measuring cover crop performance. The MDA has developed the capacity to digitize field boundaries for all fields enrolled in their cover crop programs (> 26,000 fields per year) to support a remote sensing performance analysis at a statewide scal,e and has requested assistance with the associated imagery processing from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform, scripts were developed to process Landsat 5/7/8 and Harmonized Sentinel-2 imagery to measure winter cover crop performance. We calibrated cover crop performance models using linear regression between satellite vegetation indices and USGS / USDA-ARS field sampling data collected on Maryland farms between 2006 and 2012 (1298 samples). Satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values showed significant correlation with the natural logarithm of cover crop biomass (p <= 0.01, R-2 = 0.56) and with observed percent vegetative ground cover (p <= 0.01, R-2 = 0.68). The GEE scripts were used to composite seasonal maximum NDVI values for each enrolled cover crop field and calculate performance metrics for the winter and spring seasons of three enrollment years (2014-15, 2015-16, and 2017-18) for four Maryland counties. Results from winter 2017-18 demonstrate that rye and barley fields had higher biomass than wheat fields, and that early planting, along with planting methods that increase seed-soil contact, increased performance. The processing capabilities of GEE will support the MDA in scaling up remote sensing performance analysis statewide, providing information to evaluate the environmental outcomes associated with various agronomic management strategies. The tool can be modified for different seasonal cutoffs, utilize new sensors to capture phenology in winter and spring, and scale to larger regions for use in adaptive management of winter cover crops planted for environmental benefit.', '[Thieme, Alison; Yadav, Sunita; Oddo, Perry C.; Fitz, John M.; McCartney, Sean] NASA DEVELOP Natl Program, MS 307, Hampton, VA 23681 USA.

The concepts of the p-theory have been reported and examined at the shoot and canopy scales, but not yet for the crown level. Currently, the p-value is estimated indirectly, such as converted from the spherically averaged silhouette to total area ratio ((STAR) over bar) or canopy transmittance measurements. In this work, we first validate the theoretical considerations of the p concept at the crown level (e.g., its relationship with (STAR) over bar), and then provide the first method to directly estimate photon recollision probability using Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) data. The proposed geometric method is data-driven and avoids explicit reconstructions of tree structures. The p-value estimated here is the average recollision probability over spatial locations. We showed that the average recollision probability can be interpreted as the local spherical openness on phytoelement (leaf or needle) surfaces, which enabled a simple visibility calculation by avoiding explicit ray tracing. The developed method was tested on synthetic crowns of needle-leaved tree species, for which the reference p-values were known. Results confirmed the validity of the p-(STAR) over bar relationship at the crown level, and showed that p-values can be accurately estimated from TLS point clouds with a relative root measure square error of less than 10%.

Taking the urban group of Xi\'an City and Xianyang City in Western China as a case study area, this study proposed a wavelet coherence approach to identifying the prioritizing LST influencing factors and research scales. Based on the sample transects, the results showed that around 1 km could be used as the prioritizing research scale for simultaneously exploring multiple LST influencing factors. And the normalized difference build-up index was the dominant influencing factor with the strongest multi-scale stability. The coherence relationships with LST of the area percentage of blue land, and the mean patch area of blue land represented high spatial heterogeneity, with multi-scale stability in the area of widespread water body. The normalized difference vegetation index should also be highlighted due to the multi-scale stability and stable medium coherence with LST.

But optical sensors often miss key stages for crop growth because of clouds, which poses challenges to many studies. The synergistic of SAR and optical data is expected to lift this problem, especially in areas with persistent cloud cover. However, due to the different characteristics of optical and SAR sensors, it is difficult to build a relationship between the two with most existing methods, let alone construct the long-time correlations to fill optic observation gaps using SAR data. Inspired by deep learning, this study presents a novel strategy to learn the relationship between optical and SAR time series based on the sequence of contextual information. To be specific, we extended the conventional CNN-RNN to build Multi-CNN-Sequence to Sequence (MCNN-Seq) model, and formulate the correlation between the optic and SAR time series sequences. We verified the MCNN-Seq model and found that the accuracy of the predicted optical image was determined by crop types and phenological stages, both in the spatial and temporal domain, respectively. For several crops, such as onion, winter wheat, corn, and sugar beet, our predictions are fitting well with R2 0.9409, 0.9824,0.9157, and 0.9749, respectively. Compared to CNN and RNN, the simulation accuracy achieved by the MCNN-Seq model is much better in terms of R2 and RMSE. In general, results demonstrate that deep learning models have the potential to synergize SAR and optical data and provide replaceable information when the optical data has a long data gap due to the persistent clouds.', '[Zhao, Wenzhi; Qu, Yang] Beijing Normal Univ, Inst Remote Sensing Sci & Engn, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

EnviroAtlas maps ecosystem services indicators at national, regional, and local extents that can contribute to targets set forth in numerous goals, such as SDG 6 for clean water, SDG 11 for sustainable cities and communities, and SDG 15 for life on land. Examples of EnviroAtlas indicators that provide a way to view spatial inequalities, help fill gaps in environmental indicators, and integrate socio-economic and environmental data for the SDGs are explored herein. Remotely sensed EO data are essential for producing these indicators and informing planning and decision-making for the SDGs at subnational scales. The National Land Cover Dataset is the basis for many EnviroAtlas maps at the national extent, while National Agriculture Imagery Program and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data are used to classify Meter-scale Urban Land Cover in select US metro areas. These 30 m and 1 m land cover products are combined with demographic and other geospatial data (remotely sensed and otherwise) to produce integrated indicators that can aid in target setting of the SDGs. Though EnviroAtlas was created for the conterminous US, the methods for indicator creation are transferable, and the open-source code for the EnviroAtlas resource may serve as an example for other nations. Achieving the SDGs means assessing targets and decision-making outcomes at local, regional, and national levels using consistent and accurate data. Geospatial resources like EnviroAtlas that provide open access to indicators based on EO data and allow for assessment at multiple extents and resolutions are critical to broadly addressing national to subnational SDG goals and targets.', '[Cochran, Ferdouz] US EPA, Oak Ridge Inst Sci & Educ, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.

Here, we tested the ability of using leaf reflectance spectra to estimate LMA and LDMC and classify plant growth forms within the cerrado and campo rupestre seasonally dry non-forest vegetation types of Southeastern Brazil, filling an existing gap in published assessments of leaf optical properties and plant traits in such environments. We measured leaf reflectance spectra from 1648 individual plants comprising grasses, herbs, shrubs, and trees, developed partial least squares regression (PLSR) models linking LMA and LDMC to leaf spectra (400-2500 nm), and identified the spectral regions with the greatest discriminatory power among growth forms using Bhattacharyya distances. We accurately predicted leaf functional traits and identified different growth forms. LMA was overall more accurately predicted (RMSE = 8.58%) than LDMC (RMSE = 9.75%). Our model including all sampled plants was not biased towards any particular growth form, but growth-form specific models yielded higher accuracies and showed that leaf traits from woody plants can be more accurately estimated than for grasses and forbs, independently of the trait measured. We observed a large range of LMA values (31.80-620.81 g/m(2)) rarely observed in tropical or temperate forests, and demonstrated that values above 300 g/m(2) could not be accurately estimated. Our results suggest that spectroscopy may have an intrinsic saturation point, and/or that PLSR, the current approach of choice for estimating traits from plant spectra, is not able to model the entire range of LMA values. This finding has very important implications to our ability to use field, airborne, and orbital spectroscopic methods to derive generalizable functional information. We thus highlight the need for increasing spectroscopic sampling and research efforts in drier non-forested environments, where environmental pressures lead to leaf adaptations and allocation strategies that are very different from forested ecosystems. Our findings also confirm that leaf reflectance spectra can provide important information regarding differences in leaf metabolism, structure, and chemical composition. Such information enabled us to accurately discriminate plant growth forms in these environments regardless of lack of variation in leaf economic traits, encouraging further adoption of remote sensing methods by ecologists and allowing a more comprehensive assessment of plant functional diversity.', '[Streher, Annia Susin] Univ Estadual Paulista, Inst Biociencias, Dept Biodiversidade, UNESP, Rio Claro, SP, Brazil.

The capability of conventional Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to monitor tectonic movements, volcanic eruptions and city subsidence has been fully demonstrated, but its application to mining subsidence is limited because of the failure caused by localized surface displacements with strong spatial gradients. In this paper, a new method is presented to utilize SAR pixel Offset Tracking (OT) with a single pair of SAR images to resolve three-dimensional (3D) large surface displacements caused by underground coal mining. Coal mining subsidence theory is utilised to analytically separate the vertical and horizontal components. This method is applied to the Daliuta coal mining area in Shaanxi Province, China, where a dense GPS network is available. Results show the RMS differences of OT derived displacements against GPS in both horizontal and vertical directions are in the sub-centimeter level. In addition, a prediction of mining-induced ground movements is performed with the Support Vector Regression algorithm and RMS differences of 12.4, 13.1 and 14.4 cm are observed compared to GPS, in the vertical, easting and northing directions respectively. The framework demonstrated in this paper is not only able to derive the evolution of the 3D large surface displacements with multi-temporal SAR images in a single-geometry, but also has a potential for short-term predication, which can provide early warnings and promote strategic decision-making for engineering management in the process of coal mining.', '[Chen, Bingqian; Kang, Jianrong; Hu, Jinshan; Liang, Liang] Jiangsu Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Geomat & Urban Rural Planning, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

The concentration of SPM can be derived from particle scatter if the specific scattering properties of the respective water body are known. In this paper we show that likewise, ISPM can be derived reliably from remotely sensed particle scatter. An empirical algorithm between particle scatter (AC9 data) and ISPM concentration (measured gravimetrically) was derived from in-water measurements. This regional algorithm was then applied to the iop_bpart level 2 product (i.e. the particle scatter measured at 443 nm) derived from OLCI data on Sentinel-A (S3A) using the C2RCC neural network and validated against an independent data set. The standard error of the derived OLCI match-up data was 10%, and was thus within the goal of the mission requirements of Sentinel-3.   The generated S3 composite images from spring and autumn 2018 show that in the Baltic Sea most of the ISPM falls out rather close to the shore, whereas only a very small proportion of ISPM is carried further off-shore. This is also supported by in situ ISPM transects measured in the coastal zone.   The ISPM images clearly highlight the areas that are most strongly influenced by terrestrial matter. Differences between the NE Baltic and the SE Baltic proper can be explained by the difference in hydrology and coastal influence as well as bathymetry and wind-wave stirring. The method is of interest for coastal zone management and for assessing the effect of seasonal changes in terrestrial run-off and wind-driven resuspension of sediments. It can also be used to evaluate the effect of climate change which has led to an increase of extreme storm and flooding events that are usually accompanied by increased erosion and run-off from land. Last but not least, turbidity caused by particles influences the light conditions in inner coastal areas and bays, which has a profound effect on pelagic productivity, the maximum growth of macroalgae as well as fish behaviour.', '[Kratzer, Susanne; Kyryliuk, Dmytro] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.

Accurate prediction of reflectance change is difficult, especially when the change is caused by both phenological change and land cover class changes. Although several spatio-temporal fusion methods such as the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) directly derive land cover phenological change information (such as endmember change) at different dates, the direct derivation of land cover class change information is challenging. In this paper, an enhanced FSDAF that incorporates sub-pixel class fraction change information (SFSDAF) is proposed. By directly deriving the sub-pixel land cover class fraction change information the proposed method allows accurate prediction even for heterogeneous regions that undergo a land cover class change. In particular, SFSDAF directly derives fine spatial resolution endmember change and class fraction change at the date of the observed image pair and the date of prediction, which can help identify image reflectance change resulting from different sources. SFSDAF predicts a fine resolution image at the time of acquisition of coarse resolution images using only one prior coarse and fine resolution image pair, and accommodates variations in reflectance due to both natural fluctuations in class spectral response (e.g. due to phenology) and land cover class change. The method is illustrated using degraded and real images and compared against three established spatio-temporal methods. The results show that the SFSDAF produced the least blurred images and the most accurate predictions of fine resolution reflectance values, especially for regions of heterogeneous landscape and regions that undergo some land cover class change. Consequently, the SFSDAF has considerable potential in monitoring Earth surface dynamics.', '[Li, Xiaodong; Zhang, Yihang; Du, Yun; Ling, Feng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geodesy & Geophys, Key Lab Environm & Disaster Monitoring & Evaluat, Wuhan 430077, Peoples R China.

In order to increase the spatial and temporal resolution, availability and quality of sandbars observations, this study proposes and evaluates a new approach for automatic extraction of sandbars positions from freely available satellite imagery, using a case study of complex waters located on the Danube Delta coast, Black Sea. Validation of the satellite extracted sandbars locations against 4 in-situ measurements between 2016 and 2018 shows a very good correlation between the two datasets, demonstrating the high accuracy of satellite-derived data in revealing the underwater morphology of the upper shoreface along large areas and with high temporal resolution. The obtained sandbars positions were then integrated into an automatic workflow able to accurately represent the seasonal and multi-annual sandbars dynamics and also to give an insight about the sandbars alongshore behavioural changes. The results are similar to the ones previously suggested by other studies, which empowered different methods. These prove the high potential of the newly proposed algorithm to be used for the automatic extraction of the positions of underwater features in the surf zone on other sites worldwide, after proper tuning of parameters in accordance with local conditions. The main constraints of the proposed approach are represented by the omission of sandbars position that imprint a low signal on the satellite image due to increased water depth (especially for the outer bar), high turbidity (mostly for the inner bar) or any other noise generation situation (sun glint, small wind waves). The main advantages of the described algorithm are related to the simplicity of implementation and adaptability to other areas of interest and other types of satellite data.', '[Tatui, Florin; Constantin, Sorin] Univ Bucharest, Res Inst, Bucharest, Romania.

Accurate estimation of AGB and carbon stocks in this biome is important for addressing sustainable development goals as the information can aid natural resource management at varied spatial scales. Previous AGB mapping efforts focused on humid forests, with little attention on savannas. This study explored the use of annual monthly time-series of Senitinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data to map AGB in the SS. Backscatter, spectral reflectance, and derivatives (vegetation indices and biophysical parameters) were combined with field inventory data in a Random Forest regression to map AGB. Eight experiments were conducted with different data configurations to determine: (1) the potential of S-1 and S-2 for AGB mapping, (2) optimal image acquisition period for AGB mapping, and (3) contribution of image derivatives to improving the accuracy of AGB mapping. The predicted map was validated with 40% of the inventory data. Uncertainty in the AGB was assessed using mean absolute error, root mean squared error, coefficient of determination and symmetrical mean absolute percentage error. Results show that about 90% of the study area have low AGB stocks of less than 90 Mg/ha. Compared to S-1 (RMSE: 78.6; MAE: 25.6), S-2 achieved better prediction accuracy (RMSE: 60.6; MAE: 19.2), although combination of the two according to seasonality produced the best results (RMSE: 45.4; MAE: 16.3). Images acquired in the dry season were found to be more useful for predicting AGB than those of rainy season. Also, stress-related vegetation indices and a red-edge dependent normalized difference vegetation index not tested in previous AGB studies using Sentinels were found to be significant contributors to the superior performance of S-2. Since biomass is a finite resource, our results can provide valuable information on the sustainable use of biomass and energy security including studies on carbon cycling and ecosystem functions in the region. The demonstrated possibility of using open access earth observation data to map and monitor AGB in data scarce regions is useful and beneficial to attaining SDG indicators 15.2.1 (sustainable forest management) and 15.3.1 (proportion of land that is degraded over total land area).

Persistent clouds over agricultural fields can mask key stages of crop growth, leading to unreliable yield predictions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides all-weather imagery which can potentially overcome this limitation, but given its high and distinct sensitivity to different surface properties, the fusion of SAR and optical data still remains an open challenge. In this work, we propose the use of Multi-Output Gaussian Process (MOGP) regression, a machine learning technique that learns automatically the statistical relationships among multisensor time series, to detect vegetated areas over which the synergy between SAR-optical imageries is profitable. For this purpose, we use the Sentinel-1 Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) and Sentinel-2 Leaf Area Index (LAI) time series over a study area in north west of the Iberian peninsula. Through a physical interpretation of MOGP trained models, we show its ability to provide estimations of LAI even over cloudy periods using the information shared with RVI, which guarantees the solution keeps always tied to real measurements. Results demonstrate the advantage of MOGP especially for long data gaps, where optical-based methods notoriously fail. The leave-one-image-out assessment technique applied to the whole vegetation cover shows MOGP predictions improve standard GP estimations over short-time gaps (R-2 of 74% vs 68%, RMSE of 0.4 vs 0.44 [m(2)m(-2)]) and especially over long-time gaps (R-2 of 33% vs 12%, RMSE of 0.5 vs 1.09 [m(2)m(-2)]). A second assessment is focused on crop-specific regions, clustering pixels fulfilling specific model conditions where the synergy is profitable. Results reveal the MOGP performance is crop type and crop stage dependent. For long time gaps, best R-2 are obtained over maize, ranging from 0.1 (tillering) to 0.36 (development) up to 0.81 (maturity); for moderate time gap, R-2 = 0.93 (maturity) is obtained. Crops such as wheat, oats, rye and barley, can profit from the LAI-RVI synergy, with R-2 varying between 0.4 and 0.6. For beet or potatoes, MOGP provides poorer results, but alternative descriptors to RVI should be tested for these specific crops in the future before discarding synergy real benefits. In conclusion, active-passive sensor fusion with MOGP represents a novel and promising approach to cope with crop monitoring over cloud-dominated areas.', '[Pipia, Luca; Munoz-Mari, Jordi; Amin, Eatidal; Belda, Santiago; Camps-Valls, Gustau; Verrelst, Jochem] Univ Valencia, IPL, Parc Cient, Valencia 46980, Spain.', 'University of ValenciaRP Pipia, L (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, IPL, Parc Cient, Valencia 46980, Spain.', 'luca.pipia@uv.esRI , Gustavo/ABC-1706-2022; Pipia, Luca/AAN-9780-2020; Camps-Valls,   Gustavo/A-2532-2011; Verrelst, Jochem/AAH-4788-2019; Belda,   Santiago/O-3342-2017; verrelst, Jochem/ABB-1911-2021', 'Pipia, Luca/0000-0003-0759-4422; Camps-Valls,   Gustavo/0000-0003-1683-2138; Verrelst, Jochem/0000-0002-6313-2081;   Belda, Santiago/0000-0003-3739-6056; Amin, Eatidal/0000-0003-4878-5268', 'European Union [730074]; European Research Council (ERC) under the   ERC-2017-STG SENTIFLEX project [755617]; ERC under the ERCCOG-2034 SEDAL   [647423]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO);   FEDER [TIN2012-38102-0O3-01, TIN2015-64210-R]; SENSAGRI H2020 Project   [730074]', 'The research leading to these results has received funding from the   European Union\'s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme, under   Grant Agreement no 730074.

This indicator is to be measured using trends in a remotely-sensed vegetation index. The use of vegetation indices is well-established and remotely-sensed data are readily available. However, their uses for monitoring production that is relevant to sustainable livelihoods have received little attention. This review identifies four areas in the currently-proposed monitoring methodology that are in need of further development. The first is the derivation of primary production from vegetation indices, which requires attention to physiological processes such as light-use efficiency and plant respiration. The second concerns the subsequent steps, in which ecological processes transform the net production into production of goods and services, such as crop products. The third is the need for explicit baselines or reference conditions that specify the productivity in the absence of anthropogenic degradation. The fourth, and most difficult, is to distinguish anthropogenic causes of degradation from potentially similar effects of natural environmental processes. Some of these issues are difficult to tackle with remote sensing alone, although several improvements are available, and others are in development.

Currently, SMAP has an L-band radiometer and a defunct L-band radar with a rotating 6-m mesh reflector antenna. On July 7th, 2015, the SMAP radar malfunctioned and became inoperable. Consequently, the production of high-resolution active-passive soil moisture product got hampered, and only similar to 2.5 months (April 15th, 2015 to July 7th, 2015) of data remain available. Therefore, during the SMAP post-radar phase, many ways were examined to restart the high-resolution soil moisture product generation of the SMAP mission. One of the feasible approaches was to substitute the SMAP radar with other available SAR data. Sentinel-1A/Sentinel-1B SAR data was found most suitable for combining with the SMAP radiometer data because of its nearly similar orbit configuration that allows overlapping of their swaths with a minimal time difference, a key feature/requirement for the SMAP active-passive algorithm. The Sentinel interferometric wide swath (IW) mode acquisition also provides the co-polarized and cross-polarized observations required for the SMAP active-passive algorithm. However, some differences do exist between the SMAP and Sentinel SAR data. They are mainly: 1) Sentinel has a C-band SAR whereas SMAP operates at L-band; 2) Sentinel has multiple incidence angles within its swath, and SMAP has one single incidence angle; and 3) Sentinel 1A/B Interferometric Wide (IW) swath width is similar to 250 km as compared to SMAP with 1000 km swath width. On any given day, the narrow swath width of the Sentinel observations significantly reduces the overlap spatial coverage between SMAP and Sentinel as compared to the original SMAP radar and radiometer swath coverage. Hence, the temporal resolution (revisit interval) suffers due to narrow overlapped swath width and degrades from 3 days to 12 days. One advantage of using very high-resolution resolution Sentinel-1A/Sentinel-1B data in the SMAP active-passive algorithm is the potential of obtaining the disaggregated brightness temperature and thus soil moisture at a much finer spatial resolution of 3 km and 1 km at global extent. The assessment of high-resolution product at 3 km and 1 km using the soil moisture calibration and validations sites shows reasonable accuracy of similar to 0.05 m(3)/m(3).

This study proposed a novel approach to produce winter wheat maps using statistics as the training targets of supervised classification. Deep neural network architectures were built to link remotely sensed image series to the harvested areas of individual administrative units. After training, the resultant maps were generated using the activations on a middle layer of the deep model. The direct use of statistical data to some extent alleviates the shortage of ground samples in classification tasks and provides an opportunity to utilize a wealth of statistical records to improve land use mapping. The experiments were carried out in Kansas and Northern Texas during 2001-2017. For each study area the goal was to create winter maps that are consistent with USDA county-level statistics of harvested areas. The trained deep models automatically identified the seasonal pattern of winter wheat pixels without using pixel-level reference data. The winter wheat maps were compared with the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) for years when the CDL is available. In Kansas where the winter wheat extent of the CDL has high reported accuracy and agrees well with county statistics, the maps produced from the deep model was evaluated using the CDL as an independent test set. Northern Texas was selected as an example where the winter wheat area of the CDL is very different from official statistics, and the maps by the deep model enabled a map-to-map comparison with the CDL to highlight the areas of discrepancy. Visual representation of the deep model behaviors and recognized patterns show that deep learning is an automated and robust means to handle the variability of winter wheat seasonality without the need of manual feature engineering and intensive ground data collection. Showing the possibility of generating maps solely from regional statistics, the proposed deep learning approach has great potential to fill the historical gaps of conventional sample-based classification and extend applications to areas where only regional statistics are available.

While SIF has an intrinsic, underlying relationship with canopy light capture and light use efficiency, these physiological relationships are obscured by the fact that satellites observe a small and variable fraction of total emitted canopy SIF. Upon emission, most SIF photons are reabsorbed or scattered within the canopy, preventing their observation remotely. The complexities of the radiative transfer process, which vary across time and space, limit our ability to reliably infer physiological processes from SIF observations. Here, we propose an approach for estimating the fraction of total emitted near-infrared SIF (760 nm) photons that escape the canopy by combining the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV) and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), two widely available remote sensing products. Our approach relies on the fact that NIRV is resilient against soil background contamination, allowing us to reliably calculate the bidirectional reflectance factor of vegetation, which in turn conveys information about the escape ratio of SIF photons. Our NIRV-based approach explains variations in the escape ratio with an R-2 of 0.91 and an RMSE of 1.48% across a series of simulations where canopy structure, soil brightness, and sun-sensor-canopy geometry are varied. The approach is applicable to conditions of low leaf area index and fractional vegetation cover. We show that correcting for the escape ratio of SIF using NIRV provides robust estimates of total emitted SIF, providing for the possibility of studying physiological variations of fluorescence yield at the global scale.', '[Zeng, Yelu; Badgley, Grayson; Berry, J.

However, due to the scattering and re-absorption effects inside the leaves and canopy, SIF measured at the canopy level is only a small part of the total SIF emission at the photosystem level. Therefore, a downscaling mechanism of SIF from the canopy level to the photosystem level is important for better understanding the relationship between SIF and the vegetation gross primary production (GPP). In this study, firstly, we analyzed the canopy scattering effects using a simple parameterization model based on the spectral invariant theory. The probability for SIF photons to escape from the canopy was found to be related to the anisotropic spectral reflectance, canopy interception of the upward solar radiation, and leaf absorption. An empirical approach based on a Random Forest (RF) regression algorithm was applied to downscale SIF constrained by the red, red-edge and far-red anisotropic reflectance. The RF was trained using simulations conducted with the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model. The performance of the SIF downscaling method was evaluated with SCOPE and Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model simulations, ground measurements and airborne data. Results show that estimated SIF at the photosystem level matches well with simulated reference data, and the relationship between SIF and photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by chlorophyll is improved by SIF downscaling. This finding in combination with other evaluation criteria suggests the downscaling of canopy SIF as an efficient strategy to normalize species dependent effects of canopy structure and varying solar-view geometries. Based on our results for the SIF-APAR relationship, we expect that such normalization approaches can be helpful to improve estimates of photosynthesis using remote sensing measurements of SIF.', '[Liu, Xinjie; Liu, Liangyun; Peng, Dailiang; Du, Shanshan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Key Lab Digital Earth Sci, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.

Passive-optical remote sensing techniques, despite remarkable success in identifying global hotspots of forest cover loss, cannot fully satisfy observation requirements at the plot or canopy crown level. Critical issues including signal saturation and algorithm uncertainty impose limitations on capturing subtle canopy cover changes using standard products generated from satellite imagery, particularly over largely intact dense tropical forests. Spaceborne lidar remote sensing can fill this gap in contemporary Earth observation networks by providing direct measurements of 3-D canopy structure. Here we analyze global canopy cover distributions using observations from the Geoscience Laser Altimetry System (GLAS) onboard of NASA\'s Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-1). We found ICESat-based cover estimates were sensitive to canopy cover dynamics even over dense forests with cover exceeding 80% and were able to better characterize biome-level gradients and canopy cover distributions than the existing products derived from conventional optical remote sensing. At the footprint level, ICESat-1 produced almost no bias when compared with airborne estimates, and had RMSE values on the order of similar to 20% cover. Improved cover products based on lidar should allow comprehensive analysis of subtle forest structure changes at landscape scales, and provide unique information for biophysical stratification of forests and changes in vertical canopy structure. This is particularly true given the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidar recently installed on the International Space Station, which will acquire higher resolution lidar data at greater sampling densities than has been available to date.', '[Tang, Hao; Armston, John; Marselis, Suzanne; Dubayah, Ralph] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

By cross-comparing three independent collocated observations, triple collocation (TC) can solve for geophysical product errors in error-prone systems. However, acquiring three independent products for a geophysical variable of interest can be challenging. Here, a double instrumental variable based algorithm (IVd) is proposed as an extension of the existing single instrumental variable (IVs) approach to estimate product error standard deviation (sigma) and product-truth correlation (R) using only two independent products - an easier requirement to meet in practice. An analytical examination of the IVd method suggests that it is less prone to bias and has reduced sampling errors relative to IVs. Results from an example application of the IVd method to precipitation product error estimation show that IVd-based a and R are good approximations of reference values obtained from TC at the global extent. In addition to their spatial consistency, IVd estimated error metrics also have only marginal (less than 5%) relative biases versus a TC baseline. Consistent with our earlier analytical analysis, these empirical results are shown to be superior to those obtained by IVs. However, several caveats for the IVd approach should be acknowledged. As with TC and IVs, IVd estimates are less robust when the signal-to-noise ratio of geophysical products is very low. Additionally, IVd may be significantly biased when geophysical products have strongly contrasting error auto-correlations.', '[Dong, Jianzhi; Crow, Wade T.] USDA, Hydrol & Remote Sensing Lab, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA.

Vegetation changes over large areas are traditionally monitored by linking plot-scale measurements to satellite data. However, integrating field and satellite data is not straightforward. Typically, the satellite data are at a much coarser scale in comparison to field measurements. Here, we studied how Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) can be used to bridge this gap. We covered three 250 m x 250 m sites in Fennoscandian tundra with varying productivity ana FCover, ranging from barren vegetation to shrub tundra. The UAS sites were then used to train satellite data-based FCover models.   First, we created a binary vegetation classification (absent, present) by using UAS-derived RGB-orthomosaics and logistic regression. Secondly, we used the classification to calculate FCover to Planet CubeSat (3 m), Sentinel-2A MSI (10 m, 20 m), and Landsat 8 OLI (30 m) grids, and examined how well FCover is explained by various spectral vegetation indices (VI) derived from satellite data.   The overall classification accuracies for the UAS sites were >= 90%. The UAS-FCover were strongly related to the tested VIs (D-2 89% at best). The explained deviance was generally higher for coarser resolution data, indicating that the effect of data resolution should be taken into account when comparing results from different sensors. VIs based on red-edge (at 740 nm, 783 nm), or near-infrared and shortwave infrared (SWIR) had the highest performance. We recommend wider inspection of red-edge and SWIR bands for future Arctic vegetation research.   Our results demonstrate that UASs can be used for observing FCover at multiple scales. Individual UAS sites can serve as focus areas, which provide information at the finest resolution (e.g. individual plants), whereas a sample of several UAS sites can be used to train satellite data and examine vegetation over larger extents.', '[Riihimaki, Henri; Luoto, Miska; Heiskanen, Janne] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, POB 64, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.

In contrast, the quantity that matters for coastal management and society is relative sea level. That is, the sea level relative to the land, as measured by conventional tide gauges. However, two important issues are associated with the use of tide gauges. First, supplemental information is required to separate vertical land motion from ocean climate signals in tide gauge records, and hence to understand the causes of future coastal sea level changes and their relative importance. This can be provided by space-borne geodetic techniques, for instance installing a permanent Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna at the tide gauge. Second, vertical land motion can show local spatial patterns, which limits the spatial validity of the point-wise information at the GPS station. Using Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and high-precision GPS data, the above-mentioned limitations were addressed in the case study of Brest (France). Our findings show that, over the past decades, Brest and its surroundings are overall stable, in agreement with the geological setting, except for the embankment areas of the commercial and military harbours. The GPS-calibrated InSAR results were then further combined with geocentric satellite radar altimetry data to obtain relative sea level trends along the Brest coastline with an unprecedented high-spatial resolution of 200 m.

Due to the lack of in situ lake level monitoring for most lakes, and long-term continuous satellite altimetry data for some large lakes, estimates of water storage changes for all lakes throughout the TP over a long time is challenging. We have estimated the lake water storage changes of 315 lakes (each lake is > 10 km(2)) during the period of 1976-2013 through an empirical equation based on Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data and Landsat images. These lakes are located within endorheic basins and occupied approximately 80% of the total lake surface areas of the TP in 2013 based on the results of this study and Zhang et al. (2014). The results showed that the lake water storage decreased by 23.69 Gt from 1976 to 1990 and increased by 140.8 Gt from 1990 to 2013. Increased water storage was mainly concentrated in the central TP (regions A) and northern TP (region B). The increase in total lake surface area during the period 2000-2013 in region B (1981.6 km(2)) was greater than that in region A (1869.1 km(2)), but the increase in the water storage in the former was half of that in the latter, indicating that lake surface area changes cannot represent the degree of lake water storage change due to differences in the topography and lake size. Although the total variation in the rate of the lake water storage change (7.19 Gt/y) was similar to the rate of increase in the mass (7 +/- 7 Gt/y) estimated from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data for the whole region, the spatial distribution of these variations was largely different. During the period 2000-2013, a trend analysis revealed that precipitation was perhaps the primary reason for lake change throughout the TP, while a decreasing evaporation rate only contributed approximately 1.5%, 2.5% and 1.7% to the expansions of the lakes in regions A, C and D respectively. However, based on modern glacier mass balance observation data, we estimated that glacial meltwater may have contributed 22.2%, 39.8%, 50.6% and 100% to the increasing water storage during the period 2000-2013 by rough estimates in regions A, B, C and D, respectively, indicating that glacial meltwater perhaps was a primary contributor to lake expansion in region D, which was located in an extremely cold and dry climate with a broad distribution of glaciers.', '[Qiao, Baojin] Zhengzhou Univ, Inst Smart City, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan, Peoples R China.

Consequently, soil moisture proxies derived from antecedent rainfall considerations are commonly applied in their place. However, the suitably of satellite RS products has not yet been examined for newer soil moisture products derived from L-band microwave radiometry. This study globally compares correlations between monthly soil moisture and the monthly number of summertime hot days (NHD) for the case of three separate RS-based soil moisture products and a fourth soil moisture proxy derived from the standard precipitation index (SPI). Compared with SPI-based estimates, C- and X-band RS soil moisture products demonstrate a significantly (at p = 0.05 [-] confidence) weaker correlation with NHD. However, 2010-2018 L-band Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) based soil moisture-NHD correlation is generally comparable to the SPI case. Furthermore, utilizing higher-precision 2015-2018 soil moisture products from the L-band Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission further strengthens soil moisture-NHD correlation and leads to stronger sampled correlations than SPI over global hot spot regions (significant at p = 0.05 [-] confidence). Combined with the general equivalence of monthly surface and root zone soil moisture anomalies, these results suggest that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR, i.e. the relative size of soil moisture signal and random observation error variances) of RS-based surface soil moisture product, instead of their vertical measurement depth, is the key limiting factor determining their ability to quantify land atmosphere coupling strengths. Based on this, we argue that L-band soil moisture products have reached a sufficient level of SNR to be of value for the study of land-atmosphere coupling.', '[Dong, Jianzhi; Crow, Wade T.] USDA, Hydrol & Remote Sensing Lab, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA.', 'United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)RP Dong, JZ (通讯作者)，USDA, Hydrol & Remote Sensing Lab, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA.', 'Jianzhi.Dong@ars.usda.govRI Crow, Wade/ABC-9227-2020', 'Dong, Jianzhi/0000-0002-3284-4414', 'NASA SMAP mission [NNH12ZDA001N-SMAP]', 'This paper was partially supported by the NASA SMAP mission through   award NNH12ZDA001N-SMAP.', 35, 15, 16, 5, 56, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Unfortunately, an assessment of how much native grassland remains in North America is difficult because all nation-wide landcover mapping products do not reliably distinguish native grasslands from grasslands that have been deliberately planted with tame grasses and forbs (i.e., tame grasslands). We established a 218.5 km(2) study area in southwestern Saskatchewan, Canada to evaluate the use of high-resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) for classification of native (i.e., fields with native-dominant species mixes or fields that were formerly native species dominated but have been invaded by exotic species) and tame grasslands (i.e., grasslands dominated by exotic grass and forb species), and compared these classifications to the best-available landcover mapping product that is currently available for this area. We used the presence of tractor furrows, identified from the LiDAR digital terrain hillshade product, in tame-dominated grasslands to distinguish them from native dominated grasslands that had an absence of tractor furrows. The LiDAR method achieved substantially better classification success (Cohen\'s Kappa = 0.57) at distinguishing native-dominated (N = 82) from tame-dominated grasslands (N = 45), than the currently available landcover product (Cohen\'s Kappa = 0.13) over our 218.5 km(2) study area.

Yet we lack a deeper understanding of the spatial variability observed in LSP within a land cover type and the factors that control it. Here we make use of a high resolution LiDAR based dataset to study the effect of subpixel forest stand characteristics on the spatial variability of LSP metrics based on MODIS NDVI. Multiple linear regression techniques (MLR) were applied on forest stand information and topography derived from LiDAR as well as land cover information (i.e. CORINE and proprietary habitat maps for the year 2012) to predict average LSP metrics of the mountainous Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany. Six different LSP metrics, i.e. start of season (SOS), end of season (EOS), length of season (LOS), NDVI integrated over the growing season (NDVIsum), maximum NDVI value (NDVImax) and day of maximum NDVI (maxDOY) were modelled in this study. It was found that irrespective of the land cover, the mean SOS, LOS and NDVIsum were largely driven by elevation. However, inclusion of detailed forest stand information improved the models considerably. The EOS however was more complex to model, and the subpixel percentage of broadleaf forests and the slope of the terrain were found to be more strongly linked to EOS. The explained variance of the NDVImax improved from 0.45 to 0.71 when additionally considering land cover information, which further improved to 0.84 when including LiDAR based subpixelforest stand characteristics. Since completely homogenous pixels are rare in nature, our results suggest that incorporation of subpixel forest stand information along with land cover type leads to an improved performance of topography based LSP models. The novelty of this study lies in the use of topography, land cover and subpixel vegetation characteristics derived from LiDAR in a stepwise manner with increasing level of complexity, which demonstrates the importance of forest stand information on LSP at the pixel level.', '[Misra, Gourav; Buras, Allan; Menzel, Annette] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Ecoclimatol, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.

A data set of ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 L-band images is used as an example of successful inversion at the scene level, with sub-kilometer resolution. The results are validated with soil moisture products based on ASCAT and show a high degree of correlation. The raw moisture derived by the algorithm could be immediately used to correct SAR interferometric phases; however, for applications that need absolute moisture levels, a calibration step is likely necessary. Unexpectedly, a good performance was observed over forested areas, which suggests a sensitivity of closure phases to tree moisture; at the same time, over pastures and agricultural fields the closure phase signal was found relatively weak.

The updated algorithm improves upon the heritage Collection 5.1 (C5.1) MCD64A1 and MCD45A1 algorithms by offering significantly better detection of small burns, a modest reduction in burn-date temporal uncertainty, and a large reduction in the extent of unmapped areas. Comparison of the C6 and C5.1 MCD64A1 products for fifteen years (2002-2016) on a regional basis shows that the C6 product detects considerably more burned area globally (26%) and in almost every region considered. The sole exception was in Boreal North America, where the mean annual area burned was 6% lower for C6, primarily as a result of a large increase in the number of small lakes mapped (and subsequently masked) at high latitudes in the upstream C6 input data. With respect to temporal reporting accuracy, 44% of the C6 MCD64A1 burned grid cells were detected on the same day as an active fire, and 68% within 2 days, which represents a substantial reduction in temporal uncertainty compared to the C5.1 MCD64A1 and MCD45A1 products.

Using ultra- and hyperspectral technologies, the goals of this research comprise the definition and mapping of Neotropical tree species that are associated with geological facies (here called geo-environments) as well as their spectral discrimination at leaf and crown scales. This work also aims to investigate the possible relationship between leaf and crown spectral and chemical properties. The study was developed at the Mogi-Guacu Ecological Station, in the Cerrado domain, southeastern Brazil. Data from 70 sample units, such as sediment texture and species from inventories, were first analyzed through vectorial quantization using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). Principal Component Analysis and Spearman\'s ranked correlation coefficients were used to define geo-environments and target-species, respectively. Biochemical and visible to shortwave infrared (VSWIR) point spectral data (350-2500 nm) were collected from the leaves of the target-species, during both rainy and dry seasons. Spectral data from target-species crowns were obtained from hyperspectral images (530-2.532 nm, ProSpecTIR-VS sensor) with 1 m spatial resolution, and acquired in the beginning of the dry season. These spectra were classified using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) with two endmembers (EMs). Based on the MESMA results with two EMs, the best dataset per target-species was chosen for pixel-based image unmixing with three EMs (target-species, other vegetation types and shade). From 121 species sampled in the field, two proved to be associated with floodplains (Alluvial Deposits sequence), two with hills and plateaus of the Aquidauna Formation (Carboniferous sedimentary rocks, Parana Basin), and two more with a specific facies of the Aquidauna Formation that has a distinctive presence of coarse and very coarse sand. Five target-species were well discriminated at the leaf scale, reaching 90.0% and 85.0% of global accuracies in the rainy season and in the dry season, respectively. Accurate spectral discrimination appears to be linked to the considerable biochemical variability of their leaves in both seasons. Three species were discriminated at the crown scale, with 70.6% of global accuracy. When eight other landscape scale vegetation classes were included in the analyses, only Qualea grandiflora Mart. produced a satisfactory accuracy (61.1% and 100% of producer and user\'s accuracies, respectively). The spatial distribution of its fraction in the unmixed image, particularly, matches with the geological facies to which it was associated in the field. Ecological requirements for successfully mapping indicator species include broad and random distribution of the target-species\' population, and singular physiological, phenological (and spectral) behavior at the imagery acquisition date.

Several studies have observed that it is highly challenging to map different vegetation types in tropical rainforests due to large environmental heterogeneity, high topographical variability and near constant cloud cover. In the present study, we assessed the capability of optical multispectral Sentinel-2 MSI bands, their derived NDVI and textures, and SAR Sentinel-1 bands and their textures to discriminate different vegetation types in the tropical rainforests of the Western Ghats using maximum likelihood and random forest classification. We also compared the results of our classification with previous such maps of the study area. Finally, we evaluated the magnitude of habitat fragmentation by using derived landscape metrics. Our classification had high accuracy ( > 75%), especially compared to previous classification efforts. Our results emphasise the significance of using vegetation indices and textures for vegetation type classification in the Western Ghats. Furthermore, the results suggest that rainforest habitats and other agro-ecosystems, suitable as habitats for numerous plant and animal species, are highly fragmented and require top conservation priority. High spectral and spatial resolution, continuity, affordability and access makes Sentinel-2 one of the best options for regular monitoring of tropical rainforests.', '[Erinjery, Joseph J.; Kent, Rafi] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel.

Therefore, long-term records of the phenology of the vegetated land surface are critical in exploring the biological response to environmental change at regional to global scales. Land surface phenology (LSP) from satellite observations has been extensively used to monitor the dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems in the face of a changing climate. Here we introduce and describe the global land surface phonology (GLSP) product derived from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data at a gridded spatial resolution of 500 m. This new product will provide continuity for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GLSP product that has been produced on an operational basis since 2001. The VIIRS GLSP algorithm uses daily VIIRS Nadir BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) data as the primary input to calculate the two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) at each 500 m pixel. The temporal EVI2 trajectory is modeled using a hybrid piecewise logistic function to track the seasonal vegetation development, detect phenological transition dates, calculate the magnitude of vegetation greenness development, and characterize the confidence of phonology detections. The VIIRS GLSP algorithm has been implemented across the contiguous United States, and the resulting phenological metrics have been evaluated through comparisons with species-specific field phenological observations, Landsat phenology retrievals, and the MODIS phenology detections. The results demonstrate that the VIIRS GLSP metrics are of high quality and are in a good agreement with the other independent satellite and field observations. The results also indicate that the uncertainty in the VIIRS GLSP retrievals is primarily associated with missing high quality observations in VIIRS EVI2 time series.', '[Zhang, Xiaoyang; Liu, Lingling; Jayavelu, Senthilnath; Wang, Jianmin; Henebry, Geoffrey M.] South Dakota State Univ, Geospatial Sci Ctr Excellence, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.

Satellite images have proven their high potential for mapping crop areas at large scales, even at the crop-species level, when a classifier is calibrated on the same image with reference data corresponding to the same period. For operational monitoring purposes, however, it is critical to develop generalized classification methodologies applicable to large scales and different years. Generalized classifiers were presented in this study as follows: a) simple cross-year calibration and application (M1); b) multiyear calibrations (M2); and c) map updating through change detection with multiyear calibrations (M3). These three methods were developed in a classical frame of object-based classifications for a time series of Landsat images with the Random Forest machine learning algorithm. Therein, we tested these methods for sugarcane classification in Sao Paulo state, Brazil, as sugarcane is an economically important crop that has developed substantially in the past decades. Eight years of sugarcane reference maps were used to calibrate and validate the classifiers at four different sites. The cross-year application of M1 provided a low average accuracy Dice coefficient (DC) of 0.84, while it was, on average, 0.94 for the classical same-year calibration. When the classifier was trained on a multiyear dataset (M2), the accuracies achieved average values of 0.91 in independent years. The map updating method M3 showed promising results but was not able to reach the accuracy of visual interpretation methods for detecting annual sugarcane land use change. The multiyear classifier M2 was applied to four contrasting sites and provided reliable results for new sites and years for sugarcane classification. Calibration of the machine learning algorithm on a multiyear dataset of standardized and gap-filled satellite images and reference data proved to give an accurate and space-time generalized classifier, reducing the time, cost and resources for mapping sugarcane areas at large scales.', '[dos Santos Luciano, Ana Claudia; Junqueira Franco, Henrique Coutinho; Sanches, Guilherme Martineli; Lima Verde Leal, Manoel Regis; le Maire, Guerric] Brazilian Ctr Res Energy & Mat CNPEM, Brazilian Bioethanol Sci & Technol Lab CTBE, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil.

We investigate the ability of these freely available optical images to detect precursory motions before rapid landslides. A 9-month time-series of displacement is derived from Sentinel-2 data over a major landslide in the French Alps, which exhibited a sudden reactivation in June 2016. This analysis reveals a 7-month period of low activity (<= 1 m), followed by a sudden acceleration of 3.2 +/- 1.2 m in 3 days, before the failure of a mass of about 2 to 3.6 10(6) m(3). The location of this precursory motion is consistent with that of the slow motions occurring since 2001 (about 1 m/year), as revealed by aerial photographs and LiDAR analysis. This change in activity over a very short period of time (days) emphasizes the value of the frequent revisit time of Sentinel-2, despite its medium resolution of 10 m. We finally simulate the ability of Sentinel-2 for detecting these precursory patterns before a rapid landslide occurs, based on typical Voight\'s laws for creeping materials, characterized by a power law exponent a. Based on this analysis and on global cloud cover maps, we compute the probability to detect pre-failure motions of landslides using the Sentinel-2 constellation. This probability is highly heterogeneous at the global scale, affected by the revisit time of the satellite and the cloud cover. However the main factors controlling this detection ability are the properties of the landslide itself (its size and the alpha parameter), with almost 100% of detection probability for alpha = 1.3 and 0% for alpha = 1.8. Despite all these limitations, probability to detect a motion before a landslide failure often reaches 50% for classical landslide parameters. These results open new perspectives for the early warning of large landslide motion from global and open source remote sensing data.', '[Lacroix, Pascal; Bievre, Gregory; Pathier, Erwan; Jongmans, Denis] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, CNRS, IRD,IFSTTAR,ISTerre, F-38000 Grenoble, France.

Recently, it became apparent that when multi-temporal Sentinel-2A tile acquisitions are compared, they can be misregistered by more than one 10 m pixel. This study quantifies the multi-temporal misregistration by application of a recently published matching algorithm to all the available Sentinel-2A data sensed in six months (June 2nd to November 30th 2016) over 1400 x 3000 km of southern Africa. The Sentinel-2A L1C tile product processing software was updated by ESA on June 15th 2016. The results of our analysis show that the update reduced the mean multi-temporal Sentinel-2A tile misregistration from about 1.6 10 m pixels (standard deviation > 0.9 pixels) to 0.4 10 m pixels (standard deviation of about 0.2 pixels). Future updates to the ESA L1C tile product processing software are expected to further reduce this misregistration error. Meanwhile, users should exercise care when using multi-temporal Sentinel-2A data for applications that require precise sub-pixel registration. In solution, an orbit-based registration methodology that uses a least-squares adjustment applied to matches derived among Sentinel-2A tile acquisitions sensed in different orbits is described and demonstrated. For all the tile acquisitions in an orbit in a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) map projection zone, they are registered in the same manner, meaning that there are no relative shifts among the tile acquisitions from the same orbit in the registered data, and that the tile acquisitions that are obscured by cloud or that have a large amount of missing data can still be registered. Over 97% of the study data, including the data sensed before June 15th 2016, were registered. The mean tile registration precision was better than 0.15 10 m pixels (standard deviation 0.06 pixels) and is shown qualitatively to provide multi-temporal data with no visually obvious misregistration at 10 m resolution.', '[Yan, L.; Roy, D.

In the case of the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite mission, this capacity was hampered due to the contamination of SMOS data processing by strong land sea emissivity contrasts. Kolodziejczyk et al. (2016) (hereafter K2016) developed a methodology to mitigate SMOS systematic errors in the vicinity of continents, that greatly improved the quality of the SMOS Sea Surface Salinity (SSS). Here, we find that SSS variability, however, often remained underestimated, such as near major river mouths. We revise the K2016 methodology with: a) a less stringent filtering of measurements in regions with high SSS natural variability (inferred from SMOS measurements) and b) a correction for seasonally-varying latitudinal systematic errors. With this new mitigation, SMOS SSS becomes more consistent with the independent SMAP SSS close to land, for instance capturing consistent spatio-temporal variations of low salinity waters in the Bay of Bengal and Gulf of Mexico. The standard deviation of the differences between SMOS and SMAP weekly SSS is < 0.3 pss in most of the open ocean. The standard deviation of the differences between 18 day SMOS SSS and 100-km averaged ship SSS is 0.20 pss (0.24 pss before correction) in the open ocean. Even if this standard deviation of the differences increases closer to land, the larger SSS variability yields a more favorable signal-to-noise ratio, with r(2) between SMOS and SMAP SSS larger than 0.8. The correction also reduces systematic biases associated with man-made Radio Frequency Interferences (RFI), although SMOS SSS remains more impacted by RFI than SMAP SSS. This newly-processed dataset will allow the analysis of SSS variability over a larger than 8 years period in regions previously heavily influenced by land-sea contamination, such as the Bay of Bengal or the Gulf of Mexico.', '[Boutin, J.; Marchand, S.; D\'Amico, F.; Hasson, A.; Reverdin, G.; Vialard, J.] Sorbonne Univ, IRD, MNHN, LOCEAN, F-75005 Paris, France.

Rain gauge observations and satellite-derived precipitation data are two main sources of precipitation estimates. Gauge observations are accurate and reliable, but are heavily point-based and sparse in areas of rugged or complex terrains. Satellite-derived precipitation products can cover large areas, but they are generally characterized by inherent bias. To optimize the use of both datasets, we propose in this paper, a downscaling-integration framework to generate high quality monthly precipitation datasets at 1 km spatial resolution by merging rain gauge observations and TRMM 3B43 products. Firstly, an area-to-point kriging (ATPK) approach is used to downscale the original TRMM product to 1 km, so as to ensure a fair comparison with rain gauge data. Then, the downscaled TRMM precipitation datasets are integrated with the gauge observations using geographically weighted regression kriging (GWRK). The geographical factors (i.e. longitude, latitude and elevation) are also used as auxiliary variables in the GWRK model. Applying this approach to an experiment conducted at the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China from 2001 to 2014 shows that: (1) the downscaled monthly TRMM precipitation data by ATPK are more accurate than the original TRMM estimates; (2) the GWRK model employing the downscaled TRMM precipitation data and geographical factors provides better monthly precipitation estimates than the conventional ordinary kriging (OK) interpolation and the commonly used merging methods (i.e. geographical difference analysis, GDA and kriging with extemal drift, KED); (3) the GWRK method reduces the influence of the inaccuracy (bias) of satellite-derived precipitation data on the precipitation estimates compared to GDA. The approach presented in this study has provided an efficient alternative for solving the scale mismatch problem between point-based gauge data and low resolution satellite data, and producing improved precipitation data at high spatial resolution.', '[Chen, Yuanyuan; Huang, Jingfeng; Mansaray, Lamin R.] Zhejiang Univ, Inst Appl Remote Sensing & Informat Technol, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

This approach may be adequate to estimate an overall measure of systematic error; however, it cannot provide a good estimation of measurement precision. Knowing measurement precision is crucial for measuring elevation surface changes observed by DEM comparisons. In this paper, we illustrate an approach to characterize spatial variation in the precision for SFM-MVS derived DEMs. We use a snow-covered surface of an active rock glacier located in the southern French Alps as the case study. A spatially varying precision estimate is calculated from repeated close range aerial surveys for a single acquisition period by calculating the standard deviation per grid cell between the DEMs created for each flight repetition. Regression analysis using a generalized additive model (GAM) is performed to model the estimated precision and provide insights regarding how sensor, survey design and field site conditions may spatially influence the measurement precision. Additionally, we define how DEM error can be described differently depending on the available validation data. In our study image height above ground level and distance to ground control points had the greatest explanatory power for spatial variation in DEM precision. Image overlap, mean reprojection error and saturation were also useful for explaining spatially varying measurement precision of the DEMs. Field site characteristics, such as slope angle and shading, had the least importance in our model of precision. From a practical point of view, regression-modeled relationships between precision and image and site characteristics can be utilized to design future surveys with similar sensing platforms and site conditions for improved DEM precision.', '[Goetz, Jason; Brenning, Alexander] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Dept Geog, Loebdergraben 32, D-07743 Jena, Germany.

Developing such maps presents a unique challenge, as variability in relationships between spectral characteristics (i.e., predictors) and a response variable is likely to increase with the size of the region across which a model is built and applied. Although most mapping approaches apply the same predictor-response relationships globally across the entire modeling region, learned relationships from one local area may be invalid for another when predicting across broad extents. Here, we adapted a spatial ensemble approach borrowed from species distribution modeling to land cover mapping, and evaluated whether the approach could faithfully represent spatial variation in relationships between land cover and spectral data. The spatiotemporal exploratory model (STEM) uses an ensemble of regression trees defined within spatially overlapping support sets, producing a broad-extent map that reflects variability at the spatial scale of each constituent support set. As test cases for reference maps, we used 30-m-resolution forest canopy and impervious surface cover layers from the 2001 U.S. National Land Cover Database (NLCD) for the states of Washington, Oregon, and California. When testing strategies for support set size and sampling intensity, we found that predictor-response relationships were strongest when individual components of the spatial ensemble were small and when sampling intensity was high. Compared to aspatial bagged decision tree and random forest models, we found that the STEM approach successfully captured variation in our source maps, both globally and at scales smaller than the modeling region. Leveraging the spatial structure of a STEM, we also mapped per-pixel spatial variation in prediction confidence and the importance of different predictor variables. After testing appropriate spatial ensemble and sampling strategies, we extended the predictor-response relationships gleaned from the 2001 source maps into a yearly time series based on temporally-smoothed spectral data from the LandTrendr algorithm. The end products were yearly forest canopy and impervious surface cover time series representing 1990-2012. Formal evaluation showed that our temporally extended maps also closely resembled NLCD maps from 2011. The aim of this research was to cultivate the implicit relationships between spectral data and a given map, not improve them, but as the need for time series maps produced at both broad extents and fine resolutions increases, our results demonstrate that an ensemble of locally defined estimators is potentially more appropriate than conventional ensemble models for land cover mapping across broad extents.', '[Hooper, Sam; Kennedy, Robert E.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, 104 CEOAS Admin Bldg, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.', 'Oregon State UniversityRP Hooper, S (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, 104 CEOAS Admin Bldg, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.', 'hoopersa@oregonstate.edu', NULL, 'Landsat Science Team project (USGS) [G15AC00018]', 'This research was conducted with support from a Landsat Science Team   project awarded to Robert E.

As revealed by phenology analysis of Landsat satellite data, there are strong spatial patterns in the rate of green down across temperate deciduous forest landscapes, and analyzing these patterns could help advance our understanding of surface reflectance drivers. Within an oak-hickory (Quercus spp. - Carya spp.) forest landscape in western Maryland, USA, we tested how spatial patterns in greendown related to potential drivers at the landscape-, tree crown- and leaf-levels. We found that 50% of the spatial variability in greendown was explained by landscape variables, with greendown particularly higher in locations with higher maximum greenness, more southerly aspects, or locations with greater abundance of white oak (Quercus alba). The importance of species composition as a driver of greendown was supported at the tree crown level, where, relative to three other tree species, white oak exhibited the most consistent trend toward more vertical leaf angles later in the season. At the leaf level, NIR reflectance decreased in productive sites where %N increased, and delta C-13 decreased, through the season. However, among all sites, there were no consistent seasonal trends in foliar NIR reflectance, and we found no correlation among leaf-level NIR reflectance and satellite-observed greendown. Collectively, these results suggest that the spatial variability of greendown in this oak-hickory forest is most strongly controlled by an interaction of topographic and species compositional drivers operating at the landscape and tree crown levels. We found spatial analysis of greendown to be a useful approach to explore landscape-, tree crown-, and leaf-level controls on surface reflectance, and thereby help translate land surface phenology data into predictions of ecosystem structure and functioning.', '[Reaves, V.

However, forecast accuracy is usually limited by uncertainties in initial conditions such as the eruption rate and the vertical distribution of ash injected above the volcano. Here, we demonstrate the potential of the Telematics Earth Observation Mission (TOM) picosatellite formation, due for launch in 2020, to provide valuable information for constraining ash cloud dispersion models through simultaneous image acquisition from three satellites. TOM will carry commercial frame cameras. Using photogrammetric simulations, we show that such data should enable ash cloud heights to be determined with a precision (similar to 30-140 m depending on configuration) comparable to the vertical resolution of lidar observations (30-180 m depending on the cloud height). To support these estimates, we processed photographs taken from the International Space Station of the 2009 Sarychev Peak eruption, as a proxy for TOM imagery. Structure-from-motion photogrammetric software successfully reconstructed the 3-D form of the ascending ash cloud, as well as surrounding cloud layers. Direct estimates of the precision of the ash cloud height measurements, as well as comparisons between independently processed image sets, indicate that a vertical measurement precision of similar to 200 m was achieved. Image sets acquired at different times captured the plume dynamics and enabled a mean ascent velocity of 14 m s(-1) to be estimated for regions above 7 km. In contrast, the uppermost regions of the column (at a measured cloud top height of similar to 11 km) were not ascending significantly, enabling us to constrain a 1-D plume ascent model, from which estimates for the vent size (50 m) and eruption mass flux (2.6 x 10(6) kg s(-1)) could be made. Thus, we demonstrate that nanosatellite imagery has the potential for substantially reducing uncertainties in ash dispersion models by providing valuable information on eruptive conditions.', '[Zaksek, Klemen; Nogueira, Tiago; Schilling, Klaus] Ctr Telemat, Magdalene Schoch Str 5, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.

Recent several years have witnessed significant improvement in their classification methods, e.g. geographic object based image analysis (GEOBIA). However, these methods focus mainly on bottom-up classifications from visual features to semantic categories but they ignore top-down feedbacks which are capable of optimizing classification results. To resolve the issue, this study presents an iterative method which integrates bottom-up and top-down processes for land-cover and functional-zone classifications. First, hierarchical semantic cognition (HSC) is employed to make bottom-up classification for land covers and functional zones. The HSC is essentially a hierarchical Bayesian model which links visual features, land covers, spatial object patterns, and functional zones together with a hierarchical structure. Then, a top down feedback method, inverse hierarchical semantic cognition (IHSC), is proposed to optimize the initial classification results. Finally, the two processes are carried out iteratively to generate more and more accurate results. To verify the effectiveness of this method, we conducted it in Beijing, China. Experimental results indicate that the method produces accurate classification results of land covers and functional zones, and improves their accuracies by 9.9% and 6.5% respectively. Accordingly, our method combines bottom-up classification and top-down feedback and can significantly improve land-cover and functional-zone mapping results, thus can be regarded as a novel paradigm of urban mapping.', '[Zhang, Xiuyuan; Du, Shihong] Peking Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & GIS, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.

They can now retrieve the elevations of some rivers < 200 m wide. However, as these satellite missions are primarily designed to observe ocean surface topography, they are not always able to observe continental surfaces. For steep-sided rivers (i.e. in river valleys no more than a few km wide and surrounded by slopes over 50 m high), altimeters tend to observe the top of the surrounding topography rather than the river itself.   The Jason-3 altimetry mission, launched in January 2016, has an alternative instrument operation mode, the so called Open-Loop (OL) or Digital Elevation Model (DEM) tracking mode. This mode is intended to help overcome this issue, by using an on-board DEM. However it was not used in 2016 as the operational mode because of difficulties in defining an accurate on-board global-scale DEM. Mainland France has been chosen to test the OL tracking mode, as water masks and DEMs of sufficient accuracy are available.   Following the launch of Jason-3, Jason-2 (its predecessor) was maintained on the same nominal orbit as its follow-on, for more than 6 months. During this tandem period, data from the first 10 Jason-3 cycles (a Jason-2/-3 cycle corresponds to 10 days) were acquired in the traditional Closed-Loop (CL) tracking mode. Jason-3 data from the last 13 cycles were acquired in OL tracking mode. Jason-2 was always in CL tracking mode. Compared to nearby in situ gages and for river wider than 100 m, Jason-3 water elevation anomalies have a RMSE between 0.20 and 0.30 m for most reaches. Jason-3 performance over narrow rivers is similar to that of Jason-2. In CL tracking mode, Jason-3 altimeter tends to be locked over the surrounding topography more frequently than Jason-2 (due to the specific post-launch Jason-2 altimeter tuning). This study shows that Jason-2 observed 60% of river reaches studied (48 of 86 reaches), whereas Jason-3 in OL tracking mode was able to measure all river reaches for every cycle. This result clearly highlights the significant advantages of the OL tracking mode for observation of steep-sided rivers. However, further investigations are required to compute an accurate on-board global-scale DEM and to determine those locations where the use of OL tracking mode is or is not appropriate.', '[Biancamaria, Sylvain; Schaedele, Thomas; Blumstein, Denis; Frappart, Frederic; Blarel, Fabien; Nino, Fernando] Univ Toulouse, LEGOS, CNES, CNRS,IRD,UPS, 14 Ave Edouard Belin, F-31400 Toulouse, France.

In recent years, as an alternative to field plot data, the use of Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) acquisitions for calibration and validation purposes in combination with such satellite reflectance data to model a range of forest structural response variables has become well established. In this research, we use a predictive modeling approach to map forest structural attributes over the similar to 552 million ha boreal forest of Canada. For model calibration and independent validation we utilize airborne lidar-derived measurements of forest vertical structure (known as lidar plots) obtained in 2010 via a > 25,000 km transect-based national survey. Models were developed linking the lidar plot structural variables to wall-to-wall 30-m spatial resolution surface reflectance composites derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus imagery. Spectral indices extracted from the composites, disturbance information (years since disturbance and type), as well as geographic position and topographic variables (i.e., elevation, slope, radiation, etc.) were considered as predictor variables. A nearest neighbor imputation approach based on the Random Forest framework was used to predict a total of 10 forest structural attributes. The model was developed and validated on > 80,000 lidar plots, with R2 values ranging from 0.49 to 0.61 for key response variables such as canopy cover, stand height, basal area, stem volume, and aboveground biomass. Additionally, a predictor variable importance analysis confirmed that spectral indices, elevation, and geographic coordinates were key sources of information, ultimately offering an improved understanding of the driving variables for large-area forest structure modeling. This study demonstrates the integration of airborne lidar and Landsat-derived reflectance products to generate detailed and spatially extensive maps of forest structure. The methods are portable to map other attributes of interest (based upon calibration data) through access to Landsat or other appropriate optical remotely-sensed data sources, thereby offering unique opportunities for science, monitoring, and reporting programs.', '[Matasci, Giona; Hermosilla, Txomin; Coops, Nicholas C.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Resources Management, Integrated Remote Sensing Studio, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.

However, conventional time series InSAR methods such as persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) and small-baseline subset (SBAS) can rarely identify sufficient measurement points (MPs) in mountainous areas due to decorrelations caused by steep terrain and vegetation coverage. In this study, we developed a new InSAR approach, coherent scatterer InSAR (CSI), to map landslide surface displacements in the radar line-of-sight (LOS) direction by combining persistent scatterers (PS) and distributed scatterers (DS). The key ideas of CSI include the employment of the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test for the identification of statistically homogeneous pixels (SHPs) and the use of the phase linking algorithm to estimate optimal phase for each DS pixel. The joint exploitation of PS and DS targets dramatically increases the spatial density of MPs, which makes the phase unwrapping more reliable. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the CSI approach, we applied it to retrieve the historical displacements of the Jiaju landslide in Danba County of southwest China using 19 L-band ALOS PALSAR images (2006-2011) and nine C-band ENVISAT ASAR images (2007-2008). Multiple comparisons clearly illustrated the big advantages of CSI over PSI and SBAS in mapping landslide displacements with more details owing to much higher ( > 10 times) MP density. Furthermore, the superiority of L-band SAR data over C-band for landslide investigation in rural environments was confirmed. Quantitative validation of the CSI results for PALSAR data against in-situ GPS measurements suggested an accuracy of about 10.5 millimeters per year (mm/year) in terms of root mean square error (RMSE). Afterwards, the spatial-temporal characteristics of the Jiaju landslide surface displacements were summarized, with a new upper boundary for the active northern part delineated. Particularly, the northern part of the landslide moved faster than the southern part, exhibiting a maximum LOS displacement rate of around 120 mm/year. Subsequently, the fluvial erosion by the Dajinchuan River was identified as the predominant impact factor for the instability of the Jiaju landslide. Finally, the major problems and challenges for the application of CSI method were discussed, and the conclusions were given.', '[Dong, Jie; Zhang, Lu; Liao, Mingsheng; Gong, Jianya; Ao, Meng] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.

This has the potential to improve near real-time deforestation monitoring in dry tropical regions, where traditional optical only monitoring systems typically suffer from limited data availability due to persistent cloud cover. In this context, the recently launched Sentinel-1 satellites promise unprecedented potential, because for the first time dense and regular SAR observations are free and openly available. We demonstrate multi-sensor near real-time deforestation detection in tropical dry forests, through the combination of Sentinel-1 C-band SAR time series with ALSO-2 PALSAR-2 L-band SAR, and Landsat-7/ETM + and 8/OLI. We used spatial normalisation to reduce the dry forest seasonality in the optical and SAR time series, and combined them within a probabilistic approach to detect deforestation in near real-time. Our results for a dry tropical forest site in Bolivia, showed that, as a result of high observation availability of Sentinel-1, deforestation events were detected more timely with Sentinel-1 than compared to Landsat and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2. The spatial and temporal accuracies of the multi-sensor approach were higher than the single-sensor results. We improved the precision of the reference data derived from the multi-sensor satellite time series, which enabled a more robust estimation of the temporal accuracy. We quantified how the near real-time deforestation detection is associated with a trade-off between the confidence in detection and the temporal accuracy. We showed that the trade-off affects the choice on how to use the near-real time data for different applications such as fast alerting with high temporal accuracy but lower confidence versus accurate detection at lower temporal detail. When aiming for a high confidence in change area estimates for example, deforestation was detected with a user\'s accuracy of 88%, a producer\'s accuracy of 89% (low area bias), and a mean time lag of 31 days using all sensors. This is on average 7 days earlier than when using only Sentinel-1 observations, and six weeks earlier than when relying only on Landsat observations. We showed that confident near real-time deforestation alerts can be provided with a mean time lag of 22 days, but these are associated with a higher commission error.

This will be accomplished through a multi-sensor approach by placing it in a common orbit in tandem with the Sentinel-3 (S3) mission, which will have two optical sensors on board, OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) and SLSTR (Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer) to complement FLEX. These S3 instruments will be used in combination with the imaging spectrometers on board FLEX to provide data useful for atmospheric correction of FLEX data. However, a fully synergetic approach, i.e. by exploiting the spectral and directional information from all tandem mission instruments together, is an attractive alternative which is explored in this paper. By employing all combined top of-atmosphere (TOA) spectral radiance data, one can (i) characterize the relevant optical properties of the atmosphere, (ii) retrieve biophysical canopy properties including the associated reflectance anisotropy, and (iii) retrieve a more accurate and consistent canopy F.   Regarding retrieval methods, Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) and Spectral Fitting (SF) are well-known techniques applied to hyperspectral data. Both methods depend on a high spectral resolution and assume a Lambertian (isotropic) canopy reflectance. However, most vegetation canopies are non-Lambertian. This implies that, in particular when ignoring the anisotropic surface reflection, substantial retrieval errors can occur due to the interaction between atmospheric absorption bands and surface reflectance anisotropy. In this paper, a novel method based on spectral radiative transfer (RT) modeling is proposed, in which coupled RT models are used to simulate TOA radiance spectra. These are then matched with `measured\' spectra in order to retrieve surface fluorescence, along with a suite of biophysical parameters, by model inversion through optimization. By applying coupled RT models of the soil-leaf-canopy and the surface-atmosphere systems, TOA radiance spectra can be simulated for all optical sensors of this tandem mission. In this way, complex effects due to surface reflectance anisotropy and the spectral sampling by the various instruments, which are difficult to compensate for in the end products, are properly taken into account by their incorporation in the forward modeling. Next, by model inversion of TOA radiance data via optimization, the most accurate F retrievals can be achieved in a consistent manner, along with important canopy level biophysical parameters that may help interpret the F spectrum, such as chlorophyll content and leaf area index (LAI). The potential of this approach has been explored in a numerical experiment, and the results are presented in this paper. We find that, with the assumed well-characterized and plausible FLEX/S3 instrument performances, the simultaneous retrieval of biophysical canopy parameters and F spectra would be possible with a remarkable accuracy, provided the correct atmospheric characterization is available.', '[Verhoef, Wouter; van der Tol, Christiaan] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, Hengelosestr 99,POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.

The Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) and Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) sensors have very different spatial and temporal resolutions (Sentinel-2 MSI sensor 10 m, 20 m and 60 m, 10 days, albeit 5 days with 2 sensors, conditional upon clear skies; Sentinel-3 OLCI sensor 300 m, < 1.4 days with 2 sensors). For local monitoring (e.g., the growing cycle of plants) one either has the desired spatial or temporal resolution, but not both. In this paper, spatio-temporal fusion is considered to fuse Sentinel-2 with Sentinel-3 images to create nearly daily Sentinel-2 images. A challenging issue in spatio-temporal fusion is that there can be very few cloud-free fine spatial resolution images temporally close to the prediction time, or even available, strong temporal (i.e., seasonal) changes may exist. To this end, a three-step method consisting of regression model fitting (RM fitting), spatial filtering (SF) and residual compensation (RC) is proposed, which is abbreviated as Fit-FC. The Fit-FC method can be performed using only one Sentinel-3 Sentinel-2 pair and is advantageous for cases involving strong temporal changes (i.e., mathematically, the correlation between the two Sentinel-3 images is small). The effectiveness of the method was validated using two datasets.

To mitigate wide-spread land degradation, actions have been taken to maintain and restore ecologically valuable landscapes such as natural forests. However, the effects of the various vegetation protection policies that have been implemented in China since the late 1990\'s still remain largely unknown. In this paper, we therefore focus on mapping land use and land cover change (LULCC) in Inner Mongolia, one of the key regions targeted by Chinese ecological restoration programs. We used 250-m MODIS time series and a random forest classification approach to generate annual probabilities for each land cover class between 2000 and 2014. We then applied a trajectory-based change detection approach based on a modified version of the Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery (LandTrendr) algorithm to the probability time series and mapped land cover change trajectories. We found that our trajectory-based approach achieved high accuracies (overall accuracy 0.95 +/- 0.02). It provides spatial-temporal land change maps that allow a land-use related interpretation of change patterns. Our change maps show that i) forest loss decreased rapidly after 2000 (from 15,717 1770 ha in 2001 to 1313 165 ha in 2014) and forth gain (190,645 28,352 ha during 2001-2014) occurred in the ecological program zones, leading to a net forest increase in Inner Mongolia, and ii) cropland retirement (212,979 54,939 ha during 2001-2014) mostly occurred at the early stage of ecological programs and mainly concentrated in drier environments and steep terrain. Overall, land cover mapping and trajectory-based land use analyses allowed a consistent characterization of LULCC over large areas, which is crucial for gaining a better understanding of environmental changes in the light of rapidly changing environmental policies and governance regimes in China.', '[Yin, He; Pflugmacher, Dirk; Hostert, Patrick] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.

This has implications for the interpretation of remote sensing data. We developed a model for light interaction and energy balance in vegetation canopies in which leaf biophysical and biochemical properties vary in the vertical. The model mSCOPE is an extension of the Soil-Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model, which simulates spectral and bidirectional reflectance, fluorescence, and photosynthesis of vertically heterogeneous vegetation canopies. The modelling of radiative transfer in mSCOPE is based on the classical SAIL theory. A solution to the radiative transfer equation for multi-layer canopies is given, which allows calculating top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance and the flux profile. The latter is used for the simulation of fluorescence emission and photosynthesis of every leaf through the leaf radiative transfer model Fluspect and a biochemical model. The radiative transfer of fluorescence in multi-layer canopies is solved numerically in mSCOPE to obtain TOC bidirectional fluorescence. The significant effect of vertical heterogeneity of leaf properties on TOC reflectance, fluorescence and photosynthesis is demonstrated by different scenarios with customized vertical profiles of leaf chlorophyll content and leaf water content, and also with measured vertical profiles of leaf chlorophyll content in corn canopies. A preliminary validation of the reflectance calculating routine of mSCOPE is conducted by comparing measured and simulated TOC reflectance spectra of the corn canopies. We conclude that it is important to consider the vertical heterogeneity of leaf properties for the prediction of reflectance, fluorescence and photosynthesis.

However, real-time versions of satellite-based rainfall products are known to contain errors. Recent studies have demonstrated how the information about rainfall intrinsically contained in soil moisture data can be utilised for improving rainfall estimates. That is, soil moisture dynamics are impacted for several days by the accumulated amount of rainfall following within a particular event. In this context, soil moisture data from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite is used in this study to correct rainfall accumulation estimates provided by satellite-based real-time precipitation products such as CMORPH, TRMM-3B42RT or PERSIANN. An algorithm based on the SMOS measurements data assimilation is tested in two land-surface models of different complexity: a simple hydrological model (Antecedent Precipitation Index (API)) and a more sophisticated state-of-the-art land-surface model (SURFEX (Surface Extemalisee)). We show how the assimilation technique, based on a particle filter method, generally leads to a significant improvement in rainfall estimates, with slightly better results for the simpler (and less computationally demanding) API model. This methodology has been evaluated for six years at ten sites around the world with different land use and climatological features.

Robust allometric equations can improve biomass estimates; however, destructive sampling to measure single-tree biomass is expensive, challenging, and prone to measurement error. We present a method to efficiently and non-destructively estimate single-tree biomass from terrestrial LiDAR scan data and test the approach on 21 destructively-sampled lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) trees. The approach estimates branch and foliage volume using voxelization and estimates trunk volume using a method developed in this study called the Outer Hull Model (OHM). The OHM iteratively fits convex hulls, accurately handles noisy scan data, and fits the true shape of the trunk rather than forcing a cylindrical fit. Volume from the LiDAR scans is converted to biomass using density values from the literature and from field sampling to assess model sensitivity to density values. Whole-tree aboveground biomass estimates derived from the LiDAR scans were nearly unbiased and agreed strongly with destructive sampling data (R-2 = 0.98, RMSE = 20.4 kg). Estimation of the trunk component biomass (R-2 = 0.99, RMSE = 12.3 kg) was stronger than foliage and needle component estimates (R-2 = 0.54, RMSE = 21.4 kg). The approach presented in this study accurately and non-destructively estimated the aboveground biomass of needleleaf trees with minimal user input.

Fungi are a megadiverse taxonomic group where lack of knowledge impedes sufficient conservation focus. Inventories of fungi require a high level of expertise and are difficult and expensive due to seasonal variation and fluctuation in sporocarp formation. Lidar offers objective, fine-resolution and potentially cheap and broad scale data for representing vegetation structure and has proven useful for prediction of the diversity of plant and animal species. In this study, we used lidar-derived variables as explanatory variables in models of fungal species richness and controlling gradients of species composition, represented by three ordination axes derived from multidimensional scaling. The fungal data comprised a data set of 1527 species recorded in three inventories of 121 sites covering all major terrestrial habitat types across Denmark. We compared the performance of lidar-derived explanatory variables with two field inventory-based sets of variables: 1) lists of vascular plants and 2) recordings of soil, microclimate and vegetation structure. Lidar-derived variables performed best in predicting fungal richness and the first ordination axis, interpreted as a gradient from low and open herb-dominated communities over Closed swards and scrubs to closed-canopy forests (cross validated r(2) of 0.50 and 0.81, respectively). The number of red-listed species and the second ordination axis were poorly predicted by lidar, and the third ordination axis was equally well detected by the three explanatory sets of variables (cross validated r(2) of 0.38). From a fungal conservation perspective, it is promising that lidar-based variables hold information suitable for detecting major gradients in fungal richness and composition.', '[Thers, Henrik; Bocher, Peder Klith; Svenning, Jens-Christian] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Sect Ecoinformat & Biodivers, Ny Munkegade 116, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.

However, few studies have investigated the trait-environment relationships that underpin diverse animal relationships with vegetation structure. We used terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and acoustic bat surveys to investigate relationships between forest structure and bat communities across a vegetation structural gradient at community, species and trait levels. We developed 20 measures of site scale vegetation structure and also quantified landscape scale vegetation cover and water availability. We predicted that overall bat activity would increase in open and decrease in cluttered vegetation, but this would vary with species, underpinned by ecomorphological traits. Overall bat activity was negatively associated with stem density, with total activity halving (from 380 to 190 calls night(-1)) as stem densities increased from 60 to 1350 stems ha(-1), while foraging activity declined from 8 to <1 feeding buzzes night(-1) over the same range. Bat activity varied among species and structures and foraging strategy explained more of this variability than call, body size or wing traits. As predicted, above canopy and edge-space foraging bats were negatively associated with local-scale clutter, while closed-space species were positively associated with cluttered stands. Stem density was the strongest predictor of bat-environment relationships, although there was evidence for differences in bat habitat use across different structural elements. Our study is the first to link detailed LiDAR-derived 3D forest structural metrics to multiple animal traits.

However, few studies have used the AQI data to calibrate satellite-based estimates of fine particulate matter (PM2.5, particles no greater than 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter) concentrations, partly because the AQI-derived PM2.5 is not continuously obtained each day. Taking Beijing as an example, we developed a geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model that can account for spatial and temporal variability in the relationship between the non-continuous AQI-derived PM2.5 and satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD). The GTWR model, which uses AOD values with a 3-km spatial resolution obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), meteorological fields, and land-use variables as predictors, was fitted seasonally from April 2013 to March 2015. After being cross-validated against ground observations, the coefficient of determination (R-2) of PM2.5 ranged from 0.36 to 0.75, with a mean value of 0.58. The GTWR model outperforms several conventional models, such as the multiple linear regression (MLR) model, geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, temporally weighted regression (TWR) model, and linear mixed-effects (LME) model. Compared to a previous spatiotemporal model, the two-stage (LME + GWR) model, the GTWR model may be more feasible. When the number of daily records is >= 5, there is no obvious difference in prediction accuracy (cross-validated R-2 both valued at 0.68). However, when the number of daily records is <5, the GTWR model performs much better (cross-validated R-2 of 0.45 and 0.08). Our estimates indicate that the gridded annual mean PM2.5 values range from 62 to 110 mu g/m(3), denoting strong spatial variation. We find that when available, continuous daily PM2.5 observations can significantly improve model performance and therefore facilitate the estimation of surface PM2.5 concentrations at urban scales. The GTWR model may serve as a reference for studying regions where continuous air pollution data are limited. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Recently many studies have presented interesting results at regional, continental and global scale with 14.25 m to 25 km spatial and 10 day to one year temporal resolution. However, surface inland water bodies can feature temporally rapid spatial changes caused by extreme events, seasonal variability as well as human activity. Such changes can occur on temporal scales which are below the currently existing dynamic water body products. While the daily temporal resolution of available sensors has not been exploited yet. In this study we present an approach which uses the full temporal resolution of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to generate a 250 m daily global dataset of inland water bodies based on spectral information and dynamic thresholding. Based on a combination of MODIS Terra and Aqua daily classifications, auxiliary mask layers and temporal interpolation, a global cloud and gap free time series of inland water bodies is produced. The presented results are validated with 321 Landsat images across the globe. The executed validation shows an overall accuracy of 96.3% with 7.8% omission and 0.5% commission error, and a kappa coefficient of 933% for pure water pixels. The presented results demonstrate the high potential for different applications requiring information of inland water body dynamics at high temporal resolution. Examples demonstrate that e.g. the filling and emptying of water reservoirs, changes and inundation cycles of natural water bodies as well as freezing and thawing of lakes can be analyzed at a highly detailed temporal scale.

The use of a simulation crop model allowed obtaining indicators of crop water stress indices: (1) soil water deficit, (2) crop water use vs. reference crop evapotranspiration, and (3) fraction of the available water capacity that is readily available.   The NDVI/LST spaces presented a trapezoidal form, which indicated that TVDI will have similar sensitivity for the full range of NDVI and showed temporal changes of wet and dry edges.   When soybean cover exceeds 60%, the combination of TVDI with (2) and (3) can enhance the ability of detecting crop water stress conditions (R-2 = 0.62 and 0.82, respectively). However, the relationship between TVDI and (1) showed low correlation values (R-2 = 0.21). (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Previous large-domain studies estimated the variances of their biomass density estimates as the sum of the GLAS sampling variability plus the model variability associated with the models that predict airborne lidar estimates of biomass density (Y) as a function of satellite lidar measurements (X). This approach ignores the additional variability associated with the predictive models used to estimate ground biomass density as a function of airborne lidar measurements. This paper addresses that shortcoming. Analytic variance expressions are provided that include sampling variability and model variability in situations where multiple models are employed to generate estimates of biomass. As an example, the forest biomass of the continental US is estimated, by forest stratum within state, using a space lidar system (ICESat/GLAS). An airborne laser system (ALS) is used as an intermediary to tie the GLAS measurements of forest height to a small subset of US Forest Service (USFS) ground plots by flying the ALS over the ground plots and, independently, over individual GLAS footprints. Two sets of models are employed to relate satellite measurements to the ground plots. The first set of equations relates USFS ground plot estimates of total aboveground dry biomass density (Y-1) to spatially coincident ALS forest canopy measurements (X-1). The second set of models predicts those ALS canopy height measurements (X-1) used in the first set of models to GLAS waveform measurements (X2). The following important conclusions are noted. (1) The variability associated with estimation of the plot-ALS model coefficients is significant and should be included in the overall estimate of biomass density variance. In the continental US, the total variance of mean forest biomass density (98.06 t/ha) increases by a factor of 3.6x, i.e., from 1.91 to 6.94 t(2)/ha(2), when plot-ALS model variance is included in the calculation of total variance. (2) State-level results are more variable, but on average, the percent model variance at the state level, i.e., (model variance / total variance) * 100, increases from 16% to 59% when plot-ALS model variance is included. (3) The overall model variance is driven in large part by the number of plots overflown by the ALS and the number of GLAS pulses overflown by the ALS. Given a choice of improving precision by either increasing the number of plot-ALS observations or increasing ALS-GLAS observations, there is no obvious benefit to selecting one over the other. However, typically the number of ground plots overflown is the limiting factor. (4) If heteroskedasticity is evident in either the ground-air or air-satellite models, it can modeled using weighted regression techniques and incorporated into these model variance formulas in straightforward fashion. The results are unambiguous; in a hybrid three-phase sampling framework, both the ground-air and air-satellite model variance components are significant and should be taken into account.

Here, we present a generic multi-resolution approach to sample-based crop type area estimation at the national level using soybean as an example crop type. Historical MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data were used to stratify growing regions into subsets of low, medium and high soybean cover. A stratified random sample of 20 km x 20 km sample blocks was selected and Landsat data for these sample blocics classified into soybean cover. The Landsat-derived soybean area was used to produce national estimates of soybean area. Current year MODIS-indicated soybean cover served as an auxiliary variable in a stratified regression estimator procedure. To evaluate the approach, we prototyped the method in the USA, where the 2013 USDA Cropland Data Layer (CDL) was used as a reference training data set for mapping soybean cover within each sample block. Three individual Landsat images were sufficient to accurately map soybean cover for all blocics, revealing that a rather sparse sample of phenological variation is needed to separate soybean from other cover types. In addition to stacks of images, we also evaluated standard radiometrically normalized Landsat inputs for mapping blocks individually (local-scale) and all at once (national-scale). All tested inputs resulted in area estimates comparable to the official USDA estimate of 30.86 Mha, with lower accuracy and higher standard error for national-scale mapping implementations. The stratified regression estimator incorporating current year MODIS-indicated soy reduced the standard error of the estimated soybean area by over 25% relative to the standard error of the stratified estimator. Finally, the method was ported to Argentina. A stratified random sample of blocks was characterized for soybean cultivated area using stacks of individual Landsat images for the 2013-2014 southern hemisphere growing season. A sub sample of these blocks was visited on the ground to assess the accuracy of the Landsat-derived soy classification. The stratified regression estimator procedure performed similarly to the US application as it resulted in a reduction in standard error of about 25% relative to the stratified estimator not incorporating current year MODIS-indicated soybean. Our final estimated soybean area was 28% lower than that reported by the USDA, corresponding to a 20% field-based omission error related to underdeveloped fields. Lessons learned from this study can be ported to other regions of comparable field size and management intensity to assess soybean cultivated area.

In this article, we present a new version of the widely-used PROSPECT model, hereafter named PROSPECT-D for dynamic, which adds anthocyanins to chlorophylls and carotenoids, the two plant pigments in the current version. We describe the evolution and improvements of PROSPECT-D compared to the previous versions, and perform a validation on various experimental datasets. Our results show that PROSPECT-D outperforms all the previous versions. Model prediction uncertainty is decreased and photosynthetic pigments are better retrieved. This is particularly the case for leaf carotenoids, the estimation of which is particularly challenging. PROSPECT-D is also able to simulate realistic leaf optical properties with minimal error in the visible domain, and similar performances to other versions in the near infrared and shortwave infrared domains.

However, the interpretation of SIF over different spatial resolutions is critical to bridge the existing gap between local and global scales. This study provides insight into the influence of scene components, and forest structure and composition on the quantification of the red and far-red fluorescence signal as an early indicator of forest decline. The experiments were conducted over an oak forest (Quercus ilex) affected by water stress and Phytophthora infection in the southwest of Spain. SIF retrievals through the Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) principle with three spectral bands F (FLD3) was assessed using high resolution (60 cm) hyperspectral imagery extracting sunlit crown, full crown and aggregated pixels. Results showed the link between F (FLD3) extracted from sunlit crown pixels and the tree physiological condition in this context of disease infection, yielding significant relationships (r(2) = 0.57, p < 0.01) for midday xylem water potential NO, (r(2) = 0.63, p < 0.001) for the de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle (DEPS), and (r(2) = 0.74, p < 0.001) for leaf-level measurements of steady-state fluorescence yield (F-s). In contrast, a poor relationship was obtained when using aggregated pixels at 30 m spatial resolution, where the relationship between the image-based F (FLD3) and F-s yielded a non-significant relationship (r(2) = 025, p > 0.05). These results demonstrate the need for methods to accurately retrieve crown SIF from aggregated pixels in heterogeneous forest canopies with large physiological variability among individual trees. This aspect is critical where structural canopy variations and the direct influence of background and shadows affect the SIF amplitude masking the natural variations caused by physiological condition. FluorFLIGHT, a modified version of the three dimensional (3-D) radiative transfer model FLIGHT was developed for this work, enabling the simulation of canopy radiance and reflectance including fluorescence at different spatial resolutions, such as may be derived from proposed satellite missions such as FLEX, and accounting for canopy structure and varying percentage cover. The 3-D modelling approach proposed here significantly improved the relationship between F-s and F (FLD3) extracted from aggregated pixels (r2 = 0.70, p < 0.001), performing better than when aggregation effects were not considered (r2 = 0.42, p < 0.01). The FluorFLIGHT model used in this study improved the retrieval of SIF from aggregated pixels as a function of fractional cover, Leaf Area Index and chlorophyll content yielding significant relationships between F-s ground-data measurements and fluorescence quantum yield estimated with FluorFLIGHT at p < 0.01 (r(2) = 0.79). The methodology presented here using FluorFLIGHT also demonstrated its capabilities for mapping SIF at the tree level for single tree assessment of forest physiological condition in the context of early disease detection.

The advantages of the high temporal-spatial resolution and the wide field of view make the GF-1 WFV imagery very popular. However, cloud cover is an inevitable problem in GF-1 WFV imagery, which influences its precise application. Accurate cloud and cloud shadow detection in GF-1 WFV imagery is quite difficult due to the fact that there are only three visible bands and one near-infrared band. In this paper, an automatic multi-feature combined (MFC) method is proposed for cloud and cloud shadow detection in GF-1 WFV imagery. The MFC algorithm first implements threshold segmentation based on the spectral features and mask refinement based on guided filtering to generate a preliminary cloud mask. The geometric features are then used in combination with the texture features to improve the cloud detection results and produce the final cloud mask. Finally, the cloud shadow mask can be acquired by means of the cloud and shadow matching and follow-up correction process. The method was validated using 108 globally distributed scenes. The results indicate that MFC performs well under most conditions, and the average overall accuracy of MFC cloud detection is as high as 96.8%. In the contrastive analysis with the official provided cloud fractions, MFC shows a significant improvement in cloud fraction estimation, and achieves a high accuracy for the cloud and cloud shadow detection in the GF-1 WFV imagery with fewer spectral bands. The proposed method could be used as a preprocessing step in the future to monitor land-cover change, and it could also be easily extended to other optical satellite imagery which has a similar spectral setting.

In this study, we assess the potential of ICESat laser altimetry for providing snow depths for its operational period 2003-2009 on the example of the Scandinavian Mountains in southern Norway. Snow cover during ICESat campaigns typically results in positive elevation differences (dh) between ICESat GLAH14 elevations and reference elevations from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). Three DEMs are used: the Norwegian national DEM for the entire study area, and the SRTM DEM and a high-resolution airborne lidar DEM for a spatial subset on the Hardangervidda mountain plateau. To account for uncertainty in elevation data, ICESat samples are grouped into spatial subsets, elevation bands, and over time (e.g. all winter campaigns together). We find that ICESat has the potential to provide regional-scale snow depths for the years 2003-2009 for its winter (March) and late spring (June) campaigns. ICESat-derived snow depth time series for different elevation bands agree well with measured (RMSE 0.47 m) and modelled (RMSE 0.61 m) snow depths in the study area. Annual differences in snow amounts and the increase of snow depths with elevation and coastal proximity over the study area are correctly reproduced. Uncertainties in reference elevations exceed ICESat elevation uncertainty and good control over errors and biases in reference DEMs turn out essential. Spatially varying vertical offsets between ICESat and the reference DEMs make it necessary to bias-correct March/June snow depths with autumn dh per spatial unit or elevation band. Best results are achieved when samples are summarised per season over the entire observation period. After correction of local DEM biases, the spatial pattern of ICE Sat 2003-2009 March dh matches spatially distributed modelled snow depths in southern Norway with decimeter-scale accuracy. In the western part of Hardangervidda, ICESat-based March snow depths agree better with measurements (RMSE <= 0.15 m for all DEMs) than modelled snow depths do (RMSE 0.61 m). In eastern Hardangervidda, the coarse resolution SRTM DEM (RMSE 0.41 m) performs better than the 10 m Norwegian DEM (RMSE 0.64 m) which is based on a less consistent mosaic of elevation data. Using the high resolution lidar DEM, even single footprints show good agreement (R-2 0.59, RMSE 0.94 m) with measured snow depths from the same year. Snow depth estimates could be further improved by using full waveform ICESat data or elevation measurements from ICESat-2 once this satellite is operational. Good quality reference DEMs may still be acquired in the future even in areas where no such data exists today. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

PRI was originally designed as a means of assessing the xanthophyll cycle and LUE over short (e.g. diurnal) time frames, and few studies have explored the drivers of PRI over longer, seasonal time frames, particularly in crops having different photosynthetic pathways or canopy structures. Consequently, our purpose was to understand and quantify the drivers of PRI responses over seasonal time scales for two crops, maize (C-4) and soybean (C-3), contrasting in photosynthetic pathway, leaf structure and canopy architecture. In both crops, PRI was very closely related to green LAl (R-2 > 0.90) and stand chlorophyll (Chl) content (R-2 > 0.93). The slopes of the relationships in different phenological stages, vegetative and reproductive, were substantially different (3-fold smaller in the vegetative stage). The main cause of this disparity was the high PRI value of soil/residue background. While PRI was a sensitive indicator of the changes in stand green LAl and stand Chl content over the full growing season, it was not sensitive to LUE; LUE explained below 12% of PRI variation in maize and 19% in soybean. Unlike leaf-level PRI, stand-level PRI was not clearly related to the Car/Chl ratio, presumably because the large changes in canopy structure (affecting stand Chl and green LAI) had a dominant influence on PRI over this time frame. The strong relationship between PRI and stand Chl content as well as between PRI and Chl-related vegetation index over a growing cycle allowed us to subtract the stand Chl content effect from measured PRI to reveal the component of PRI most likely related to periods of stress. However, for accurate subtraction of the Chl effect from long-term PRI records, thoughtful study of uncertainties related to \"natural\" variation of PRI-stand Chl relationships, and stand Chl content estimation for different varieties of the same species and for different species is required. The findings of a strong link between stand-level PRI and stand green LAI and Chl content and the lack of a clear relationship between PRI and LUE over seasonal and ontogenetic time spans suggest the need for a more careful evaluation of the relationship between PRI and either LUE or photosynthetic activity. In particular, studies that contrast short-term (e.g. diurnal) vs. long-term (e.g. seasonal) pigment, PRI, and photosynthetic responses in contrasting vegetation types are needed to clarify the different mechanisms involved at different temporal and spatial scales. These findings have important implications for attempts to monitor photosynthetic phenology from remote sensing, many of which have relied on PRI as an indicator of photosynthetic activity.

Of particular relevance, negative anomalies of snow and sea ice cover, glacier retreat, and the extended melt of Greenland combined with increasing temperature at double the rate of the rest of the planet have been observed in the Arctic. Several studies have suggested that another response to the current arctic warming could be an increase in rain-on-snow (ROS) events followed by subsequent freezing and the creation of ice layers. We use recently developed detection algorithms of ROS and ice events using passive microwave retrieval approaches to examine the spatial and temporal trends in rain-on-snow and ice layer creation for 18 islands across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) over the last two decades. Results show that both icing and ROS event occurrence tripled between the periods of 1979-1995 and 1996-2011, with very active years in winters 1993-1994,1998-1999 and 2002-2003. The areas with the most combined occurrences are the Boothia Peninsula and Axel Heiberg, Cornwallis, Banks and Victoria Islands. We then compare the rain-on-snow and icing events to Peary caribou estimates to test whether the algorithms can detect weather events associated with population declines. There has been an important reduction in population numbers of Peary caribou, the northernmost caribou population in Canada, over the last three generations. The major hypothesis for the decline is that severe weather events lead to more difficult winter grazing conditions. The comparison with the Peary caribou population estimates suggest that caribou numbers decrease with increased occurrence of ROS and icing events, where 3-4 ROS events and 12 icing events in one winter season are sufficient to have a negative impact on Peary caribou.

In order to estimate ET in heterogeneous agricultural areas, we inspect in this paper the use of disaggregation techniques applied to two different sensors, such as MODIS (daily revisit cycle and 1 km spatial resolution in the TIR domain) and Spot 5 (5 days revisit cycle and 10 m spatial resolution in the VNIR bands but no TIR band). Spot 5 images were used as a proxy for upcoming Sentinel-2. The Simplified Two-Source Energy Balance (STSEB) model was used for the estimation of ET. Since no Sentinel-2 images were available yet, images from the Spot 5 Take 5 experiment were used for testing this approach. Results assessment was conducted at two different levels: field scale (using ground data), and scene scale (using Landsat 7-ETM+ images as a reference). Validation of both disaggregated land surface temperature (LST) and derived surface energy fluxes was performed. Mean absolute deviations of similar to 2 degrees C in disaggregated LST were observed at both field and scene scales. At field scale, relative errors of 22% and 19% were obtained for ET at instantaneous and daily scales, respectively. At scene scale, the four components of the surface energy balance equation were obtained with relative errors of 3, 14, 11 and 8% for net radiation, evapotranspiration, sensible heat flux and soil heat flux, respectively, compared to Landsat. The results obtained were compared to the use of the MODIS LST at its original resolution (1 km), which was used also to obtain the surface energy fluxes. As the surface heterogeneity increases the errors in both MODIS LSI and ET become more and more significant, compared to the use of the disaggregated images. Although reference images at 10 m spatial resolution were not available at this stage for a more robust comparison, this paper shows the potential of the use of disaggregated 1ST to estimate ET at 10 m spatial resolution, which is especially attractive in highly heterogeneous areas.

In general all these conditions yield negative deviations in the time series of NDVI. Many time series reconstruction models have been developed to eliminate effect of the negative deviations and most of them perform differently in different applications and regions. The Harmonic Analysis (HA), Double logistic (DL), Asymmetric Gaussian (AG), Whittaker smoother (WS) and Savitzky-Golay filter (SG) are five of the most widely used time series reconstruction models owing to their simplicity of implementation or the capability to extract phenological metrics from the time series. The performance of these models varies with the NDVI signal and the noise distribution, however, and until now there is no consensus on which method outperforms all others under all situations. Since the NDVI signal and the noise distribution are highly dependent on regional climate and land cover, the reconstruction performance is expected to be spatially variable. Thus this study compared the five reconstruction models at pixel scale to provide practical and biome- specific recommendations for future time series reconstruction applications. Specifically, the 14 years raw daily reflectance data and ancillary Quality Assessment (QA) information from the MODIS sensor were used to generate pixel reference series and noisy series. Then the five candidate models were applied to both reference series and noisy series and three reconstruction performance metrics i.e. Overall Reconstruction Error (ORE), Fitting Related Error (FRE), and Normalized Noise Related Error (NNRE), were calculated. Finally, the performance of the five candidate reconstruction models was evaluated by applying the three metrics. The preliminary results showed that when considering ORE only, the Asymmetric Gaussian model outperforms other models over most areas of high latitude boreal region, while the Savitzky-Golay model gives the best reconstruction performance in tropical and subtropical regions. The FRE and the NNRE helped to reveal the main error sources in the reconstruction in different regions. The comparison method developed and applied in this study led to suggest adaptive selection of the best reconstruction model for specific NDVI signals and noise distribution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, a multistep method is developed to generate cloud-free MODIS daily snow cover products. The accuracy of the updated MODIS snow products is evaluated for a region in southwestern Germany in which winter cloud coverage and snow variability are typically high. First, we applied Aqua/Terra combination, temporal combination and spatial combination to reduce the cloud coverage and to retrieve the omitted snow. This procedure was not effective since cloud blockage occurs frequently during the snow season. A conditional probability interpolation was then employed to reclassify the remaining cloud cover on MODIS snow maps based on in situ snow depth observations. Finally, we implemented a set of meteorological filters to minimize the misclassified snow in MODIS snow products. The improved cloud-free MODIS daily snow maps showed an overall accuracy of about 92% during the snow season with significantly reduced snow overestimation errors and a slight increase in snow omission errors, compared to the overall accuracy of 87% and 94% for original MODIS Aqua and Terra data, respectively. This study suggests that the fusion of ground-based and satellite based snow observations is an effective approach for generating cloud-free remote sensing snow data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, coupled with structural information from space-based and airborne laser altimetry, Landsat 8 provides powerful capabilities for large-area, long-term studies that quantify temporal and spatial changes in above-ground biomass and cover. With the planned launch of ICESat-2 in 2017 and thus the potential to couple Landsat 8 and ICESat-2 data, we have unprecedented opportunities to address key challenges in drylands, including quantifying fuel loads, habitat quality, biodiversity, carbon cycling, and desertification.   In this study, we explore the strengths of Landsat 8\'s Operational Land Imager (OLI) in estimating vegetation structure in a dryland ecosystem, and compare these results to Landsat 5\'s Thematic Mapper (TM). We also demonstrate the potential of OLI when coupled with light detection and ranging (lidar) in estimating vegetation cover and biomass in a dryland ecosystem. The OLI and TM predictions were similarly positive, indicating data from these sensors may be used in tandem for long-term time-series analysis. Results indicate shrub and herbaceous cover are well predicted with multi-temporal OLI data, and a combination of OLI and lidar derivatives improves most of these estimates and reduces uncertainty. For example, significant improvements were made for shrub cover (R-2 = 0.64 and 0.78 using OLI only and both OLI and lidar data, respectively). Importantly, a time series of OLI, with some improvement from lidar, provides strong estimates of herbaceous cover (68% of the variance is explained with OLI alone). In contrast, OLI data explain roughly 59% of the variance in total shrub biomass, however approximately 71% of the variance is explained when combined with lidar derivatives.   To estimate the potential synergies of OLI and ICESat-2 we used simulated ICESat-2 photon data to predict vegetation structure. In a shrubland environment with a vegetation mean height of 1 m and mean vegetation cover of 33%, vegetation photons are able to explain nearly 50% of the variance in vegetation height. These results, and those from a comparison site, suggest that a lower detection threshold of ICESat-2 may be in the range of 30% canopy cover and roughly 1 m height in comparable dryland environments and these detection thresholds could be used to combine future ICESat-2 photon data with OLI spectral data for improved vegetation structure. Overall, the synergistic use of Landsat 8 and ICESat-2 may improve estimates of above-ground biomass and carbon storage in drylands that meet these minimum thresholds, increasing our ability to monitor drylands for fuel loading and the potential to sequester carbon.

Forest covers 40% of Northeast China, and the presence of forests influences the accuracy of snow depth retrievals from passive microwave remote sensing data. An optimal iteration method was used to retrieve the forest transmissivities at 18 and 36 GHz based on the snow and forest microwave radiative transfer models and the snow properties measured in field experiments. The transmissivities at 18 and 36 GHz are 0.895 and 0.656 in the horizontal polarization, and 0.821 and 0.615 in the vertical polarization, respectively. Furthermore, the forest transmissivity and snow properties were input into the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS) to establish a dynamic look-up table (LUT). Snow depths were retrieved from satellite passive microwave remote sensing data based on the LUT method, and these retrievals were verified by snow depth observations at 103 meteorological stations. The results showed that the bias between the retrieved and measured snow depths is very small, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of approximately 6 cm in forest regions and 4 cm in non-forest regions. When compared with the existing snow products, the snow depth retrieved in this work presented the highest level of accuracy. The regional snow depth product in China is superior to the GlobSnow and NASA AMSR-E standard SWE products in non-forest regions, whereas the GlobSnow estimate is superior to the regional snow depth product in China and NASA AMSR-E standard SWE product estimates in forest regions. Therefore, we conclude that 1) the influence of forest on snow depth retrieval is important, and the appropriate forest parameters should be considered in the estimation of snow depth from passive microwave brightness temperature data; and 2) the snow depth retrieval algorithm based on the dynamic LUT method proved to be efficient in Northeast China.

We used daily images over a full year from a tower-mounted RGB camera to quantify the leaf phenology of 267 individual tree crowns in an evergreen Central Amazon forest. The Green Chromatic Coordinate, an index of each crown\'s greenness, showed rapid large-amplitude positive and negative changes, each generally occurring once per year. Rapid increase was attributed to leaf flushing and occurred in 85% of all crowns. Rapid negative change occurred in 42% of individuals, caused mostly by massive pre-flush leaf abscission (31% of all crowns). Flushing was concentrated in the five driest months (55% of crowns) compared to the five wettest months (10%). Inter-crown variance of greenness was lowest in the wet season when fewer crowns were abruptly abscising or flushing leaves. With a one month lead, flushing frequency closely tracked seasonal light availability (R = 0.89) and was inversely correlated with rainfall (R = -0.88). We linked the post-flush age of each crown\'s leaf cohort to the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) of crowns at different phenostages on a nadir view QuickBird image. When aggregated to landscape-scale, this camera-based EVI closely followed (R = 0.95) the MODIS MAIAC EVI of the same site, fully corrected for sun-sensor geometry effects. Leaf phenology therefore drives the dry season green-up detected by MODIS in the Central Amazon. It is also consistent with evolutionary strategies to couple photosynthetic efficiency with light availability and to avoid predation and disease on vulnerable young leaves. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

An assessment of the impact of climate change on frontal positions and frontal gradients requires reliable reference data and the possibility to monitor oceanic fronts. Therefore, the development of algorithms which automatically detect frontal positions from Earth Observation (EO) data is an important tool to analyse long EO time series, i.e. to process big data volumes. The development of GRADHIST was driven by the need to generate a climatology for North Sea fronts. GRADHIST is a new algorithm for the detection and mapping of oceanic fronts, which is based on a combination and refinement of the gradient algorithm of Canny (1986) and the histogram algorithm of Cayula and Cornillon (1992). GRADHIST preserves the main principles of both algorithms and can be applied to various ocean parameters as well as to different sensors with very little effort. GRADHIST was validated and tested using both synthetic and real data and applied to sea surface temperature and ocean colour parameters retrieved from satellite data; i.e. data from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), MERIS (MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer), AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) and AATSR (Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer). Selected results and statistical analysis of a new North Sea climatology for oceanic fronts are presented and discussed.

The L-band brightness temperature observed by SMOS has been used to produce estimates of both soil moisture and tau, the optical thickness of the land surface. Although tau should theoretically be proportional to the amount of vegetation present within a SMOS pixel, several initial investigations have not been able to confirm this expected behavior. However, when the noise in the SMOS tau product is removed, tau in the U.S. Corn Belt, a region of extensive row-crop agriculture, has a distinct shape that mirrors the growth and development of crops. We find that the peak value of SMOS tau occurs at approximately 1000 degrees C day (base 10 degrees C) growing degree days after the mean planting date of maize (corn). We can explain this finding in the following way: tau is directly proportional to the water column density of vegetation; maize contributes the most to growing season changes in tau in the Corn Belt; and maize reaches its maximum water column density at its third reproductive stage of development, at about 1000 degrees C day growing degree days. Consequently, SMOS tau could be used to monitor the phenology of crops in the Corn Belt at a spatial resolution similar to a U.S. county and a temporal frequency on the order of days. We also examined the magnitude of the change in SMOS tau over the growing season and hypothesized it would be related to the amount of accumulated solar radiation, but found this not to be the case. On the other hand, the change in magnitude was smallest for the year in which the most precipitation fell. These findings are rational since SMOS tau at the satellite scale is in fact a function of both vegetation and soil surface roughness, and soil surface roughness is reduced by precipitation. To fully explain changes in SMOS tau in the Corn Belt it appears that it will be necessary to use in situ and remotely-sensed observations along with agro-ecosystem models to account for land management decisions made by farmers that affect changes in soil surface roughness and all of the relevant biophysical processes that affect the growth and development of crops.

In this study, an index of Virtual-Baseline Floating macroAlgae Height (VB-FAH) is proposed to use the green and red bands as the baseline to measure the height of the near-infrared (NIR) reflectance. Cross-sensor comparison with Landsat TM and ETM + data suggests that for several images evaluated here VB-FAH appears to be comparable to the previously proposed Floating Algae Index (FAI) even in the absence of a shortwave-infrared (SWIR) band. VB-FAH is applied to 30-m resolution TM and ETM + data for the YS during 1995-2006 and to HJ-1 data for the ECS during 2009-2014 to map MABs. Results show bloom history in the YS back to 1999 and early bloom occurrence in the ECS in winter and spring (e.g., February and March 2013). MABs are also found to extend to the ECS as far south as 26 degrees N near Fujian Province and Taiwan, and as far east as the Kuroshio Current. These new findings provide important information for exploring the origins, causes, and consequences of MABs in the YS and ECS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This opens up opportunities to fully exploit the use of the SIF spectrum as an indicator of photosynthetic activity. Simulations performed with the coupled fluorescence-photosynthesis model SCOPE were used to determine how strongly canopy-leaving SIF can be related to net photosynthesis of the canopy (NPC) for various canopy configurations. Regression analysis between SIF retrievals and NPC values produced the following general findings: (1) individual SIF bands that were most sensitive to NPC were located around the first emission peak (SIFred) for heterogeneous canopy configurations (i.e., varying biochemistry, leaf, canopy variables); (2) using two SIF retrieval bands, e.g. O-2-B at 687 nm and O-2-A at 760 nm, or the red and NIR emission peaks at 685 nm and 740 nm, led to stronger correlations than using only one band; (3) using the O-2-B and the O-2-A SIF retrieval bands was at least as effective as using the two emission peaks; (4) superior correlations were achieved by using the four main SIF retrieval bands (H alpha, O-2-B, water vapor, O-2-A); and (5) further improvements may be obtained by exploiting the full SIF profile and by using an adaptive, nonlinear regression algorithm such as Gaussian processes regression (GPR). Relationships can be due to variation in photosynthetic capacity (V-cmo), but also from variation in leaf optical and canopy structural variables such as chlorophyll content and leaf area index. Overall, modeling results suggest that sampling the SIF profile in at least both O-2-B and O-2-A bands enables quantification photosynthetic activity of vegetation with high accuracy.

Its environmental evolution is significant for understanding historical global climate change. At present, there is no surface water in Lop Nur Lake Basin, and on SAR images it looks like an \"Ear\". The objective of this article is to recognize different types of salt crust by surface roughness parameters and interpret their environmental meanings in Lop Nur. Surface roughness parameter estimation, by means of microwave remote sensing technology, is a topic which is intensively studied yet not solved satisfactorily. In this article, the potential of using Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) acquisitions for the estimation of surface roughness parameter in Lop Nur Lake Basin is investigated. A new parameter Si is proposed to characterize surface roughness and to discriminate salt crust types. Through the analysis of scattering mechanisms, the physical meaning of the PolSAR parameter Single Bounce Eigenvalue Relative Difference (SERD) is reinterpreted and it is used to retrieve parameterSt. A good linear correlation between the measured surface roughness parameter Si and SERD with an R-2 value of 0.72 was obtained. Furthermore, the distributions of different salt crusts in the certain lake area were analyzed. Based on hypotheses of the evolution of surface salt crust and the drying-up cycle of lakes, the fluctuation processes of an ancient lake in Lop Nur were discussed theoretically. These can help to have a better understanding of environmental changes in arid and semi-arid regions. (c) 2016 The Authors.

Nadir viewing passive multispectral sensors have limited utility for measuring the N status of winter wheat in middle and bottom layers, and multi-angular remote sensors may instead improve detection of whole canopy physiological and biochemical parameters. Our objective was to improve the predictive accuracy and angular stability of leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) measurement by constructing a novel Angular Insensitivity Vegetation Index (AIVI). We quantified the relationship between LNC and ground-based multi-angular hyperspectral reflectance in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) across different growth stages, plant types, N rates, planting density, ecological sites and years. The optimum vegetation indices (VIs) obtained from 17 traditional indices reported in the literature were tested for their stability in estimating LNC at 13 view zenith angles (VZAs) in the solar principal plane (SPP). Overall the back-scatter direction gave improved index performance, relative to the nadir and forward-scattering direction. Red-edge VIs (e.g., mND705, GND [750,550], NDRE, RI-1dB) were highly correlated with LNC. However, the relationships strongly depended on experimental conditions, and these VIs tended to saturate at the highest LNC (4.5%). To further overcome the influence of different experimental conditions and VZAs on VIs, we developed a novel index, Angular Insensitivity Vegetation Index (AIVI), based on red-edge, blue and green bands. Our new model showed the highest association with LNC (R-2 = 0.73-0.87) compared to traditional VIs. Investigating AIVI predictive accuracy in measuring LNC across view zenith angles (VZAs) revealed that performance was the highest at -20 degrees and was relatively homogenous between -10 degrees and -40 degrees. This provided a united, predictive model across this wide-angle range, which enhances the possibility of N monitoring by using portable monitors. Testing of the models with independent data gave R-2 of 0.84 at -20 degrees, and 0.83 across the range of -10 degrees to -40 degrees, respectively. These results suggest that the novel AIVI is more effective for monitoring LNC than previously reported VIs for predicting accuracy, monitoring model stability and view angle independency.

In the procedure herein proposed, named Time-Domain Triangle Method (TDTM), the triangular feature space was parameterized considering pairs of T-s-VI values obtained by exploring, for each pixel, only their temporal dynamics. This new method was developed using time series products provided by MODIS and MSG-SEVIRI sensors. Moreover the proposed procedure does not depend on ancillary data, and it is only based on remotely sensed vegetation indices and day-night time land surface temperature differences.   Two different test areas located in Sicily were selected for testing and validating the approach. Satellite ET rates were validated versus directly measured fluxes of mass (ET) obtained by eddy covariance (EC) towers during the observation period 2010-2012.   The proposed approach predicts daily ET rates with an acceptable level of accuracy for practical purposes; therefore, the TDTM can be considered as a simple and effective tool to easily estimate, at regional scale, spatial and temporal changes of this key-variable related to water resource management, agriculture, ecology and climate change.

Human impacts like draining can hinder the ability of peatlands to sequester carbon and expose their soils to fire under dry conditions. Estimating soil carbon loss from peat fires can be challenging due to uncertainty about pre-fire surface elevations. This study uses multi-temporal LiDAR to obtain pre- and post-fire elevations and estimate soil carbon loss caused by the 2011 Lateral West fire in the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, VA, USA. We also determine how LiDAR elevation error affects uncertainty in our carbon loss estimate by randomly perturbing the LiDAR point elevations and recalculating elevation change and carbon loss, iterating this process 1000 times. We calculated a total loss using LiDAR of 1.10 Tg C across the 25 km(2) burned area The fire burned an average of 47 cm deep, equivalent to 44 kg C/m(2), a value larger than the 1997 Indonesian peat fires (29 kg C/m(2)). Carbon loss via the First-Order Fire Effects Model (FOFEM) was estimated to be 0.06 Tg C. Propagating the LiDAR elevation error to the carbon loss estimates, we calculated a standard deviation of 0.00009 Tg C, equivalent to 0.008% of total carbon loss. We conclude that LiDAR elevation error is not a significant contributor to uncertainty in soil carbon loss under severe fire conditions with substantial peat consumption. However, uncertainties may be more substantial when soil elevation loss is of a similar or smaller magnitude than the reported LiDAR error. Published by Elsevier Inc.', '[Reddy, A.

Despite the normative of land-cover class specific albedos, there is considerable variability in albedo within a land cover class. The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo product were combined to produce a long-term (14 years) integrated land cover-albedo database for the continental United States that can be used to examine the temporal behavior of albedo as a function of land cover. The integration identifies areas of homogeneous land cover at the nominal spatial resolution of the MODIS (MCD43A) albedo product (500 m x 500 m) from the NLCD product (30 m x 30 m), and provides an albedo data record per 500 m x 500 m pixel for 14 of the 16 NLCD land cover classes. Individual homogeneous land cover pixels have up to 605 albedo observations, and 75% of the pixels have at least 319 MODIS albedo observations (>= 50% of the maximum possible number of observations) for the study period (2000-2013). We demonstrated the utility of the database by conducting a multivariate analysis of variance of albedo for each NLCD land cover class, showing that locational (pixel-to-pixel) and inter-annual variability were significant factors in addition to expected seasonal (intra-annual) and geographic (latitudinal) effects.

These applications depend on reliable correction of atmospheric scattering and absorption. The HyspIRI Preparatory Campaign is an airborne precursor mission comprised of multiple flights by the \"classic\" Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-C) over a wide geographic area. This article describes the atmospheric correction that we have implemented for the campaign. We first present the theoretical basis of our approach, which is grounded in the ATmospheric REMoval (ATREM) algorithm. We then describe new enhancements including retrieval of pressure altitude, which improves accuracy over widely varying topography, and joint retrieval of optical absorption for three phases of water (vapor, liquid, and ice), which improves accuracy over vegetated areas. Reflectance is validated using ground spectra acquired across a wide range of targets and elevations. Finally, we use the algorithm to map vapor, liquid, and ice phases of water over 6 months across a 14,000 km(2) region of California. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Remote sensing is the most expeditious method of obtaining floristic information at landscape and regional scales, but the spatial complexity of many northern peatlands and the spectral similarity of a number of peatland vegetation species is such that the success of traditional methods of vegetation classification is often limited. Here, we assessed whether ordination and regression analyses may be a useful alternative method for mapping peatland plant communities from remote sensing data. We used isometric feature mapping (Isomap) to describe the community structure of the peatland vegetation and related the identified continuous floristic gradients to hyperspectral imagery (AEA Eagle) using partial least squares regression (PLSR). We performed the same analysis at two hierarchical levels of species aggregation in order to map continuous gradients in the composition of both species and plant functional types (PFTs), the latter of which is the most widely used level of aggregation in northern ecosystems. Isomap was able to transfer 82% and more than 96% of the observed ground-based observations to the ordination space for plots characterised by species and PFT; respectively. The modelled floristic gradients showed good agreement with ground-based species and PFT observations although the strength of the agreement was proportional to the amount of floristic variation explained by each ordination axis (r(val)(2) = 0.74, 0.45 and 030 for the first three ordination axes and r(val)(2) = 0.68 and 0.66 for the first two ordination axes; for species and PFT floristic gradients respectively). We also found that how a PVC is defined has an important influence on the success with which it can be mapped. The resultant mapped floristic gradients enabled visualisation of homogeneous vegetation stands, heterogeneous mixtures of different key species and PFTs, and the presence of continuous and abrupt floristic transitions, without the need for unique spectral signatures or the collection of data characterising ancillary environmental variables.

Thresholds in automated cloud detection algorithms are often set conservatively leading to underestimation of the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) domain. Yet an expert user can visually distinguish the cloud patterns from SST. In this study, available pattern recognition methodologies are discussed and an automated SST Pattern Test (SPT) is formulated. Analyses are performed with SSTs retrieved from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor onboard S-NPP using the NOAA operational Advanced Clear-Sky Processor for Oceans (ACSPO) system. Based on the analyses of global data, we have identified spatial features potentially useful for discriminating cloud from clear-ocean. The SPT attempts to mimic the visual perception by a human operator such as gradient information, spatial connectivity, and high/low frequency discrimination. It first identifies contiguous areas with similar features, and then makes a decision based on the statistics of the whole region, rather than on a per pixel basis. The initial objective of the SPT was to automatically identify clear sky regions misclassified by ACSPO clear sky mask as cloudy, and improve coverage in dynamic areas of the ocean and in the coastal zones. Future work will be directed towards extending the SPT to also minimize cloud leakages, and redesigning the current ACSPO clear-sky mask making full use of pattern recognition approach.

We derived a tide-corrected ice velocity map and mass budget of Campbell Glacier Tongue (CGT) in East Antarctica by using 14 COSMO-SkyMed one-day tandem differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR) pairs obtained from January to November 2011. The vertical tidal deflection of CGT was estimated and removed from the DInSAR images by using a tide deflection ratio map generated by double-differential InSAR (DDInSAR) method. We then generated averaged ice-flow velocity (v map) and its standard deviation (cry map). Ice-flow velocity increased from the upper part of the grounding line (similar to 020 m d(-1)) to the seaward edge of CGT (similar to 0.67 md(-1)) with sigma(v), less than similar to 0.04 m d(-1) in the main stream of CGT. The eastern part of CGT flows slower than the western part because it is grounded along the flow line and thus experiences severe basal drag. Flux mass balance (FMB), i.e., ice thickness change by volume flux divergence, of CGT was obtained by combining the v map and an ice thickness value of 340 +/- 18 m estimated by the ICESat GLAS data. We used mass conservation assumption in which total mass balance (TMB, -629 +/- 137 m a(-1) observed by ICESat GLAS data) is attributed to FMB, basal mass balance (BMB) and surface mass balance (SMB, 024 +/- 0.02 m a(-1)). Mass loss in the freely floating zone of CGT is mainly caused by basal melting (BMB = -144.5 +/- 39.9 Mt a(-1)) while thinning by volume flux (FMB = -67.2 +/- 8.9 Mt a(-1)) is relatively small. In the hinge zone of CGT, mass change is contributed to FMB of -147.3 +/- 25.2 Mt a(-1) and BMB of 15.3 +/- 39.8 Mt a(-1). However, basal freezing derived for the hinge zone may be erroneous as a result of the constant ice thickness assumption extrapolated from the freely floating zone. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Two documented methods are applied, the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) and an unmixing-based method which proposes a Bayesian formulation to incorporate prior spectral information. Furthermore, the strengths of both algorithms are combined in a novel data fusion method: the Spatial and Temporal Reflectance Unmixing Model (STRUM). The potential of each method is demonstrated using simulation imagery and Landsat and MODIS imagery. The theoretical basis of the algorithms causes STARFM and STRUM to produce Landsat-like reflectances while preserving the spatial patterns found in Landsat images, and the unmixing-based method to produce MODIS-like reflectances. The ability of fused images to capture phenological variations is also assessed using temporal NDVI profiles. Temporal profiles of STARFM NDVI closely resembled Landsat NDVI profiles. However, the unmixing-based method and STRUM produced a more accurate reconstruction of the NDVI trajectory in experiments simulating situations where few input high-resolution images are available. STRUM had the best performance as it produced surface reflectances which had the highest correlations to reference Landsat images. The results of this study indicate that STRUM is more suitable for data fusion applications requiring Landsat-like surface reflectances, such as gap-filling and cloud masking, especially in situations where few high-resolution images are available. Unmixing-based data fusion is recommended in situations which downscale the spectral characteristics of the medium-resolution input imagery and the STARFM method is recommended for constructing temporal profiles in applications containing many input high-resolution images.

The fractional snow retrieval uses the SCAmod method designed ecpecially to enable accurate snow mapping including forests. The basics of the methodology are presented, as well as the cloud screening method applied in SE production. Considerations for future validations together with discussion on some current issues and potential inaccuracies are presented. One focus of the investigation is on the representativeness of reference FSC generated from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) data, with a particular interest in forested areas. Two methods for reference data generation are investigated. When comparing the GlobSnow Daily Fractional Snow Cover to these reference data, we try to identify how the comparison reflects the possible inaccuracies of the DFSC and to define the conditions where the reference data are not representative. It is obvious that the evaluation result strongly depends on the quality of the reference data, and that the two methods investigated cannot provide representative reference data for dense forests. For fully snow-covered dense conifer forest area in Finland, a Root Mean Squared Error of 20-30% was obtained from comparisons although DFSC indicated full snow cover correctly. These first evaluations would indicate a good performance of GlobSnow SE products in forests; however, this does not necessarily show up in validations due to the non-representativeness of the reference data. It is also concluded that GlobSnow SE products are sensitive to the representativeness of the applied SCAmod parameters and that FSC overestimations may occur in dense forests.

To detect the bloom an index based on multi-spectral band ratios using three wavelengths (555, 660, 745 nm) was utilized. One month later, the GOCI images detected widespread floating green algae patches (east west elongated) across the Yellow Sea and East China Sea (YS, ECS). The presence of the patches was confirmed from various oceanic observation cruises. Lagrangian particle tracking experiments were conducted to understand the pathway of the floating green algae patches and interpret the physical forcing factors that affect the distribution and advection of the floating green algae. The numerical simulation results indicated that dominant southerly winds during June and July 2011 were related to offshore movement of the floating green algae, especially their eastward extension in the YS/ECS. An infrequent and unusual event occurred in June 2011: a typhoon MEARI, caused the green algae to detach from the coast and initiated movement to the east. After the typhoon event, sea surface temperature recovered rapidly enough to grow the floating green algae, and wind and local current controlled the movement of the massive floating algae patches (coastal accumulation or offshore advection in the YS/ECS). Analysis of the floating green algae pixels\' movement during passage of Typhoon MAON in July 2011 revealed that the floating green algae patches were significantly controlled by both ocean currents and enhanced winds. These findings suggest that the floating green algae bloom off Qingdao and in the middle of the YS and ECS in the summer of 2011 occurred due to the combined effects of recent rapid expansion of seaweed aquaculture, strong winds, and the wind patterns in blooming regions. Our combined approach, using satellite data and numerical simulations, provides a robust estimate for tracing and monitoring changes in green algae blooms on a regional scale. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In order to fill the gaps on the comprehension of the spatial variability of the Douro estuarine plume, an innovative methodology was applied to observe and characterize this plume and its spatial and temporal variability. Using images of normalized water-leaving radiance at 555 nm from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) in combination with long-term concurrent wind, tidal and river discharge data (2003-2011), this work evaluates the effect of the main drivers (river discharge, wind and tide) on the plume features. Expected strong relationships between river discharge and turbid levels were detected. A circular pattern is well distinct off Douro estuary when the flow exceeds 500 m(3) s(-1). Under upwelling favorable winds and high river discharge regime, an offshore expansion is observed. During southerly winds, there is a plume confinement to the coast. Easterly winds produce a bulge formation with an offshore detachment from the coast while westerly winds tend to confine freshwater close to the shoreline and decrease the cross-shore advection. Under high river discharges, a remarkable tidal influence in the near-field regions is observed close to the coast and near the river mouth. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This method makes the initial assumption that absorption by coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the region of interest is either constant, or so low that its variability can be neglected. It uses a slightly modified version of the Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (Lee et al., 2009) to recover the non-water absorption (a) and particulate backscattering (bbp) coefficients, and then obtains an estimate of absorption by CDOM, and the bacicscattering to absorption ratios for minerals and phytoplankton, by fitting upper and lower boundaries to the resulting data cluster. These ratios are employed in linear un-mixing equations to resolve the contributions of phytoplanlcton and minerals to the particulate absorption coefficient. The performance of the method was evaluated using reflectance spectra generated by an optical model of the Irish Sea which incorporated realistic specific inherent optical properties and distributions of constituent concentrations. It was then used to recover absorption coefficients for phytoplankton and suspended minerals in the 488 nm waveband from MODIS remote sensing data for the central Irish Sea for the period May 2005-November 2012. The partitioned coefficients showed strong seasonality, with suspended mineral absorption peaking in winter and phytoplanlcton absorption becoming dominant in spring and summer. By employing locally determined specific inherent optical properties, it was possible to estimate the average annual cycles in the concentrations of the two constituents. These cycles proved to be consistent with previously published models of particle dynamics in the region in which mineral concentrations are elevated by winter mixing and increasing water column stability in spring is followed by a period of phytoplankton growth. We conclude that it is possible to resolve the separate contributions of phytoplankton and minerals to particulate absorption in waters where these constituents are the dominant determinants of optical variability, and that the partitioned absorption coefficients can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of biogenic and minerogenic particles in shelf sea ecosystems. 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.', '[Mitchell, Catherine; Cunningham, Alex; Mckee, David] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Phys, Glasgow G4 0NG, Lanark, Scotland.', 'University of StrathclydeRP Cunningham, A (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Dept Phys, 107 Rottenrow, Glasgow G4 0NG, Lanark, Scotland.', 'a.cunningham@strath.ac.ukRI McKee, David J C/D-6244-2013', NULL, 'Natural Environment Research Council [NE/E013678/1, 1104872,   NE/B501004/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/E013678/1] Funding   Source: UKRI', NULL, 48, 9, 9, 1, 25, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

However, it has a fragile ecosystem and is facing severe impacts from climate change and human activities. Motivated by the high demand for spatial and temporal information about flooding dynamics and vegetation patterns, six fully polarimetric RADARSAT-2 images acquired with the same configuration were explored to reveal the characteristics of the floodplain. The evaluation of a set of polarimetric observables derived from the series of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data was used to investigate the characteristics of the typical land-cover types in the floodplain. The behaviors of the polarimetric features highlight the benefits of interpreting the scattering mechanism evolutions at different phenological and inundation stages. The vegetation and inundation patterns were mapped by a random forest (RF) classifier with the input of these polarimetric observations. The results show that a multi-temporal classification can better capture the spatial distribution of the vegetation pattern than single-temporal classifications, which often show a large variability due to the effect of phenology and flooding. A hydroperiod map, which was generated by the time-series classification results of open water, illustrates the flooding temporal dynamics and the hydrological regime. The two main environmental factors that induced the changes in the backscattering - phenology and flooding - were identified based on the aggregated classification results of different phenological intervals. The spatial and temporal characteristics of the phenology- and flooding-induced changes were documented by the changes in the trajectories of three patch metrics at the class level. The polarimetric features\' importance scores derived from the RF classifier indicate that the intensity-related features are important for land-cover mapping. The HV intensity, in particular, achieves the highest importance score. In addition, the volume scattering component shows a better performance among the composite features, revealing the importance of the quad-polarimetric information for floodplain interpretation and monitoring.

Because of the high contribution of irrigated crops (>80%) to total agricultural production, knowing the spatial distribution and year-to-year variability in irrigated areas is imperative to monitoring food security for the country. We used 16-day composites of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor to create 23-point time series for each year from 2000 through 2013. Seasonal peak values and time series were used in a threshold-dependent decision tree algorithm to map irrigated areas in Afghanistan for the last 14 years. In the absence of ground reference irrigated area information, we evaluated these maps with the irrigated areas classified from multiple snapshots of the landscape during the growing season from Landsat 5 optical and thermal sensor images. We were able to identify irrigated areas using Landsat imagery by selecting as irrigated those areas with Landsat-derived NDVI greater than 0.30-0.45, depending on the date of the Landsat image and surface temperature less than or equal to 310 Kelvin (36.9 degrees C). Due to the availability of Landsat images, we were able to compare with the MODIS-derived maps for four years: 2000, 2009, 2010, and 2011. The irrigated areas derived from Landsat agreed well r(2) = 0.91 with the irrigated areas derived from MODIS, providing confidence in the MODIS NDVI threshold approach. The maps portrayed a highly dynamic irrigated agriculture practice in Afghanistan, where the amount of irrigated area was largely determined by the availability of surface water, especially snowmelt, and varied by as much as 30% between water surplus and water deficit years. During the past 14 years, 2001, 2004, and 2008 showed the lowest levels of irrigated area (similar to 15 million hectares), attesting to the severe drought conditions in those years, whereas 2009, 2012 and 2013 registered the largest irrigated area (similar to 2.5 million hectares) due to record snowpack and snowmelt in the region. The model holds promise the ability to provide near-real-time (by the end of the growing seasons) estimates of irrigated area, which are beneficial for food security monitoring as well as subsequent decision making for the country. While the model is developed for Afghanistan, it can be adopted with appropriate adjustments in the derived threshold values to map irrigated areas elsewhere. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Leaf-off data are useful for classifying evergreen and deciduous trees since echoes at lower intensity are returned from deciduous trees when compared to evergreen trees. In addition to this, the proportion of echoes from the ground is higher for deciduous trees than for evergreen trees. In this study, we classified land cover, including evergreen and deciduous trees, using a Random Forest classifier based on LiDAR-metrics generated from leaf-off ALS data, and estimated tree cover and tree heights for the whole of Denmark. The results were compared with the CORINE Land Cover (CLC2006) data, percentage of tree cover from MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) and a global tree height map based on ICESat data. Considering tree class alone, deciduous and evergreen trees could be classified with an overall accuracy of 94% using validation data generated using aerial imagery from a 60-km strip across Central Jutland. The lower values of ALS-based percentage tree cover were overestimated and the higher values underestimated by MODIS VCF data, with a root-mean-square (RMS) deviation of 18.26%. The tree heights estimated using ALS data were generally lower than the global estimates of tree height with an RMS deviation of 5.1 m. The ALS intensity values were useful for classifying evergreen and deciduous trees. These findings show that ALS datasets collected for generating national DTMs can be used for tree cover and tree height mapping, as well as for regional classification of trees if data over the whole area are collected within a few months in the leaf-off season.

Results show that the CBPM-derived NPP using the new model for P-opt(B) are improved for the Chesapeake Bay. Comparisons of MODIS-Aqua-derived and in situ-measured NPP show that the satellite-derived data correspond reasonably well to in situ measurements, although MODIS-Aqua-derived NPP values may be slightly overestimated for the upper Bay, primarily due to uncertainties in the bio-optical algorithm for satellite ocean color products for that region. We also generated MODIS-Aqua-derived NPP maps using the improved CBPM for the period of 2002 to 2011 to characterize NPP in the Chesapeake Bay. Spatial distributions of MODIS-Aqua-derived NPP products show that higher NPP values are generally found in the southern upper Bay and northern middle Bay (regions around 38.3 degrees N-39.0 degrees N), including the Potomac River, while relatively low NPP values were found in the northern upper Bay, the eastern area of middle Bay, and lower Bay. The temporal pattern of MODIS-Aqua-derived NPP showed lowest values in winter (December to February) over the entire Bay, while high NPP values were in late spring to summer (May to August), depending on location. Furthermore, there is a strong interannual variability in NPP for the Chesapeake Bay, and an apparent increasing trend from 2003 to 2011.

When analyzing wide areas, large numbers of single scenes obtained at different times of the dry season are often handled. Such imagery is characterized by changes of spectral reflectance due to vegetation phenology, varying atmospheric effects and solar geometries. In order to allow batch processing with automatic classification techniques, inter-scene comparability is required and data have to be radiometrically normalized. Cambodia is characterized by a mixture of evergreen, semi-evergreen and deciduous forest types, the latter two experiencing at least partial leaf shedding over the course of the dry season. Using spatial medium resolution SPOT 4 data and a manually delineated base map a season adjustment model was developed. The model is adapting the land cover specific spectral signatures of a slave scene (acquired in the middle of the dry season with its seasonal forests defoliated) to an adjacent master scene (from the beginning of the dry season, showing the same forest types with leafs). The relative position of every pixel reflectance was determined in relation to the mean reflectance and its standard deviation for each land cover type and sensor band of the unadjusted slave scene. For seasonality adjustment these pixel reflectance values were transformed (rescaled) to the corresponding position in spectral space defined by the band mean reflectance and standard deviation derived from the corresponding land cover class of the master scene. While the variability of spectral profiles of the pixels in the slave scene is rescaled, the mean reflectance value of the land cover class in the slave scene is conformed to the mean reflectance of the corresponding land cover class in the master scene. The Transformed Divergence (TD) separability index was used to indicate the performance of the adjustment process by characterizing the spectral distance for each land cover type comparing a reference dataset to the uncorrected and to the seasonality corrected scene respectively. While the TD values of all forest types showed a sharp decline, highlighting the good performance of the model, the TD values of the agriculture/urban class remained high, indicating limited normalization of this heterogeneous land cover type. In order to further demonstrate the performance of the model, an object-based land cover classification was applied to the unadjusted as well as to the corresponding adjusted scene. A comparison of the results showed a highly significant improvement of overall accuracy from 32.2% to 75.8% when applying seasonality adjustment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Initial assessment using results derived from the global processing of the algorithm indicated small, although variable, commission errors (<1.2%) for nominal confidence fire pixels. We achieved improved performance using the 375 m active fire data compared to the VIIRS 750 m baseline fire product, resulting in a 3 x and 25 x factor increase in the absolute number of fire pixels detected using day and nighttime data, respectively. Similarly, VIIRS 375 m fire data showed significantly superior mapping capabilities compared to current MODIS fire detection data with improved consistency of fire perimeter delineation for biomass burning lasting multiple days.

With multiple space-borne remote sensing FAPAR global products available from several sources the need for continual comparison and validation has become imperative. In this study, the performance of three global FAPAR algorithms (JRC-TIP, ESA/JRC MGVI and Boston University FAPAR) was evaluated over Europe for the year 2011. Results show an overall agreement among FAPAR products on sites having high and low FAPAR values, except for the north-eastern region of Europe characterized by boreal forest and the transition region with tundra biomes, where the Boston product exceeds values in other products by up to 0.5. Differences in FAPAR estimates over forest biomes suggest that assumptions on structure and optical properties of land surfaces in the different radiative transfer models play an important role in remote-sensing-derived FAPAR products. Uncertainty assessments were carried out using both quality indicators as proposed by the individual product teams as well as independent theoretical uncertainty estimates obtained with the triple collocation error model. The former revealed consistent spatial patterns but large differences in magnitudes (up to 0.1) with systematically lower uncertainties for the Boston product The latter instead suggests similar uncertainty ranges among the three products. Finally, a comparison with ground estimates for the 2009-2011 period over four European flux tower sites showed consistent, plausible seasonal variations of remote-sensing-derived FAPAR products. Findings suggest that differences in absolute values and inconsistency in uncertainty representation among FAPAR products are still considerable. Standardization frameworks quantifying the impact of different radiative transfer formulations on the estimation of biophysical variables, independent uncertainty estimation methods and well-defined ground measurement protocols need to be put in place before FAPAR products can be reliably fed into existing biogeochemical process models.

Lichen mats, however, can be heavily overgrazed at high deer densities, triggering area abandonment or population declines. Although the species\' management and conservation require precise information on the quality of winter grazing areas, no reliable and cost-efficient methods are available to date to measure lichen volume across wide and remote areas. We developed a new Lichen Volume Estimator, LVE, using remote sensing and field measurements. We used a Landsat TM land cover mask to separate lichen heath communities from other vegetation types and, therein, we predicted lichen volume from a two dimensional Gaussian regression model using two indexes: the Normalized Difference Lichen Index, NDLI (Band 5 - Band 4/ Band 5 + Band 4), and the Normalized Difference Moisture Index, NDMI (Band 4 - Band 5 / Band 4 + Band 5). The model was parameterized using 202 ground measurements equally distributed across a gradient ranging from 0 to 80 lichen dm(3)/m(2) (R-2 = 0.74 between predicted and observed ground measurements), and was validated with a ten-fold cross validation procedure (R-2 = 0.67), which also showed a high parameter stability. The LW can be a valuable tool to predict the quality of winter pastures for reindeer and caribou and, thus, help to improve the species\' management and conservation. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Data included chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla), coefficients of particulate absorption, a(p)(lambda), phytoplankton absorption, a(ph)(lambda), beam attenuation, c(p)(660), diffuse attenuation, K-d(lambda), and hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda). Surface Chla varied within a wide range from 0.10 to 18.87 mg m(-3) (mean of 2.82 +/- 3.35), reflecting differences in both, the timing of the blooms and the geographical sampling area. Considerable dispersion was verified for a(p)(lambda), c(p)(660), and K-bio(440) (K-d(440) minus diffuse attenuation for pure water) as a function of Chla. A hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) applied to the R-rs(lambda) spectra (N = 116) resulted in three classes ordered by spectral features that varied according to Chla. Class 1 (N = 22), Class 2 (N = 52), and Class 3 (N = 42) were grouped according to the R-rs(lambda) associated with Chla average of 0.86 (+/- 0.51), 2.42 (+/- 1.62), and 8.40 mg m(-3) (+/- 3.96), respectively. The estimation of Chla and a(ph)(lambda) by empirical and semi-analytical algorithms was evaluated using satellite data. Errors in the Chla estimates from the empirical algorithm OC4v6 using in situ R-rs(lambda) showed significant statistical relationships with Chla, a(ph)(440) / Chla, and b(p)(660) / Chla (where b(p)(660) = c(p)(660) - a(p)(660)). Although reasonable agreements were found between the measured and satellite-estimated values, the dependence of the OC4v6 errors on the Chla-specific phytoplankton absorption and particulate scattering coefficients reinforces the need to regionally refine both empirical and semi-analytical algorithms to improve satellite estimates of the bio-optical variables for the Patagonia region.

On account of almost persistent cloud cover in the rainy season, the application of optical remote sensing data presents a challenging exercise and demands special data processing and classification methods. An Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series is produced based on data from both platforms AQUA and TERRA, with dropouts and noise being effectively-reduced by applying an adaptive Savitzky-Golay filter. Thereby, different parameterisation is applied dependent on the number of harvest cycles, which are defined by an initial harmonic analysis, based on an EVI time series of 5 years. Information on land cover is derived by a multistep unsupervised classification approach optimised for regions with frequent cloud cover, based on multispectral monthly and seasonal composites, amplitude and phase information from a 11-year EVI time series (2001-2011), and phenological metrics from 2010. Moreover, the environmental heterogenic conditions in the region are addressed by a regionally tuned clustering approach based on physiographic subregions and the use of auxiliary geodata. The results obtained demonstrate that the adapted approach performs satisfactory in terms of accuracy under given conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Overcoming this limitation is an interesting scientific challenge with substantial application potential.   When both the total water area and topography are known, it is possible to locate regional water distribution in small regions, e.g., less than 1 km(2). The water fraction derived from TERRA/MODIS not only provides the water area in 500-m pixels, but it also contains geo-location information in each pixel, providing a potential way to derive high-resolution water maps with the use of SRTM digital elevation model (DEM) data. In this study we introduce an integration method to downscale MODIS 500-m water fraction maps to 30-m water maps with SKIM 30-m DEM data. The method uses an iteration cycle to compare water fraction by increasing water surface level based on the minimal elevation (searched from the 30-m SRTM cells within a 500-m pixel) to water fraction retrieved with dynamic nearest neighboring searching (DNNS) method from TERRA/MODIS multi-channel data, and iterations are terminated when the two fractions are equal to each other. The final water surface level is viewed as the maximal water surface level and smoothed by a uniformity process to reduce the impact from TERRA/MODIS water fraction retrieval errors. Then, cells in SRTM 30-m DEM with elevation between the minimal and maximal water surface levels are assigned as water to generate 30-m water maps.   The presented method was applied to the Mississippi River flood of May 2011 and showed promising results. A validation analysis was performed using simultaneous Landsat TM 30-m data, Worldview-2 2-m data and river gauge observations and showed high consistency between integrated MODIS 30-m water maps and high resolution real-time satellite water maps, and the matched rate with TM is above 93%. The calculated maximal water surface levels used for integration are also close to the water levels observed at river gauges along Mississippi River. The validation result indicates the feasibility of this method to derive high-resolution water maps from coarse- or moderate-resolution satellite data, which can significantly improve the capability of these satellite data in flood analysis for decision-makers and downstream users.

Then, the developed algorithmwas applied into a new hyperspectral satellite data, namely the HJ1A/HSI image, mapping spatio-temporal distribution of suspended particulate composition for Lake Taihu waters. The findings in the present study indicate that the proposed approach has a great potential in detecting particulate composition of water bodies. This study provides us improved understanding of particulate composition characteristics and corresponding spatio-temporal distribution for complex turbid inland waters.', '[Sun, Deyong; Gong, Shaoqi] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

Insufficient spatial and temporal resolution limits both cruise sampling and polar-orbiting satellite remote sensing in the mapping of TSM diurnal dynamics in coastal regions. However, the in-orbit operation of the world\'s first geostationary satellite ocean color sensor, GOCI, provides hourly observations of the covered area. In this study, we proposed a practical atmospheric correction algorithm for GOCI data in turbid waters. The validation results showed that the GOCI-retrieved normalized water-leaving radiances matched the in situ values well in both quantity and spectral shapes. We also developed a regional empirical TSM algorithm for GOCI data that is applicable in extremely turbid waters. Based on these atmospheric correction and regional TSM algorithms, we generated hourly TSM maps from GOCI Level-1B data. The diurnal variations derived by GOCI were a good match to the buoy data. The hourly GOCI observations revealed that various regions and tidal phases had different diurnal variation magnitudes, with a maximum of up to 5000 mg/l in central Hangzhou Bay. Strong wind events, such as typhoons, can significantly increase TSM in the bay; however, both the GOCI observations and buoy measurements indicated that this increase was episodic, had a short duration, and returned to normal within a day after the passage of a typhoon. Our results suggest that GOCI can successfully map the diurnal dynamics of TSM in turbid coastal waters. Moreover, the significant diurnal dynamics revealed in the hourly GOCI observations implied that caution should be taken in mapping TSM in coastal waters using cruise sampling and conventional polar-orbiting satellite data, as the temporal resolution is insufficient for catching diurnal variations.

In this study, SMOS soil moisture product was evaluated globally by using the triple collocation method. This statistical method is based on the comparison of three datasets and produces global error maps by statistically inter-comparing their variations. Only the variable part of the errors are considered here, the bias errors are not treated by triple collocation. This method was applied to the following datasets: SMOS Level 2 product, two soil moisture products derived from AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer)-LPRM (Land Parameter Retrieval Model) and NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Center), ASCAT (Advanced Scatterometer) and ECMWF (European Center for Medium range Weather Forecasting). The resulting errors are not absolute since they depend on the choice of the datasets. However this study showed that the spatial structure of the SMOS was independent of the combination and pointed out the same areas where SMOS performed well and where it did not. This global SMOS error map was then linked to other global parameters such as soil texture, RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) occurrence probabilities and land cover in order to identify their influences in the SMOS error. Globally the presence of forest in the field of view of the radiometer seemed to have the greatest influence on SMOS error (56.8%) whereas RFI represented 1.7% according to the analysis of variance from a multiple linear regression model. These percentages were not identical for all the continents and some discrepancies in the proportion of the influence were highlighted: soil texture was the main influence over Europe whereas RFI had the largest influence over Asia.

A total of seven flights between summer and autumn were conducted with a hyperspectral camera that captured 30 cm resolution imagery and 260 spectral bands in the 400-900 nm region. This enabled the identification of pure-vegetation tree crown pixels around an eddy covariance flux tower without shadow components or background effects. The hyperspectral imagery was used to study the temporal patterns of canopy fluorescence and reflectance indices related to physiology and canopy structure. The seasonal trends observed in the airborne indices and fluorescence and their relationship with gross primary production (GPP) demonstrated that vegetation indices mostly related to structure such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) yielded non-significant relationships (r(2) = 0.17; p > 0.05) due to the small structural changes in the canopy through the season. By contrast, physiological indices related to chlorophyll content (TCARI/OSAVI), light use efficiency (PRI570), and canopy chlorophyll fluorescence calculated through the Fraunhofer Line Depth principle (FLD3) showed a similar seasonal trend to that of GPP measured at the same time of the flights (r(2) in the range 0.75-0.84; p < 0.01). These results are consistent with the physiological trend observed during summer and autumn, which showed that chlorophyll content increased by 17.9% while the NDVI and the estimated tree crown projected LAI (LAI(p)) remained almost constant during the experiment (3% variation). The time-series hyperspectral dataset demonstrated that the seasonal trajectories of the NDVI and EVI were weakly related (p > 0.05) to the physiological indicators such as TCARI/OSAVI, PRI570 and fluorescence. The spatial variability of the hyperspectral indices investigated through the coefficient of variation (CV) showed that fluorescence around the tower varied up to 17% at the time of the maximum stress (summer), while LAI(p) showed little variation during that time (CV = 1.8%). After the summer stress period, the CV for fluorescence and chlorophyll content decreased in autumn down to 9%. This study demonstrates that small physiological changes occurring in an evergreen canopy were still captured by remote sensing physiological indices and high-resolution airborne fluorescence. These indicators are required for GPP monitoring when the vegetation dynamics are not captured by remote sensing structural indices. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Zarco-Tejada, P.

The scattering classes were then attributed to structural forms of either excurrent (large, central stem with minimal branching) or decurrent (diffuse branching) trees. To test the classification for a variety of forest structures, three contrasting study areas were chosen; a wooded savanna at the Injune Landscape Collaborative Project in Queensland, Australia, a managed transitional boreal-hardwood forest at the Howland Research Forest in Howland, Maine, and a transitional hardwood-pine forest at the Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts. Two questions are answered in this study: can the polarimetric parameters alpha and H characterize structurally similar areas within forests? And can they consistently differentiate these areas across multiple study areas? It is shown that the classification explained nearly 80% of the forest composition at the Injune Collaborative Research Site, 47% at the Howland Research Forest and 40% at the Harvard Forest. Classification accuracy decreases with high levels of H, which is a limiting factor at Howland and Harvard forests where canopy heterogeneity, density and moisture content are higher. When high-H Wishart classes (H>0.9) are omitted from analysis, accuracy improves to 83% and 86% for the Injune Collaborative Research Site and Harvard Forest respectively. The success of the Wishart classification at low-H indicates that there is a potential for using polarimetric information to characterize forest composition in particular landscapes; namely those that do not exhibit a high, homogeneous H response.

Some recent attempts have been made to derive Chla based on red and near-infrared wavelengths to avoid such problems. Using in situ data collected from 9 cruises between 1998 and 2010 in Tampa Bay, a large estuary (similar to 1000 km(2)) located in Florida (U.S.A.), we first tested three Chla algorithms, where each algorithm derived Chla as a function of independent variable x = Rrs(lambda(2))/Rrs(lambda(1)), x = [Rrs(lambda(1))(-1) - Rrs(lambda(2))(-1)] * Rrs(lambda(3)), and x = [Rrs(lambda(1))(-1) - Rrs(lambda(2))(-1)]/[Rrs(lambda(4))(-1) - Rrs(lambda(3))(-1)], respectively. Here Rrs(lambda) is the remote sensing reflectance, lambda is the wavelength from 660 to 760 nm, and the positions of the these wavelengths were determined using an objective method while the functional forms of Chla=f(x) were determined through regression between Chla and x. A synthetic chlorophyll index (SCI) using 4 green-red MERIS wavelengths was also tested. Using field measured Rrs(lambda) data, all these algorithms showed the potentials to retrieve Chla between similar to 2 and similar to 80 mg m(-3), with 2-band algorithms showing the best performance. However, when satellite-derived Rrs(lambda) data were used, none of the four algorithms was applicable to MODIS in this estuary, and only a 2-band algorithm in the form of Rrs(709)/Rrs(665) was applicable to MERIS, with other algorithms significantly degraded. The coefficients of the 2-band algorithm for MERIS were determined through regression between in situ Chla and MERIS-derived Rrs(709)/Rrs(665), with the final form of Chla = 10.55x(1.51). The algorithm yielded mean relative errors of 35.3% for Chla between 1.0 and 30.0 mg m(-3) when an in situ dataset from the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County (EPCHC) was used to tune the algorithm coefficients, which was further validated using another independent dataset. Spatial Chla patterns derived from MERIS for both low and high concentrations also showed reasonable agreement with in situ measurements. In contrast, 3-band and 4-band algorithms yielded significant patchiness in spatial patterns that differed from in situ measurements. Tests in Chesapeake Bay (located on the east coast of the U.S.A.) showed reasonable spatial patterns of Chla using the Rrs(709)/Rrs(665) approach, with a mean relative error of 34.7% for Chla ranging between 1.6 and 21.5 mg m(-3), suggesting that the approach may be generally applicable to other turbid estuaries once algorithm coefficients are adjusted using local data.

Potential PAR is incident photosynthetically active radiation under a condition of minimal atmospheric aerosol loading. This model was proposed for GPP estimation based entirely on satellite data, and it was tested in maize and soybean, which are contrasting crop types different in leaf structures and canopy architectures, under different crop managements and climatic conditions. The model using MODIS 250 m data, which brings high temporal resolution and moderate spatial resolution, was capable of estimating GPP accurately in both irrigated and rainfed croplands in three Nebraska AmeriFlux sites during growing seasons 2001 through 2008. Among the MODIS-250 m retrieved indices tested, enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI) were the most accurate for GPP estimation with coefficients of variation below 20% in maize and 25% in soybean. It was shown that the developed model was able to accurately detect GPP variation in crops where total chlorophyll content is closely tied to seasonal dynamic of GPP. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In this research an identification and correction procedure for systematic error is developed and used to evaluate the NOAA AVHRR long-term satellite data record produced by the Canada Center for Remote Sensing (CCRS). The record is composed of observations acquired by seven AVHRR sensors during the period 1985-2011. It includes two types of AVHRR sensor: AVHHR-2 flown onboard NOAA-9, -11, and -14, and AVHRR-3 onboard NOAA-16, -17, -18 and -19. Systematic error between sensors was identified through evaluation of synchronized nadir overpass (SNO) observations. The first order systematic error correction was derived from SNO comparison and then further optimized using a reference calibration target. Examination showed considerable difference between AVHRR-2 and AVHRR-3 measurements, which are largely attributed to differences in sensor design characteristics, uncertainty in sensor radiometric calibration, and imperfections in data processing. The results also show overall higher consistency between data from missions with AVHRR-3 than with AVHRR-2 sensors. The developed approach for correction of systematic error in time series was validated based on statistical analysis of eight independent pseudo-invariant targets not used for the initial correction development. Trends in these targets largely caused by the difference between AVHRR-2 and -3 sensors are shown to be removed or reduced after the correction was applied.

Not only data on habitat occurrence are needed, but also detailed information on the structural and functional characteristics of the habitat patches is crucial for an adequate conservation status assessment. Classification of hyperspectral remote sensing images performs well in discriminating dominant land cover and vegetation classes, but the accuracy drops significantly for the classification of more subtle differences in conservation status that are related to structural characteristics. This study proposes a method to facilitate ecological conservation status assessment based on decision tree modeling of subpixel fraction estimates steered by ecological expert knowledge. In particular, it contributes to the spatially explicit assessment of an important structural aspect of dry heathland vegetation, namely the heather age structure, using Airborne Hyperspectral line-Scanner radiometer (AHS-160) data of the Kalmthoutse Heide in northern Belgium. We implemented a subpixel unmixing approach to identify the percentage of heather, sand and shadow in each heather pixel, and subsequently applied a decision tree classification to allocate each pixel to a certain age class. As such, our method provides a tool that contributes to the information required for an appropriate management and successful conservation of natural heathlands. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Vertical profiles of LAI were derived at 0.3 m height intervals from the Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) data using the Geometric Optical and Radiative Transfer (GORT) model. Cumulative LAI profiles obtained from LVIS were validated with data from 55 ground to canopy vertical transects using a modular field tower to destructively sample all vegetation. Our results showed moderate agreement between lidar and field derived LAI (r(2) = 0.42, RMSE = 1.91, bias = -0.32), which further improved when differences between lidar and tower footprint scales (r(2) = 0.50, RMSE = 1.79, bias = 0.27) and distance of field tower from lidar footprint center (r(2) = 0.63, RMSE = 1.36, bias = 0.0) were accounted for. Next, we mapped the spatial distribution of total LAI across the landscape and analyzed LAI variations over different land cover types. Mean values of total LAI were 1.74, 5.20, 5.41 and 5.62 over open pasture, secondary forests, regeneration forests after selective-logging and old-growth forests respectively. Lastly, we evaluated the sensitivities of our LAI retrieval model to variations in canopy/ground reflectance ratio and to waveform noise such as induced by topographic slopes. We found for both, that the effects were not significant for moderate LAI values (about 4). However model derivations of LAI might be inaccurate in areas of high-slope and high LAI (about 8) if ground return energies are low. This research suggests that large footprint waveform lidar can provide accurate vertical LAI profile estimates that do not saturate even at the high LAI levels in tropical rain forests and may be a useful tool for understanding the light transmittance within these canopies.

These areas are important due to their role as wildlife habitats, the contributions they make to air and water quality and for human recreation. However, the intermingling of wildland and homes also increases the risk to life and property through wildfires. Management of this risk requires current and detailed knowledge of the spatial extent of wildland. What constitutes wildland vegetation is often difficult to define and may be influenced by both the horizontal continuity and vertical structure. We present a method to map wildland vegetation based on a combination of a vertically stratified cover threshold and spatial morphology.. To test its practical application, the method was applied to airborne lidar data collected prior to a major wildfire that occurred in Australia in 2009. Distance between the lidar defined wildland extent and homes impacted by the fire was assessed and compared to previously published data using manual delineation of wildland extent. Results showed that the proportion of homes destroyed at the wildland boundary was greater than reported in previous fires and that there was an exponential decline in the proportion of homes destroyed as a function of distances to wildland. Although the method is objective the extent of wildland depends on the parameters which define thresholds of cover and lateral extent and connectivity. This highlights the need for a clear definition of wildland that can be used to determine extent using objective methods such as those described, whether this is in the context of quantifying wildfire vulnerability or other related applications such as ecological assessment and monitoring.

The ALS waveform data were analyzed in three different ways; by summing the intensity of the waveforms in height intervals (a); by first normalizing the waveforms with an algorithm based on Beer-Lambert law to compensate for the shielding effect of higher vegetation layers on reflection from lower layers and then summing the intensity (b); and by deriving points from the waveforms (c). As a comparison, conventional, discrete return ALS point data from the laser scanning system were also analyzed (d). The study area was located in hemi-boreal, spruce dominated forest in the southwest of Sweden (Lat. 58 degrees N, Long. 13 degrees E). The vegetation volume profile was defined as the volume of all tree crowns and shrubs in 1 dm height intervals in a field plot and the total vegetation volume as the sum of the vegetation volume profile in the field plot. The total vegetation volume was estimated for 68 field plots with 12 m radius from the proportion between the amount of ALS reflections from the vegetation and the total amount of ALS reflections based on Beer-Lambert law. ALS profiles were derived from the distribution of the ALS data above the ground in 1 din height intervals. The ALS profiles were rescaled using the estimated total vegetation volume to derive the amount of vegetation at different heights above the ground. The root mean square error (RMSE) for cross validated regression estimates of the total vegetation volume was 31.9% for ALS waveform data (a), 27.6% for normalized waveform data (b), 29.1% for point data derived from the ALS waveforms (c), and 36.5% for ALS point data from the laser scanning system (d). The correspondence between the estimated vegetation volume profiles was also best for the normalized waveform data and the point data derived from the ALS waveforms and worst for ALS point data from the laser scanning system as demonstrated by the Reynolds error index. The results suggest that ALS waveform data describe the volumetric aspects of vertical vegetation structure somewhat more accurately than ALS point data from the laser scanning system and that compensation for the shielding effect of higher vegetation layers is useful. The new methods for estimation of vegetation volume profiles from ALS data could be used in the future to derive 3D models of the vegetation structure in large areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The laboratory emissivity spectra of thirteen common broad leaved species, comprising 3024 spectral bands in the MIR and TIR, were analyzed. For each wavelength the differences between the species were tested for significance using the one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the post-hoc Tukey HSD test. The emissivity spectra of the analyzed species were found to be statistically different at various wavebands. Subsequently, six spectral bands were selected (based on the histogram of separable pairs of species for each waveband) to quantify the separability between each species pair based on the Jefferies Matusita GM) distance. Out of 78 combinations, 76 pairs had a significantly different JM distance. This means that careful selection of hyperspectral bands in the MIR and TIR (2.5 mu m-14 mu m) results in reliable species discrimination. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

They are also used to monitor long-term changes in the climate. For these applications, and others, it is necessary to understand the uncertainties in the data. Near-coincident SST observations from the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and in situ platforms were used to understand the characteristics of errors in the measurements. The mean random error on the AATSR retrievals was found to be 0.14 K. The in situ errors were modelled as a constant offset plus a random error. For ships, the standard deviation of the constant offset was estimated to be 0.71 K and the mean random error was 0.74 K. For drifting buoys, the standard deviation of the constant offset was estimated to be 0.29 K and the mean random error was 0.26 K. These results suggest that there is a need to revisit current assessments of the adequacy of in situ observing systems. The trend in global-average SST between 1991 and 2007 calculated from in situ data was compared to its counterpart calculated from the ATSR instruments. The in situ record warms more slowly than the ATSR record, probably due to a decrease in the fraction of relatively warm-biassed ship observations contributing to the global-average SST over the period and a corresponding increase in the fraction of relatively unbiassed drifting buoy observations.

Taking the 196 km(2) Cottonwood Lake area in North Dakota as our pilot study site, we integrated PDSI. Landsat images, and aerial photography records to simulate monthly water surface. First, we developed a new Wetland Water Area Index (WWAI) from PDSI to predict water surface area. Second, we developed a water allocation model to simulate the spatial distribution of water bodies at a resolution of 30 m. Third, we used an additional procedure to model the small wetlands (less than 0.8 ha) that could not be detected by Landsat. Our results showed that i) WWAI was highly correlated with water area with an R-2 of 0.90, resulting in a simple regression prediction of monthly water area to capture the intra- and inter-annual water change from 1910 to 2009; ii) the spatial distribution of water bodies modeled from our approach agreed well with the water locations visually identified from the aerial photography records: and iii) the R-2 between our modeled water bodies (including both large and small wetlands) and those from aerial photography records could be up to 0.83 with a mean average error of 0.64 km(2) within the study area where the modeled wetland water areas ranged from about 2 to 14 km(2). These results indicate that our approach holds great potential to simulate major changes in wetland water surface for ecosystem service; however, our products could capture neither the short-term water change caused by intensive rainstorm events nor the wetland change caused by human activities.

Moderate resolution (30 m) lidar-based LAI estimates were aggregated to the resolution of the 1-km MODIS LAI product and compared to temporally-coincident MODIS retrievals. Differences in the MODIS and lidar-derived values of LAI were grouped and analyzed by several different factors, including MODIS retrieval algorithm, sun/sensor geometry, and sub-pixel heterogeneity in both vegetation and terrain characteristics. Of particular interest is the disparity in the results when MODIS LAI was analyzed according to algorithm retrieval class. We observed relatively good agreement between lidar-derived and MODIS LAI values for pixels retrieved with the main RT algorithm without saturation for LAI LAI Moreover, for the entire range of LAI values, considerable overestimation of LAI (relative to lidar-derived LA!) occurred when either the main RT with saturation or back-up algorithm retrievals were used to populate the composite product regardless of sub-pixel vegetation structural complexity or sun/sensor geometry. These results are significant because algorithm retrievals based on the main radiative transfer algorithm with or without saturation are characterized as suitable for validation and subsequent ecosystem modeling, yet the magnitude of difference appears to be specific to retrieval quality class and vegetation structural characteristics.

To understand changes and trends in terrestrial ecosystems and their functioning as carbon sources and sinks, and to characterize the impact of their changes on climate, habitat and biodiversity, new space assets are urgently needed to produce high spatial resolution global maps of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of vegetation, its biomass above ground, the carbon stored within and the implications for atmospheric green house gas concentrations and climate. These needs were articulated in a 2007 National Research Council (NRC) report (NRC, 2007) recommending a new satellite mission, DESDynI, carrying an L-band Polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (Pol-SAR) and a multi-beam lidar (light RAnging And Detection) operating at 1064 nm. The objectives of this paper are to articulate the importance of these new, multi-year, 3D vegetation structure and biomass measurements, to briefly review the feasibility of radar and lidar remote sensing technology to meet these requirements, to define the data products and measurement requirements, and to consider implications of mission durations. The paper addresses these objectives by synthesizing research results and other input from a broad community of terrestrial ecology, carbon cycle, and remote sensing scientists and working groups. We conclude that:   (1) Current global biomass and 3-D vegetation structure information is unsuitable for both science and management and policy. The only existing global datasets of biomass are approximations based on combining land cover type and representative carbon values, instead of measurements of actual biomass. Current measurement attempts based on radar and multispectral data have low explanatory power outside low biomass areas. There is no current capability for repeatable disturbance and regrowth estimates.   (2) The science and policy needs for information on vegetation 3D structure can be successfully addressed by a mission capable of producing (i) a first global inventory of forest biomass with a spatial resolution 1 km or finer and unprecedented accuracy (ii) annual global disturbance maps at a spatial resolution of 1 ha with subsequent biomass accumulation rates at resolutions of 1 km or finer, and (iii) transects of vertical and horizontal forest structure with 30 m along-transect measurements globally at 25 m spatial resolution, essential for habitat characterization.   We also show from the literature that lidar profile samples together with wall-to-wall L-band quad-pol-SAR imagery and ecosystem dynamics models can work together to satisfy these vegetation 3D structure and biomass measurement requirements. Finally we argue that the technology readiness levels of combined pol-SAR and lidar instruments are adequate for space flight. Remaining to be worked out, are the particulars of a lidar/pol-SAR mission design that is feasible and at a minimum satisfies the information and measurement requirement articulated herein.

Extraction by imagery snapshots and use of a crisp data model do not value the inherent uncertainties in space and time. This study addresses parameterization of a mixed Gaussian random set model in a multi-temporal analysis. The model is applied to monitor annual variation of wetland inundation extents from a series of Landsat TM images in 2004 and HJ images in 2009 on the Poyang Lake national nature reserve (PLNNR) in China. We use related indices to represent spatial uncertainties of inundated areas and to delineate the transition zone between wetland vegetation and open water. The PLNNR water regime is investigated by accumulating a series of random sets during one year and determining the water covering days (WCD) at the pixel level. Random sets provide detailed spatial configurations of the WCD which has a strong negative correlation with the underwater DEM. Comparing 2004 and 2009, the study shows that almost half of the PLNNR area experienced drought. We conclude that the mixed Gaussian random set model with three components presented in this study serves as a general method to parameterize the random set model for large datasets. Moreover, it is well suited to capture detailed information on spatial temporal dynamic of wetland inundation and contributes to our understanding of wetlands water regimes from multi-temporal images.

Recent advances in sensor technology allow remote measurements of the sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence signal (Fs) at leaf and canopy scale. The commonly used Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) principle exploits spectrally narrow atmospheric oxygen absorption bands and relates Fs to the difference of the absorption feature depth of a fluorescensing and a non-fluorescensing surface. However, due to the nature of these narrow bands. Fs retrieval results depend not only on vegetation species type or environmental conditions, but also on instrument technology and processing algorithms. Thus, an evaluation of all influencing factors and their separate quantification is required to further improve Fs retrieval and to allow a reproducible interpretation of Fs signals.   Here we present a modeling study that isolates and quantifies the impacts of sensor characteristics, such as spectral sampling interval (SSI), spectral resolution (SR), signal to noise ratio (SNR), and spectral shift (SS) on the accuracy of Fs measurements in the oxygen A band centered at 760 nm (O-2-A). Modeled high resolution radiance spectra associated with known Fs were spectrally resampled, taking into consideration the various sensor properties. Fs was retrieved using the three most common FLD retrieval methods, namely the original FLD method (sFLD), the modified FLD (3FLD) and the improved FLD (iFLD). The analysis investigates parameter ranges, which are representative for field and airborne instruments currently used in Fs research (e.g., ASD FieldSpec, OceanOptics HR, AirFLEX, AISA, APEX, CASI, and MERIS).   Our results show that the most important parameter affecting the retrieval accuracy is SNR, SR accounts for <= 40% of the error, the SSI for <= 12%, and SS for <= 7% of the error. A trade-off study revealed that high SR can partly compensate for low SNR. There is a strong interrelation between all parameters and the impact of specific parameters can compensate or amplify the influence of others. Hence, the combination of all parameters must be considered by the evaluation of sensors and their potential for Fs retrieval. In general, the standard FLD method strongly overestimates Fs, while 3FLD and iFLD provide a more accurate estimation of Fs. We conclude that technical sensor specifications and the retrieval methods cause a significant variability in retrieved Fs signals. Results are intended to be one relevant component of the total uncertainty budget of Fs retrieval and have to be considered in the interpretation of retrieved Fs signals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Thirty-eight satellite scenes (ERS SAR), taken from May 1992 to January 2001, were analysed for detecting more than 2 million PS on the study area. Continuous velocity surface maps (Iso-Kinematic Maps: IKM) were obtained from geo-statistical and spatial cluster techniques (Hot Spot analysis) of PS \"short-period\" data, to identify relative ground motions and to compare them with \"long-period\" tectonic mobility trends, i.e. those inferred at regional scale over geological times (some million years).   The comparison was made by individuation of homogeneous kinematic areas, represented in the IKM, and characterization of the boundaries between them (Iso-Kinematic Boundaries: IKB). The IKB were used as tools to asses if the PS-InSAR data on present-day crustal mobility could fit with the distribution of real tectonic structures or field geological elements.   IKM were drawn for uplifting geological sectors of Piemonte (Maritime Alps, Gran Paradiso, Langhe) where moderate to very low seismicity is recorded, and gravitational instabilities of rock mass on mountain slopes are widespread. The land sectors have been chosen in order to test the suitability of IKM in very different geomorphological conditions.   Different types of correspondence between the IKM and the geological kinematic trend were found:   a first type in which the kinematic trend of short-period (a decade of years, i.e. the PS-InSAR detection time span) is in agreement with a long-period tectonic trend (some million years) and seem to be driven by well known faults subparallel to the IKB. These kinematic trends can be hidden by the slope movement due to gravitational instabilities;   a second type in which the kinematic trend of short-period does not strictly correspond to the long-period trend, but can be considered as minor-order, uplifting-subsidence cycles, even if in contrast with the long-period kinematic trend. Alternatively, the short-period kinematic trends could reflect the action of deep-seated geological forces or structures, not yet known or inferable (at least with the recorded PS-InSAR velocities) on the basis of the available geological data and models.

Recently, a variety of bio-optical and ecological methods have been established that use satellite data to identify and differentiate between either phytoplankton functional types (PFTs) or phytoplankton size classes (PSCs). In this study, several of these techniques were evaluated against in situ observations to determine their ability to detect dominant phytoplankton size classes (micro-, nano- and picoplankton). The techniques are applied to a 10-year ocean-colour data series from the SeaWiFS satellite sensor and compared with in situ data (6504 samples) from a variety of locations in the global ocean. Results show that spectral-response, ecological and abundance-based approaches can all perform with similar accuracy. Detection of microplankton and picoplankton were generally better than detection of nanoplankton. Abundance-based approaches were shown to provide better spatial retrieval of PSCs. Individual model performance varied according to PSC, input satellite data sources and in situ validation data types. Uncertainty in the comparison procedure and data sources was considered. Improved availability of in situ observations would aid ongoing research in this field. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Brewin, Robert J.

We sought to identify ecologically-relevant broad-scale indicators of heat waves based on MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and interpolated air temperature data and assess their associations with avian community structure. Specifically, we asked which data source, time periods, and heat wave indices best predicted changes in avian abundance and species richness. Using mixed effects models, we analyzed associations between these indices and data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey in the central United States between 2000 and 2007 in four ecoregions and five migratory and nesting species groups. We then quantified avian responses to scenarios of severe, but commonly-occurring early, late, and summer-long heat waves. Indices based on MODIS LST data, rather than interpolated air temperatures, were more predictive of avian community structure. Avian communities were more related to 8-day LST exceedances (positive anomalies only); and were generally more sensitive to summer-long heat waves. Across the region, abundance, and to a lesser extent, species richness, declined following heat waves. Among the ecoregions, relationships were most consistently negative in the southern and montane ecoregions, but were positive in a more humid northern ecoregion. Among migratory groups, permanent resident species were the most sensitive, declining in abundance following a summer-long heat wave by 19% and 13% in the montane and southern ecoregions, respectively. Ground-nesting species, which declined in the south by 12% following a late summer heat wave, were more sensitive than avifauna overall. These results demonstrate the value of MODIS LST data for measuring ecologically-relevant heat waves across large regions. Ecologically, these findings highlight the importance of extreme events for avian biodiversity and the considerable variation in response to environmental change associated with different functional groups and geographic regions. The magnitude of the relationships between avian abundance and heat waves reported here raises concerns about the impacts of more frequent and severe heat waves in a warming climate.

The two repeat-track methods yield similar results and compare well to the more accurate, but sparsely sampled, crossover points. Most glacier regions in Svalbard have experienced low-elevation thinning combined with high-elevation balance or thickening during 2003-2008. The geodetic mass balance (excluding calving front retreat or advance) of Svalbard\'s 34,600 km(2) glaciers is estimated to be -4.3 +/- 1.4 Gt y(-1), corresponding to an area-averaged water equivalent (we.) balance of -0.12 +/- 0.04 m w.e. y(-1). The largest ice losses have occurred in the west and south, while northeastern Spitsbergen and the Austfonna ice cap have gained mass. Winter and summer elevation changes derived from the same methods indicate that the spatial gradient in mass balance is mainly due to a larger summer season thinning in the west and the south than in the northeast. Our findings are consistent with in-situ mass balance measurements from the same period, confirming that repeat-track satellite altimetry can be a valuable tool for monitoring short term elevation changes of Arctic glaciers.

The presence of speckle necessitates aggregating backscatter measurements over large (>100 m x 100 m) land areas in order to derive reliable soil moisture information from imagery, and a model calibrated to such aggregated information can only provide estimates of soil moisture at spatial resolutions required for reliable speckle accounting. A method utilizing the likelihood formulation of a probabilistic speckle model as the calibration objective function is proposed which will allow for calibrating land surface models directly to radar backscatter intensity measurements in a way which simultaneously accounts for model parameter- and speckle-induced uncertainty. The method is demonstrated using the NOAH land surface model and Advanced Integral Equation Method (AIEM) backscatter model calibrated to SAR imagery of an area in the Southwestern United States, and validated against in situ soil moisture measurements. At spatial resolutions finer than 100 m x 100 m NOAH and AIEM calibrated using the proposed radar intensity likelihood parameter estimation algorithm predict surface level soil moisture to within 4% volumetric water content 95% of the time, which is an improvement over a 95% prediction confidence of 10% volumetric water content by the same models calibrated directly to soil moisture information derived from synthetic aperture radar imagery at the same scales. Results suggest that much of this improvement is due to increased ability to simultaneously estimate NOAH parameters and AIEM surface roughness parameters. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We compare Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-based albedo retrievals to data from the Greenland Climate Network (GCN) weather stations and the floating ice station Tara for polar summer 2007. The AVHRR dataset consists of 2755 overpasses. The overpasses are matched to in situ observations spatially and temporally. The SAL algorithm presented here derives the surface broadband albedo from AVHRR channels 1 and 2 using an atmospheric correction, temporal sampling of an empirical Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), and a narrow-to-broadband conversion algorithm. The satellite product contains algorithms for snow, sea ice, vegetation, bare soil, and water albedo. At the Summit and DYE-2 stations on the Greenland ice sheet, instantaneous SAL RMSE is 0.073. The heterogeneous surface conditions at satellite pixel scale over the stations near the Greenland west coast increase RMSE to >0.12. Over Tara, the instantaneous SAL RMSE is 0.069. The BRDF sampling approach reduces RMSE over the ice sheet to 0.053, and to 0.045 over Tara. Taking into account various sources of uncertainty for both satellite retrievals and in situ observations, we conclude that SAL agrees with in situ observations within their limits of accuracy and spatial representativeness.

The continuous spatial character of such datasets provides an incredible source of information at the landscape level for ecosystem research, policy analysis, and planning applications, all of which are critical for addressing current challenges related to climate change, urbanization pressures, and data requirements for monitoring carbon sequestration. However, the effectiveness of these applications is dependent upon the accuracy of the geospatial input datasets. A comprehensive set of robust measures is necessary to provide sufficient information to effectively assess the accuracy of these modeled geospatial datasets being produced. Yet challenges in the availability of reference data, in the appropriateness of assessment methods to dataset use, and in the completeness of assessment methods available have continued to hamper the timely and consistent application of map assessments. In this study we present a suite of assessments that can be used to characterize the accuracy of geospatial datasets of modeled continuous variables an increasingly common format for modeling such attributes as proportion or probability of forestland as well as more traditionally continuous attributes such as leaf area index and forest biomass. It is a comparative accuracy assessment, in which each modeled dataset is compared to a set of reference data, recognizing both the potential for error in reference data, and probable differences in spatial support between the datasets. When used together, this proposed suite of assessments provides essential information on the type, magnitude, frequency and location of errors in each dataset. The assessments presented depend upon reference data with large sample sizes. The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database is introduced as an available reference dataset of sufficient sampling intensity to take full advantage of these assessments and facilitate their prompt application after modeled datasets are developed. We illustrate the application of this suite of assessments with two modeled datasets of forest biomass, in Minnesota and New York. The information provided by this suite of assessments substantially improves a user\'s ability to apply modeled geospatial datasets effectively and to assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of multiple datasets depicting the same forest characteristic.

Therefore, many earth-system science and operational monitoring applications require access to repetitive, frequent and well-characterized information on fire emissions source strengths. Geostationary imagers offer important temporal advantages when studying rapidly changing phenomena such as vegetation fires Here we present a new algorithm for detecting and characterising active fires burning within the imager footprints of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), including consideration of cloud-cover and calculation of fire radiative power (FRP), a metric shown to be strongly related to fuel consumption and smoke emission rates The approach is based on a set of algorithms now delivering near real time (NRT) operational FRP products from the Meteosat Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager (SEVIRI) imager (available from http://landsaf meteo pt/), and the GOES processing chain presented here is designed to deliver a compatible fire product to complete geostationary coverage of the Western hemisphere. Results from the two GOES imagers are intercompared, and are independently verified against the well regarded MODIS cloud mask and active fire products We find that the detection of cloud and active fires from GOES matches that of MODIS very well for fire pixels having FRP > 30 MW, when the GOES omission error falls to less than 10% The FRP of fire clusters detected near simultaneously by both GOES and MODIS have a bias of only 22 MW, and a similar bias is found when comparing near-simultaneous GOES East and GOES West FRP observations However, many fire pixels having FRP < 30 MW remain undetected by GOES, probably unavoidably since It has a much coarser spatial resolution than MODIS. Adjustment using data from the less frequent but more accurate views obtained from high spatial resolution polar orbiting imagers could be used to bias correct regional FRP totals. Temporal integration of the GOES FRP record indicates that during the summer months, biomass burning combusts thousands of millions of tonnes of fuel daily across the Americas. Comparison of these results to those of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFEDv2) indicate strong linear relationships (r(2) > 0.9), suggesting that the timely FRP data available from a GOES real-time data feed is likely to be a suitable fire emissions source strength term for inclusion in schemes aiming to forecast the concentrations of atmospheric constituents affected by biomass burning.

Mapping accuracy can be improved by combining advanced RS image-processing techniques with microhabitat data expressed as a structural complexity index (SCI). To test this idea, we used principal components analysis (PCA) and an additive SCI method developed for forest ecology (calculated by re-scaling and summing representative structural variables) to summarize 13 microhabitat-scale (0.04 ha) vegetation structure attributes describing the rare mountain bongo antelope\'s (Tragelaphus eurycerus isaaci) habitat in Kenya\'s Aberdare mountains. Microhabitat data were collected in 127 plots: 37 related to bongo habitat use, 90 from 1 km-spaced grid points representing overall habitat availability and bongo non-presence. We then assessed each SCI\'s effectiveness for discerning microhabitat variability and bongo habitat selection, using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests for differences in mean SCI scores among plots divided into 4 vegetation classes, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics from logistic regressions. We also examined the accuracy of predicted SCI scores resulting from regression models based on variables derived from a) ASTER imagery processed with spectral mixture and texture analysis, b) an SRTM DEM and c) rainfall data, using the 90 grid plots for model training and the bongo plots as an independent test dataset. Of the five SCIs derived, two performed best: the PCA-derived Canopy Structure Index (CSI) and an additive index summarizing 8 structural variables (AI(8)). CSI and AI(8) showed significant differences between 5 of 6 vegetation class pairs, strong abilities to distinguish bongo-selected from available habitat (AUCs=0.71 (CSI); 0.70 (AI(8))), and predicted scores 60-110% more accurate than reported by other studies using RS to quantify individual microhabitat structural attributes (CSI model R(2)=0.51, RMSE=0.19 (training) and 0.21 (test); AI(8) model R(2)=0.46, RMSE=0.17 (training) and 0.19 (test)). Repeating the Wilcoxon tests and logistic regressions with RS-predicted SCI values showed that AI(8) most effectively preserved the patterns found with the observed SCIs. These results demonstrate that SCIs effectively characterize microhabitat structure and selection, and boost microhabitat mapping accuracy when combined with enhanced RS image-processing techniques. This approach can improve distribution models and broaden their applicability, makes RS more relevant to applied ecology, and shows that processing field data to be more compatible with RS can improve RS-based habitat mapping accuracy.

Temporal trajectories of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) were extracted to examine temporal variation of WSG and CSG grasslands in a growth cycle. It was found that the spring-summer period revealed maximal spectral differences between these two grass types. CSG reached peak NDVI in May while WSG tended to have peak NDMI in July. NDVI was more useful than NDMI in summer-fall. The NDVI trends in this period varied with both phenology and grassland treatments such as haying and grazing, which provided additional information in WSG/CSG delineation. A hierarchical decision tree was developed to delineate WSG and CSG grasslands in a 3-tier process. The WSG lands including those publically conserved prairies were identified in the lower Osage Plain in southwest Missouri. The accuracies were about 80% and could be improved with more frequent satellite observations. The trajectory-based decision tree in this study provides a robust approach of long-term WSG/CSG mapping. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Compensation for this paucity of information may be obtained by using satellite-based methods. However, the derivation of near surface air temperature (Ta), from the land surface temperature (Ts) derived from satellite is far from straight forward. Some studies have tried to derive maximum Ta from satellites through regression analysis but the accuracy obtained is quite variable according to the study.

First, comparisons between night MODIS Ts data with minimum Ta showed that MODIS nighttime products provide a good estimation of minimum Ta over different ecosystems (with (Delta Ts - Ta) centered at 0 degrees C, a mean absolute error (MAE) = 1.73 degrees C and a standard deviation = 2.4 degrees C). Secondly, comparisons between day MODIS Ts data with maximum Ta showed that (Delta Ts - Ta) strongly varies according to the seasonality, the ecosystems, the solar radiation, and cloud-cover. Two factors proposed in the literature to retrieve maximum Ta from Ts, i.e. the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Solar Zenith Angle (SZA), were analyzed. No strong relationship between (Delta Ts - Ta) and (i) NDVI and (ii) SZA was observed, therefore requiring further research on robust methods to retrieve maximum Ta. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However, due to their small size and the quantised nature of remote sensing imagery they may be under-represented in the landscape when mapped using earth observation. This paper investigates the effect of patch area and patch elongation on the accurate mapping of these vegetation patches. Using synthetic images to simulate sub-pixel patch location, we investigated classification accuracy and extraction probability resulting from differences in the geometric properties of the raster grid and the feature alone. We simulated the effect of grid position, detectability, feature size and shape on classification. This represents the highest achievable accuracy using the remote sensing raster grid, where other factors influencing classification such as classification algorithm, radiometric calibration and sensor characteristics are excluded. We found that mapping error was highest when the scale of the feature and the raster grid coincided. We showed that the spatial resolution of the grid should be many times finer in order to extract these features accurately. For square patches with a mean classification accuracy of 75%, the grid pixel area was 11 times smaller than patch size. When patches were small and/or elongated, the probability of extraction was reduced, mapping accuracies decreased and variability in accuracy due to the effects of grid position increased. For example, a square shaped patch needed an area of at least 11 pixels to achieve a mean accuracy of 75%, whilst a linear patch with a width to length ratio of 4 needed an area of 12.3 pixels. This paper quantifies the limitations of remote sensing for the accurate detection of small and linear features and provides guidelines on the appropriate spatial resolution required to map these features. Using our results, map users can estimate the probability of a map classifying small and linear features independently of the error matrix. Furthermore, we provide a more precise estimate of the size of the smallest discernable feature taking into account the random position of the remote sensing grid with respect to the feature as well as its shape. An understanding of this phenomenon is critical for making good land management decisions based on a thorough understanding of the limitations of remote sensing data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The new algorithm is based on separating the reflected signal into a linear (first-order) and non-linear (diffuse) reflectance component. A limitation of the proposed algorithm is that the leaf single-scattering albedo omega(lambda) is retrieved with an accuracy of a structural parameter (called a) which, in turn, depends on canopy bidirectional gap probability. ratio of leaf reflectance to transmittance, and distribution of leaf normals. The structural parameter (a(0)) was found to depend on tree-level structural parameters, such as tree height and volume of a single crown, but not the amount of leaf area. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The VUA-NASA AMSR-E near-surface soil moisture product has been compared to in-situ soil moisture data from 12 locations in the Murrumbidgee and Goulburn Monitoring Networks, both in southeast Australia. Temporally, the AMSR-E soil moisture has a strong association to ground-based soil moisture data, with typical correlations of greater than 0.8 and typical RMSD less than 0.03 vol/vol (for a normalized and filtered AMSR-E timeseries). Continental-scale spatial patterns in the VUA-NASA AMSR-E soil moisture have also been visually examined by comparison to spatial rainfall data. The AMSR-E soil moisture has a strong correspondence to precipitation data across Australia: in the short term, maps of the daily soil moisture anomaly show a clear response to precipitation events, and in the longer term, maps of the annual average soil moisture show the expected strong correspondence to annual average precipitation.

We used Landsat imagery from 1976, 1987, 1999 and 2006 to map the extent of surface mines and mine reclamation for eight large watersheds in the Central Appalachian region of West Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania. We employed standard image processing techniques in conjunction with a temporal decision tree and GIS maps of mine permits and wetlands to map active and reclaimed mines and track changes through time. For the entire study area, active surface mine extent was highest in 1976, prior to implementation of the Surface Mine Control and Reclamation Act in 1977, with 1.76% of the study area in active mines, declining to 0.44% in 2006. The most extensively mined watershed, Georges Creek in Maryland, was 5.45% active mines in 1976, declining to 1.83% in 2006. For the entire study area, the area of reclaimed mines increased from 1.35% to 4.99% from 1976 to 2006, and from 4.71% to 15.42% in Georges Creek. Land cover conversion to mines and then reclaimed mines after 1976 was almost exclusively from forest. Accuracy levels for mined and reclaimed cover was above 85% for all time periods, and was generally above 80% for mapping active and reclaimed mines separately, especially for the later time periods in which good accuracy assessment data were available. Among other implications, the mapped patterns of LCLUC are likely to significantly affect watershed hydrology, as mined and reclaimed areas have lower infiltration capacity and thus more rapid runoff than unmined forest watersheds, leading to greater potential for extreme flooding during heavy rainfall events.

In addition to field surveys that can be spatially limited, remote sensing can provide a synoptic view of the changes occurring on coral reef habitats. Here, we utilize an 18-year time series of Landsat 5/TM and 7/ETM+ images to assess changes in eight coral reef sites in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, namely Carysfort Reef, Grecian Rocks, Molasses Reef, Conch Reef, Sombrero Reef, Looe Key Reef, Western Sambo and Sand Key Reef. Twenty-eight Landsat images (1984-2002) were used, with imagery gathered every 2 years during spring, and every 6 years during fall. The image dataset was georectified, calibrated to remote sensing reflectance and corrected for atmospheric and water-column effects. A Mahalanobis distance classification was trained for four habitat classes (\'coral\', \'sand\', \'bare hardbottom\' and \'covered hardbottom\') using in situ ground-truthing data collected in 2003-2004 and using the spectral statistics from a 2002 image. The red band was considered useful only for benthic habitats in depths less than 6 m. Overall mean coral habitat loss for all sites classified by Landsat was 61% (3.4%/year), from a percentage habitat cover of 19% (1984) down to 7.6% (2002). The classification results for the eight different sites were critically reviewed. A detailed pixel by pixel examination of the spatial patterns across time suggests that the results range from ecologically plausible to unreliable due to spatial inconsistencies and/or improbable ecological successions. In situ monitoring data acquired by the Coral Reef Evaluation and Monitoring Project (CREMP) for the eight reef sites between 1996 and 2002 showed a loss in coral cover of 52% (8.7%/year), whereas the Landsat-derived coral habitat areas decreased by 37% (6.2%/year). A direct trend comparison between the entire CREMP percent coral cover data set (1996-2004) and the entire Landsat-derived coral habitat areas showed no significant difference between the two time series (ANCOVA; F-test, p = 0.303, n = 32), despite the different scales of measurements.

This paper presents a new approach using Self Organizing Map (SOM) as unsupervised algorithm of artificial neural networks for analysis and characterization of yardangs.   Nowadays, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) with 3 arc sec data (approximately 90 m resolution) and nearly world wide coverage provides uniform good quality data.   The SRTM 3 arc sec data were re-projected to a 90 m UTM grid. Bivariate quadratic surfaces with moving window size of 5 x 5 were fitted to this DEM. The first derivative, slope steepness and the second derivatives minimum, maximum curvature and cross-sectional curvatures were calculated as geomorphometric parameters used as input to the SOMs. 42 SOMs with different learning parameter settings, e.g. initial and final radius, number of iterations, and the effect of random initial weights on average quantization error were investigated. A SOM with a low average quantization error (0.1040) was used for further analysis. Feature space analysis, morphometric signatures, three-dimensional inspection, auxiliary data like Landsat ETM+ and high resolution satellite imagery from QuickBird facilitated the assignment of semantic meaning to the output classes in terms of geomorphometric features. Results are provided in a geographic information system as thematic maps of landform entities based on form and slope, e.g. yardangs (ridge), corridors (valley) or planar areas.   The results showed that all yardangs and corridors were clearly recognized and classified by this method when their width was larger than the DEM resolution but became unrecognizable if their width is much smaller than the grid resolution. The identified yardangs and corridors are aligned NNW-SSE parallel to the prevailing direction of the strong local 120 days wind and cover about 31% and 42% of the study area respectively. The results demonstrate that SOM is a very efficient tool for analyzing aeolian landforms in hyper-arid environments that provides very useful information for terrain feature analysis in remote regions.

LiDAR information potential is made even greater though, with its consideration of intensity. Elevation and intensity airborne LiDAR data are used in this study in order to classify forest and ground types quickly and efficiently without the need for manipulating multispectral image files, using a supervised object-orientated approach. LiDAR has the advantage of being able to create elevation surfaces that are in 3D, while also having information on LiDAR intensity values, thus it is a spatial and spectral segmentation tool. This classification method also uses point distribution frequency criteria to differentiate between land cover types. Classifications were performed using two methods, one that included the influence of the ground in heavily vegetated areas, and the other which eliminated the ground points before classification. The classification of three meanders of the Garonne and Allier rivers in France has demonstrated overall classification accuracies of 95% and 94% for the methods including and excluding the ground influence respectively. Five types of riparian forest were classified with accuracies between 66 and 98%. These forest types included planted and natural forest stands of different ages. Classifications of short vegetation and bare earth also produced high accuracies averaging above 90%. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Antonarakis, A. S.; Richards, K.

The analysis of the time series, compared to a detailed geological and geotechnical investigation of the lithostratigraphy of the alluvial sediments of the Tiber River, and combined with a temporal reconstruction of the expansion of the city over the alluvial valleys, allowed us to depict the main factors controlling the observed subsidence. These are: the in situ effective stress conditions, the related compressibility and viscous characteristics of the loaded soils, the thickness of the compressible stratum, the time since loading instant, and the entity of loading. Furthermore the observed subsidence is time-dependent, even at a long time-scale, with respect to the age of the buildings being most of the buildings constructed since the \'50s still affected by slow subsidence. We mainly focused on the Grottaperfetta stream valley that is characterized by an anomalous high and time-lasting subsidence. Original data on the lithostratigraphic setting of this alluvial valley indicate that the high subsidence rate measured up to 2005 is caused by a still active primary consolidation process.

As with any other optical wavelength satellite sensor, cloud contamination greatly compromises image usability for land surface studies. Additionally, selective scene acquisition due to payload, ground station and mission cost constraints further reduces Landsat image availability. Since the 1999 launch of the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) a Longterm Acquisition Plan (LTAP) has been used to anticipate user requests with the goal of annually refreshing a global daytime archive of cloud-free ETM+ data. This research evaluates the availability of cloud-free Landsat ETM+ data over the conterminous U.S. and globally using 3 years of ETM+ cloud fraction metadata archived by the U.S. Landsat project. Landsat application requirements including obtaining at least one cloud-free observation in a year, a season, and two different seasons, or at least a pair of cloud-free observations occurring no more than 16, 32, 48, 64, and 80 days apart within a year and season are considered. Probabilistic analyses indicate that over the conterminous U.S., land applications requiring at least one cloud-free observation in a year, a season, two different seasons, or at least two cloud-free observations occurring within any period of the year, are on average largely unaffected by cloud cover, except for certain Winter applications and cloudy scenes near the U. S. Canada border and the Great Lakes. Cloud becomes a constraint when at least two cloud-free observations are required from the same season over the conterminous U.S., especially when the separation between observations is restricted to short time intervals. Global applications requiring at least one cloud-free observation in a season, in two different seasons, and applications requiring at least two cloud-free observations in a year, are all severely affected by cloud and data availability constraints; and globally it is generally not practical to consider land applications that require at least two cloud-free observations in any season. Globally, only land applications requiring at least one cloud-free observation per year are largely unaffected by cloud cover and the reduced global ETM+ data availability. These results are specific only to the U.S. Landsat ETM+ archive; they suggest the need for an increased global Landsat acquisition rate for the current and future Landsat missions and/or the development of new approaches to mitigating cloud contamination in the U.S. global Landsat ETM+ archive.

In each test, foliage mass and crown radius for trees in the sample plots were predicted with a particular pair of allometric regression models. The forest reflectance model was then run using the estimated foliage mass and crown radius values. Reflectance factors were simulated and compared with the reflectance values obtained from three atmospherically corrected Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) scenes. The statistics of linear regression between the simulated and measured reflectance factors were used to assess the performance of foliage and crown radius models. The hypothesis was that the best allometric regression models should provide the best fit in reflectance. The strongest correlation between the simulated and measured reflectance factors was found in the short-wave infrared band (ETM+5) for all the images. The highest R-2 =0.71 was observed in Picea abies dominated stands. No excellent combination of foliage mass and crown radius functions was found, but the ranking based on determination coefficients showed that some linear crown radius models are not applicable to our data. Processing of raster images, reflectance measurement for small sample plots, usage of tree-species-specific fixed parameters (specific leaf area, etc.), and the ignored influence of phenology introduced additional variation into the relationships between simulated and measured reflectance factors. Further studies are needed, but these preliminary results demonstrate that the proposed method could serve as an effective way of testing the performance of foliage mass and canopy cover regressions.

Nonetheless, the concept has been shown to be a useful tool for incorporating the effects of 3D structure on canopy absorptive and reflective properties in forest reflectance models. A method is presented by which an average value of the canopy recollision probability ((p) over cap) can be calculated from canopy gap fraction data, which are provided for example by the LAI-2000 plant canopy analyzer or can be extracted from fisheye photographs. The new method was used to calculate the average recollision probabilities ((p) over cap values) of uniform leaf and shoot canopies, showing good agreement with results from Monte Carlo simulations. Strengths of the method presented here are the explicitly formulated relationship between recollision probability and canopy structure, and its direct applicability in canopy RT studies.

The surveyed areas contain four different reef morphologies, the distribution of which depends on water depth and distance from the shoreline. These four reef types also have different coral densities and colony morphologies (branching or mixed massive/branching). Textural analysis, based on first order statistics, unsupervised cluster analysis and Mann-Whitney U-tests, showed a correlation between recorded backscatter response and reef type that is attributed to the link between community composition and rugosity on a millimetre to tens of metre scale. Branching coral colonies are found to be relatively good scatterers of acoustic energy, and result in a broad intermediate to high intensity response. Massive coral colonies and reefs with a hard carbonate pavement are found to be principally reflectors of the acoustic energy, resulting in a narrow low intensity response. Comparison of the two surveys separated in time by two years, showed seabed texture to change most significantly over the reef areas that contained the highest coral abundances and mortality rates. In particular, the disintegration of dense branching colonies that suffered almost 100% mortality during the bleaching event resulted in a characteristic loss of intermediate to high backscatter intensity. The work demonstrates the contribution that side-scan sonar could make in the assessment of loss of rugosity following a bleaching episode, which has important implications to both the recovery of the reef itself and the abundance and distribution of associated reef organisms.

We analyzed the physical relationship between surface reflectance and live fuel moisture content using simulated MODIS measurements of diverse leaf samples, derived approximate inversion models, and proposed a semi-physical approach for live fuel moisture retrieval employing multiple MODIS bands. Using simulated MODIS measurements, the correlation coefficients between the true LFMC and estimated LFMC with our inversion models are 0.7738, 0.8397, 0.9560 and 0.9576 respectively. For validation, we tested our inversion method with woody live fuel moisture measurements at fire weather stations in Georgia.

The analysis of the satellite data from 2001 to 2004 showed that agricultural burning in the southeastern United States accounted for an average of 16% of annual fire activity. The southeastern region contributed an average of 33% of all agricultural burning detected in the contiguous United States. Crop residues that burned in the southeast included rice, winter wheat, sugarcane, soybean and cotton. Much of the agricultural burning occurred in June and from October to January and was related to the harvest of winter wheat and rice in the spring and the harvest of sugarcane, soybean and cotton in the fall and winter. The results showed that cropland burning was spatially dependent on crop type and temporally dependent on management practices (planting harvesting). Arkansas, Florida, and Louisiana contributed more than 75% of all agricultural burning in the southeast.

The difference between MODIS and MISR cloud-top heights is assessed in situations where multiple cloud layers are present in a vertical column (i.e., cloud overlap or multilayered cloud). MISR stereo cloud-top heights are known to be sensitive to low-level clouds of high contrast (between two camera views) even if high clouds with a wide range of optical thicknesses are also present in the scene. MODIS retrieved cloud-top heights do not experience this problem as long as the highest cloud layer has a visible optical thickness greater than approximately 1. Consequently, the difference in cloud-top heights between MODIS and MISR is often large and positive in cloud overlap conditions. In cloud overlap conditions, small differences between MODIS and MISR cloud-top heights can be found where both instruments detect the highest cloud layer or, on the contrary, where they both fail to detect the highest cloud but instead detect some lower level cloud. The comparison with radar cloud-top heights on a 2 1 -scene subset confirmed that large differences are associated with cloud overlap, but also showed that small differences can be found in similar situations if the highest layer is of large contrast (both instruments detect the highest cloud layer) or of extremely small optical thickness (both instruments fail to detect the highest cloud layer). With the use of a cloud-typing technique applied to MODIS data that can also identify areas containing cloud overlap, small differences were found to occur for 60-70% of all overlap pixels examined here, highlighting the weakness of using the MODIS-MISR cloud-top height differences as a sole indicator for automated cloud overlap detection. While the accuracy of the MODIS cloud-top pressure/height algorithm decreases as the cirrus optical thickness becomes less than 1, the MISR approach may still be able to infer an accurate cloud-top height depending on the cloud contrast between two view angles. However, synergy between the difference in MODIS-MISR cloud-top height analysis and the MODIS cloudtyping method could improve overlap detection for thin cirrus over low cloud situations and provide additional information on the cloud-top height of two distinct layers.

Since natural gas is invisible, changes in the vegetation could potentially indicate gas leakage. Although it is known that gas in soil affects plant reflectance, the relationship between natural gas and the development and reflectance properties of plants has not been studied. The objective of this study was to test whether natural gas and its two main components, methane and ethane, affect vegetation reflectance in the chlorophyll and water absorption regions. An experiment was carried out in which maize (Zea mays) plants were grown in pots that were flushed with 10 1 of gas per day for 39 4 days. Leaf reflectance was measured once a week with a spectrophotometer. The reflectance was analysed using continuum removal of the blue (400-550 nm), red (550-750 nm) and two water absorption features (1370-1570 nm and 1870-2170 nm), after which the band depths and normalized band depths were analyzed for each treatment. The band depth analysis showed that ethane caused an initial increase of 10% in reflectance between 560 and 590 nm, followed by a decrease during the course of the experiment. Normalized band depth analysis showed that ethane caused a reflectance shift of I to 5 nm towards longer wavelengths compared to the control reflectance in the visible region. All gases caused an increase in reflectance in the water absorption bands. The physiological reflectance index, PRI, which has previously linked water stress to photosynthetic activity, suggested that the hydrocarbon gases (particularly ethane) decreased the photosynthetic activity of the plants. The combination of reduced band depths in the chlorophyll and water absorption regions and the increased PRI suggests that ethane gas in the soil hampered a normal water uptake by maize plants in an early stage of their growth. Although further research is necessary to upscale the results from the laboratory to the field, the increased reflectance in the 560-590 nm region caused by ethane together with the increased PRI are promising indicators for gas leakage.

Climatic relationships appear best defined at regional rather than local levels. In reference to tree diversity, process-based models that express gross primary production (GPP) as an integrated function of climate seem most appropriate. Since 2000, NASA\'s MODIS satellite has provided composite data at 16-day intervals to produce estimates of GPP that compare well with direct measurements. The MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI), which is independent of climatic drivers, also appears a good surrogate to estimate seasonal patterns in GPP. In this paper we identified 65 out of 84 delineated ecoregions distributed across the contiguous U.S.A., within which sufficient (>= 200) Federal Inventory and Analysis survey plots were available to predict the total number of tree species, which varied from 17 to 164. Four different formulations of EVI were compared: The annual maximum, the annual integrated, the growing season defined mid-point and growing season averaged values. The growing season mid-point EVI defined the beginning and end of the active growing season. In all formulations of EVI, a polynomial function accounted for about 60% of the observed variation in tree diversity, with additional precision increasing to 80% when highly fragmented ecoregions with < 50% forest cover were excluded. Maps comparing predicted with measured tree richness values show similar patterns except in the Pacific Northwest region where a major extinction of tree genera is known to have occurred during the late Pliocene. The extent that these relationships remain stable under a changing climate can be evaluated by determining if the MODIS climate-driven estimate of GPP continues to match well with EVI patterns and systematic resurveys of forest vegetation indicate that tree species are able to adjust rapidly to climatic variation.

Most remote sensing research has been conducted on conifer crop tree detection and assessment using imagery acquired in deciduous leaf-off conditions. Some research on competition assessment has been conducted using leaf-on imagery, but it is too costly and time consuming to require both leaf-off and leaf-on image acquisition and analysis for complete regeneration assessment. This paper evaluates the potential of automated methods for assessment of woody stem competition using very high-resolution (2 cm) leaf-off imagery. The intent is to couple the competition-evaluation methods with previously developed leaf-off conifer assessment methods. The automated method combined texture analysis, classification, and line detection. Results show that competition measures extracted from the processed imagery agreed well with estimates derived from both manual competition interpretation and field measurements. Manual estimates slightly outperformed automated extraction when compared against field measurements, but the best approach may be to combine them to optimize processing time and achieve the highest possible precision, particularly in areas where competition abundance is estimated to be close to a given silvicultural decision threshold.

Several studies have investigated the spatial scale dependencies of NDVI and the relationship between NDVI and fractional vegetation cover, but without any consensus on the two issues. The objectives of this paper are to analyze the spatial scale dependencies of NDVI and to analyze the relationship between NDVI and fractional vegetation cover at different resolutions based on linear spectral mixing models. Our results show strong spatial scale dependencies of NDVI over heterogeneous surfaces, indicating that NDVI values at different resolutions may not be comparable. The nonlinearity of NDVI over partially vegetated surfaces becomes prominent with darker soil backgrounds and with presence of shadow. Thus, the NDVI may not be suitable to infer vegetation fraction because of its nonlinearity and scale effects. We found that the scaled difference vegetation index (SDVI), a scale-invariant index based on linear spectral mixing of red and near-infrared reflectances, is a more suitable and robust approach for retrieval of vegetation fraction with remote sensing data, particularly over heterogeneous surfaces. The proposed method was validated with experimental field data, but further validation at the satellite level would be needed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

From field measurements recorded within 32 50 x 50 in plots, AGB was estimated by applying species-specific allometric equations to stand measurements. AGB was then scaled-up to the larger area using relationships established with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data acquired over 150 (10 columns, 15 rows) 500 x 150 in cells (or Primary Sampling Units, PSUs) spaced 4 x 4 kin apart in the north- and east-west directions. Large-scale (1 :4000) stereo aerial photographs were also acquired for each PSU to assess species composition. Based on the LiDAR extrapolations, the median AGB for the PSU grid was 82 Mg ha(-1) (maximum 164 Mg ha(-1)), with the higher levels associated with forests containing a high proportion of Angophora and Callitris species. Empirical relationships between AGB and SAR backscatter confirmed that C-, L- and P-band saturated at different levels and revealed a greater strength in the relationship at higher incidence angles and a larger dynamic range and consistency of relationships at HV polarizations. A higher level of saturation (above similar to 50 Mg ha(-1)) was observed at C-band HV compared to that reported for closed forests which was attributable to a link between foliage projected cover (FPC) and AGB. The study concludes that L-band HV backscatter data acquired at incidence angles approaching or exceeding 45 degrees are best suited for estimating the AGB up to the saturation level of similar to 80-85 Mg ha(-1). For regional mapping of biomass below the level of saturation, the use of the Japanese Space Exploration Agency (JAXA) Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phase Arrayed L-band SAR (PALSAR) is advocated.

Spectral angle mapper (SAM) and spectral feature fitting (SFF) classification techniques were applied to obtain rule mineral images. Each pixel in these rule images represents the similarity between the corresponding pixel in the hyperspectral image to a reference spectrum. The rule images provide weights that are utilized in objective functions of the sampling schemes which are optimized through a process of simulated annealing. A HyMAP 126-channel airborne hyperspectral data acquired in 2003 over the Rodalquilar area in Spain serves as an application to target those pixels with the highest likelihood of occurrence of a specific mineral and as a collection the location of these sampling points selected represent the distribution of that particular mineral. In this area, alunite being a predominant mineral in the alteration zones was chosen as the target mineral. Three weight functions are defined to intensively sample areas where a high probability and abundance of alunite occurs. Weight function I uses binary weights derived from the SAM classification image, leading to an even distribution of sampling points over the region of interest. Weight function 11 uses scaled weights derived from the SAM rule image. Sample points are arranged more intensely in areas of abundance of alunite. Weight function III combines information from several different rule image classifications. Sampling points are distributed more intensely in regions of high probable alunite as classified by both SAM and SFF, thus representing the purest of pixels. This method leads to an efficient distribution of sample points, on the basis of a user-defined objective. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Although the stereoscopic capability derived from a combination of these two views was originally designed for use in land applications, serendipitous observation has shown that it also represents a promising source of data over water bodies. In fact, when coupled with surface temperature measurements derived from the sensor\'s thermal-infrared (TIR) component, stereo viewing forms a powerful observational capability that can be exploited in the monitoring of lake and marine environments. One important aspect introduced by the stereo system is the capability to measure the short-term displacements associated with surface currents and waves by comparing the nadir and back-looking views. In initial results presented here, surface motion was deduced from the displacement of a ship wake appearing in the Sun glitter regime of an ASTER image of the Izu Shoto islands, which lie to the southwest of Tokyo Bay, Japan. Within the natural limitations imposed by spatial and temporal resolutions, this measurement was found to be consistent with simultaneous surface current values derived from a nearby shore-based High-frequency (HF) radar system. The success of this basic comparison introduces the possibility that stereo imaging from space, if well tuned to follow the motion of surface slicks and other surface features within the Sun glitter regime, could provide a future means of observing surface current on a global scale.   Data from the VNIR stereo system also highlights the influence of observational geometry. In the case of a surface with Sun glitter, this often manifests as a brightness reversal between the nadir and back-looking views in which relatively bright (dark) features at nadir appear dark (bright) in the back-looking view. Such a region of brightness reversal (ROBR) can be indicative of a locally rough or smooth surface texture as may be found, for example, in the vicinity of internal waves (rough) or ship wakes (smooth). Simple analysis based on a \"Back to Nadir\" ratio of relative radiances shows that the signal strengths measured by ASTER within a ROBR can yield a crude estimate of the mean square surface slope, which is an important parameter in theories of sea surface roughness imaging by devices such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).   Several other potential applications of VNIR stereo data in coastal zone and lake monitoring are considered here, including the study of internal waves (in the Strait of Gibraltar), derivation of wind velocity at cloud height, swell-wave propagation, suspended sediment transport, marine traffic monitoring and ship wake patterns. As the reflectivity of water in the near infrared reverses from low to high in the presence of Sun glitter, most of the applications discussed here involve glitter and hence some discussion of the influence of sensor view geometry is presented. The general conclusion of the paper is that future missions such as the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS), which aim to deploy high spatial resolution stereo viewing systems primarily for land applications, should also return data of considerable value in oceanography and limnology, particularly if their observational geometry can be adjusted to permit the imaging of Sun glitter from water surfaces.

We address an important question in this context: \"How does topography influence the vegetation\'s response to natural climate fluctuations?\" We explore this issue through the analysis of interannual vegetation variability over a very large area (continental United States) using long-term (13-year period of 1989-2001), monthly averaged, biweekly maximum value composite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. These data are obtained from satellite remote sensing at 1-km resolution. Through the novel implementation of data mining techniques, we show that the Nor-them Pacific climate oscillation and the ENSO phenomena influence the year-to-year vegetation variability over an extensive geographical domain. Further, the vegetation response to these fluctuations depends on a variety of topographic attributes such as elevation, slope, aspect, and proximity to moisture convergence zones, although the first two are the predominant controls. Therefore, the dynamic response of terrestrial vegetation to climate fluctuations, which shows tremendous spatial heterogeneity, is closely linked to the variability induced by the topography. These findings suggest that the representation of vegetation dynamics in existing climate models, which do not incorporate such dependencies, may be inadequate. Therefore, climate models that are regularly employed to guide policy decisions need to better incorporate these dependencies for the assessment of terrestrial carbon sequestration under evolving climate scenarios.

However, in summer, increasing surface heating effects make SSTs uniform and the SST front disappears. The purpose of the present study is to examine applicability of satellite-derived surface chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) for detection of the Kuroshio front in the ocean south of Japan during the summer season.   The Kuroshio surface front is formed between the Kuroshio water (KW) and the coastal water (CW) in the study area. Investigating accumulated in situ observations of SST and Chl-a, it is shown that the difference of Chl-a between KW and CW is increased in summer though that of SST becomes small. Using 76 pairs of cloud-free satellite-derived SST and Chl-a images with 0.01 degrees spatial resolution, their seasonal variations are investigated through two-dimensional (2-D) histograms of Chl-a and SST. In summer, SST ranges from 25 to 30 degrees C and Chl-a ranges 0.03 to 0.4 mg/m(3). Two peaks in the summer 2-D histogram correspond to wider KW and CW areas with rather uniform Chl-a and SST distributions. The peak values are extracted from the 2-D histograms and used to determine a threshold value dividing the KW and CW surface Chl-a during summer. It is found that the Chl-a concentration of 0.17 mg/m(3) divides the extracted peaks into two groups, i.e., CW and KW except for a few peaks.   The proposed Kuroshio-front detection method using the Chl-a images and the threshold value is examined using the satellite images and in situ data. The threshold contour superimposed in the summer Chl-a image distinctly separates the two representative waters in the ocean south of Japan. The front positions determined by the satellite-derived Chl-a, in situ SST, and in situ surface salinity transects along observation lines crossing the Kuroshio front agree with each other. Applying a traditional Kuroshio front index of temperature at 200 m depth, the capability of new Chl-a threshold in dividing two waters around the near-front area is quantitatively examined. Producing 74 match-ups of the satellite-derived Chl-a and 200-m temperature in the frontal zone, the dividing capability is evaluated quantitatively using the traditional Kuroshio-axis index. The detection capability of the proposed method is 82%, which can be considered high enough for practical applications. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Measurement error bias attributable to error in classifying land cover change may occur with either the sampling or complete coverage mapping approach. An additional contribution to MSE attributable to sampling variability exists for the sampling-based estimator, but not the complete coverage estimator. If this sampling variability is small, the classification error bias of the sampling approach need not be reduced very far relative to the classification error bias of complete coverage to achieve similar MSE. Data from several published change accuracy error matrices are used to provide MSE comparisons for specific applications. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Two EUROFLUX beech (Fagus sylvatica) sites, Hesse, France and Soro, Denmark, were selected for this evaluation. The local LAI seasonal courses from the years 2001 to 2003 were retrieved based on a local radiative transfer model using above and below canopy radiation measurements. The MODIS LAI time series for the same years was created by downscaling the downloaded MODIS LAI data and filtering with the associated quality flags. Validation of MODIS LAI in the temporal scale included the traditional absolute value check and more importantly, the pattern check. Although MODIS LAI has generally lower absolute values than the local model, it is able to resemble the general patterns of the LAI seasonal trajectory of typical temperate deciduous forests. However, some obvious discrepancies are also noted in the two LAI time series. The MODIS LAI time series tends to rise early, to have a relatively short period of leaf constant period, and to have a much longer LAI decreasing period in the leaf senescent period as compared with the local LAI seasonal courses. The onset dates detected through MODIS LAI are significantly earlier than the local LAI determinations, which lead to the longer growing season length. It remains unclear if this apparent anticipation of canopy greening is a caused by understorey or herbal layer greening, that is known to occur earlier in European Beech forests or by other factors. The results indicate that MODIS LAI retrieval in these complex multi-layer deciduous forests is not unequivocal even with advanced sensors and algorithms, and care should be taken before using MODIS LAI retrieval for regional scale modeling applications.

Considerable efforts have been made to develop global continuous fields for different land cover types at large spatial scales based on NOAA-AVHRR and TERRA-MODIS data and a range of techniques have been applied to depict the sub-pixel fraction of land cover types from these data. In this study, a new methodology is described for deriving and optimizing continuous fields of tree cover for complex topography at the regional scale of the European Alps using generalized linear models (GLM). MODIS data (MOD09) at a spatial resolution of 500 m were used to calibrate the models against regional training data of fractional tree cover. For evaluating the method we test the GLM model output to a regression tree model (using the same data structure). Further we test the resulting GLM-based tree cover continuous fields against two different, independent test data sets; one of which is spatially separated and the other is from within the calibration area. Finally, we compare the GLM model output with two available global data sets at spatial resolutions of I km and 3 km: (1) TERRA-MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields product (MOD44), and (2) the NOAA-AVHRR vegetation continuous fields. Our GLM-based method results in high accuracy. (MAE=9. 1%) and low bias (- 1.2%) across the combined evaluation and calibration area, and with small differences only between the calibration and the spatially separated evaluation area (1.3%). Compared to the regression tree model the results from the GLM model for all analyses are significantly better. Thus we conclude that generalized linear models are appropriate for deriving continuous fields of fractional tree cover for complex topography at the regional scale. GLMs can handle nonlinear relationships present in the training data set well, and the method is robust with respect to sample size and the number of months used for calibration. Regional calibrations of vegetation continuous fields may offer significantly improved predictions compared to globally calibrated models. Such regionally calibrated and optimized models may serve as valuable tools for regional monitoring of land cover pattern and its temporal change. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Paddy rice fields are characterized by an initial period of flooding and transplanting, during which period open canopy (a mixture of surface water and rice crops) exists. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard the NASA EOS Terra satellite has visible, near infrared and shortwave infrared bands; and therefore, a number of vegetation indices can be calculated, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) that is sensitive to leaf water and soil moisture. In this study, we developed a paddy rice mapping algorithm that uses time series of three vegetation indices (LSWI, EVI, and NDVI) derived from MODIS images to identify that initial period of flooding and transplanting in paddy rice fields, based on the sensitivity of LSWI to the increased surface moisture during the period of flooding and rice transplanting. We ran the algorithm to map paddy rice fields in 13 provinces of southern China, using the 8-day composite MODIS Surface Reflectance products (500-m spatial resolution) in 2002. The resultant MODIS-derived paddy rice map was evaluated, using the National Land Cover Dataset (1: 100,000 scale) derived from analysis of Landsat ETM+ images in 1999/2000. There were reasonable agreements in area estimates of paddy rice fields between the MODIS-derived map and the Landsat-based dataset at the provincial and county levels. The results of this study indicated that the MODIS-based paddy rice mapping algorithm could potentially be applied at large spatial scales to monitor paddy rice agriculture on a timely and frequent basis.

Based on this dataset, a band-ratio type algorithm was developed using ALI band 2 and band 3 for estimating CDOM content (absorption of filtrated water at 420 nm) in lakes. Correlation between in situ measured CDOM and the remote sensing estimate of CDOM was high, r(2)=0.73. The CDOM retrieval algorithm obtained on the basis of two images and in situ data was validated on a third ALI image (eastern Finland, 2002) that was available in the ALI image archive. In situ water-colour monitoring data from 22 lakes (27 measuring stations) in the third image were available in a database of the Finnish Environment Administration. The water-colour data were converted to CDOM absorption values, which were then compared to the results from a third ALI image. The correlation between remotely estimated and in situ CDOM values in the algorithm validation image was high, r(2)-0.83. These results support the conclusion that CDOM content in lakes over a wide range of concentrations (a(CDOM)(420) between 0.68 and 11.13 m(-1)) can be mapped using Advanced Land Imager data.

Global annual NPP was estimated as 59.6 Gt C year(-1) by MOD-Sim-CYCLE (Sim-CYCLE after integration of MODIS-LAI), whereas it was 62.7 Gt C year(-1) in case of Sim-CYCLE for the year 2001. Both models predicted highest NPP around the equator with another smaller peak occurring around 60degreesN. These two regions represented the tropical and boreal forests biomes, respectively. The NPP estimated by MOD-Sim-CYCLE exceeded the NPP estimated by Sim-CYCLE in these two regions. Other than the tropical and boreal forests biomes, NPP values estimated by the MOD-Sim-CYCLE were typically lower than Sim-CYCLE across the latitudes. Validations of results in Australia and USA showed that MOD-Sim-CYCLE estimated NPP more accurately than Sim-CYCLE. Our results demonstrate the utility of combining satellite-observation with an ecosystem process model to achieve improved accuracy in estimates and monitoring global net primary productivity.

However, data on the variability of the LUE coefficient, epsilon, on the landscape are minimal and sometimes conflicting. The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify and compare the variability of LUE among five forest cover types: aspen, northern hardwoods, red pine, forested wetland, and upland conifer; and (2) quantify the variability of epsilon between two years, 1999 and 2000, and relate differences to environmental conditions. The study site was in a northern temperate forest in Wisconsin, USA. Northern hardwood forests, primarily consisting of sugar maple, had the highest epsilon each year followed by aspen, red pine, forested wetlands, and upland conifer. NPP was estimated using radial growth measurements and published allometric equations. Absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) was estimated optically using a Li-Cor Plant Canopy Analyzer. Growing season - of all forest cover types increased significantly from 0.42 in 1999 to 0.47 (gC MJ(-1)) in 2000. Annual E of all forest cover types increased significantly from 0.33 in 1999 to 0.36 (gC MJ(-1)) in 2000. Growing season and annual g differed significantly (p less than or equal to 0.001) among forest cover types for each year. Future research should consider variations in LUE among mixtures of many land cover types, especially forested wetlands. Results from this study show that LUE models should consider species-specific efficiency factors rather than biome-specific factors. Remote sensing-based land cover classifications should also reflect species differences for this area if the classification map is used in estimating NPP with an LUE model. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

These include spectral mixing of diverse land cover components within pixels, spectral confusion with other land cover features such as fallow agricultural fields and the fact that urban classes of interest are of the land use and not the land cover category. A new methodology to address these issues is proposed. This approach involves, as a first step, the generation of two independent but rudimentary land cover products, one spectral-based at the pixel level and the other segment-based. These classifications are then merged through a rule-based approach to generate a final product with enhanced land use classes and accuracy. A comprehensive evaluation of derived products of Ottawa, Calgary and cities in southwestern Ontario is presented based on conventional ground reference data as well as inter-classification consistency analyses. Producer accuracies of 78% and 73% have been achieved for urban \'residential\' and \'commercial/industrial\' classes, respectively. The capability of Landsat TM to detect low density residential areas is assessed based on dwelling and population data derived from aerial photography and the 2001 Canadian census. For low population densities (i.e. below 3000 persons/km(2)), density is observed to be monotonically related to the fraction of pixels labeled \'residential\'. At higher densities, the fraction of pixels labeled \'residential\' remains constant due to Landsat\'s inability to distinguish between high-rise apartment dwellings and commercial/industrial structures.

Methods were tested on 1-m resolution hyperspectral ROSIS datasets acquired over two olive groves in southern Spain during the HySens 2002 campaign conducted by the German Aerospace Center (DLR). Leaf-level biochemical estimation using 1-m ROSIS data when targeting pure olive tree crowns employed PROSPECT-SAILH radiative transfer simulation. At lower spatial resolution, therefore with significant effects of soil and shadow scene components on the aggregated pixels, a canopy model to account for such scene components had to be used for a more appropriate estimation approach for leaf biochemical concentration. The linked models PROSPECT-SAILH-FLIM improved the estimates of chlorophyll concentration from these open tree canopies, demonstrating that crown-derived relationships between hyperspectral indices and biochemical constituents cannot be readily applied to hyperspectral imagery of lower spatial resolutions due to large soil and shadow effects. Predictive equations built on a MCARI/OSAVI scaled-up index through radiative transfer simulation minimized soil background variations in these open canopies, demonstrating superior performance compared to other single-ratio indices previously shown as good indicators of chlorophyll concentration in closed canopies. The MCARI/OSAVI index was demonstrated to be less affected than TCARI/OSAVI by soil background variations when calculated from the pure crown component even at the typically low LAI orchard and grove canopies.

Unlike regular forward mode, MFM-5-Scale does not require exact physical stand descriptors, but instead requires only input ranges and model increments that are easily obtained, with results determined by matching satellite image data with modeled reflectance values as stored in a look-up table. In this work, MFM-5-Scale was applied to a mosaic of seven multi-year (1991-1998) Landsat TM scenes covering the BOREAS region in western Canada, with results validated against field data and also compared with the Enhancement Classification Method (ECM), a highly accurate yet subjective and labour intensive approach which involves considerable user judgement and expertise. The goal was to approach ECM accuracy using MFM-5-Scale, but without the subjectivity of ECM. Classifications of 13 forest classes including deciduous and species-specific coniferous classes subdivided into low, medium and high crown densities as well as a mixed forest class were evaluated against 136 field checked validation sites. Overall classification accuracies were 91% for ECM and 85% for MFM-5-Scale. Additional assessments of agreement between the MFM-5-Scale and ECM products were also performed over larger sample areas. MFM-5-Scale classification of a full set of 25 forest and non-forest classes adhering to Global Observation of Forest Cover (GOFC) specifications was in 80% agreement with the ECM product (n = 11,442). This is viewed as a significant result given the ambitious and detailed nature of the classes considered (21 forest classes comprising 12 species and density specific conifer and deciduous classes, four mixed forest classes and five burnt forest classes, as well as four non-forest classes). The two products were also in 94% agreement for 6 forest density classes (it = 3730). MFM-5-Scale biophysical analysis of 63 BOREAS plots showed LAI was estimated within +/- 0.53 LAI compared with ground-based TRAC LAI validation data (biophysical information is not provided by ECM). These results represent significant progress towards defining an operational landcover and biophysical estimation approach given the objective, semi-automated nature of MFM-5-Scale physical scene modeling compared to subjective, user-driven methods such as ECM.

Two important variables, water-holding capacity (WHC) and hydrologic soil group (HSG), were controlled in our water budget experiment to evaluate their impacts on soil moisture content (SMC) changes throughout the period. Results showed that HSG affected drought detection and occurrence very little, but WHC variations explained most local variations of soil moisture content. As a strong indicator of relative soil moisture deficit, the Standardized Thermal Index (STI) patterns were also influenced by WHC. Generally, the earlier the soil moisture content drops below 40%, the earlier the STI reaches a threshold value of 0.2 or higher. Vegetation responses to thermal detection lagged behind the STI by up to 8 weeks, which was computed by comparing the STI and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) deviation from a 10-year mean. The spatial pattern of lag-times was not apparent, but lag-times were correlated with a WHC component. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

In the first part of the study, we examined spruce and pine stands with an age range of 20 - 100 years and compared their simulated hemispherical-directional reflectance factors (HDRFs) at nadir in red (661 nm), NIR (838 nm) and MIR (1677 nm) when crowns were modeled as ellipsoids or cones. In all the cases, when a stand was modeled with conical crowns, it had a smaller reflectance factor than the same stand with ellipsoidal crowns.   To analyze the sensitivity of HDRF on crown shape, in the second part of the study we simulated the angular distributions of HDRF of two pine stands with different leaf area index (LAI) and canopy closure values at 661 nm assuming four different crown shapes (cone, cylinder, ellipsoid, and cylinder bottom, cone top) and separated the components forming the HDRE Considerable difference in the HDRF between the four crown shapes was observed: The larger the crown volume, the higher the canopy reflectance at similar LAI and canopy closure. A comparison of the two stands revealed that in denser stands (with a higher canopy closure) single scattering from tree crowns was responsible for the difference in HDRF between the different crown shapes, whereas in stands with a smaller canopy closure the single scattering from ground dominated the HDRE Finally, the role of crown shape for the retrieval of LAI by inversion from remotely sensed data is discussed.

Surface conditions (water level, aboveground biomass, soil moisture) were measured in 13 study sites (representing three major wetland types) over a 25-month period. ERS SAR imagery was collected over these sites on 22 different occasions and correlated with the surface observations. The results show wide variation in ERS backscatter in individual sites when they were flooded and non-flooded. The range (minimum vs. maximum) in SAR backscatter for the sites when they were flooded was between 2.3 and 8.9 dB, and between 5.0 and 9.0 dB when they were not flooded. Variations in backscatter in the non-flooded sites were consistent with theoretical scattering models for the most part. Backscatter was positively correlated to field measurements of soil moisture. The Michigan MIcrowave Canopy Scattering (MIMICS) model predicts that backscatter should decrease sharply when a site becomes inundated, but the data show that this drop is only 1-2 dB. This decrease was observed in both non-wooded and wooded sites. The drop in backscatter as water depth increases predicted by MIMICS was observed in the non-wooded wetland sites, and a similar decrease was observed in wooded wetlands as well. Finally, the sensitivity of backscatter and attenuation to variations in aboveground biomass predicted by MIMICS was not observed in the data.   The results show that the inter- and intra-annual variations in ERS SAR image intensity in the study region are the result of changes in soil moisture and degree of inundation in the sites. The correlation between changes in SAR backscatter and water depth indicates the potential for using spaceborne SAR systems, such as the ERS for monitoring variations in flooding in south Florida wetlands.

Site-intensive biophysical and canopy structural measurements were made simultaneously at each of the Cerrado types including Cerrado grassland, shrub Cerrado, wooded Cerrado, Cerrado woodland, and gallery forest. We analyzed the spectral reflectance signatures, their first derivative analogs, and convolved spectral vegetation indices (VI) over all the Cerrado physiognomies. The high spectral resolution data were convolved to the MODIS, AVHRR, and ETM+ bandpasses and converted to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to simulate their respective sensors. Dry and wet season comparisons of the measured biophysical attributes were made with the reflectance and VI data for the different Cerrado physiognomies. We found that three major domains of Cerrado could be distinguished with the dry and wet season spectral signatures and vegetation indices. The EVI showed a higher sensitivity to seasonality than the NDVI; however, both indices displayed seasonal variations that were approximately one-half that found with the measured landscape green cover dynamics. Inter-sensor comparisons of seasonal dynamics, based on spectral bandpass properties, revealed the ETM+-simulated VIs had the best seasonal discrimination capability, followed by MODIS and AVHRR. Differences between sensor bandpass-derived VI values, however, varied with Cerrado type and between dry and wet seasons, indicating the need for inter-sensor VI translation equations for effective multi-sensor applications.

In vivo fluorescence emissions can occur in the wavelength region from 300 to 800 nm and are dependent on the wavelength of illumination. These light emissions have been grouped into five primary bands with maxima most frequently received from corn at 320 mn (UV), 450 nm (blue), 530 mn (green), 685 nm (red), and 740 nm (far-red). Two active fluorescence sensing systems have been custom developed; a leaf level Fluorescence Imaging System (FIS), and a canopy level Laser Induced Fluorescence Imaging System (LIFIS). FIS sequentially acquires high-resolution images of fluorescence emission bands under darkened laboratory conditions, while LIFIS simultaneously acquires four band images of plant canopies greater than or equal to1 m(2) under ambient sunlit conditions. Fluorescence emissions induced by these systems along with additional biophysical measures of crop condition; namely, chlorophyll content, N/C ratio, leaf area index (LAI), and grain yield, exhibited similar curvilinear responses to levels of supplied N. A number of significant linear correlations were found among band emissions and several band ratios versus measures of crop condition. Significant differences were obtained for several fluorescence band ratios with respect to the level of supplied N. Leaf adaxial versus abaxial surface emissions exhibited opposing trends with respect to the level of supplied N. Evidence supports that this confounding effect could be removed in part by the green/blue and green/red ratio images. The FIS and LIFIS active fluorescence sensor systems yielded results which support the underlying hypothesis that leaf and canopy fluorescence emissions are associated with other biophysical attributes of crop growth and this information could potentially assist in the site-specific management of variable-rate N fertilization programs.

The active and passive use of solar energy is an approach to reduce the fossil energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emissions originated by buildings. Consideration of solar energy technologies in urban planning demands accurate information of the available solar resources. This can be achieved by the use of remote sensing data from geostationary satellites which show a very high spatial and a sufficient temporal resolution compared to ground station data. This paper gives a brief introduction to the HELIOSAT method applied to derive surface solar irradiance from satellite images and shows examples of applications: The use of daylight in buildings, the generation of correlated time series of solar irradiance and temperature as input data for simulations of solar energy systems and a short-term forecast of solar irradiance which can be used in intelligent building control techniques.

Microwave remote sensing from satellite platforms has the potential to monitor the freeze-thaw status of soil and overlying snow packs over large areas. We evaluate the backscatter response of the NSCAT scatterometer to changing snow surface conditions, especially freeze and thaw status, using a macroscale hydrology model and the NSCAT backscatter data for the upper Mississippi River basin of the north central U.S. and the Boreal Ecosystem Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) region in central Canada. We compared the snowmelt conditions simulated by the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrology model driven with surface meteorological observations with NSCAT measurements for 1996-1997 snow season. A mid-winter thaw event (in February) and late season melt (April-May) are evaluated for both regions. Comparison of backscatter images with daily and hourly-modeled snow surface wetness and temperature showed that the model agreed with the backscatter for snow surface wetness on some days but not on others. Factors such as NSCAT overpass times, vegetation on the ground and their freeze-thaw state, and liquid moisture content appear to contribute to these discrepancies. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Despite their many benefits and general flexibility, the use of decision trees with high spatial resolution data has not yet been fully explored. In support of the National Park Service (NPS) Vegetation Mapping Program (VMP), we have examined the feasibility of using a commercially available decision tree classifier with multitemporal satellite data from the Enhanced Thematic Mapper-Plus (ETM+) instrument to map 11 land cover types at the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area near Milford, PA. Ensemble techniques such as boosting and consensus filtering of the training data were used to improve both the quality of the input training data as well as the final products.   Using land cover classes as specified by the National Vegetation Classification Standard at the Formation level, the final land cover map has an overall accuracy of 82% (kappa = 0. 80) when tested against a validation data set acquired on the ground (n = 195). This same accuracy is 99.5% when considering only forest vs. nonforest classes. Usage of ETM+ scenes acquired at multiple dates improves the accuracy over the use of a single date, particularly for the different forest types. These results demonstrate the potential applicability and usability of such an approach to the entire National Park system, and to high spatial resolution land cover and forest mapping applications in general.

However, its application to the study of tidal flats has not been investigated in detail. The waterline in a tidal flat in Gomso Bay, Korea is characterized and evaluated using 27 sets of Landsat thematic mapper (TM) and Earth Observing System-Terra (EOS-Terra) Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Radiometer (ASTER) data. Ground truth data including grain size, soil moisture content, ground levelling, and waterline tracking have been obtained. The choice of spectral bands in terms of tidal conditions turned out to play a key role in locating the waterline. While the waterlines extracted from near-infrared (NIR), short-wavelength infrared (SWIR), and thermal infrared (TIR) data are commonly reliable on the flood tide, the discrepancies between different bands become large on the ebb tide. The bands TIR, NIR, and SWIR are, in that order, decreasingly effective in extracting the waterline while ebb tides are in progress. The effect of turbid water on NIR can be reduced by a ratioing of NIR and the visible band. The location of the waterline is also an important factor to consider; the discrepancy is largest on the middle tidal flat. Selection of the proper band for waterline extraction under various conditions is suggested. However, no single band can accommodate all aspects of the tidal flat environment. A schematic model associated with the spectral reflectance of the tidal flat is proposed in which the remnant water scattered on the surface after exposure is emphasized as an additional factor.

A method is presented to estimate fractional cover based upon the differing ways in which grasses and trees respond to rainfall, and implementation of this method is demonstrated along the Kalahari Transect (KT), an aridity gradient in southern Africa. Seasonally averaged normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the sensitivity of the NDVI to interannual variations in wet season rainfall are used as state-space variables in a linear unmixing model. End members for this analysis were determined on the basis of best fit to the observed data. The realized end members were consistent with the qualitative characteristics of trees (high NDVI, low sensitivity of NDVI to interannual variations in rainfall), bare soil (low NDVI, low sensitivity), and the transient grass/bare soil area (moderate NDVI, high sensitivity). Observed sensitivity of NDVI to rainfall was measured as the relationship between wet season NDVI and normalized rainfall over a 16-year period (1983-1998). The unmixing model yields a north-to-south decrease in tree fractional cover that corresponds to the decrease in mean wet season precipitation from 1600 to 300 mm along the KT (R-2 =. 87). The fractional tree cover results compare favorably with available ground-based observations. The potential extent of grass cover is limited by the dominance of trees on the northern end of the transect, peaks at the location with approximately 450 mm of mean wet season rainfall, and is limited by rainfall in the and southern portion of the transect. With mean NDVI for grass inferred from the data, yearly estimates of tree, grass, and bare soil fractional cover can be derived. These annual estimates, which are difficult to obtain from traditional unmixing procedures, are important parameters in fuel load and land-atmosphere exchange models. No calibration or training sets were required for this analysis, and this method has the additional capability to predict fractional-cover components for future rainfall scenarios.

The method uses three equations to solve for three variables: the atmospheric resistance between the surface and the air (r(ae)); the surface resistance (r(s)); and the vapour pressure at the surface (e(s)). The novelty of this approach is the estimation of e(s), which is assessed using the decoupling coefficient (Omega) by Jarvis and McNaughton [Adv. Ecol. Res. 15 (1986) 1]. The input parameters are: surface temperature (T-s), net radiation (R-n), soil heat flux (G), air temperature (T-a), and air humidity (e(a)). A time series (100 days) of field data collected for a wheat crop is used to illustrate the method, which is validated using latent heat fluxes recorded by the eddy covariance technique. The control of r(s) on lambdaE is expressed through the Surface Control Coefficient (SCC = 1-Omega), which is compared to soil moisture data. The application of the technique in a remote sensing monitoring context is demonstrated for a Danish agricultural landscape containing crops at different stages of development. For the satellite-based estimation of lambdaE and SCC, the variables T-s, R-n, and G are calculated on the basis of Landsat-5 TM, which leaves solar irradiance (for computing R-n), T-a, and e(a) as the only field data required. The method is directly applicable without any calibration when the soil surface is moist or when the vegetation cover is dense.

Extensive efforts to exploit the potential of remotely sensed observations to help quantify this complex variable are still underway. Among the various methods, several investigators have explored a combination of surface temperatures and spectral vegetation index (SVI) measurements, the TVX method, as a means to account for the variable influence of vegetation cover in soil moisture assessment. Although considerable empirical evidence has been presented exploring the potential of TVX methods to assess regional moisture conditions, less attention has been given to assessing the underlying biophysics of the observed TVX patterns. In this study, the Simplified Simple Biosphere (SSiB) model is exploited to examine the factors that lead to the observed TVX relation. For a range of typical, midlatitude, growing season conditions, the SSiB model produces the expected TVX relationship, surface temperature decreases with increasing SVI values. The most critical factors that cause the TVX relation to vary include near-surface soil moisture (2 cm), incident radiation (IR), and, to a lesser degree, wind speed. Whereas many empirical studies have suggested that the slope of the TVX relation may provide an important diagnostic of soil moisture conditions, in this analysis, the impact of plant stomatal function is shown to confuse this interpretation of the TVX slope. However, other aspects of the TVX metrics, specifically bare soil temperature and canopy temperature. do provide diagnostic near-surface soil moisture information. Growing season variations in TVX metrics were examined for the conditions recorded at the Hydrological and Atmospheric Pilot Experiment-Modelisation du Bilan Hydrique (HAPEX-Mobilhy) study site. The results from this analysis indicate that soil and canopy temperatures vary as a function of soil moisture conditions and, to a lesser degree, as a result of varying solar insolation and wind speed. The results also show that the TVX metrics are able to provide daily soil moisture variation up to 2 cm of soil depth and seasonal trend up to 10 cm. Using the satellite-derived surface temperatures and a SSiB-derived retrieval equation, the retrieved soil moistures at the HAPEX-Mobilhy site generally closely approximate the conditions recorded on the ground.

Remotely sensed data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) are combined with meteorological data to estimate the Normalised Difference Temperature Index (NDTI). The NDTI provides a measure of the moisture availability, the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration. Sur-face temperature minus air temperature, percent vegetation cover and net radiation explained 85% of variation in the modelled NDTI. Using these three covariates across the network of meteorological stations allows NDTI images, which maps changes in Moisture availability across the MDB, to be calculated. This method uses a calculate then interpolate (CI) approach that uses the per-pixel variation present in the AVHRR data as the backbone for the spatial interpolation. Using the spatially dense AVHRR-based covariates in a Cl approach avoids errors that occur between measurement points when interpolating variables for regional hydrologic modelling, most significantly the spatial pattern of rainfall. The NDTI provides a link into regional water balance modelling which does not require daily rainfall to be spatially interpolated. Assessing spatial and temporal interactions between the NDTI and the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) provides useful information about regional hydroecological processes, including agricultural management, within the context of Australia\'s highly variable climate and sparse network of meteorological stations.

Since such corrections are a function of the atmospheric path between the sensor and ground, correction techniques that do not consider the topographic variations within a scene can introduce appreciable error in the estimation of the atmosphere effects. In this paper. we describe the development and application of a variable-elevation atmospheric correction procedure. Our objective was to incorporate changes in target altitude into a general atmosphere correction strategy. This procedure was tested on a TIMS data set acquired over Mt. Etna, Italy in July 1986. The methodology adopted in this study is based on the use of the LOWTRAN radiative transfer code and a digital elevation model (DEM) registered to the image data. The image data are divided into a series of layers, based on elevation. and a separate atmosphere correction is applied to each layer. Maps of emissivity estimates derived with the variable-elevation approach were compared with geologic maps of the Etna flow fields. Prior to the variable-elevation correction, the emissivity spectra of long lava flows appeared to vary with elevation. Following the variable-elevation correction, many of these spectral artifacts were removed from the emissivity maps. In addition. the variable-elevation correction increased our ability to discriminate individual lava flows. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The photochemical reflectance index (PRI), derived from narrow band reflectance at 531 and 570 nm has been related with some success to photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE). Such a relationship would enable the estimation of stand photosynthesis from remotely sensed data. However, canopy PRI is an integral of the component leaf response weighted by the strength of the signal from each leaf to the sensor. This analysis investigates the extent to which canopy structure, view, and illumination angles are likely to influence the measured canopy PRI. A one-dimensional ray tracing radiative transfer model was used to estimate light distribution within a canopy and the dynamic response of individual foliar elements, based oil a published relationship between PRI and LUE and a simple photosynthetic light response function. The model estimated the LUE of the canopy, based oil both incident and absorbed light, and reflectance of the canopy at the desired wavelengths and hence the canopy PR1. A range or solar zenith, leaf area index (LAI), leaf angle distributions (LAD), and soil types were used to determine the likely influence on measured canopy PRI. The results show a positive correlation between PRI and LUE variation at canopy scale. However, the index shows a greater variation of view angle than most vegetation indices. The index is strongly influenced by varying soil background for LAI < 3. At large viewing angles (> 30 degrees) the index is also sensitive to LAD. Correction for Rayleigh scattering is necessary to relate the index to ground measured PRI. Results Show that the PRI value is most sensitive to changes in LAI. Utilisation of the relationship to predict or improve estimates of canopy LUE based oil either absorbed or incident light will require an independent estimate of LAI change between dates/locations of in situ measurements and of remote sensing observations.

Calculation results with input of a high-resolution roughness map provide the most realistic deposition pattern. A scare analysis of degrading the land cover map into lower resolutions is performed. The atmospheric deposition model results based on lower resolution roughness maps are compared and evaluated by the so-called Dose Isopleth Correlation Area (DICA) method. The recommendation is that a l-km resolution is adequate for real-time deposition modelling. Furthermore, the land cover mapping should be performed with care.

The amplitude of the first harmonic indicated the variability of productivity over the year as expressed in a single annual pulse of net primary production. This summarized the relative dominance of evergreen vs. deciduous or annual habit. The phase of the first harmonic summarized the timing of green-up relative to the timing of winter and spring rains.

It is reasonable to assume that both the surface and the atmosphere will change little between orbits, and that after BRDF correction reflectances of given targets should be the same in both orbits. Before BRDF parameters can be fitted, atmospheric correction must be performed. To improve this process, average monthly atmospheric profiles and aerosol optical depths are used as radiative transfer model inputs in conjunction with a digital elevation model. Using atmospheric corrected reflectance data from 12 NOAA-14 AVHRR image pairs, BRDF parameters were extracted for predominant vegetation groups in New Zealand: indigenous forest; exotic forest; scrub; pasture; and tussock grassland. For each of these vegetation groups significant non-Lambertian reflectance behavior was observed, and BRDF correction using the derived equal reflectance line gives a measure of the accuracy of the method. After correction, the RMS reflectance errors were approximately 0.01 in the visible and 0.02 in the near-infrared. A vegetation map specifying the proportions of the vegetation groups at any given location can be used to perform regular BRDF correction. Reflectance standardization to a fixed view and sun angle can then be performed using the pre-derived BRDF parameters and proportional BRDF correction.

The interactions of light with the surface are governed by the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), and modeling this is one of the most promising methods for describing and explaining this variability. Here the Roujean linear semiempirical kernel-driven (LiSK) model was tested against two independent bidirectional reflectance factor datasets that were acquired close to ground level over seminatural semiarid grasslands in Xilingol, Inner Mongolia (People\'s Republic of China) and in Arizona (United States). The objectives were to determine how well the model is able to describe and explain observed bidirectional reflectance factor distributions in the red and near-infrared wavelengths, to explore its utility in correcting such data for angular variations, and the likely impact of such corrections on cover-type discrimination. The sensitivity of the model to reductions in the number and angular distribution of the bidirectional reflectance observations with which it is inverted was also evaluated. The results show that the model is able to describe the observed multiangular BRFs with good accuracy and with low sensitivity to the number of angular inputs, with observations in the forward-scattering direction shown to be important in constraining inversions. The behavior of retrieved parameters indicates that one or more of the simplifying assumptions made in the model derivation is likely to be too severe for explaining BRDF in the near-infrared region; non-negligible anisotropic multiple scattering and the assumption of an optically thick medium mean that a physical interpretation of parameters is unlikely to be valid. However, the model is shown to provide an effective means of correcting for BRDF effects, allowing greater precision and consistency than hitherto possible in the retrieval of surface spectral reflectance over simiarid grasslands and concrete improvements in cover-type discrimination.

Principal component analysis was used to identify the dominant characteristics of soil spectra and cluster analysis to group samples into homogeneous classes. The analysis was applied stepwise (1) to a minimum number of reflectance values, representative of the general shape and curvature of soil spectra, and (2) to the normalized amplitude (depth) of characteristic absorption bands. In the first step analysis, it was found that the brightness and the visible near-infrared (VIS-NIR) slope of the spectra are important spectral characteristics to discriminate soil development, also in relation to the underlying lithology. The principal intercorrelation between the brightness, the VIS-NIR spectral slope, and various soil properties, such as calcium carbonate content, organic matter, and texture, could be also explained. In the second step, it was demonstrated that different types of soil include in the homogeneous groups, resulting from the first step multivariate analysis, could be further separated, mainly as function of the iron oxide features and the two main water and hydroxyl absorption bands at 1400 nm and 1900 nm. These results suggest that our method is suitable for the evaluation and interpretation of remote sensing data for discriminating different soil development and degradation levels of large parts of the Apennines, which are similar to the test area. The brightness and the VIS-NIR slope components derived int he first step multivariate analysis may be retrievable from common multispectral systems such as Landsat-TM. The application of the second step multivariate analysis, however, would require the use of hyperspectral systems capable of retrieving the absorption features. In both cases rigorous atmospheric correction including the removal of the effects of relief illumination is a prerequisite.

The method relies on a combination of techniques; some of which having a successful background of solid experimental and theoretical justification, while others having only recently been introduced as promising tools for the extraction of environmental information from satellite data. The transpiration rate (lambda E-v) is calculated by applying an energy balance approach to the vegetation component of the land surface: lambda E-v=R-n(v)-H-v, where R-n(v) is the net radiation absorbed by the vegetation, and H-v is the sensible heat flux between the leaves and the air within the canopy. R-n(v) is calculated through the use of remote sensing and standard meteorological data by combining a conventional method for estimation of the land surface net radiation with a ground-calibrated function of NDVI (normalized differential vegetation index). H-v is assessed as a linear function of the temperature difference between vegetation (T-v) and the mean canopy air stream (To) Because the surface temperature (T-s) recorded by satellite contains combined information of both soil and vegetation, T-v is evaluated on the basis of the linear NDVI-T-s relationship for individual surface types. T-0 is assessed utilizing recent evidence that (T-s-T-0) is linearly related to the difference in surface temperature and air temperature above the canopy (Ts-T-u), with the slope coefficient depending only on canopy structure. The method is tested using remote sensing data ranging from ground-based, airborne, and satellite recordings. The modeled transpiration rates compared well to measurements of sapflow data and latent heat fluxes recorded for a wide range of surface types (agricultural crops, natural vegetation, forest vegetation).

The Daughtry et al. (1989) (A new technique to measure the spectral properties of conifer needles. Remote Sens. Environ. 27:81-91.) method of measuring conifer needle optical properties utilizes a relatively large gap fraction (approximately 0.3-0.6) and needles painted black on one surface of the sample from which the gap fraction of the sample is indirectly determined. Following this protocol typically results in distortions in optical properties, including underestimates in transmittance (sometimes negative values), and only one surface of the sample can be measured. The objectives of this article are to: 1) evaluate the influence of gaps between sample elements (conifer needles, twigs, narrow leaves and leaflets) on optical properties calculated with the published equations from Daughtry et al. (1989) and 2) revise the original Daughtry et al. method for optical property measurements by using an image-analysis to directly measure the gap fraction and use both surfaces of the sample. We achieve these objectives by reviewing the theory and investigating the effects of gaps by measurements of an inert photographic film material, fir needles, and mesquite leaflets. Tests to estimate the transmittance of film samples (film) and foliage (fir needles, mesquite leaflets) indicate that a relatively small gap fraction (less than 0.20) reduces the occurrence of computed negative transmittance values, reduces the variation in computed values, and yields values expected for the \"true\" or \"nongap\" transmittance. Employing the image analysis along with reduced gap fractions decreased the variance of measurements and permitted measurements of both surfaces per sample, thus reducing the time required by making half as many samples as originally required by Daughtry et al.

Remotely sensed data acquired over Central Africa from a variety of sensors (air-borne video camera, SPOT XS, Landsat Thematic Mapper, NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer, and ERS-1 Along Track Scanning Radiometer) were used to provide quantitative measurements of the spectral separability, and temporal and spatial sampling associated with the detection of burnt areas and active fires. Three main strategies to the monitoring of biomass burning were analyzed: detection of burnt areas at fine spatial resolution, detection of burnt areas at coarse spatial resolution and high temporal frequency, and detection of active fires at a coarse spatial resolution and high temporal frequency. In each case, we assess the detectability of the selected biomass burning indicator, the statistical representativity in time and space of the sample detected and whether the sample observations are an unbiased estimator of the total biomass burning events in the region. We conclude that while active fire detection remains important in defining the seasonality, timing, and interannual variations in biomass burning, the most reliable strategy for estimating biomass burning at a regional scale is a multisensor approach in which regional burnt area estimates from coarse spatial resolution data are calibrated on the basis of a sample of fine spatial resolution estimates of burnt areas, using a double sampling with regression estimator approach.

A methodology and strategy for achieving the required uncertainty in the post-launch era is presented here. The method consists of combining direct measurements of the water-leaving radiance, white-cap radiance, and aerosol optical thickness made simultaneously with satellite overpasses, with radiative transfer theory to reduce the calibration uncertainty of the visible bands with respect to the near-infrared (NIR). This procedure is possible over the open ocean, where, in the absence of aerosol transported from land over long distances by the wind, the atmosphere can be very clear with most of the aerosol generated by local processes such as breaking waves, for example, the aerosol optical thickness in the visible similar to 0.05-0.10. In this case, the radiative transfer process is considerably simplified and molecular scattering is the dominant atmospheric component in the visible. It is shown that such a procedure alone is sufficient to reduce the calibration uncertainty to required levels. Further reduction is possible by reducing the uncertainty in the NIR calibration by measuring sky radiance from island locations (or a ship), and using these to predict the at-sensor radiance. For the most part, this NIR calibration is limited by the uncertainty in the calibration of the radiometer used to measure the sky radiance. Finally, the sensory calibration is maintained by monitoring the actual water-leaving radiance continuously at a single location, where the atmosphere is sufficiently clear that atmospheric correction introduces only a small error, and directly comparing the true and the sensor-derived water-leaving radiances.

High spectral resolution allows identification of materials in the scene, while high spatial resolution locates those materials.

In this article we extend the spectral mixing (unmixing) approach to use one or more higher resolution sharpening images, locating the endmembers to higher spatial accuracy. The approach starts with conventional unmixing to generate fraction images. Constrained optimization techniques spatially locate the endmembers to high resolution. Synthetic image generation (SIG) tools are used to generate test images. SIG controls all the image parameters, making it easier to analyze algorithm performance. The results show spectral mixing material maps can be successfully sharpened, increasing the effective resolution of the hyperspectral images.

Our objectives were to apply fractal scaling to high-resolution profiling laser altimetry data and to determine fractal parameters for differentiating land cover. Data were collected at the USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range in New Mexico over grass-dominated and shrub-dominated sites along four transects at each site. Scale-dependent root-mean-square (RMS) roughness and data power spectrums were computed from 100,000 data points (similar to 2 km) from each transect. A linearity measure and piecewise linear approximation were applied to find intervals of the fractal scaling. The RMS roughness data had two intervals of self-affine fractal scaling on grass transects and four such intervals on shrub transects. Reduction in the number of data points did not lead to a decrease in roughness but caused a smoothing dependency of fractal dimension on scale. Ten- and hundred-meter scales were appropriate for distinguishing between grass and shrub transects on the basis of fractal dimensions.

Scenes with known amounts of crop residue were illuminated in the lab with long-wave ultraviolet (UV) radiation and fluorescence images were measured and recorded with a video camera equipped with a mico-channel-plate image intensifier and fitted with a 453-488 nm bandpass filter. Six agricultural soils were used as backgrounds for the weathered soybean residue. Residue cover was determined from the proportion of the pixels in the image with fluorescence values greater than a threshold. Soil pixels gave the lowest fluorescence or brightness responses in the images and the residues the highest, so that brightness values of the scene spanned nearly the full range of the 8-bit video data. The images were classified in brightness categories that related to within 2% (absolute units) of measured residue cover regardless of the soil type or moisture condition (dry vs. wet). Therefore, fluorescence images can be used to provide percent residue cover in the lab, but portable equipment and procedures for use in the field still need to be developed.

Their optical properties are represented by individual scattering phase functions that are directly input into the model or are computed with optical and structural characteristics of elements within the cell. Radiation scattering and propagation are simulated with the exact kernel and discrete ordinate approaches; any set of discrete direction can be selected. In addition to topography and hot spot, leaf specular and first-order polarization mechanisms are modeled. Two major iterative steps are distinguished: 1) Cell illumination with direct sun radiation: Within cell multiple scattering is accurately simulated. 2) Interception and scattering of previously scattered radiation: Atmospheric radiation, possibly anisotropic, is input at this stage. Multiple scattering is stored as spherical harmonics expansions, for reducing computer memory constraints. The model iterates on step 2, for all cells, and stops with the energetic equilibrium. Two simple accelerating techniques can be used: 1) Gauss Seidel method, i.e., simulation of scattering with radiation already scattered at the iteration stage, and (2) decrease of the spherical harmonics expansion order with the iteration order. Moreover, convergence towards the energetic equilibrium is accelerated with an exponential fitting technique. This model predicts the bidirectional reflectance distribution function. of 3-D canopies. Radiation components associated with leaf volume and surface mechanisms are distinguished. It gives also the radiation regime within canopies, for further determination of 3-D photosynthesis rates and primary production. Accurate modeling of multiple scattering within cells, combined with the fact that cells can have different x,y,z dimensions, is well adapted to remote sensing based studies, i.e., scenes with large dimensions. The model was successfully tested with homogeneous covers. Preliminary comparisons of simulated reflectance images with remotely acquired spectral images of a 3-D heterogeneous forest cover stressed the usefulness of the DART model for conducting studies with remotely acquired information.

Currently, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is utilized to study and monitor\' vegetation activity on an operational basis at global scales. Recently developed variants to the NDVI equation, based on improved knowledge of atmosphere, canopy background, and sensor-view geometry, are being considered for use with the EOS Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) sensor. A set of criteria is established to evaluate their performance with respect to the vegetation signal and atmospheric and soil sources of noise. These include the vegetation signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), % relative error, and vegetation equivalent noise (VEN), which form the basis for the evaluation and comparison of vegetation indices (VIs) across a wide range in vegetation covers. The NDVI variant equations outperformed the NDVI by minimizing atmospheric and/or soil background sources of contamination as well as increasing vegetation signal sensitivity. Preliminary estimates, based on the data sets tested here, indicate an overall level of uncertainty of +/- 0.4 LAI (similar to 15% cover) with the use of the soil adjusted and atmospherically resistant vegetation index (SARVI), compared with +/- 0.8 LAI (30% cover) for the NDVI. Eventually, the final evaluation and validation of VIs for MODIS will include a field campaign strategy, simulation studies, and a worldwide establishment of test sites that collectively cover a diverse range of biomes.

The degree of success of the model shows that GIS and the global change data base can be effective modeling tools, especially when functions are added to enhance the modeling capabilities of GIS. One function, INDEX, developed for this case history, is a simple utility that models a single data set as a function of another data set.

Reflectances were measured with an IRIS spectroradiometer over plots of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) sown on different dates and at different densities to produce a wide range in canopy cover. Vegetation color was varied by infecting selected plots with sugar beet yellows virus. Soil brightness was varied by placing trays of peat between the plant rows.

This article describes how a cover index can be derived from Landsat MSS data and how the index can be standardized to remove atmospheric effects and differences in sensor calibration between space-craft. Tests carried out on 1-m-diameter radiometer targets show that the best separation between soil, rock, or stone and vegetated surfaces occurs in the Band 4-Band 5 data space. This separation includes both dry and green vegetation whereas in the commonly used Band 5-Band 7 data space the separation is much less clear if the vegetation is not green. We have therefore developed a vegetation cover index in the Band 4-Band 5 data space. This index, known as PD54, has a similar form to the perpendicular vegetation index of Richardson and Weigand (1977). It is calculated by identifying a soil line or, more correctly, an upper soil band limit, and then determining the perpendicular distance of each pixel from that line. The perpendicular distance is scaled using distances calculated for points or pixels which have 100% cover. In the normal mix of rangeland vegetation at the pixel scale, these reference pixels occupy a very limited area of the Band 4-Band 5 data space and can be treated as a point or as a line of limited length and with a slope similar to that of the soil line. PD54 performs better than several other indices when tested at the Landsat MSS pixel scale using aircraft-mounted radiometer data. It is also less subject to systematic errors when shifting from one vegetation type to another. The principal difficulty in using PD54 as a cover index arises because there is no single soil line. Instead, the position of that line varies with both Munsell soil hue and chroma. Attempts to standardize PD54 for Landsats 1, 2, 4, and 5 showed that the commonly used approach of converting data to exoatmospheric reflectance based on published radiometer gains and offsets does not work. Furthermore, the dark pixel subtraction method of haze correction does not remove all atmospheric effects. It is, however, possible to remove the effects of differences between the different Landsat MSSs and inadequate haze correction by identifying the extremes of the Band 4-Band 5 data space on a particular scene and using them to scale PD54. Once this is done, PD54 gives substantially better estimates of cover from MSS data than Band 5 values which have supposedly been radiometrically standardised.RP PICKUP, G (通讯作者)，CSIRO, DIV WILDLIFE & ECOL, CTR ARID ZONE RES, POB 2111, ALICE SPRINGS, NT 0871, AUSTRALIA.RI Chewings, Vanessa H/A-7402-2011', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 42, 138, 145, 0, 27, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

The focus of this research is the interception of solar and long-wave radiation by a vegetated surface, and the subsequent thermodynamic and biological control of sensible and latent heat release.  In addition, the science teams are investigating the use of satellite remote sensing to monitor the components of the surface energy balance at point, regional and global scales.  Field experiments were conducted in the summer of 1987 and again in the summer of 1989.  Analyses of the 1987 data are reasonably mature, whereas the 1989 data analyses are in the early stages.  In this paper we summarize the results of the analyses to date.  The analyses have shown that the hypotheses linking energy balance components to surface biology and remote sensing are reasonable at a point level, and that satellite remote sensing can potentially provide useful estimates of the surface energy budget.  GOES data have been used to estimate solar insolation at the earth\'s surface to an accuracy of about 21.6 W m-2 and about 8.2 W m-2 for photosynthetically active radiation.  The ratio of near-infrared to red reflectance has also shown to be linearly related to measured CO2 flux.  Radiometric temperatures estimated from remote sensing are highly correlated to the canopy aerodynamic temperatures; however, the remote sensing estimation of H to useful accuracies (+/- 100 W m-2) appears to be a more difficult problem than the accurate estimation of LE.  The investigation of atmospheric scattering and absorption effects on satellite remote sensing of surface radiance shows that the magnitude of atmospheric opacity variations within the FIFE site and with season can have a large effect on satellite measured values of surface radiances.  However, comparisons of atmospherically corrected TM radiances with surface measured radiances agreed to within about 2% in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths and to 6% in the mid-infrared.  Looking at the frequency of cloud-free (< 10%) acquisitions actually achieved during FIFE shows that for land-surface climatology, multiple polar orbiters may be required to achieve the minimum desired acquisition frequency:  once each 5 days.', 'UNIV MARYLAND,COLA,COLLEGE PK,MD 20742.

Despite all the key findings in hydrology, the utility of GRACE-derived Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA) and its time derivative Terrestrial Water Storage Flux (TWSF) have mainly been limited to large catchments due to their coarse spatial resolution. Here, we propose a method to downscale TWSF by incorporating available finer-resolution data. We determine the downscaled TWSF and its uncertainty within a proposed Bayesian framework by incorporating the fine-scale data of TWSF and Soil Moisture Change (SMC) from different available sources. For the Bayesian ingredients, we rely on GRACE data to obtain the prior and rely on copula models to obtain nonparametric likelihood functions based on the statistical relationship between GRACE TWSF with fine-scale TWSF data and SMC. We apply our method to the Amazon Basin and assess the performances of our products from various fine-scale input datasets of TWSFs and SMCs. Given the lack of ground truth for TWSF, we validate our results against space-based Surface Water Storage Change (SWSC) in the Amazon river system and also against the Vertical Crustal Displacements Rate (VCDR) observed by the Global Positioning System (GPS). Overall, the results show that the proposed method is able to estimate a downscaled TWSF, which is informed by GRACE and fine-scale data. Validation shows that our downscaled products are better anticorrelated with VCDR (-0.81) than fine-scale TWSF (-0.73) and show a mean relative RMSE of 26% with SWSC versus 70% for fine-scale TWSF. The proposed methodology can be extended to other coarse scale datasets, which are crucial for hydrological application at regional and local scales.', '[Tourian, Mohammad J.; Saemian, Peyman; Sneeuw, Nico] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Geodesy GIS, Stuttgart, Germany.

However, sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is one of the crops whose interaction with microwave signal is still not fully understood. Here, we aim to analyze and interpret time series of S1 data for sunflower phenology monitoring. The SAR backscattering coefficients in VH (vertical-horizontal) and VV (vertical-vertical) polarizations as well as their ratio (VH/VV) in both ascending and descending orbits were retrieved for three sites located in three different agro-ecological regions in Ukraine. We observed that sunflower backscattering response differs for the ascending and descending orbits for the VV polarization and VH/VV polarization ratio due to the directional behavior of the flower head. Our analysis did not find major change in VH polarization for the two orbits. We also compared the S1-based sunflower phenology with that of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from optical data acquired by Sentinel-2 (S2). Our analysis revealed a considerable correlation r2 > 0.4 between S1 and NDVI for VH and VV polarizations in both ascending and descending orbits; however, we observed lower correlation (r2 < 0.20) for the VH/VV polarization ratio in descending orbit (VH/VVdes). Based on the characteristics of sunflower phenology, we identified two sunflower phenological stages: beginning of flowering (BoF) and end of flowering (EoF). The difference between S1-based dates using VH/VVdes and reference dates was 4.1 and 4.4 days for the BoF and EoF stages, respectively; the use of VH/VVdes+asc yielded weaker results: 7.4 and 6.1 days. These results suggest that the VH/VVdes is a preferable parameter for identifying sunflower phenological stages such as BoF and EoF.', '[Qadir, Abdul; Skakun, Sergii; Eun, Jaemin; Prashnani, Meghavi; Shumilo, Leonid] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.

TSD mapping ap-proaches based on the Spectral Variability Hypothesis (SVH) could provide a reliable alternative to image classification methods. However, such methods have not been tested in large-scale TSD mapping using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images. In this study, we developed a new workflow for large-scale TSD mapping in an approximately 4000 km2 temperate montane forest using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery-based heterogeneity metrics and topographic data. Through a systematic comparison of model performance in 24 prediction scenarios with different combinations of input variables, and a correlation analysis between six image heterogeneity metrics and two in-situ TSD indicators (species richness S and Shannon-Wiener diversity H \'), we assessed the effects of vegetation phenology, image heterogeneity metrics, and sensor type on the accuracy of TSD pre-dictions. Our results show that (1) the combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery produced higher ac-curacy of TSD predictions compared to the Sentinel-2 data alone, and that the further inclusion of topographic data yielded the highest accuracy (S: R2 = 0.562, RMSE = 1.502; H \': R2 = 0.628, RMSE = 0.231); (2) both Multi -Temporal and Spectral-Temporal-Metric data capture phenology-related information of tree species and signif-icantly improved the accuracy of TSD predictions; (3) texture metrics outperformed other image heterogeneity metrics (i.e., Coefficient of Variation, Rao\'s Q, Convex Hull Volume, Spectral Angle Mapper, and the Convex Hull Area), and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived image heterogeneity metrics were most effective in predicting TSD; and (4) the spatial distribution of TSD showed a clear decrease trend along the altitudinal gradient (r = -0.61 for S and -0.45 for H \') and varied significantly among forest types. Our results suggest a good potential of the SVH-based approaches combined with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery and topographic data for large-scale TSD mapping in temperate montane forests.

This is achieved by using about 300 channels between 3.6 and 4.0 mu m and a physically-based approach which properly takes the contribution of the reflected solar radiation into account. Based on about 150 millions observations, the same number of wave-slope probabilities are retrieved for wind speeds (at 10 m) up to 15 m/s. We revisit and discuss the methodology proposed by Cox and Munk (CM) to derive their celebrated wave-slope probability distribution function (pdf) from photographs of the sun glitter. We propose an original and robust approach for accurate retrievals of the 7 parameters appearing in the Gram-Charlier representation of the pdf. Our results for the mean square slopes (MSSs) are fully compatible with those of CM, and with the more recent results by Breon and Henriot, but our lower uncertainties enable to point out departures from the linear wind-speed dependencies and a slight overestimation of the upwind MSS described by the linear fit of CM at moderate wind speed. Our skewness and kurtosis coefficients show clear influences of the wind speed, with a steady decrease of the former and the alongwind kurtosis coefficient being maximal at moderate wind speeds, features that CM could not point out due to the limitations of their measurements. We revisit the renormalization procedure employed by CM to obtain the complete variances from truncated pdfs and show that it imposes stringent conditions on the kurtosis coefficients that allow to determine them accurately, with wind-dependent values specific to the local sea state. We also provide measurements of the shifted position of the most probable slope as well as a demonstration of a qualitative change of regime in the updown wind asymmetry of the wave-slope probability when the wind speed increases.', '[Guerin, Charles-Antoine] Aix Marseille Univ, Univ Toulon, CNRS, IRD,Mediterranean Inst Oceanog MIO, Toulon, France.

In this manuscript, the correlation of the Stokes parameters of the GNSS reflections collected by the Soil Moisture Active Passive - Reflectometry (SMAP-R) with SMAP soil moisture (SM), SMAP vegetation optical depth (VOD), and the Global Forest Canopy Height (CH) are analyzed. SMAP-R is the first hybrid compact polarimetric reflectometer in space, and it provides a valuable dataset useful to design future GNSS-R mission that target polarimetric retrievals. The SMAP-R total-intensity reflectivity is presented, estimated from the bistatic radar cross section assuming coherent reflection. The calibrated intensity and the normalized Stokes parameters of the received wave are compared for a 1-year period to the SMAP VOD, the SMAP SM, the Global Forest CH, and the standard deviation of the digital elevation model. To provide a first assessment of the performance of full-Polarimetric GNSS-R to estimate SM and VOD, a linear regression approach is implemented using the four Stokes parameters and the child Stokes parameters. The two approaches show a correlation coefficient of R = 0.73 and R = 0.55 to estimate SM and VOD, respectively, enabling the estimation of both variables using polarimetric GNSS-R data without the need for ancillary data.

Although SIF contains more physiological information than NIRvP, NIRvP can have higher data quality and spatio-temporal resolution. Therefore, the two variables can be considered complementary for GPP monitoring. Here, we propose a simple framework to combine SIF and NIRvP data from different data sources to generate an enhanced SIF product (eSIF). The original SIF data comes from the TROPOMI instrument onboard the Sentinel-5P mission, whereas NIRvP data are derived from MODIS spectral reflectance and ERA5 reanalysis data. The resulting eSIF product has a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees and a temporal resolution of 8 days, as well as a higher signal-to-noise ratio and a lower angular dependency than the original TROPOMI SIF data. Our results demonstrate that eSIF has similar spatial patterns to the original SIF but is more spatially continuous and less noisy. Comparisons with the FLUXCOM global GPP product show that eSIF has a more universal relationship with GPP than NIRvP for different grass/crop plant functional types (the coefficients of variation are 18.9% for slopes of GPP to eSIF and 27.3% for slopes of GPP to NIRvP), but NIRvP outperforms eSIF for tracking GPP for forest PFTs exclude BoENF. Moreover, eSIF is able to better track the seasonal variations in GPP related to environmental stresses. This study highlights that our methodology based on the combination of SIF and NIRvP is a promising approach for better monitoring of GPP.', '[Liu, Xinjie; Liu, Liangyun; Chen, Jidai; Ma, Yan; Chen, Ruonan; Du, Shanshan] Int Res Ctr Big Data Sustainable Dev Goals, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.

The instrument employs a Fresnel-lens optical system and a focal surface composed of 36 Multi-Anode Photomultiplier tubes, 64 channels each, for a total of 2304 channels with single photon counting sensitivity. Mini-EUSO also contains two ancillary cameras to complement measurements in the near infrared and visible ranges. The scientific objectives of the mission range from the search for Extensive Air Showers (EAS) generated by Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) with energies above 10(21) eV, the search for nuclearites and Strange Quark Matter (SQM), up to the study of atmospheric phenomena such as Transient Luminous Events (TLEs), meteors and meteoroids. Mini-EUSO can map the night-time Earth in the near UV range (predominantly between 290-430 nm) with a spatial resolution of about 6.3 km (full field of view equal to 44 degrees) and a maximum temporal resolution of 2.5 mu s, observing our planet through a nadir-facing UV-transparent window in the Russian Zvezda module. The detector saves triggered transient phenomena with a sampling rate of 2.5 mu s and 320 mu s, as well as continuous acquisition at 40.96 ms scale. In this paper we discuss the detector response and the flat-fielding and calibration procedures. Using the 40.96 ms data, we present similar or equal to 6.3 km resolution night-time Earth maps in the UV band, and report on various emissions of anthropogenic and natural origin. We measure ionospheric airglow emissions of dark moonless nights over the sea and ground, studying the effect of clouds, moonlight, and artificial (towns, boats) lights. In addition to paving the way forward for the study of long-term variations of light of natural and artificial origin, we also estimate the observation live-time of future UHECR detectors.', '[Casolino, M.; Bisconti, F.; Cambie, G.; Marcelli, L.; Picozza, P.; Reali, E.; Romoli, G.] Ist Nazl Fis Nucl, Sez Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.

Most attention has focused on LCLUC in tropical forests, and so information regarding the magnitude, geography, and rate of LCLUC across sub-tropical and temperate ecosystems in Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay (APU) is incomplete. To address this, we used Landsat to map changes in the fractional cover of bare ground, woody cover, and herbaceous vegetation at annual time steps from 1999 to 2019 over APU. Using field observations and Landsat imagery, we created a spectral library representative of these three cover types. We trained a machine learning model to map annual fractional cover at 30 m spatial resolution, and used a Bayesian change point algorithm to characterize spatial and temporal trajectories of LCLUC. Our results reveal that 11.6% of the study domain experienced changes in land cover composition over APU between 1999 and 2019. The most substantial changes were herbaceous cover gain (87,507 symbolscript 2730 km2), woody cover loss (101,528 symbolscript 2843 km2), and bare ground gain (31,354 symbolscript 934 km2). Herbaceous cover in Paraguay increased by 51%, mostly because of deforestation for cattle ranching in the Dry Chaco and commodity crop agriculture in the Atlantic Forest. Uruguay showed a 62% increase in woody cover arising from the emergence and growth of pine and eucalyptus plantations. Argentina, the largest and most heterogeneous of the three countries, experienced a 38% increase in bare ground in the Patagonian Steppe due to climate and anthropogenic drivers, including reduced precipitation. Quantification of these abrupt and gradual LCLUC processes can be used to improve models of the carbon and energy budgets in southern South America, especially in arid and semi-arid ecoregions because they are increasingly understood to be important drivers of the interannual variability of the global carbon cycle.', '[Stanimirova, Radost; Olofsson, Pontus; Friedl, Mark A.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, 725 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.

Air pollution combined with high moisture availability in the shallow boundary layer, are important factors affecting the persistence and widespread nature of fog over the IGP. Despite the environmental significance and impacts on the public at-large, an in depth understanding of the long-term spatial-temporal distribution of the south Asian fog, is presently not available in the literature. We utilize infrared remote sensing techniques to develop a high-resolution (asymptotic to 1 km x 1 km) fog/low-stratus detection climatology over the past two decades (2002-2020), using Aqua/MODIS satellite observations. A dynamic brightness temperature difference threshold (involving 3.96 mu m and 11.03 mu m bands) for nighttime fog/low-stratus detection is constructed based on systematic radiative transfer simulations involving cloud effective radius, cloud top height, liquid water path and satellite viewing geometry. Our satellite-based fog/low-stratus detection is consistent with theoretical simulations of fog characterization and is also found to be well-correlated with near-surface visibility observations of dense fog (r = 0.89, p-value << 0.01). We also provide satellite -derived nighttime estimates of fog/low-cloud effective radius that are comparable to the operational daytime MODIS cloud data product and limited in situ observations. In terms of fog/low-stratus frequency, the IGP is relatively uniformly covered by widespread fog/low-stratus occurrences with the largest frequency found in the low-lying Terai region, bordering India and Nepal, which is also consistently observed in our daytime fog/low-stratus detection results over the last two decades. Additionally, the interannual variations in fog/low-stratus occurrences track closely with that of relative humidity in the IGP, which is associated with shallow boundary layer conditions during winter-time favoring the formation and persistence of fog. Overall, these long-term satellite-derived results present new high-resolution data and insights into the dense and often intense winter fog occurrences which routinely engulf the entire stretch of the Indo-Gangetic Plains and cause significant degradation to ground visibility in one of the world\'s most densely populated regions.', '[Singh, Manoj K.] Univ Petr & Energy Studies, Sch Engn, Dehra Dun 248007, Uttarakhand, India.

Hitherto, some studies have been carried out to retrieve fine-mode aerosol microphysical properties from multi-wavelength lidar measurements. However, there has been a dearth of lidar-based methods with quality retrieval and high time efficiency to adequately quantify the impacts of fine-mode aerosols on Earth\'s energy budget. The reasons for the gap involve the limitations in current approaches and the nature of the under-determined problem with insufficient information of three backscattering coefficients (beta) and two extinction coefficients (alpha), typically known as the 3 beta + 2 alpha configuration. Furthermore, the latest lidars, especially for spaceborne and airborne applications, are inherently difficult to perform routine diurnal 3 beta + 2 alpha observations with high resolution and require high processing speed for massive data. To overcome these conundrums, we developed a novel unsupervised machine learning method-multivariate Full-permutAtion based Stochastic foresT method (dubbed the FAST method)-to improve the retrieval of fine-mode aerosol microphysical properties. To the best of knowledge, this work is the first time that machine learning algorithms are employed in attempts to retrieve the aerosol microphysical properties with stand-alone multi-wavelength lidar data. The major merits of the FAST method include 1) high accuracy of fine-mode aerosol products with the typical 3 beta + 2 alpha configuration, 2) acceptable performances for fewer input optical channels, and 3) high processing speed for large volume data. Comprehensive simulations have been conducted to investigate the error characteristic of the FAST method under different conditions. We also applied the FAST method to the airborne lidar data acquired during the NASA DISCOVER-AQ field campaign. The retrievals of the FAST method provide high resolution time-height distributions of fine-mode aerosol microphysical properties at 20-s temporal resolution and 45-m vertical resolution. In situ measurements are compared with multi-wavelength lidar retrievals showing good agreements. We achieved 0.010, 0.014 and 0.016 in terms of mean absolute difference for retrieved 532-nm single-scattering albedo with 3 beta + 2 alpha, 3 beta + 1 alpha, and 2 beta + 1 alpha configurations, respectively. The proposed method is expected to represent an important step toward improving microphysical retrievals from multi-wavelength lidar data, especially for airborne and spaceborne lidar missions.', '[Wang, Nanchao; Xiao, Da; Liu, Yuxuan; Zhang, Kai; Tong, Yicheng; Wu, Lingyun; Chen, Feitong; Wang, Binyu; Liu, Chong; Liu, Dong] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Opt Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Modern Opt Instrumentat, Hangzhou 310000, Peoples R China.

The issue of satellite-ground mismatch, though previously recognized, has not been given sufficient attention in the relevant scientific literature due to: (i) satellite SSI have mostly focused on relatively longer-term data, such as hourly, daily and longer; and/or (ii) most studies assessed only global (or total) irradiance. Also, studies addressing this satellite-ground mismatch issue often require a dense ground network to characterize the spatial representativeness of ground measurements, which likely limited performing such studies. With shorter-term satellite SSI data, such as 10-min or less, and the direct and diffuse components becoming increasingly available, further investigation of this satellite-ground mismatch issue is warranted. Our analysis, using direct and diffuse component SSI observations from satellite and sparse ground sites showed that a large part of apparent validation errors may have been due to the satellite-ground mismatch, often exceeding 50% in the case of 10-min direct normal irradiance. Greater appreciation and understanding of this issue should lead to more objective assessment of the real quality of satellite SSI products. Our study also showed that several factors, such as spatial averaging, temporal averaging, solar zenith angle and view zenith angle, all have often substantial impacts on the validation outcomes, over 100 W/m(2) in some cases, highlighting the necessity for the ground-and satellite-based solar radiation communities to co-develop protocols for satellite SSI data validation.', '[Qin, Yi; Huang, Jing] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Canberra, Australia.

The health and economic impacts associated with harmful algal blooms, or HABs, provide compelling rationale for developing new methods for monitoring these events via remote sensing. Although concentrations of chlorophyll -a and key pigments like phycocyanin are routinely estimated from satellite images and used to infer algal or cyanobacterial cell counts, current methods are unable to provide information on the taxonomic composition of a bloom. This study introduced a new approach capable of differentiating among genera based on their reflectance characteristics: Spectral Mixture Analysis for Surveil-lance of HABs, or SMASH. The foundation of SMASH is a multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) algorithm that takes a library of cyanobacteria endmembers and a hyperspectral image as input and estimates the fractional abundance of each genus, plus water, on a per-pixel basis. Importantly, we assume that the water column consists of only pure water and cyanobacteria, implying that our linear spectral unmixing models do not account for other optically active constituents such as suspended sediment and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). We used reflectance spectra for 12 genera measured under a microscope to populate an algal spectral library and applied the SMASH workflow to satellite images from four waterbodies across the United States. Normalized spectral separability scores indicated that the 12 genera were distinct from one another and the MESMA algorithm reproduced known input fractions for simulated mixtures that included all pairwise combinations of genera and water. We used Upper Klamath Lake as an example to illustrate data products generated via SMASH: maps of the normalized difference chlorophyll index and cyanobacterial index, a MESMA-based classification of algal genera, fraction images for each endmember, and a root mean square error (RMSE) image that summarizes uncertainty. For Upper Klamath Lake, these outputs highlighted a complex algal bloom featuring several genera, primarily Aphanizomenon, and intricate spatial patterns associated with gyres. The maximum RMSE constraint imposed on the MESMA algorithm provided a means of avoiding false positive detection of genera not present in a waterbody but must not be set so low as to leave much of an image un-classified in cases where genera included in the library are present. Comparison of endmember fractions with relative biovolumes calculated from field samples indicated that taxonomic information from SMASH was consistent with field observations. For example, the algorithm successfully identified Microcystis in Owasco Lake but avoided misclassifying Asterionella, a genus not yet included in our library, in Detroit Lake. This proof -of-concept investigation demonstrates the potential of SMASH to enhance our understanding of algal blooms, particularly with respect to their spatial and temporal dynamics.', '[Legleiter, Carl J.] US Geol Survey, 4620 Technol Dr,Suite 400, Golden, CO 80403 USA.

Accurate and current maps of these geomorphology classes from local (100 m(-1) km) to global (105 km) scales are important for a range of objectives in the coastal zone. Previous methods to create coastal geomorphic maps relied heavily on manual efforts and expert opinions. However, these approaches are labour intensive and impractical for consistent application at a global scale, while still including local details. Existing global coastal geomorphology datasets are a compilation of different local-scale datasets, with varying spatial, categorical resolutions and accuracies. The recent availability of \"big \" and \"open \" data as well as increased processing capabilities resulted in the use of satellite images and digital elevation models to identify sandy beach and cliff separately. In our work, these raster data were processed on Google Earth Engine, combined with shape descriptors of coastline vectors and then fitted into machine learning models to classify the intertidal coastal geomorphology into bedrock, beach or wetland classes on the global scale (from 56 S to 60 N, excluding coral reef/fringing reef and fjord dominated coasts). A unique attribute of this new method was the incorporation of shape descriptors extracted from shoreline vector data, which substantially improved the classification accuracy. Using existing data from European Union (EU), the United States of America (US) and Australia for training and testing, the model achieved averaged 85% accuracy for testing datasets in these continents and 84% accuracy for 10,000 independent global validation samples beyond these continents. Successful classification was achieved for coasts dominated by a single geomorphology class, as well as more complex environments, such as headland bay and barrier island systems, where multiple classes appear next to each other. The model had relatively less confidence in coasts with sandy cliffs, tall canopy cover and engineered structures. Complete statistics from this study covering 56 S to 60 N showed 36.8% (142,845 km) wetland, 26.7% (103,762 km) beach and 36.5% (141,579 km) bedrock. Beach and bedrock geomorphic classes were commonly detected at mid-latitudes (30o to 60o N/S), while wetland dominated tropical latitudes (0o to 30o N/S). The output dataset can be used for different coastal management purposes. The accuracy and categorical resolution of the classification can be further improved with the development of Earth Observation Big Data in the future.', '[Mao, Yongjing; Harris, Daniel L.; Xie, Zunyi; Phinn, Stuart] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.

Accordingly, this paper presents a deep neural network (DNN) that utilizes the merits of a suite of existing satellite and reanalysis products to produce a new SM product with minimum (maximum) bias (correlation) - using NASA\'s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data and ERA5 reanalysis. The benchmark of the network is a bias-adjusted SM with maximum correlation with in situ data over each land cover type. The mean of the benchmark data is adjusted to the product that exhibits a minimum bias over each land-cover type. Consistent with the laws of L-band microwave propagation in soil and canopy, the input variables of DNN include polarized SMAP brightness temperatures, incidence angle, vegetation scattering albedo, surface roughness parameter, surface water fraction, effective soil temperatures, bulk density, clay fraction, and vegetation optical depth from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) climatology. The DNN is trained and validated using two years (04/2015-03/2017) of global data and deployed for assessment of its performance from 04/2017 to 03/2021. The testing results against in situ measurements demonstrate that the DNN outputs typically exhibit improved error quality metrics over most land-cover types and climate regimes and can properly capture SM temporal dynamics, beyond each SMAP product across regional to continental scales.', '[Gao, Lun; Ebtehaj, Ardeshir] Univ Minnesota, Dept Civil,Environm & Geo Engn, St Anthony Falls Lab, Minneapolis, MN 55414 USA.

In this study, the effect of parallax error between the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) and Himawari-8 data is corrected based on parallax correction algorithm by referring to cloud parameters extracted from the CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) cloud property product. Due to the different sensitivity of different channels to clouds, this study treats the CALIOP data with cloud optical depth greater than 0.2 as clouds, otherwise as clear sky. Cloud property retrieval model based on the XGBoost machine learning (ML) algorithm is developed for the advanced Himawari imager (AHI) onboard the Himawari-8 satellite. The ML model can achieve unified cloud mask, cloud top temperature (CTT), and cloud top height (CTH) retrieval for both daytime and nighttime with high spatial (0.02) and temporal (10 min) resolutions using the AHI thermal data. The retrieval results are extensively evaluated over study regions (80E ~ 135E, 18N ~ 55N) by comparisons with cloud property products of JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) AHI, MODIS, and CALIOP data. The ML algorithm has higher cloud detection accuracy with cloudy sky (clear sky) hit rate (CHR) and false alarm rate (FAR) of 90.79% (88.35%) and 5.74% (4.67%) compared with the JAXA AHI (CHR = 92.81% (60.64%) and FAR = 19.66% (3.61%)) and MODIS (CHR = 88.50% (72.32%) and FAR = 13.10% (6.06%)) cloud products, and the ML algorithm also performs well for thin clouds over bright surfaces.

However, spatially explicit and high temporal-resolution glacier mass loss over the entire SETP has not been well quantified. We developed an approach to integrate satellite altimetry (ICESat, CryoSat-2, and ICESat-2) with DEM differencing and satellite gravity to resolve high spatiotemporally resolved glacier surface elevation change and mass balance across the SETP for the past two decades. We generated DEMs from ASTER L1A stereo-images to estimate the multi-year elevation change, which was used to correct for the altimetry-based counterpart. Subsequently, we processed three different satellite altimetry data and total water storage (TWS) products specifically. Finally, we obtained time series of glacier elevation change and mass balance through the integration of satellite altimetry-, satellite gravity-, and DEM-derived elevation changes during 2000-2020. Results show rapid and heterogeneous glacier depletion with a mean mass loss rate of-0.66 +/- 0.02 m water equivalent (w.e.)/yr during 2003-2020 and an accelerating trend over the past two decades. The strongest downwasting was observed in the Hengduan Mountains (-1.29 +/- 0.32 m w.e./yr). Contiguous glaciers distributed mostly in Bomi County have a slower rate of elevation changes but play a dominant role in the regional mass balance. Glacier terminus types have a significant impact on glacier melting. The mass loss rate of lake-terminating glaciers is 45% higher than that of land terminating glaciers, suggesting increasing risks of glacial lake outbursts caused by rapid glacier melting across the SETP. These spatially explicit and high-temporal-resolution features of glacier mass loss will be extremely valuable for calibrating and validating glaciological and hydrological models. Our approach also shows a promising application of CryoSat-2 to mountain glaciology and its potential of estimating glacier mass balances over similar regions globally.', '[Zhao, Fanyu; Long, Di; Li, Xingdong; Huang, Qi; Han, Pengfei] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.', 'Tsinghua UniversityRP Long, D (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.', 'dlong@tsinghua.edu.cnRI Long, Di/N-8049-2013', 'Long, Di/0000-0001-9033-5039; Zhao, Fanyu/0000-0003-2203-4001', 'Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program   [2019QZKK0105]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [92047301,   91547210]', 'This study was supported by the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific   Expedition and Research (STEP) program (2019QZKK0105) and the National   Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 92047301 and 91547210) .

Most reflectance spectra of sea snots show largely featureless spectral shapes, with continuous reflectance increases from the blue to the red, which then become flat toward the near infrared wavelengths. Some reflectance spectra show a local trough around 670 nm, indicating presence of chlorophyll a pigment, and thereby live algae.

Its increasing frequency is often related to an accelerated use of ground-water and land resources in the region. In this work, we use a combined approach of radar interferometry and spatial clustering analysis over three selected sites in West-Central Florida to identify localized deformation that may be caused by sinkhole activity. The region of West-Central Florida is a densely active sinkhole region, where sinkholes tend to be small and land cover is mixed resulting in variable interferometric coherence that complicates Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) surveys. In this work, we present a combined methodology implementing InSAR and a Density-Based Spatial Clustering Analysis (DBSCAN) algorithm to detect unknown sinkhole activity and to alert to possible precursors of sinkhole collapse.

Based on certain mathematical rules, data assimilation can merge satellite observations and land surface models, and produce spatiotemporally continuous profile soil moisture. The two mainstream assimilation algorithms (variational-based and sequential-based) both need model error and observation error estimates, which greatly impact the assimilation results. Moreover, the performance of land data assimilation relies heavily on the specification of model parameters. However, it is always challenging to specify these errors and model parameters. In this study, a dual-cycle assimilation algorithm was proposed for addressing the above issue. In the inner cycle, the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is run with parameters of both model and observation operators and their errors, which are provided by the outer cycle. Both the analyzed state variable and the innovation are reserved at each analysis moment. In the outer cycle, the innovation time series kept by the inner cycle are fed into a likelihood function to adjust the values of parameters of both the model and observation operators and their errors through an optimization algorithm. A series of assimilation experiments were first performed based on the Lorenz-63 model. The results illustrate that the performance of the dual-cycle algorithm substantially surpasses those of both the classical parameter calibration and the standard EnKF. Subsequently, the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer of earth Observing System (AMSR-E) brightness temperatures were assimilated into the simple biosphere model scheme version 2 (SiB2) with a radiative transfer model as the observation operator in two experimental areas, namely Naqu on the Tibetan Plateau and a Coordinate Enhanced Observing (CEOP) reference site in Mongolia. The results indicate that the dual-cycle assimilation algorithm can simultaneously estimate model parameters, observation operator parameters, model error, and observation error, thus improving surface soil moisture estimation in comparison with other assimilation algorithms. Since the dualcycle assimilation algorithm can estimate the observation errors, it provides the potential for assimilating multi-source remote sensing data to generate physically consistent land surface state and flux estimates.', '[Tian, Jiaxin; Chen, Yingying; Li, Xin] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Tibetan Plateau Data Ctr, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surfaces, Beijing, Peoples R China.

Since data acquisition is expensive, simulations can complement real data given certain premises are met: (i) models of 3D scene and scanner are available and (ii) modelling of the beam-scene interaction is simplified to a computationally feasible while physically realistic level. A number of laser scanning simulators for different purposes exist, which we enrich by presenting HELIOS++. HELIOS++ is an open-source simulation framework for terrestrial static, mobile, UAV-based and airborne laser scanning implemented in C++. The HELIOS++ concept provides a flexible solution for the trade-off between physical accuracy (realism) and computational complexity (runtime, memory footprint), as well as ease of use and of configuration. Features of HELIOS++ include the availability of Python bindings (pyhelios) for controlling simulations, and a range of model types for 3D scene representation. Such model types include meshes, digital terrain models, point clouds and partially transmissive voxels, which are especially useful in laser scanning simulations of vegetation. In a scene, object models of different types can be combined, so that representations spanning multiple spatial scales in different resolutions and levels of detail are possible. HELIOS++ follows a modular design, where the core components of platform, scene, and scanner can be individually interchanged, and easily configured. HELIOS++ further allows the simulation of beam divergence using a subsampling strategy, and is able to create fullwaveform outputs as a basis for detailed analysis. We show how HELIOS++ positions among other VLS software in terms of input model support and simulation of beam divergence in a literature survey. We also perform a direct comparison of simulations with DART, where we employ a scene from the Radiative Transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI). This example shows that HELIOS++ takes about 10 times longer than DART for parsing and preparing the 3D scene, but performs about 314,000 times faster in the beam simulation, achieving 200,000 rays/s. Comparing HELIOS++ to its predecessor, HELIOS, revealed reduced runtimes by up to 99%. Virtually scanned point clouds may be used for a broad range of applications as shown in literature. We could identify four main categories of use cases prevailing at present, which benefit from simulated LiDAR point clouds: data acquisition planning, method evaluation, method training and sensing experimentation. We conclude that a general-purpose LiDAR simulator can be employed for many different scientific applications, as long as it is ensured that the simulation adequately represents reality, which is specific to the given research question.', '[Winiwarter, Lukas; Weiser, Hannah; Anders, Katharina; Searle, Mark; Hoefle, Bernhard] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Geog, 3DGeo Res Grp, Heidelberg, Germany.

The non-linearity between SIF and GPP at the canopy level was often observed in many previous studies, but the non-linearity between SIFtotal and GPP has not yet been systematically investigated. In this study, based on a theoretical analysis of the relationship between SIF and GPP at the leaf level and how it propagates to the canopy level with the consideration of sunlit and shaded leaf fractions in the canopy, we asserted that non-linear relationships between SIFtotal and GPP at the canopy level are general and physically sound. We derived SIFtotal from two different approaches using TROPOMI SIF data. One is based on the canopy escape ratio of SIF signals observed by satellite sensors (SIFobs), and the other is an angular normalization method. At the site level, we established linear and non-linear (exponential, hyperbolic, and polynomial) regressions between TROPOMI SIF and GPP data from 25 flux tower sites covering the eight biomes. The results indicate that non-linearity between SIFtotal and GPP exists among eight major biomes, and expo-nential regression is the best regression method to capture the non-linearity between SIF and GPP at the site level. We developed a simple variable, SIFnon-linear, to capture the non-linearity between SIFtotal and GPP. R-2 values of the linear correlations between SIFnon-linear and GPP are equal or close to those of exponential corre-lations between SIFtotal and GPP. SIFnon-linear captures the non-linearity well, even though different biomes have different degrees of non-linearity. On the global scale, TROPOMI SIF was compared with GPP simulations of the BEPS model and the SMAP GPP product, showing that SIFnon-linear is a better proxy of GPP than SIFobs and SIFtotal. We find that the non-linearity between SIFtotal and GPP generally exists among eight major biomes regardless of the spatial or temporal scales. The non-linearity is driven by the seasonal variation of the absorbed photosyn-thetically active radiation (APAR). The degree of the non-linearity varies among different biomes, and it is controlled by three factors: the light saturation point of GPP, the variation of APAR during the growing season, and the ratio between the sunlit and shaded portion of the canopy. Temporal aggregation of SIFtotal reduces the non-linearity. Our results indicate that the simple variable SIFnon-linear can replace SIFobs or SIFtotal to improve global SIF-GPP related studies in the future.', '[Liu, Yihong; Chen, Jing M.; Rogers, Cheryl] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Planning, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.

As a primary step, various features, such as lithological units, alteration types, structures, and indicator minerals, are mapped to aid decision-making in targeting ore deposits. Different types of remote sensing datasets, such as satellite and airborne data, make it possible to overcome common problems associated with mapping geological features. The rapid increase in the volume of remote sensing data obtained from different platforms has encouraged scientists to develop advanced, innovative, and robust data processing methodologies. Machine learning methods can help process a wide range of remote sensing datasets and determine the relationship between components such as the reflectance continuum and features of interest. These methods are robust in processing spectral and ground truth measurements against noise and uncertainties. In recent years, many studies have been carried out by supplementing geological surveys with remote sensing datasets, which is now prominent in geoscience research. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the implementation and adaptation of some popular and recently established machine learning methods for processing different types of remote sensing data and investigates their applications for detecting various ore deposit types. We demonstrate the high capability of combining remote sensing data and machine learning methods for mapping different geological features that are critical for providing potential maps. Moreover, we find there is scope for advanced methods such as deep learning to process the new generation of remote sensing data that provide high spatial and spectral resolution for creating improved mineral prospectivity maps.', '[Shirmard, Hojat] Univ Tehran, Sch Min Engn, Coll Engn, Tehran, Iran.

However, it is difficult to establish links between changes in snow cover and shrub distribution changes due to a lack of in situ and long-term snow records in relation to abundance shifts of shrubs at their leading (i.e., cold) and trailing (i.e., warm) edges. We used remote sensing to extract long-term changes in both snow cover and shrub distributions in response to climate change in the alpine tundra of the Changbai Mountains in Northeast China. First, we analyzed spatio-temporal changes in snow cover during the snowmelt period (April 1st to June 15th) over the past 54 years (1965-2019). Then, we analyzed distribution changes of the dominant evergreen alpine shrub, Rhododendron aureum, using 31 years (1988-2019) of Landsat NDVI archives. We applied a novel approach by analyzing NDVI data from autumn only, when R. aureum is green yet most of the surrounding plants are already brown. Finally, we tested the relationship between snowmelt date and the distribution of R. aureum. We found that the fraction cover of R. aureum experienced greater loss than gain in the last 30 years. R. aureum expanded at the leading edge, establishing in snow-rich habitats, yet retracted further at the trailing edge due to loss of snow habitats. We identified the preferred snowmelt regime (habitats with snowmelt date of 20 April or later) of this shrub species and found that further advances in snowmelt dates would lead to the upward range shift of R. aureum in a warming climate. Our results indicate that spring snow cover change affected distribution changes of R. aureum. Our study highlights that long-term changes in snow cover due to climate change have already had marked impacts on plant species distributions in alpine ecosystems.', '[Zong, Shengwei; Du, Haibo; He, Hong S.; Wu, Zhengfang] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Geog Proc & Ecol Secur Changbai Mt, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China.

Particularly ice-rich permafrost is vulnerable to rapid thaw and erosion, impacting whole landscapes and ecosystems. Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) are abrupt permafrost disturbances that expand by several meters each year and lead to an increased soil organic carbon release. Local Remote Sensing studies identified increasing RTS activity in the last two decades by increasing number of RTS or heightened RTS growth rates. However, a large-scale assessment across diverse permafrost regions and at high temporal resolution allowing to further determine RTS thaw dynamics and its main drivers is still lacking. In this study we apply the disturbance detection algorithm LandTrendr for automated large-scale RTS mapping and high temporal thaw dynamic assessment to North Siberia (8.1 x 106km2). We adapted and parametrised the temporal segmentation algorithm for abrupt disturbance detection to incorporate Landsat+Sentinel-2 mosaics, conducted spectral filtering, spatial masking and filtering, and a binary machine-learning object classification of the disturbance output to separate between RTS and false positives (F1 score: 0.609). Ground truth data for calibration and validation of the workflow was collected from 9 known RTS cluster sites using very highresolution RapidEye and PlanetScope imagery. Our study presents the first automated detection and assessment of RTS and their temporal dynamics at largescale for 2001-2019. We identified 50,895 RTS and a steady increase in RTS-affected area from 2001 to 2019 across North Siberia, with a more abrupt increase from 2016 onward. Overall the RTS-affected area increased by 331% compared to 2000 (2000: 20,158 ha, 2001-2019: 66,699 ha). Contrary to this, 5 focus sites show spatiotemporal variability in their annual RTS dynamics, with alternating periods of increased and decreased RTS development, indicating a close relationship to thaw drivers. The majority of identified RTS was active from 2000 onward and only a small proportion initiated during the assessment period, indicating that the increase in RTS-affected area was mainly caused by enlarging existing RTS and not by new RTS.

Although several individual algorithms have been proven to capture local variations in cyanobacteria biomass in specific regions, their performance has not been assessed on hyperspectral images from satellite sensors. Our work leverages a machine-learning model, Mixture Density Networks (MDNs), trained on a large (N = 939) dataset of collocated in situ chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chla), PCs, and remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) measurements to estimate PC from all relevant spectral bands. The performance of the developed model is demonstrated via PC maps produced from select images of the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) and Italian Space Agency\'s PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) using a matchup dataset. As input to the MDN, we incorporate a combination of widely used band ratios (BRs) and line heights (LHs) taken from existing multispectral algorithms, that have been proven for both Chla and PC esti-mation, as well as novel BRs and LHs to increase the overall cyanobacteria biomass estimation accuracy and reduce the sensitivity to increment Rrs. When trained on a random half of the dataset, the MDN achieves uncertainties of 44.3%, which is less than half of the uncertainties of all viable optimized multispectral PC algorithms. The MDN is notably better than multispectral algorithms at preventing overestimation on low (<10 mg m(-3)) PC. Visibly, HICO and PRISMA PC maps show the wider dynamic range that can be represented by the MDN. The available in situ and satellite-derived Rrs matchups and measured in situ PC demonstrate the robustness of the MDN for estimating low (<10 mg m(-3)) PC and the reduced impact of increment Rrs on medium-to-high in situ PC (>10 mg m(-3)). According to our extensive assessments, the developed model is anticipated to enable practical PC products from PRISMA and HICO, therefore the model is promising for planned hyperspectral missions, such as the Plankton Aerosol and Cloud Ecosystem (PACE).

Although numerous reconstruction methods have been developed, they have not effectively addressed the issues associated with large gaps in the time series over cloudy and rainy regions, due to the insufficient utilization of the spatial, temporal and periodical correlations. In this paper, an adaptive SpatioTemporal Tensor Completion method (termed ST-Tensor) method is proposed to reconstruct long-term NDVI time series in cloud-prone regions, by making full use of the multi-dimensional spatio-temporal information simultaneously. For this purpose, a highly-correlated tensor is built by considering the correlations among the spatial neighbors, inter-annual variations, and periodic characteristics, in order to reconstruct the missing information via an adaptive-weighted low-rank tensor completion model. An iterative l1 trend filtering method is then implemented to eliminate the residual temporal noise. This new method was tested using MODIS 16-day composite NDVI products from 2001 to 2018 obtained in Mainland Southeast Asia, where the rainy climate commonly induces large gaps and noise in the data. The qualitative and quantitative results indicate that the ST Tensor method is more effective than the five previous methods in addressing the different missing data problems, especially the temporally continuous gaps and spatio-temporally continuous gaps. It is also shown that the ST-Tensor method performs better than the other methods in tracking NDVI seasonal trajectories, and is therefore a superior option for generating high-quality long-term NDVI time series for cloud-prone regions.', '[Chu, Dong; Shen, Huanfeng; Guan, Xiaobin] Wuhan Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

Despite the fact that the significant wave height inferred from SAR measurements has been validated against model output and in-situ data, SAR\' s primary and unique capability for operational 2-dimensional spectral description of sea state remains to be fully evaluated. In this study, we extended the previous assessment approaches by introducing a new SAR image spectral parameter, the Mean rAnge Cross-Spectrum (MACS) that focuses on the isolated wave scales along the radar line-of-sight direction. MACS is an efficient variable in that it characterizes the local wave spectra properties without need of the non-linear wave inversion procedure. The assessment is based on the multiple-year data acquired by Envisat/ASAR wave mode, along with the collocated WaveWatch III (WW3) hindcast and the in-situ buoy-observed wave spectra, for which the SAR forward transformation is systematically performed to obtain the simulated image spectra. Inter-comparison between SAR-measured and WW3-simulated MACS demonstrates that the consistency is wavelength (or wavenumber) dependent. Three typical wavelengths, around 62 m for windsea, 168 m for intermediate waves and 342 m for swell, are selected to present the MACS comparison in detail. Comparable magnitude of SAR-measured and the simulated MACS is observed for the intermediate waves and swell, while larger simulation values are predicted for the windsea waves. Spatial distribution of MACS agrees well between these two data sets for all wavelengths with high correlation coefficients (>0.8) in most of the global ocean. One exception is in the extratropics where the quantitative difference is particularly notable. In the contrary, when comparing SAR-measured and buoys-simulated MACS, the agreement increases towards the shorter (<100 m) wavelengths. We also found that the large-scale atmospheric/oceanic features persistent on SAR images lead to the overestimate of SAR MACS at long wavelengths, which is expected to bias the wave inversion. The wave spectra retrieval performance shall advance as long as such impact is properly resolved.', '[Li, Huimin; Zhang, Biao; He, Yijun] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Marine Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China.

The diverse reflectance spectra caused by chemically varying polymer types and their different kinds of brightness and transparencies, which are, moreover, influenced further by the respective surface backgrounds. This paper investigates the capability of WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite data, characterized by a high spatial resolution and equipped with eight distinct and relatively narrow SWIR bands suitable for global monitoring of different types of plastic materials. To meet the objective, hyperspectral measurements and simulations were conducted in the laboratory and by aircraft campaigns, based on the JPL-ECOSTRESS, USGS, and inhouse hyperspectral libraries, all of which are convolved to the spectral response functions of the WV-3 system. Experiments further supported the analyses wherein different plastic materials were placed on different backgrounds, and scaled percentages of plastics per pixel were modeled to determine the minimum detectable fractions. To determine the detectability of plastics with various chemical and physical properties and different fractions against diverse backgrounds, a knowledge-based classifier was developed, the routines of which are based on diagnostic spectral features in the SWIR range. The classifier shows outstanding results on various background scenarios for lab experimental imagery as well as for airborne data and it is further able to mask non-plastic materials. Three clusters of plastic materials can clearly be identified, based on spectra and imagery: The first cluster identifies aliphatic compounds, comprising polyethylene (PE), polyvinylchloride (PVC), ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVAC), polypropylene (PP), polyoxymethylene (POM), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and polyamide (PA). The second and third clusters are diagnostic for aromatic hydrocarbons, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), polycarbonate (PC), and styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN), respectively separated from polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and polyurethane (PU). The robustness of the classifier is examined on the basis of simulated spectra derived from our HySimCaR model, which has been developed inhouse. The model simulates radiation transfer by using virtual 3D scenarios and ray tracing, hence, enables the analysis of the influence of various factors, such as material brightness, transparency, and fractional coverage as well as different background materials. We validated our results by laboratory and simulated datasets and by tests using airborne data recorded at four distinct sites with different surface characteristics. The results of the classifier were further compared to results produced by another signature-based method, the spectral angle mapper (SAM) and a commonly used technique, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Finally, we applied and successfully tested the classifier on WV-3 imagery of sites known for a high abundance of plastics in Almeria (Spain), Cairo (Egypt), and Accra, (Ghana, West Africa). Both airborne and WV-3 data were atmospherically corrected and transferred to \"at-surface reflectances\". The results prove the combination of WV-3 data and the newly designed classifier to be an efficient and reliable approach to globally monitor and identify three clusters of plastic materials at various fractions on different backgrounds.', '[Zhou, Shanyu; Kuester, Theres; Bochow, Mathias; Bohn, Niklas; Brell, Maximilian] German Res Ctr Geosci GFZ, Remote Sensing & Geoinformat Sect, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.

Over the past several decades, ground observations of wildfire and prescribed fire severity have been acquired across hundreds of wildland fires in the United States, primarily utilizing the Composite Burn Index (CBI) plot protocol. These observations have been coupled to spaceborne passive spectral reflectance indices (e.g. Landsat-derived variations of the Normalized Burn Ratio [NBR]) to produce regression models describing their relationship. Here we develop regression models by vegetation type for multiple vegetation classification systems representing a range of spatial scales, and a decision tree framework for evaluating these regression models. Our overall goals were to determine which scale of ecological classifications provided the best estimate of burn severity from Landsat data and how to choose the best regression model. We aggregated a total of 6280 CBI plots for 234 wildland fires that burned between 1994 and 2017 and produced Landsat-derived NBR and differenced NBR (dNBR) values for each plot. We then calculated best fit linear or higher order regression equations between CBI and NBR/dNBR for each landcover classification system from smallest to largest scale: LANDFIRE Biophysical Settings (BPS), National Vegetation Classification macrogroup (NVC) landcover classifications, Omernick III, II, and I ecoregions, LANDFIRE Fire Regime Groups (FRG), and the entire conterminous United States (CONUS) dataset. The CONUS regression model goodness of fit was moderate (R2 = 0.55, P < 0.001) for dNBR and poor (R2 = 0.30, P < 0.001) for NBR. Within landcover classifications, CBI was better fit by dNBR than NBR. Finer scale regional regression models including BPS (dNBR R2 = 0.56 and 0.00-0.83 R2 range; NBR R2 = 0.43 and 0.00-0.82 R2 range) and NVC (dNBR R2 = 0.55 and 0.15-0.78 R2 range; NBR R2 = 0.41 and 0.00-0.79 R2 range) were on average the same or better than the CONUS models for dNBR and NBR, with the strongest fit models exhibiting R2 >= 0.70, whereas larger scale regional models R2 ranged from 0.28 to 0.5. However, variation in accuracy among landcover types indicate that dNBR and NBR regression models could be used to effectively estimate CBI for future fires in certain regions, while for other regions models may require additional field observations or alternative spectral transformations. Our decision tree schema can be used to help users determine which scale is likely to produce the most accurate results using our models. The CBI regression models developed here, paired with the decision tree, provide users with a simple method to estimate burn severity in units of CBI for any fire within CONUS with moderate to high levels of confidence and provide a template for further development of models with new data going forward.', '[Picotte, Joshua J.] US Geol Survey USGS, Earth Resource Observat & Sci EROS Ctr, Sioux Falls, SD 57198 USA.

Plant functional traits (PTs) are altered during the decline process - initially affecting the physiological condition of the plants with non-visual symptoms and subsequently the leaf pigment content and canopy structure - being its quantification critical for the development of scalable detection methods for effective management. This study examines the relationship between spectral-based PTs and oak decline incidence and severity. We evaluate the use of high-resolution hyperspectral and thermal imagery (< 1 m) together with a 3-D radiative transfer model (RTM) to assess a supervised classification model of holm oak decline. Field surveys comprising more than 1100 trees with varying disease incidence and severity were used to train and validate the model and predictions. Declining trees showed decreases of model-based PTs such as water, chlorophyll, carotenoid, and anthocyanin contents, as well as fluorescence and leaf area index, and increases in crown temperature and dry matter content, compared to healthy trees. Our classification model built using different PT indicators showed up to 82% accuracy for decline detection and successfully identified 34% of declining trees that were not detected by visual inspection and confirmed in a re-evaluation 2 years later. Among all variables analysed, canopy temperature was identified as the most important variable in the model, followed by chlorophyll fluorescence. This methodological approach identified spectral plant traits suitable for the detection of pre symptomatic trees and mapping of oak forest disease outbreaks up to 2 years in advance of identification via field surveys. Early detection can guide management activities such as tree culling and clearance to prevent the spread of dieback processes. Our study demonstrates the utility of 3-D RTM models to untangle the PT alterations produced by oak decline due to its heterogeneity. In particular, we show the combined use of RTM and machine learning classifiers to be an effective method for early detection of oak decline potentially applicable to many other forest diseases worldwide.', '[Hornero, A.; North, P.

To inform restoration objectives with data sources that can characterize individual trees, groups of trees, and the entire stand, different remote sensing strategies such as aerial and terrestrial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) have been explored. Unfortunately, high equipment and operational costs of aerial systems, along with limited spatial extent of terrestrial scanners, have restricted widespread adoption of these technologies for repeated forest monitoring. This study investigates applications of unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery for Structure from Motion derived modeling of individual tree and stand-level metrics. Specifically, we evaluate how flight parameters impact UAS extracted height and imputed DBH accuracies against field stem-mapped values. In total, 30 UAS image datasets collected from combinations of three altitudes, two flight patterns, and five camera orientations were assessed. Tree heights were extracted using a variable window function that searched UAS-derived canopy height models, while DBH was sampled from point cloud slices at 1.32-1.42 m using a least squares circle fitting algorithm. The sample trees were then filtered against National Forest Inventory data from the study region to ensure reasonable matching of extracted heights and diameters. The matched values were used to create a height to diameter relationship for predicting missing DBH values. Extracted and imputed tree values were compared against stem mapped values to determine tree commission and omission rates, the accuracy and precision of extracted tree height, DBH, as well as overstory and understory stand density. Finding that, 1) tree extraction accuracy and correctness was maximized (F-score = 0.77) for nadir crosshatch UAS flight designs; 2) extracted tree height R-2 with stem-mapped values was high (R-2 >= 0.98) for all UAS flight parameters, but the quality (mean error = 0.79 cm) and quantity (similar to 10% of all trees) of extracted DBH values was maximized for lower altitude, nadir crosshatch acquisitions; 3) the distribution of predicted DBH values most closely matched field observed values for off-nadir crosshatch flight designs; 4) using either off-nadir or crosshatch flight designs at lower altitudes maximized correlation (r > 0.70) and accuracy (basal area within 2 m(2) ha(-1)) of stand density estimates. This study demonstrates a novel UAS-based inventory strategy for estimating individual tree structural attributes (i.e., location, height, and DBH) in dry conifer forests, without the need for in situ field observations.', '[Swayze, Neal C.; Tinkham, Wade T.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest & Rangeland Stewardship, 1472 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80524 USA.

In this study, a deep learning based framework is presented to automatically extract BAs from Gaofen-3 (GF-3) data in China. In the framework, a U-Net structure based deep learning with convolutional neural network is implemented for semantic segmentation to extract BAs. To overcome the problem of network degradation when the neural network layers become deeper, residual blocks were introduced via identity shortcut connections to add to U-Net. About 30,000 samples containing different distribution types of BAs and corresponding labeled binary images, which are from 27 scenes of GF-3 SAR images covering different regions (for example plain, hilly and mountainous regions) in China, were obtained for model training. With the trained model, more than 1700 scenes of 10-m resolution GF-3 Fine Stripmap II (FSII) mode singlepolarized images covering the whole country of China were processed to obtain the BA map of China.

The freely available Sentinel-2 imagery at a 10 m spatial resolution with a similar to 5-day repeat cycle provides an opportunity to map vegetation phenology at an unprecedented fine spatial scale. To facilitate the production of a Europe-wide Copernicus Land Monitoring Sentinel-2 based phenology dataset, we design and evaluate a framework based on a comprehensive set of ground observations, including eddy covariance gross primary production (GPP), PhenoCam green chromatic coordinate (GCC), and phenology phases from the Pan-European Phenological database (PEP725). We test three vegetation indices (VI) - the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2), and the plant phenology index (PPI) - regarding their capability to track the seasonal trajectories of GPP and GCC and their performance in reflecting spatial variabilities of the corresponding GPP and GCC phenometrics, i.e., start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS). We find that for GPP phenology, PPI performs the best, in particular for evergreen coniferous forest areas where the seasonal variations in leaf area are small and snow is prevalent during wintertime. Results are inconclusive for GCC phenology, for which no index is consistently better than the others. When comparing to PEP725 phenology phases, PPI and EVI2 perform better than NDVI regarding the spatial correlation and consistency (i.e., lower standard deviation). We also link VI phenometrics at various amplitude thresholds to the PEP725 phenophases and find that PPI SOS at 25% and PPI EOS at 15% provide the best matches with the ground-observed phenological stages.

This is particularly an issue for heterogeneous landscapes, such as tree-grass ecosystems (TGE). In these areas, while appearing homogeneous at larger spatial scales pertaining to a single land cover type, the separation of the spectral signals of the main landscape features (e.g. trees and grasses) may not be achieved at the conventional satellite sensor resolution (e.g. 10-1000 m). This leads to important heterogeneity within the pixel grid that may not be accounted for in traditional modeling frameworks. This study examined the effect of pixel heterogeneity on ET simulations over a complex TGE in central Spain. High resolution hyperspectral imagery from five airborne campaigns forced the two-source energy balance (TSEB) model at 1.5-1000 m spatial resolutions. Along with this, the sharpened (20 m) and original (1000 m) Sentinels for Evapotranspiration (Sen-ET) products were evaluated over the study site for 2017. Results indicated that TSEB accurately simulated ET (RMSD: -60 W/m2) when the pixel scale was able to robustly discriminate between grass and tree pixels (<5 m). However, model uncertainty drastically increased at spatial resolution greater than 10 m (RMSD: -115 W/m2). Model performance remains relatively constant between 30 and 1000 m spatial resolutions, with within pixel heterogeneity being similar at all these scales. For mixed pixels (>= 30 m), forcing an effective landscape roughness into TSEB (RMSD: -80 W/m2) or applying a seasonally changing TSEB (TSEB-2S; RMSD: -65 W/m2) improved the modeling performance. The Sen-ET products behaved similarly at both scales with RMSD of ET roughly 80 W/m2. The non-linear relationship between input parameters and flux output, along with the poor representation of aerodynamic surface roughness, were the main drivers for the increased uncertainties at coarser scales. These results suggest that care should be taken when using global ET products over TGE and similarly heterogeneous landscapes. The modeling procedure should inherently account for the presence of vastly different vegetation roughness elements within the pixel, to achieve reliable estimates of turbulent fluxes over a TGE.', '[Burchard-Levine, Vicente; Riano, David; Martin, M.

The first algorithm is a statistical regression-based retrieval algorithm, while the second is a physically based optimal estimation (OE) algorithm. A database with matching satellite and drifting buoy observations is used to test the performance of each channel configuration using both retrieval algorithms to identify the most optimal channel selection for accurate SST retrievals. The evaluation against in situ observations allows identification of the strengths and weaknesses of the two retrieval algorithms, and demonstrates the importance of using in situ observations to evaluate existing theoretical retrieval uncertainty studies. Overall, the performance increases as expected when more channels are included in the retrieval. In particular, more channels allow a better performance for the range of different observing conditions (e.g. cold waters). The two retrieval algorithms agree that for a three-channel configuration, the 6, 10, 18 GHz (V and H polarization) is better than the 6, 10, 23 GHz configuration (V and H polarization). This is demonstrated for different geographical regions and throughout all seasons. Of the different combinations tested here, it is evident that withholding observations from the 23 and 36 GHz channels from the retrieval has the least impact on the SST performance.

The link between phylogenetic relationships and foliar reflectance spectra of Neotropical species has rarely been considered and no previous studies have explored this in relation to forest regeneration following natural gap formation. We investigated phylogenetic signatures, i.e. evolutionary conservation, of foliar spectra in gap-regenerating woody species in conserved Neotropical forests. We collected foliar spectra of 53 regenerating woody species in the forest gaps at two sites of Atlantic Seasonal Semi-deciduous forest, and quantified the phylogenetic signal for spectral wavelengths using Blomberg\'s K, Pagel\'s lambda (lambda) and LIPA (Local indicator of phylogenetic association) statistics. Analysis of foliar reflectance spectra showed that the largest portion of phylogenetic signature from both K and lambda occurred within the first part of the shortwave infrared region (SWIR-1: 1551-1849 nm), followed by the near infrared (NIR: 701-1349 nm), and the lowest portion within the visible region (VIS: 400-700 nm). Most of the significant phylogenetic signal found for wavelengths of all spectral regions suggested convergent conservation, i.e. homoplasy. The largest portion of positive LIPA (i.e. phylogenetic similarity) was found for wavelengths within the second part of the SWIR (SWIR-2: 2051-2450 nm), while most of the negative LIPA (i.e. phylogenetic distinctiveness) occurred within the VIS. We conclude that there is a tendency towards evolutionary convergence in the phylogenetic signature of foliar spectra in certain parts of the spectrum. The extent of phylogenetic signal found in the SWIR allows us to conclude that this region carries the most potential for future investigations of phylogenetic influence on spectral community dynamics within Neotmpical forests.', '[Diniz, Ecio Souza; Amaral, Cibele Hummel; Sardinha, Silas Tadin] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Engn Florestal, Lab Geoprocessarnento & Sensoriarnento Rernoto, Campus UFV S-N, BR-36570000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil.

Studies have shown that in recent years the clarity of inland and ocean water has decreased in many parts of the world owing to the influence of climate change and human activities. However, changes in inland water clarity exclusively resulting from climate change are largely ignored because most inland water is being utilized by human beings for applications such as waterworks or aquaculture. Therefore, understanding the trends and reasons of inland water clarity under natural conditions is important to recognize the inland water environment shifts under the global changes. Because of the harsh environment, the lakes on the Tibetan Plateau are less disturbed by human activities and are ideal objects for studying water clarity variations attributed to climatic changes. Here, we describe water clarity changes as measured using the Secchi Depth (SD) in 152 big lakes with an area greater than 50 km(2) based on in-situ investigations and the retrieval results from a high accuracy retrieval model (r = 0.94, P < 0.01). Most of the lakes had an SD of 3-10 m, although there was marked spatial variation and a significant positive correlation with lake area (P < 0.01). The mean SD of all 152 lakes significantly increased at a rate of 0.033 m/year (95% CI, 0.021-0.045; P < 0.01) between 2000 and 2019. Variations in lake SD were linked with temporal changes in precipitation, and related to spatial changes of water optical components including suspended matter (0.13 < R-2 < 0.40, P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), fDOM (R-2 = 0.24, P < 0.01) and chlorophyll-a concentration (R-2 = 0.12, P < 0.01).

However, effective phenology retrieval may still be hampered by significant cloud cover. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations are not restricted by weather conditions, and Sentinel-1 thus ensures more frequent observations of the land surface. However, these data have not been systematically exploited for phenology retrieval so far. In this study, we extracted crop-specific land surface phenology (LSP) from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 of major European crops (common and durum wheat, barley, maize, oats, rape and turnip rape, sugar beet, sunflower, and dry pulses) using ground-truth information from the \"Copernicus module\" of the Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS) of 2018. We consistently used a single model-fit approach to retrieve LSP metrics on temporal profiles of CR (Cross Ratio, the ratio of the backscattering coefficient VH/VV from Sentinel-1) and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from Sentinel-2). Our analysis revealed that LSP retrievals from Sentinel-1 are comparable to those of Sentinel-2, particularly for winter crops. The start of season (SOS) timings, as derived from Sentinel-1 and -2, are significantly correlated (average r of 0.78 for winter and 0.46 for summer crops). The correlation is lower for end of season retrievals (EOS, r of 0.62 and 0.34). Agreement between LSP derived from Sentinel-1 and -2 varies among crop types, ranging from r = 0.89 and mean absolute error MAE = 10 days (SOS of dry pulses) to r = 0.15 and MAE = 53 days (EOS of sugar beet). Observed deviations revealed that Sentinel-1 and -2 LSP retrievals can be complementary; for example for winter crops we found that SAR detected the start of the spring growth while multispectral data is sensitive to the vegetative growth before and during winter. To test if our results correspond reasonably to in-situ data, we compared average crop-specific LSP for Germany to average phenology from ground phenological observations of 2018 gathered from the German Meteorological Service (DWD). Our study demonstrated that both Sentinel-1 and -2 can provide relevant and at times complementary LSP information at field- and crop-level.', '[Meroni, Michele; d\'Andrimont, Raphael; Fasbender, Dominique; Lemoine, Guido; Rembold, Felix; Seguini, Lorenzo; Verhegghen, Astrid] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy.

The system assimilates microwave soil moisture retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) radiometer and the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) after bias correction based on cumulative distribution function fitting. The soil moisture assimilation estimates are evaluated with ground-based soil moisture measurements over the continental U.S. for five consecutive warm seasons (May-September of 2015-2019). The result shows that both SMAP and ASCAT retrievals improve the accuracy of soil moisture estimates. Especially, the SMAP single-sensor assimilation experiment shows the best performance with the increase of temporal anomaly correlation by Delta R similar to 0.05 for surface soil moisture and Delta R similar to 0.03 for root-zone soil moisture compared with the LSM simulation without satellite data assimilation. SMAP assimilation is more skillful than ASCAT assimilation primarily because of the greater skill of the assimilated SMAP retrievals compared to the ASCAT retrievals. The skill improvement also depends significantly on the region; the higher skill improvement in the western U.S. compared to the eastern U.S. is explained by the Kalman gain in the two experiments. Additionally, the regional skill differences in the single-sensor assimilation experiments are attributed to the number of assimilated observations.

Even though, when landscapes are highly heterogeneous, the fine-scale ground spatial variation might not be properly captured if FVC products are provided at moderate or coarse spatial scales, as typical of most of operational Earth observing satellite missions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of a RTM inversion approach for estimating FVC from satellite reflectance data at high spatial resolution as compared to the standard use of coarser imagery. The study was conducted both at landscape and plant community levels within the perimeter of a megafire that occurred in western Mediter-ranean Basin. We developed a hybrid retrieval scheme based on PROSAIL-D RTM simulations to create a training dataset of top-of-canopy spectral reflectance and the corresponding FVC for the dominant plant communities. The machine learning algorithm Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR) was learned on the training dataset to model the relationship between canopy reflectance and FVC. The GPR model was then applied to retrieve FVC from WorldView-3 (spatial resolution of 2 m) and Sentinel-2 (spatial resolution of 20 m) surface reflectance bands. A set of 75 plots of 2x2m and 45 plots of 20x20m was distributed under a stratified schema across the focal plant communities within the fire perimeter to validate FVC satellite derived retrieval. At landscape scale, the accuracy of the FVC retrieval was substantially higher from WorldView-3 (R-2 = 0.83; RMSE = 7.92%) than from Sentinel-2 (R-2 = 0.73; RMSE = 11.89%). At community level, FVC retrieval was more accurate for oak forests than for heathlands and broomlands. The retrieval from WorldView-3 minimized the over- and under-estimation effects at low and high field sampled vegetation cover, respectively. These findings emphasize the effectiveness of high spatial resolution satellite reflectance data to capture FVC ground spatial variability in heterogeneous burned areas using a hybrid RTM retrieval method.', '[Fernandez-Guisuraga, Jose Manuel; Calvo, Leonor] Univ Leon, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Area Ecol, Leon 24071, Spain.

Nevertheless, finding methods to accurately quantify carbon assimilation across species and spatial scales remains a challenge. Most methods are either empirical and not transferable across scales or can only be applied if highly complex input data are available. Under stress, the photosynthetic rate is limited by the maximum carboxylation rate (V-cmax), which is determined by the leaf biochemistry and the environmental conditions. V-cmax has been connected to plant photoprotective mechanisms, photosynthetic activity and chlorophyll fluorescence emission. Recent RTM developments such as the Soil-Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model allow the simulation of the sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and V-cmax effects on the canopy spectrum. This development provides an approach to retrieve V-cmax through RTM model inversion and track assimilation rate. In this study we explore SIF, narrow-band indices and RTM inversion to track changes in photosynthetic efficiency as a function of vegetation stress. We use hyperspectral imagery acquired over an almond orchard under different management strategies which affected the assimilation rates measured in the field. V-cmax used as an indicator of assimilation was retrieved through SCOPE model inversion from pure-tree crown hyperspectral data. The relationships between field-measured assimilation rates and V-cmax retrieved from model inversion were higher (r(2) = 0.7-0.8) than when SIF was used alone (r(2) = 0.5-0.6) or when traditional vegetation indices were used (r(2) = 0.3-0.5). The method was proved successful when applied to two independent datasets acquired at two different dates throughout the season, ensuring its robustness and transferability. When applied to both dates simultaneously, the results showed a unique significant trend between the assimilation measured in the field and V-cmax derived using SCOPE (r(2) = 0.56, p < 0.001). This work demonstrates that tracking assimilation in almond trees is feasible using hyperspectral imagery linked to radiative transfer-photosynthesis models.', '[Suarez, L.; Zarco-Tejada, P.

Almost all optical remote sensing data access portals rely to some degree on a cloud cover filter. Here we show that cirrus as well as opaque cloud cover in Sentinel-2 Level-1C (L1C) and Level-2A (L2A) imagery is systematically and significantly overestimated in very high altitude areas (e.g. Himalayas, Andes). We argue that this systematic bias is created by applying simple thresholds to single bands instead of using a multi band spectral signature in the cloud detection process. This results in a lot of \"hidden\" data for very high altitude areas when each image\'s estimated cloud cover is used as an automated selection criterion for analysis (e.g. global analyses, cloud-free mosaic production). We show geographic locations exemplifying this overestimation, and compare the L1C and L2A cloud masks produced by ESA to cloud masks generated by an expert system that uses comprehensive spectral signatures, showing that reliable cloud estimations are possible in very high altitudes. Based on this comparison, we argue for changes to L1C and L2A cloud detection algorithms in order to improve initial querying and selection of big EO data, where reliable yet automated quality indicators are necessary to handle an overwhelming data volume and velocity.

The groundwater is stored in a complex aquifer system composed of alternating layers of coarse sediments and fine-grained sediments acting as confining materials.

Surface deformation poses a hazard to the California Aqueduct, which supports Central Valley agriculture and large urban populations in Southern California. The risk of reduced aqueduct efficacy and expensive repairs compels water resource managers to carefully monitor land deformation in the Valley.

Although there are several conventional methods available in the literature, using these methods to obtain streamflow information at finer spatiotemporal resolutions is not feasible. Moreover, streamflow estimation using single or multi-satellite remote sensing approaches is still in the experimental stage. As advancement in the existing approaches, this study advocates two novel models, namely CMOD and CFUS, which use the Frank copula-based single MODIS satellite data and copula-based multi-satellite MODIS-Landsat fusion data, respectively. These developed models fit a box-centre matrix to the pixel ratios of water (within the river at the gauging station) and land (in the riparian zone) in the near-infrared spectrum. Two other approaches using the stand-alone MODIS data (MOD model) and enhanced spatiotemporal fusion of MODIS-Landsat datasets (FUS model) are also developed to inter-compare with the CMOD and CFUS models for reproducing the daily time series of streamflow at three gauging stations on the Brahmani River in eastern India. The calibration and validation results reveal that the 30 m resolution CFUS model is the best approach for daily-scale streamflow estimation with sufficient accuracy with an average Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient (NSC) of 0.92 followed by the CMOD (NSC = 0.80), FUS (NSC = 0.78), and MOD (NSC = 0.66) models.

Monitoring global aquatic land cover types plays an essential role in preserving aquatic ecosystems and maintaining the ecosystem service they provide for humans, while at the same time their accurate and consistent monitoring for multiple purposes (e.g. climate modelling, biodiversity conservation, water resource management) remains challenging. Although a number of global aquatic land cover (GALC) datasets are available for use to monitor aquatic ecosystems, there are prominent variabilities among these datasets, which is primarily caused by the inconsistency between different land versus water-related monitoring approaches and character-ization schemes. As aquatic land cover exists in many different forms on Earth (e.g. wetland, open water) and can be mapped by different approaches, it is necessary to consider a much more consistent and comprehensive characterization framework that not only ensures the consistency in the monitoring of aquatic land cover but also serves the needs of multiple users (e.g. climate users, agricultural users) interested in different aspects of aquatic lands. In this study, we addressed this issue by 1) reviewing 33 GALC datasets and user needs identified from the citing papers of current datasets and international conventions, policies and agreements in relation to aquatic ecosystems, 2) proposing a global characterization framework for aquatic land cover based on the Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) classifier principles and the identified user needs, and 3) highlighting the opportunities and challenges provided by remote sensing techniques for the implementation of the proposed framework. Results show that users require or prefer various kinds of information on aquatic types including vegetation type, water persistence, the artificiality of cover (i.e. artificial vs natural), water salinity, and the accessibility to the sea (i.e. coastal vs inland). Datasets with medium to high spatial resolution, intra-annual dynamics and inter-annual changes are needed by many users. However, none of the existing datasets can meet all these requirements and a rigorous quantitative accuracy assessment is lacking to evaluate its quality for most of the GALC datasets. The proposed framework has three levels and users are allowed to derive their aquatic land cover types of interest by combining different levels and classifiers of information. This comprehensive mapping framework can help to bridge the gap between user needs and current GALC datasets as well as the gap between generic and aquatic land cover monitoring. The implementation of the framework can benefit from evolving satellite-data availability, improved computation capability and open-source machine learning algorithms, although at the same time it faces challenges mainly coming from the complexity of aquatic ecosystems. The framework proposed in this study provides insights for future operational aquatic land cover monitoring initiatives and will support better understanding and monitoring of complex aquatic ecosystems.', '[Xu, Panpan; Herold, Martin; Tsendbazar, Nandin-Erdene; Clevers, Jan G.

Previous literatures have shown the usefulness of optical remote sensing in lake expansion monitoring and the effectiveness of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) in retrieving permafrost deformation on QTP. However, none of them incorporated both optical remote sensing and InSAR to investigate an event that may exhibit causal links between lake outburst and permafrost degradation. This study integrated both the Google Earth Engine (GEE) analysis on optical images and the small baseline subset (SBAS) processing on SAR datasets to evaluate the potential impact of a lake outburst event on permafrost degradation. The outburst of Zonag Lake (headwater lake) that occurred on 14 September 2011 was focused, and its consequential influence on the permafrost degradation surrounding Salt Lake (tailwater lake) was investigated. The GEE processing on Landsat and HJ-1 imageries allowed an efficient monitoring of the Salt Lake expansion over past 20 years. In addition, the SBAS-InSAR analysis on temporal Envisat and Sentinel-1 datasets further discovered the accelerated permafrost degradation surrounding Salt Lake after 2014. The results provide an evidence that on QTP the outburst of a headwater lake may significantly accelerate the permafrost degradation surrounding the tailwater lake. Such degradation may be attributed to the thermal alteration of the permafrost thawing-freezing cycle and the melting ground ice, along with the subsequent changes on hydrological connectivity and soil permeability. With the continuous trend of the permafrost degradation surrounding Salt Lake, potential risks may be further exposed to the regional environment and infrastructures such as the Qinghai-Tibet railway and highway, thus deserving a particular attention in the near future. The novelties of this study are: 1) technically, the preliminary attempt to integrate the GEE and InSAR techniques for a joint analysis of lake expansion and permafrost degradation, and 2) scientifically, the finding that lake outburst may accelerate permafrost degradation on QTP.', '[Lu, Ping; Han, Jiangping; Li, Zhenshi; Xu, Ruguo; Li, Rongxing; Hao, Tong; Qiao, Gang] Tongji Univ, Coll Surveying & Geoinformat, Siping Rd 1239, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.', 'Tongji UniversityRP Qiao, G (通讯作者)，Tongji Univ, Coll Surveying & Geoinformat, Siping Rd 1239, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.', 'qiaogang@tongji.edu.cnRI shuqian, liu/CAF-5267-2022', 'Qiao, Gang/0000-0002-2010-6238; Lu, Ping/0000-0002-0127-3911', 'National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0603100]; National Natural   Science Foundation of China [41671413, 41771471]', 'This study was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China   (2017YFA0603100) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.   41671413 and No. 41771471).

In order to retrieve the biophysical properties of the tree layer, correcting for forest floor is essential. Traditionally, the algorithms for retrieval of forest floor reflectance depend on tree layer information such as leaf area index, canopy cover, and site fertility. To overcome these circular dependencies, we propose an algorithm that can be applied only using airborne remote sensing data. We acquired airborne hyperspectral imagery over the Hyytiala forest research station (61 degrees 50 \' N, 24 degrees 17 \' E) in central Finland on July 3rd in 2015 using a hyperspectral pushbroom line scanner. The image data had a spectral resolution of 4.6 nm, and the spatial resolution was 0.6 m. We developed a linear spectral unmixing algorithm, which is based on the definition of the reflectance factor, taking into account the variation of incident irradiance inside the canopy. The weights of the mixture can be computed from tree canopy gap fractions, a tree species insensitive leaf albedo, and average tree stand reflectance. Canopy gap fractions were retrieved with empirical methods available in scientific literature. The forest floor reflectance in the near-infrared increased with site fertility in agreement with the forest floor field measurements. Moreover, we found that in near infrared, the reflectance of moderately rich and moist upland forests was significantly different from all other fertility classes. Finally, we tested the reflectance decomposition on the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) known to be heavily affected by understory reflectance and canopy structure, and the forest PRI to be decoupled from the PRI of the overand understory.', '[Markiet, Vincent; Mottus, Matti] VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, POB 1000, FI-02044 Espoo, Vtt, Finland.', 'VTT Technical Research Center FinlandRP Markiet, V (通讯作者)，VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, POB 1000, FI-02044 Espoo, Vtt, Finland.', 'vincent.markiet@vtt.fi; matti.mottus@vtt.fiRI Mõttus, Matti/A-4130-2009', 'Mõttus, Matti/0000-0002-2745-1966', 'Academy of Finland [266152, 272989, 303633, 317387]; Academy of Finland   (AKA) [272989, 317387, 266152, 303633, 317387, 303633, 272989] Funding   Source: Academy of Finland (AKA)', 'The authors would like to thank the Academy of Finland (grants 266152,   272989, 303633 and 317387) for providing the funds.

Previous studies demonstrated a successful retrieval of phenology with Sentinel-2 for relatively stable annual growing seasons. In semi-arid East Africa however, vegetation responds rapidly to a concentration of rainfall over short periods and consequently is subject to strong interannual variability. Obtaining a sufficient density of cloud-free acquisitions to accurately describe these short vegetation cycles is therefore challenging. The objective of this study is to evaluate if data from two satellite constellations, i.e., PlanetScope (3 m resolution) and Sentinel-2 (10 m resolution), each independently allow for accurate mapping of vegetation phenology under these challenging conditions. The study area is a rangeland with bimodal seasonality located at the 128-km(2) Kapiti Farm in Machakos County, Kenya. Using all the available PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 imagery between March 2017 and February 2019, we derived temporal NDVI profiles and fitted double hyperbolic tangent models (equivalent to commonly-used logistic functions), separately for the two rainy seasons locally referred to as the short and long rains. We estimated start and end-of-season for the series using a 50% threshold between minimum and maximum levels of the modelled time series (SOS50/EOS50). We compared our estimates against those obtained from vegetation index series from two alternative sources, i.e. a) greenness chromatic coordinate (GCC) series obtained from digital repeat photography, and b) MODIS NDVI. We found that both PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 series resulted in acceptable retrievals of phenology (RMSD of similar to 8 days for SOS50 and similar to 15 days for EOS50 when compared against GCC series) suggesting that the sensors individually provide sufficient temporal detail. However, when applying the model to the entire study area, fewer spatial artefacts occurred in the PlanetScope results. This could be explained by the higher observation frequency of PlanetScope, which becomes critical during periods of persistent cloud cover. We further illustrated that PlanetScope series could differentiate the phenology of individual trees from grassland surroundings, whereby tree green-up was found to be both earlier and later than for grass, depending on location. The spatially-detailed phenology retrievals, as achieved in this study, are expected to help in better understanding climate and degradation impacts on rangeland vegetation, particularly for heterogeneous rangeland systems with large interannual variability in phenology and productivity.', '[Cheng, Yan; Vrieling, Anton; Marshall, Michael; Gachoki, Stella] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.

This dimensionality reduction of spectral information combined with the output along a continuum of wavelength values offers a robust and user-friendly means to describe and analyze spectral R-rs(lambda) in terms of spatial and temporal trends and variability. The uncertainty in the algorithm\'s estimation of spectral shape is demonstrated on a global scale, in addition to the utility of the algorithm to discern spectral-spatial-temporal trends in the ocean, on a per-pixel basis for the entire 22 year continuous ocean color (SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua) time-series. This technique can be applied to datasets of varying multi- and hyper-spectral resolutions, providing continuity between heritage and future satellite sensors, and further enabling an effective means of elucidating similarities or differences in complex spectral signatures within the constraints of two dimensions.

However, uncertainties remain in the understanding of tropical forest leaf phenology at different spatial scales. Phenocams accurately characterize leaf phenology at the crown and ecosystem scales but are limited to a few sites and time spans of a few years. Time-series satellite observations might fill this gap, but the commonly used satellites (e.g. MODIS, Landsat and Sentinel-2) have resolutions too coarse to characterize single crowns. To resolve this observational challenge, we used the PlanetScope constellation with a 3 m resolution and near daily nadir-view coverage. We first developed a rigorous method to cross-calibrate PlanetScope surface reflectance using daily BRDF-adjusted MODIS as the reference. We then used linear spectral unmixing of calibrated PlanetScope to obtain dry-season change in the fractional cover of green vegetation (GV) and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) at the PlanetScope pixel level. We used the Central Amazon Tapajos National Forest k67 site, as all necessary data (from field to phenocam and satellite observations) was available. For this proof of concept, we chose a set of 22 dates of PlanetScope measurements in 2018 and 16 in 2019, all from the six drier months of the year to provide the highest possible cloud-free temporal resolution. Our results show that MODIS-calibrated dry-season PlanetScope data (1) accurately assessed seasonal changes in ecosystem-scale and crown-scale spectral reflectance; (2) detected an increase in ecosystem-scale GV fraction (and a decrease in NPV fraction) from June to November of both years, consistent with local phenocam observations with R-2 around 0.8; and (3) monitored large seasonal trend variability in crown-scale NPV fraction.

The modeled PWCC for the study area belonged to the respective classes as follows, PWCC0 = 26%, PWCC90 = 14%, PWCC10 = 12%, PWCC80 = 8%, PWCC20 = 7%, PWCC30 = 7%, PWCC70 = 6%, PWCC50 = 5%, PWCC40 = 5%, and PWCC60 = 5%. Statistics indicated that the overall weighted accuracy for the mapped PWCC classes (A(ow)) was 0.82 and that the overall weighted kappa ((k) over cap (w)) was 0.49. To demonstrate the usefulness of the PWCC mapping approach to produce reasonable canopy cover estimates, the relative accuracies of modeled PWCC and other similar canopy cover products (LANDFIRE, NLCD) for the study area were summarized. MAE and RSS values were calculated based on five sample areas of directly measured LiDAR canopy cover estimates. The PWCC mapping approach presented here exhibited significantly MAE values for 5 out of 5 sample areas, and lower RSS values for 4 of 5 sample areas. By class MAE and RSS values were lower for all percentage cover classes. Overall, comparisons of the mapping result with high-resolution aerial imagery and the quantitative assessments indicated that the approach presented here was effective for developing highly detailed canopy cover estimates that can be used for planning and modeling at multiple scales (e.g. regional or local). Additionally, this approach can be employed by individual researchers and is less time and resource consumptive when compared to other large scale approaches. To date, only a limited number of existing studies have focused on approaches that can be used to map tree canopy cover for large areas.', '[Sunde, Michael G.; Diamond, David D.; Elliott, Lee F.; Hanberry, Phillip; True, Diane] Univ Missouri, Sch Nat Resources, Missouri Resource Assessment Partnership 4200 New, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.', 'University of Missouri System; University of Missouri ColumbiaRP Sunde, MG (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Sch Nat Resources, Missouri Resource Assessment Partnership 4200 New, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.', 'sundem@missouri.edu', 'Sunde, Michael/0000-0001-9394-2416', 'Texas A&M Forest Service', 'Funding for the work presented here was provided by the Texas A&M Forest   Service, and the authors would like to acknowledge Curt Stripling, James   Ward, and David Shoemate of the Texas A&M Forest Service for their   support and for helping to make this study possible.

It strongly modulates the terrestrial water, energy, and carbon balance. Fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) is an essential snow variable that can be retrieved from multispectral satellite imagery. In this study, we evaluate fSCA retrievals from multiple sensors that are currently in polar orbit: the operational land imager (OLI) on-board Landsat 8, the multispectral instrument (MSI) on-board the Sentinel-2 satellites, and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) on-board Terra and Aqua. We consider several retrieval algorithms that fall into three classes: thresholding of the normalized difference snow index (NDSI), regression on the NDSI, and spectral unmixing. We conduct the evaluation at a high-Arctic site in Svalbard, Norway, by comparing satellite retrieved fSCA to coincident high-resolution snow-cover maps obtained from a terrestrial automatic camera system. For the lower resolution MODIS retrievals, the regression-based retrievals outperformed the unmixing-based retrievals for all metrics but the bias. For the higher resolution sensors (OLI and MSI), retrievals based on NDSI thresholding overestimated the fSCA due to the mixed pixel problem whereas spectral unmixing retrievals provided the most reliable estimates across the board. We therefore encourage the operationalization of spectral unmixing retrievals of fSCA from both OLI and MSI.', '[Aalstad, Kristoffer; Westermann, Sebastian] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, Oslo, Norway.

The time series are averaged at parcel level, initially for a set of 229 reference parcels for which multiple phenological observations on OSR flowering have been collected from April 21 to May 19, 2018. The set of OSR parcels is extended to a regional sample of 32,355 OSR parcels derived from a regional S2 classification. The study area comprises the northern Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (N) and the southern Bavaria (S) regions in Germany. A method was developed to automatically compute peak flowering at parcel level from the S2 time signature of the Normalized Difference Yellow Index (NDYI) and from the local minimum in S1 VV polarized backscattering coefficients. Peak flowering was determined at a temporal accuracy of 1 to 4 days. A systematic flowering delay of 1 day was observed in the S1 detection compared to S2. Peak flowering differed by 12 days between the N and S. Considerable local variation was observed in the N-S parcel-level flowering gradient. Additional in-situ phenology observations at 70 Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) stations confirm the spatial and temporal consistency between S1 and S2 signatures and flowering phenology across both regions. Conditions during flowering strongly determine OSR yield, therefore, the capacity to continuously characterize spatially the timing of key flowering dates across large areas is key. To illustrate this, expected flowering dates were simulated assuming a single OSR variety with a 425 growing degree days (GDD) requirement to reach flowering. This GDD requirement was calculated based on parcel-level peak flowering dates and temperatures accumulated from 25-km gridded meteorological data. The correlation between simulated and S2 observed peak flowering dates still equaled 0.84 and 0.54 for the N and S respectively. These Sentinel-based parcel-level flowering parameters can be combined with weather data to support in-season predictions of OSR yield, area, and production. Our approach identified the unique temporal signatures of S1 and S2 associated with OSR flowering and can now be applied to monitor OSR phenology for parcels across the globe.', '[d\'Andrimont, Raphael; Taymans, Matthieu; Lemoine, Guido; Ceglar, Andrej; Yordanov, Momchil; van der Velde, Marijn] JRC, European Commiss, Ispra, Italy.', 'European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA SiteRP d\'Andrimont, R (通讯作者)，JRC, European Commiss, Ispra, Italy.', 'raphael.dandrimont@ec.europa.euRI van der Velde, Marijn/B-3305-2009', 'van der Velde, Marijn/0000-0002-9103-7081; Taymans,   Matthieu/0000-0003-3280-1593; d\'Andrimont, Raphael/0000-0002-7326-7684;   Lemoine, Guido/0000-0002-2734-4538', 'European Union\'s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [689812];   Exploratory Research activity YELLOW of the Joint Research Centre of the   European Commission', 'The authors would like to thank Sebastian Brackhane for the in-situ data   collection (JRC contract No. 720149).

Accordingly, a multi-frequency soil moisture retrieval framework has been proposed, being applicable for SAR missions operating at the commonly used remote sensing frequencies of L-, C- and X-band. A combination of numerical, physical and semi-empirical scattering models was selected to build a series of forward modeling look up tables (LUTs) covering the typical radar configurations and nature surface conditions. An unsupervised change detection method was integrated to identify areas with abrupt roughness and vegetation changes, so that time-series data collected from different SARs can be combined with the assumption of time-invariant roughness and vegetation. The multi-frequency backscattering coefficient (sigma(0)) with negligible scattering from soil surface (equivalent to calibration uncertainty) was then removed before soil moisture retrieval. Finally, soil moisture retrieval was carried out independently for each landcover type using an optimization method and forward LUTs. Evaluation based on the Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment-5 dataset consisting of L-band airborne data, C-band RADARSAT-2 data and X-band COSMO-SkyMed data showed an acceptable overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.058 cm(3)/cm(3) at the paddock scale (similar to 0.1 - 0.5 km). The comparison with single and dual frequency retrieval suggests that multi-frequency retrieval is not necessary to have the highest accuracy.

Potential alterations to size structure are predicted to occur in tropical regions under future scenarios of climate change. Therefore, there is an increasing requirement for the synoptic monitoring of phytoplankton size structure in marine systems. The Red Sea remains a comparatively unexplored tropical marine ecosystem, particularly with regards to its large-scale biological dynamics. Using an in situ pigment dataset acquired in the Red Sea, we parameterise a two-component, abundance-based phytoplankton size model and apply it to remotely-sensed observations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, to infer Chl-a in two size classes of phytoplankton, small cells < 2 mu m in size (picophytoplankton) and large cells > 2 mu m in size. Satellite-derived estimates of phytoplankton size structure are in good agreement with corresponding in situ measurements and also capture the spatial variability related to regional mesoscale dynamics. Our analysis reveals that, for the estimation of Chl-a in the two size classes, the model performs comparably or in some cases better, to validations in other oceanic regions. Our model parameterisation will be useful for future studies on the seasonal and interannual variability of phytoplankton size classes in the Red Sea, which may ultimately be relevant for understanding trophic linkages between phytoplankton size structure and fisheries, and the development of marine management strategies.', '[Gittings, John A.; Hoteit, Ibrahim] KAUST, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia.

Moreover, fires of this number and extent alter the wood supply for harvesting, the nature of habitat for wildlife, and can affect regional and national carbon budgets. As a result, it is important to map these fires accurately and to monitor within-year fire progression in order to quantify the resulting forest-disturbance impacts fully. The Bayesian Updating of Land Cover (BULC) algorithm was used to merge burned-area classifications of individual fires from a range of remote sensing sources such as Landsat-7, Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and MODIS (MCD64A1) burned-area dataset. Together, these provisional classifications imaged each pixel within a known fire perimeter an average of 33.8 times between April 1 and December 1. The resulting 35-week time-series stack had updated weekly burned areas for each of the 89 fires in BC in 2017. Province-wide fire progression was variable throughout the period analyzed, characterized by a steady burn phase of 41,437 ha (5% of total area burned) over a two-week period in early July, an accelerated burn phase of 149,422 ha (17%) from mid-July to early August, another steady burn phase of 218,079 ha (24%) for one month until early September, and a second accelerated burn phase of 301,931 ha (34%) over two weeks in late September with subsequent steady growth of 180,119 ha (20%) over 1.5 months until containment in late October. Herein, we demonstrate how such temporally dense fire classification stacks can be used to analyze fire progression over the course of a fire season (both retrospectively and in near-real time) providing useful metrics to characterize and compare fire events. End-of-season burned-area estimates correspond with estimates derived from the National Burned Area Composite (NBAC) product that is generated retrospectively from fire best-available mapping approaches.

After 2002, this area remained relatively stable, varying between similar to 175 mha +/- 2.48% and similar to 178 mha +/- 2.53% by 2017. In 33 years, about 87% of the mapped areas experienced zero, one, two, or three land-cover / land-use transitions; overall, of the similar to 178 mha 2.53% of existing pastures in 2017, similar to 52 mha are at least 33 years old, similar to 66 mha were formed after 1985, and similar to 33 mha may have undergone some reform action in the period under consideration.

While the sampling pattern of GEDI (8 transects with about 600 m across-track spacing) is sufficient to provide accurate biomass maps at the mission\'s required gridded resolution of 1 km, it is of significant interest to fuse GEDI data with ancillary, wall-to-wall remote sensing data from other sensors to provide increased accuracy, potentially higher resolution, and to fill gaps caused by track spacing, clumping in the ISS orbital tracks, as well as from clouds. In this paper, we examine the utility of combining simulated GEDI lidar observations with acquisitions from DLR\'s TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X (TDX) InSAR mission to improve forest biomass estimation at a moderate resolution of 1 km, and to produce biomass maps at a much finer resolution of one hectare. We statistically characterize uncertainties before and after fusing simulated GEDI observations with TDX data across three different biomes: a temperate mixed deciduous forest, a temperate and mountainous coniferous forest, and a tropical forest. We implement the Random Volume over Ground (RVoG) model to derive canopy heights from TDX, using GEDI observations to parameterize key variables in the model. Our uncertainty framework is based on application of what are known as hybrid and hierarchical model-based inference, which allows for the parametric estimation of the variance of biomass estimation using both sampled and modeled data. We found improved accuracies after applying our fusion methods, with uncertainties at 1 km resolution ranging from 11%-20% across the different study sites of the mean biomass from the use of GEDI data alone, compared to 7%-12% achieved after the fusion. At one hectare resolution, comparison of the fusion derived biomass with field plots showed uncertainties associated with mean biomass predictions between 11%-27% across sites. Our results suggest that the use of ancillary data that are sensitive to biomass, such as heights from TDX, with observations of ecosystem structure from GEDI, has the potential to both improve accuracies and/or provide finer spatial resolution, than what is achievable through either mission by itself. We further demonstrate that the GEDI data themselves may be used to parameterize models that invert height from TDX, leading to more accurate height maps for use in biomass estimation. Lastly, our results illustrate the benefits of using parametric estimation theory to quantify uncertainties from both sampling and modeling errors that arise in the fusion of multi-modal remote sensing data at various spatial scales.', '[Qi, Wenlu; Armston, John; Dubayah, Ralph] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

Clumping, a characteristic of foliage distribution, is one of the important aspects of canopy structure and significantly influences light penetration through the canopy. Airborne full-waveform LiDAR data contains large amounts of structural information, and presents a powerful avenue for providing detailed foliage distribution information over large areas. In this study, we present a method for describing physical canopy clumping structure for individual trees that can resolve fine scale variations in foliage clumping. We first utilize K-means clustering algorithm to extract structure found within full-waveform LiDAR data. Then we use representative traits for each data cluster to classify them into their natural groups. Based on these traits, we draw conclusions about physical representations of each group and identify groups as containing clumps in vegetation ranging from spares to dense. We formulate a clumping index multiplier based on cluster traits that inform relative degrees of vegetation clumping at the sub-canopy scale. We use the clumping index multiplier to introduce heterogeneity to a modeled plot level clumping index and generate a vertical clumping index profile for a forested plot. This study demonstrates that large amounts of canopy structural information can be extracted from waveform LiDAR data.

Frequently, information of peatland area and vegetation type estimated by remote sensing has been used along with soil measurements and allometric functions to estimate belowground C stocks. Despite the accuracy of such approaches, there is still the need to find mappable proxies that enhance predictions with remote sensing data while reducing field and laboratory efforts. Therefore, we assessed the use of aboveground vegetation attributes as proxies to predict peatland belowground C stocks. First, the ecological relations between remotely detectable vegetation attributes (i.e. vegetation height, aboveground biomass, species richness and floristic composition of vascular plants) and belowground C stocks were obtained using structural equation modeling (SEM). SEM was formulated using expert knowledge and trained and validated using in-situ information. Second, the SEM latent vectors were spatially mapped using random forests regressions with UAV-based hyperspectral and structural information. Finally, this enabled us to map belowground C stocks using the SEM functions parameterized with the random forests derived maps.   This SEM approach resulted in higher accuracies than a direct application of a purely data-driven random forests approach with UAV data, with improvements of r(2) from 0.39 to 0.54, normalized RMSE from 31.33% to 20.24% and bias from -0.73 to 0.05. Our case study showed that: (1) vegetation height, species richness and aboveground biomass are good proxies to map peatland belowground C stocks, as they can be estimated using remote sensing data and hold strong relationships with the belowground C gradient; and (2) SEM is facilitates to incorporate theoretical knowledge in empirical modeling approaches.', '[Lopatin, Javier; Kattenborn, Teja; Schmidtlein, Sebastian] KIT, Inst Geog & Geoecol, Kaiserstr 12, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.

Some signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data received by off-shelf geodetic antennas contain the multipath information of the sea, and they have been demonstrated for use in retrieving sea levels; however, compared with conventional tide gauges, this GNSS multipath reflectometry (GNSS-MR) technique is limited in terms of both precision and sampling rate. The simplest measure to increase the sampling rate of retrievals is to use SNR data from more satellite tracks at more satellite constellations. This study estimated the sea level of station BAST belonging to the Multi-GNSS Experiment (MGEX) using SNR data of four constellations (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou) of the GNSS. It was found that the S5X/S2X, S2P/S2C, S5X, and S7I SNR types had optimal precisions for the GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou, respectively. In addition, we developed a multi-GNSS combination algorithm to formulate a 10-min sea level time series based on a state transition equation set and a robust regression solution strategy. The combined sea level retrieval time series had an approximately 40%-75% accuracy improvement compared to individual signal sea level retrievals; with a constant sampling interval in the 10 min window, the combined method presented here is beneficial for both the precision and sampling rate. This approach is novel and advanced in two key ways, in that we use data from four constellations simultaneously and through the regression strategy, which is applied to synthesize all data into a time series at regular 10-min intervals.

In 2017 alone, tropical cyclones caused an estimated $215 billion in damage. While MODIS data are regularly used in the analysis of hurricanes and typhoons, damage studies typically focus on just a few events without providing a comprehensive overview and comparison across events. The MODIS record is now sufficiently long to enable standardization in time, allowing us to extend previously developed disturbance methodology and to remove dependency on land cover datasets. We apply this new approach to detect the impact of both droughts and hurricanes on the four largest Caribbean islands since 2001. We find that the percentage of disturbed land on the four islands varies from approximately 0-50% between 2001 and 2017, with the highest percentages coinciding with major droughts in Cuba, and Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. We demonstrate that (1) Hurricane Maria resulted in significant disturbance across 50% of Puerto Rico (4549 km(2)), and (2) gradual recovery started about 2.5 months after the hurricane hit. While our approach focuses on the identification of damage arising from hurricanes, it is also capable of identifying the damage from droughts.

Compared to spring seasonally recurring events, fall phenology remains much less understood. Remotely sensed monitoring of fall phenology provides a wealth of opportunities to understand the underlying processes and mechanisms. However, the gradual change of foliage color in the fall season makes it challenging to remotely estimate critical phenological transition dates. Particularly, the transition date for foliage peak coloration cannot be adequately captured via conventional curve fitting-based phenological models. Also the lack of consensus among the conventional models makes it desirable to explore new remotely sensed representations of the fall phenological process. In this study, we developed an innovative complex network based phenological model, namely \"pheno-network\", to estimate the fall foliage transition date for peak coloration. The pheno-network model characterizes the phenological process through analyzing the collective changes of spectral signatures along the temporal trajectory. A network measure, moving average bridging coefficient, is newly designed to estimate the phenological transition date. With Harvard Forest and Hubbard Brook Forest as reference sites, the results demonstrated that the transition date estimated through the devised pheno-network model corresponds well with the peak coloration period of the reference sites. The unique structure of the pheno-network formulated via spectral similarities differentiates the various roles of vegetation spectral signatures at different phenological stages. This study is the first attempt at introducing network science to time series remote sensing in modeling the complex phenological processes of vegetation. The innovative network-based phenological representation shows great potential in improving remotely sensed phenological monitoring and shedding light on the subsequent modeling of vegetation phenological responses to climate change.', '[Diao, Chunyuan] Univ Illinois, Dept Geog & Geog Informat Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.', 'University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-ChampaignRP Diao, CY (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Geog & Geog Informat Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.', 'chunyuan@illinois.eduRI Diao, Chunyuan/AAI-5625-2021', 'Diao, Chunyuan/0000-0002-1480-8444', 'NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure award [1849821]; Campus   Research Board at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign   [RB18146]; National Science Foundation [OCI-0725070, ACI-1238993]; state   of Illinois; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Office of   Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) [1849821] Funding Source: National   Science Foundation', 'This research is partially supported by NSF Office of Advanced   Cyberinfrastructure award (1849821) and Campus Research Board (RB18146)   at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Currently, most methods are based on classifying invidual pixels from their spectral signatures, therefore they do not incorporate the spatial patterns. This often leads to misclassifications of highly reflective surfaces, such as human made structures or snow/ice. Multi-temporal methods can be used to alleviate this problem, but these methods introduce new problems, such as the need of a cloud-free image of the scene. In this paper, we introduce the Remote Sensing Network (RS-Net), a deep learning model for detection of clouds in optical satellite imagery, based on the U-net architecture. The model is trained and evaluated using the Landsat 8 Biome and SPARCS datasets, and it shows state-of-the-art performance, especially over biomes with hardly distinguishable scenery, such as clouds over snowy and icy regions. In particular, the performance of the model that uses only the RGB bands is significantly improved, showing promising results for cloud detection with smaller satellites with limited multi-spectral capabilities. Furthermore, we show how training the RS-Net models on data from an existing cloud masking method, which are treated as noisy data, leads to increased performance compared to the original method. This is validated by using the Fmask algorithm to annotate the Landsat 8 datasets, and then use these annotations as training data for regularized RS-Net models, which then show improved performance compared to the Fmask algorithm. Finally, the classification time of a full Landsat 8 product is 18.0 +/- 2.4 s for the largest RS-Net model, thereby making it suitable for production environments.', '[Jeppesen, Jacob Hoxbroe; Jacobsen, Rune Hylsberg; Inceoglu, Fadil; Toftegaard, Thomas Skjodeberg] Aarhus Univ, Dept Engn, Finlandsgade 22, DK-8200 Aarhus N, Denmark.

Since 2009, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission observes global L-band brightness temperatures, which are sensitive to near-surface soil moisture, with a revisit time of 1-3 days at a nominal 43-km spatial resolution. This work investigates if the multi-sensor assimilation of these observations into the Catchment land surface model can improve the estimation of 0-5 cm \"surface\" soil moisture, 0-100 cm \"root-zone\" soil moisture, and shallow (unconfined) groundwater levels. Single-sensor GRACE or SMOS assimilation and multi-sensor GRACE + SMOS assimilation experiments were performed over the continental U.S. for 6 years (July 2010 June 2016). GRACE data assimilation mostly improves estimates of shallow groundwater, whereas SMOS data assimilation mainly improves estimates of surface soil moisture. The benefits introduced by the single-sensor assimilation are merged in the multi-sensor assimilation experiment, suggesting that better and more consistent soil moisture and groundwater estimates can be achieved when multiple observation types are assimilated. Interestingly, in the multi-sensor GRACE + SMOS experiment, the water storage increments introduced by the GRACE analysis and the SMOS analysis are anti-correlated. That is, when the GRACE assimilation increments remove water from the overall profile storage, the SMOS assimilation increments add water to it, and vice versa. This anti-correlation could be caused by the SMOS analysis trying to undo the increments from the GRACE analysis.', '[Girotto, Manuela; Reichle, Rolf H.; Liu, Qing; Mahanama, Sarith] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Global Modeling & Assimilat Off, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.

However, monitoring and modeling of tree mortality is limited by the high spatial variability in vegetation response to climatic drought stress and lack of physiologically meaningful stress variables that can be monitored at large scales. In this study, we test the hypothesis that relative water content (RWC) estimated by passive microwave remote sensing through vegetation optical depth can be used as an empirical indicator of tree mortality that both integrates variations in plant drought stress and is accessible across large areas. The hypothesis was tested in a recent severe drought in California, USA. The RWC showed a stronger threshold relationship with mortality than climatic water deficit (CWD) - a commonly used mortality indicator - although both relationships were noisy due to the coarse spatial resolution of the data (0.25 degrees or approximately 25 km). In addition, the threshold for RWC was more uniform than that for CWD when compared between Northern and Southern regions of California. A random forests regression (machine learning) with 32 variables describing topography, climate, and vegetation characteristics predicted forest mortality extent i.e. fractional area of mortality (FAM) with satisfactory accuracy-coefficient of determination R-tmt(2) = 0.66, root mean square error = 0.023. Importantly, RWC was more than twice as important as any other variable in the model in estimating mortality, confirming its strong link to mortality rates. Moreover, RWC showed a moderate ability to aid in forecasting mortality, with a relative importance of RWC measured one year in advance of mortality similar to that of other relevant explanatory variables measured in the mortality year. The results of this study present a promising new approach to estimate drought stress of forests linked to mortality risk.', '[Rao, Krishna] Stanford Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.

Urban trees are used extensively for providing desirable ecosystem services, especially to mitigate elevated thermal stress in cities. Urban trees differ markedly from their natural counterparts in the physiology due to their close interactions with anthropogenic stressors. Here we present the cooling capacity of urban trees in response to thermal extremes in cities of the contiguous United States. The cooling capacity is quantified as the surface cooling rate, which is expressed as the negative ratio of land surface temperature (LST) changes to fractional tree cover (FTC) changes, i.e., -Delta LST/Delta FTC. Results show that the surface cooling rate is dominated by plant transpiration up to 1.336 degrees C per percentage of FTC in heat waves; its temperature dependence remarkably resembles the thermodynamic liquid-water-vapor equilibrium. Urban trees also exert pseudo cooling effect in cold waves in contrast to the anthropogenic heat emission. The average surface cooling rate in cold waves is 0.022 degrees C per percentage of FTC, which is much smaller than that in heat waves (0.202 degrees C per percentage of FTC). The enhanced cooling capacity of urban trees will enable their provision of better ecosystem services to the urban environment for projected future increase of extreme heat.', '[Wang, Chenghao; Wang, Zhi-Hua] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainable Engn & Built Environm, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.

Paradoxically, in a warmer world the incidence and impact of frost is increasing because of earlier leaf unfolding and flowering as a response to warmer temperatures. In this regard, European Beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), a native tree species widely distributed in European forests, is considered particularly sensitive to changes in spring temperature regimes associated with climate change and thus especially subject to the risk of frost damage. Although several studies concerning F. sylvatica frost damage have been conducted in northern and central Europe, no extensive studies are available for the southern part of its range, i.e. central and southern Italy as well as Greece.   In this paper the effect of a late spring frost occurring at the end of April 2016 is extensively documented with high spatial detail all along the Apennine Chain through satellite image data. Three different remote-sensing greenness indexes, namely the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and the greenness index (GI) derived from Landsat-8 satellite images acquired from May to July in the years 2014, 2015, and 2016 at a spatial resolution of 30 m, were used to gauge the spatial response of common beech forests to this late frost event with relation to latitude, altitude and slope exposure. Frost damage was evaluated as a difference (Delta) of NDVI, GI and EVI between the mean of years 2014 and 2015 (i.e. MRY, mean of reference years), and 2016 (i.e. FEY, frost reference year). The three satellite remote-sensing indexes were efficient at detecting leaf damage with detailed spatial resolution and proved consistent with one another.   The greatest damage occurred in the middle altitudinal range between 1500 and 1700 m a.s.l. with a decreasing trend toward both lower and higher elevations due to warmer temperatures below, and delayed phenology above. Exposure also influenced frost injury, with south-facing slopes of the mountain more damaged than the north. This difference was due to earlier spring leaf phenology of southern beech trees in response to a greater heat sum in the warm weeks preceding. Less damage in the northern Apennines is consistent with the spatial extent of minimum freezing temperatures. To sum up, frost damage is strongly related to site-specific conditions, i.e. on the one hand to minimum temperatures, and on the other to the phonological stage of the trees involving both altitude and exposure. Hence focusing on detailed sub-regional studies can be helpful for predicting future consequences of climate change on forests.', '[Allevato, Emilia; Saulino, Luigi; Cesarano, Gaspare; Chirico, Giovanni Battista; D\'Urso, Guido; Bolognesi, Salvatore Falanga; Rita, Angelo; Saracino, Antonio; Bonanomi, Giuliano] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, Via Univ 100, I-80055 Portici, Italy.

Owing to their remoteness, however, ecological key-processes are less understood as in the tropical lowlands. Remote sensing allows modeling of variables related to spatial patterns of carbon stocks and fluxes (e.g., biomass) and ecosystem functioning (e.g., functional leaf traits). However, at a landscape scale most studies conducted so far are based on airborne remote sensing data which is often available only locally and for one time-point. In contrast, multispectral satellites at moderate spectral and spatial resolutions are able to provide spatially continuous and repeated observations. Here, we investigated the effectiveness of Landsat-8 imagery in modeling tropical montane forest biomass, its productivity and selected canopy traits. Topographical, spectral and textural metrics were derived as predictors. To train and validate the models, in-situ data was sampled in 54 permanent plots in forests of southern Ecuador distributed within three study sites at 1000 m, 2000 m and 3000 m a.s.l. We used partial least squares regressions to model and map all response variables. Along the whole elevation gradient biomass and productivity models explained 31%, 43%, 69% and 63% of variance in aboveground biomass, annual wood production, fine litter production and aboveground net primary production, respectively. Regression models of canopy traits measured as community weighted means explained 62%, 78%, 65% and 65% of variance in leaf toughness, specific leaf area, foliar N concentration, and foliar P concentration, respectively. Models at single study sites hardly explained variation in aboveground biomass and the annual wood production indicating that these measures are mainly determined by the change of forest types along with elevation. In contrast, the models of fine litter production and canopy traits explained between 8%-85% in variation depending on the study site. We found spectral metrics, in particular a vegetation index using the red and the green band to provide complementary information to topographical metrics. The model performances for estimating leaf toughness, biochemical canopy traits and related fine litter production all improved when adding spectral information. Our findings therefore revealed that differences in fine litter production and canopy traits in our study area are driven by local changes in vegetation edaphically induced by topography. We conclude that Landsat-derived metrics are useful in modeling fine litter production and biochemical canopy traits, in a topographically and ecologically complex tropical montane forest.', '[Wallis, Christine I.

Ice breakup within this region has historically been monitored using flight reconnaissance supplemented by assessment of hydrometric data. More recently, remote sensed imagery have been used to monitor near real-time ice breakup and flood risk. However, the near real-time remotely sensed breakup information was found to have limited utility in the absence of a broader spatial and temporal understanding of breakup progression. The primary purpose of this study was to develop a method for generating a dataset of breakup dates. A secondary objective was to calculate statistics from this dataset that can be used to provide context to operational near real-time imagery analysis and improve understanding of ice processes in the study area. An automated method for detecting river ice breakup dates from 2000 to 2017 using MODIS imagery was developed. This method uses a threshold-based technique that aims to maximize river coverage and minimize effects of cloud obstruction. Image processing was completed in the high-performance Google Earth Engine application which enabled iterative classification and model calibration. The breakup date dataset was used to calculate statistics on breakup timing, duration, annual variability and breakup order. An assessment of patterns within these data is discussed, relationships between breakup timing, duration and highwater years is explored and the operational utility of these statistics is described. The classification compared well with Water Survey of Canada derived breakup dates with mean bias ranging from -2.0 days to 6.7 days and mean absolute error of 3.4 days to 6.9 days across the rivers. Latitude and distance upstream were found to be primary controls on breakup timing with drainage network configuration and reach morphology also having an influence. No relationships between highwater years and calculated breakup statistics were found. It is recommended that future studies use the dataset developed in this study in combination with hydrometric and remotely sensed data to improve prediction of highwater and understanding of breakup processes within these rivers.', '[Beaton, A.; Whaley, R.; Kenny, F.] Ontario Minist Nat Resources & Forestry, 300 Water St, Peterborough, ON K9H 2K1, Canada.

This study is the first evaluation of the MAIAC AOD from MODIS Aqua (A) and Terra (T) satellites between 2006 and 2016 over South Asia. The retrieval accuracy of MAIAC was assessed by comparing it to ground-truth AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) AOD, as well as to AOD retrieved by the two operational MODIS algorithms: Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB). MAIAC AOD showed higher spatial coverage and retrieval frequency than either the DT or the DB AOD retrievals. The high spatial resolution of the MAIAC retrievals enhances the capability to distinguish aerosol sources and to determine fine aerosol features, such as wildfire smoke plumes and haze over complex geographical regions, and provides more retrievals in conditions that are cloudy or when the surface is partially covered by snow. In comparison to AERONET AOD, MAIAC AOD shows a better accuracy than both DT and DB AOD. A higher number of MAIAC-AERONET AOD matchups demonstrate the capability of MAIAC to retrieve AOD over varied surfaces, different aerosol types and loadings. Our results demonstrate high retrieval accuracy in term of the Expected Error (EE) (A/T, EE: 72.22%, 73.50%), and low root mean square error (A/T, RMSE: 0.148, 0.164), root mean bias (RMB) (A/T, RMB: 0.978, 1.049) and mean absolute error (MAE) (A/T, MAE: 0.098, 0.096). Moreover, MAIAC has a lower bias as a function of the viewing geometry and the aerosol type among the three retrieval algorithms. MAIAC performed well over bright and vegetated land surfaces, showing the highest retrieval accuracy over dense vegetation and particularly well in retrieving smoke AOD, yet it underestimated dust AOD. In conclusion, MAIAC\'s ability to provide AOD at high spatial resolution appears promising over South Asia, thus having advantage over contemporary aerosol retrieval algorithms for epidemiological and climatological studies.

Due to high spatiotemporal variations, estimations of riverine POC flux into the sea can be relatively inexact when based on field measurement only. In this study, remote sensing algorithms of riverine POC flux through the Xuliujing hydrological station in the Changjiang River Estuary (CRE) were developed using satellite data with hourly resolution from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI). Based on data collected during four seasonal cruises in the CRE from 2014 to 2016, POC concentration showed a significant linear relationship to total suspended matter (TSM) (N = 426, R-2 = 0.97, p < 0.01). Thus, surface POC concentration was calculated by satellite-derived TSM. From the in-situ data, the vertical POC concentration profile at Xuliujing showed an exponentially increasing curve (p < 0.01), but a linear decrease (p < 0.01) for the water flow profile from the surface to the bottom. Combining the GOCI-derived surface POC concentration and vertical profiles of POC and water flow, we estimated monthly riverine POC fluxes to the CRE. Results showed that monthly POC flux at Xuliujing (0.071 +/- 0.022 Tg C) was 22.64% higher, on average, than the commonly used value at the non-tidal Datong hydrological station. Moreover, under human activity pressures, the influences of POC input from the Changjiang River on POC concentration at Xuliujing have weakened in recent years. Monthly and diurnal POC variations in the CRE were mainly impacted by wind speed and tidal processes, respectively. Thus, satellite monitoring with high spatiotemporal resolution has great significance for accurately estimating riverine POC flux to estuary.', '[Liu, Dong] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

However methodological gaps exist for adapting this technology to heterogeneous natural vegetation and for transferring it among vegetation species or plan functional types. In this study, we investigated the use of Sentinel-2A imagery for estimating needle chlorophyll (Ca+b) in a sparse pine forest undergoing significant needle loss and tree mortality. Sentinel-2A scenes were acquired under two extreme viewing geometries (June vs. December 2016) coincident with the acquisition of high-spatial resolution hyperspectral imagery, and field measurements of needle chlorophyll content and crown leaf area index. Using the high-resolution hyperspectral scenes acquired over 61 validation sites we found the CI chlorophyll index R-750/R-710 and Macc index (which uses spectral bands centered at 680 nm, 710 nm and 780 nm) had the strongest relationship with needle chlorophyll content from individual tree crowns (r(2) = 0.61 and r(2) = 0.59, respectively; p < 0.001), while TCARI and TCARI/OSAVI, originally designed for uniform agricultural canopies, did not perform as well (r(2) = 0.21 and r(2) = 0.01, respectively). Using lower-resolution Sentinel-2A data validated against hyperspectral estimates and ground truth needle chlorophyll content, the red-edge index CI and the Sentinel-specific chlorophyll indices CI-Gitelson, NDRE1 and NDRE2 had the highest accuracy (with r(2) values > 0.7 for June and > 0.4 for December; p < 0.001).

We evaluated the algorithm via 58 images and a large set of field measurements collected across seasons of multiple years in the Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. Results showed that the SBOP algorithm reduced estimation errors by as much as 4 times (RMSE = 0.17 and R-2 = 0.87 in the Saginaw Bay) when compared to the QAA-CDOM algorithm that did not take into account bottom reflectance. These improvements in CDOM estimation are consistent and robust across broad range CDOM absorption.

The forest-savanna mosaic in the northern part of Lope National Park, Gabon, has a large and complex variation in vegetation structure along a successional gradient. The goal of this research is to assess whether large footprint full-waveform lidar data can be used to distinguish successional vegetation types based on their vertical structure in this area. Eleven vegetation metrics were derived from the lidar waveforms: canopy height, canopy fractional cover, total Plant Area Index (PAI) and vertical profile of PAI. The PAI profiles from airborne waveform lidar showed good agreement with those from Terrestrial Laser Scanning, sampled at eight field plots across different vegetation types (r(2) = 0.95, RMSE = 0.63, bias = 0.41). The agreement further strengthened our confidence that lidar waveforms can be used to distinguish between the five vegetation types, within the limits of the sampled structure, because TLS was known to provide distinct PAI profiles for these vegetation types. We then employed a Random Forest model, trained with 193 locations of known vegetation type, to classify the entire study area into five successional vegetation types (classification accuracy = 81.3%). The resulting predictive map revealed the overall spatial pattern of vegetation types across the study area. Our results suggest that lidar-derived vegetation profiles can provide valuable information on vegetation type and successional stage.

The results are compared with in-situ observations from three moorings along the Jason-1 track 196. Accurate information on the total velocity direction is the key factor for obtaining accurate estimates of along-track velocities. Surface tracer fronts can be successfully used to retrieve such information, especially when currents intersect the satellite track at low incidence angles (within +/- 60 degrees from the perpendicular direction). Errors in the reconstructed total velocities tend to grow rapidly for higher angles. Best performance is obtained by retaining information from the strongest fronts only.

As ENSO is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon, in addition to the commonly used sea surface temperature (SST), water vapor in the atmosphere can be used to monitor the evolution of ENSO and to investigate its consequences (e.g., droughts and flooding). The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), in addition to its applications for positioning, timing, and navigation, is another established atmospheric observing system used to remotely sense precipitable water vapor (PWV) in the atmosphere. The accuracy of the GNSS-derived PWV measurements was assessed from 12 stations based on observations made at co-located radiosonde stations as a reference. The results show that mean values of the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and biases of 6-hourly GNSS-derived PWV derived from all 12 stations are valued at 1.48 mm and - 0.30 mm, respectively. Regarding monthly means, mean values of the RMSE and biases of the GNSS-derived PWV are valued at 0.66 mm and -0.23 mm, respectively. The variability in PWV estimated from 56 GNSS stations positioned close to the sea indicates that it is significantly affected by ENSO events. Generally, a 1-K increase in SST will lead to an 11% increase in PWV across all of the stations. A case study conducted at the TOW2 station in Australia shows that the non-linear trend of the PWV depicts the evolution of two severe flood events and one severe drought event occurring in this region. Comparative results derived from TOW2 and from another 24 stations show a good agreement between PWV and total precipitation. These results suggest that GNSS-derived PWV together with other climatic variables (e.g., SST) can be used as an indication of the evolution of ENSO events and as a possible indicator of drought and flood occurrence.', '[Wang, Xiaoming; Li, Zishen; Yuan, Hong] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Optoelect, Beijing, Peoples R China.

However this has not been widely applied to smaller regional rivers. In this study, we investigated the reliability of calibrating a hydrological model for the upper Yalongjiang River Basin on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, based solely on river water surface widths derived from four high spatial resolution commercial satellite images: two from QuickBird and one each from IKONOS and WorldView-1. The model was forced using satellite-based meteorological datasets and calibrated using remotely sensed river widths. In situ gauged data are not used for modeling, making the approach applicable for ungauged basins. To shift the calibration objective from streamflow to river width, the hydrological model is connected to the at-a station hydraulic geometry (AHG) relationship. Generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation was used for automatic calibration and to better quantify simulation uncertainty. After constraining the model parameter space solely to the river width observations, the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values for the streamflow simulated using the calibrated model reached 64.3% in the calibration period and 55.8% in the validation period. When calibrating the model using river width datasets with designed measurement error associated with riparian canopy, the influences of error on model simulation were less than expected. This was because the effect of the error was counteracted by adjustment of the AHG parameters. Both superimposing updated ranges for the AHG parameters and further constraining the model output using hydrological signature information following calibration reduced simulation uncertainty, particularly with use of the latter method. This study demonstrates the potential for application of the proposed calibration method to regional ungauged basins lacking ground streamflow observation data, and provides insights into how remote sensing data can be more effectively integrated with hydrological modeling.', '[Sun, Wenchao; Fan, Jiao; Wang, Guoqiang; Yu, Jingshan; Fu, Yongshuo H.; Zuo, Depeng; Xu, Zongxue] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Water Sci, Xinjiekouwai St 19, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

Remote sensing is capable of observing land surface temperatures (LST) across a city; however, its ability to quantify vegetation canopy temperatures is limited because of LST variability resulting from urban surface heterogeneity, differences in vegetation fraction and non-vegetated material, and the coarse resolution of available thermal imagery. This study is a large-scale analysis of urban surface composition and temperature variability across the Los Angeles, USA, metropolitan area (4466 km(2)). Sub-pixel fractions of two plant functional types (tree and turfgrass) and four urban materials (impervious surface, commercial roof, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and soil) were quantified using hyperspectral imagery (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer). Fractional cover gradients of plant types and non-vegetated materials were developed using 1.7 million pixels, from which we modeled LST changes using simultaneously collected thermal imagery (MODIS-ASTER Airborne Simulator). Vegetation LST variability was mapped by subtracting modeled LST from observed LST and investigated relative to building density and vegetation management. Overall, LST varied significantly among plant functional types and urban material types. Across heterogeneous mixtures, LST and vegetation fraction exhibited a negative, linear relationship, with the slopes of LST change showing significant differences between trees and turfgrass. The map of vegetation LST variability had a standard deviation of 3.5 degrees C, indicating significant variability across Los Angeles independent of vegetation type or fractional cover. Building density was observed to affect tree and turfgrass LST differently, while a negative relationship was observed between vegetation LST and irrigation (R-2 = 0.55). Our results show that an LST signal of vegetation function, distinct from that of vegetation fractional cover, can be observed and modeled at city-scales in fractional mixture analysis, indicating potential for improved understanding of urban microclimates.', '[Wetherley, Erin B.; McFadden, Joseph P.; Roberts, Dar A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.', 'University of California System; University of California Santa BarbaraRP Wetherley, EB (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.', 'wetherley@geog.ucsb.edu', 'Wetherley, Erin/0000-0003-3114-1642', 'NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship Program [17-EARTH17R-68];   Belgian Science Policy Office in the framework of the STEREO III   Program-Project UrbanEARS [SR/00/307]', 'This research was supported by the NASA Earth and Space Science   Fellowship Program (17-EARTH17R-68); and by the Belgian Science Policy   Office in the framework of the STEREO III Program-Project UrbanEARS   (SR/00/307).

Five individual Artificial Intelligence (AI) models including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), M5P model tree, Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) are developed for each cluster and their best results are used in fusion process. In addition, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization model is utilized to determine optimal weights in weighting methods. Estimation performance of all models are evaluated using statistical error indices of Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R-2).

This is likely the result of the mixed pixel effect: (1) a pixel in VI products may contain an unknown composition of vegetation species or land cover types; and (2) these species differ in their sensitivity to climatic variations. The mixed pixel effect has induced inconsistent findings in LSP with in situ observations of spring phenology. To this end, this study has designed a series of simulation experiments to initiate the methodological exploration of how the green-up date (GUD) of a mixed pixel could be altered by the endmember GUDs and different non-GUD variables, including the end member composition, minimum and maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the length of the growth period. The study has also compared the sensitivity of two generally adopted GUD identification methods, the relative threshold method and the curvature method (also known as the inflection-point method). The simulations with two endmembers show that even if there is no change in the endmember GUDs, the GUD of the mixed pixel could be substantially altered by the changes in non-GUD variables. In addition, the study has also developed a simulation toolkit for the GUD identification with cases of three or more endmembers. The results of the study provide insights into effective strategies for analyzing spring phonology using VI products: the mixed pixel effect can be alleviated by selecting pixels that are relatively stable in the land cover or species composition. This simulation study calls for in situ phonological observations to validate the LSP, such as conducting climate-controlled experiments on few mixed species at a small spatial scale. The paper also argues for the necessity of isolating GUD trends caused by non-phenological changes in the study of spring phenology.', '[Chen, Xiang; Wang, Dawei; Chen, Jin; Wang, Cong] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

Various studies exist on the mapping of irrigation using remote sensing and census statistics, but they mainly focus on the mapping of irrigation extent without taking frequency and timing into account. In this study, we proposed a new approach to extract irrigation attributes including irrigation extent, frequency and timing using multi-source data moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), Landsat, and ancillary data. A time-series dataset with 30-m spatial resolution was generated by fusing 480-m time-series MODIS and Landsat imagery. We used the greenness index (the ratio of NIR and green spectral bands) to detect irrigation events during the first half of the growing season. Rainfall events were assumed as water supplement events along with irrigation events. The number of water supplement stages were then recorded cumulatively when a water supplement event was detected using a threshold-based model. To estimate the possible dates of each water supplement stage, Gaussian process regression and linear regression models were applied. The new framework was applied to the Hexi Corridor in northwestern China, an intensively irrigated region with a semi-arid climate. Results show that the overall accuracy of water supplement stage using the proposed method is 87%. Validation of the number of water supplement stages and possible dates of water supply by GRP model with a \"strict\" (or \"loose\") assessment method shows an overall accuracy of 55% (94%) and 59% (89%), respectively. The good accuracy of the additional independent validations for different years and sites demonstrates the robustness of the proposed method, suggesting the general applicability to other regions. Overall, this research demonstrates that the proposed method is promising in detecting irrigation attributes such as frequency and timing which have not been explored in previous research.', '[Chen, Yaoliang] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Dept Land Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

For example, there are several viable but highly varied strategies for using time series of Landsat imagery to detect changes in forest cover. Performance among algorithms varies across complex natural systems, and it is reasonable to ask if aggregating the strengths of an ensemble of classifiers might result in increased overall accuracy. Relatively simple rules have been used in the past to aggregate classifications among remotely sensed maps (e.g. using majority predictions), and in other fields, empirical models have been used to create situationally specific algorithm weights. The latter process, called \"stacked generalization\" (or \"stacking\"), typically uses a parametric model for the fusion of algorithm outputs. We tested the performance of several leading forest disturbance detection algorithms against ensembles of the outputs of those same algorithms based upon stacking using both parametric and Random Forests-based fusion rules. Stacking using a Random Forests model cut omission and commission error rates in half in many cases in relation to individual change detection algorithms, and cut error rates by one quarter compared to more conventional parametric stacking. Stacking also offers two auxiliary benefits: alignment of outputs to the precise definitions built into a particular set of empirical calibration data; and, outputs which may be adjusted such that map class totals match independent estimates of change in each year. In general, ensemble predictions improve when new inputs are added that are both informative and uncorrelated with existing ensemble components. As increased use of cloud-based computing makes ensemble mapping methods more accessible, the most useful new algorithms may be those that specialize in providing spectral, temporal, or thematic information not already available through members of existing ensembles.', '[Healey, Sean P.; Moisen, Gretchen G.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA.

Concentration maps of K, Th, U, as well as their ratios, were computed from airborne gamma-ray spectrometry data to assess the geochemical composition of the regolith. The mineralogy of the surfaces was mapped via the analysis of multispectral ASTER and Landsat scenes. Pauli-decomposition data retrieved from polarimetric ALOS PALSAR and Radarsat-2 images were included to characterize the surface properties of the regolith material. Morphometric variables such as slope, curvature, and relative relief were derived from the SRTM digital elevation model to quantify the topographic parameters of the different regolith landforms. An artificial neural network implementation, ADVANGEO, was then employed to extract four basic regolith landform units from the satellite and airborne data. Relic ferruginous duricrusts rich in hematite and goethite belonging to the High glacis, erosional surfaces represented by rock outcrops and sub outcrops, alluvial sediments, and soft pediment materials of the Middle and Low glacis were mapped successfully in the region. The results were compared with the existing geomorphological maps, an independent visual classification, and field observations. We found that the distribution and shape of the iron-rich duricrusts are more accurate than portrayed in the current maps. The best results, with an overall accuracy of 94.21% and a kappa value of 0.92, were obtained for a dataset consisting of gamma-ray spectrometry data combined with derivatives of the SRTM digital elevation model augmented by Landsat, and polarimetric radar data. The approach demonstrates for the first time the potential of machine learning in regolith landform mapping.

These products are inferred by a Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System (CCDAS) and consist of net and gross biosphere-atmosphere fluxes of carbon dioxide on a global 0.5 degrees grid. As a further dataset provided by the CCI, the burnt area product developed by its Firei project was used in the CCDAS to prescribe the emission component from biomass burning. The new flux products are provided with per-pixel uncertainty ranges. Fluxes with uncertainty ranges can also be provided aggregated in space and time, e.g. over given regions or as annual means. For both, posterior flux fields inferred from BESD and EMMA products, transport model simulations show reasonable agreement with the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration observed at flask sampling stations. This means that the information provided by the terrestrial and transport models, the respective GHG ECV product, the burnt area ECV product, a product of the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation used to drive the model, and the atmospheric flask samples is largely consistent.   The most prominent feature in the posterior net flux is the tropical source of CO2 inferred from both products. But for the EMMA product this release, especially over South America, is with 300 gC/m(2)/year much more pronounced than for BESD. This confirms findings by a recent intercomparison of transport inversions using GOSAT data by Houweling et a). (2015). The reason for the larger net flux is increased heterotrophic respiration. For both products the posterior 2010 sink over Europe (without Russia) is in the range of a recent compilation of European flux estimates by Reuter et al. (2016b). The posterior 2010 uptake of Australia (including Oceania) inferred from the EMMA product is 1.3 +/- 0.2 PgC/year and appears to confirm the high sink also derived from GOSAT by Detrners et al. (2015) over a slightly different period and area. While for some regions (USA, Canada, Europe, Russia, Asia) the one standard deviation uncertainty ranges derived from BESD and EMMA do overlap, for some other regions (Brazil, Africa, Australia) this is not the case. It is not clear yet whether this is due to the uncertainty specifications in the respective products or the handling of uncertainty in the assimilation chain. Assumptions on correlation of observational uncertainty in space and time have a considerable impact on the inferred flux fields (a 60 gC/m(2)/year). The effect of adding an uncertainty that approximates the error in the retrieval system is of similar size.', '[Kaminski, T.; Vossbeck, M.] Invers Lab, Tewessteg 4, D-20249 Hamburg, Germany.

While agricultural expansion has been heavily scrutinized, less attention has been paid to changes within cropland systems. Here we present a method to detect individual cropland field parcels from temporal Landsat imagery to improve cropland estimates and better depict the scale of farming across South America. The methods consist of multi-spectral image edge extraction and multi-scale contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) and adaptive thresholding using Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record (CDR) products. We tested our methods across a South American region with approximately 82% of the 2000/2001 total cropland area, using a Landsat time series composite with a January 1, 2000 to August 1, 2001 timeframe. A thematic accuracy assessment revealed an overall cropland f-score of 91%, while an object-based assessment of 5480 fields showed low geometric errors. The results illustrate that Landsat time series can be used to accurately estimate cropland in South America, and the low geometric errors of the per-parcel estimates highlight the applicability of the proposed methods over a large area. Our approach offers a new technique of analyzing agricultural changes across a broad geographic scale. By using multi-temporal Landsat imagery with a semi-automatic field extraction approach, we can monitor within-agricultural changes at a high degree of accuracy, and advance our understanding of regional agricultural expansion and intensification dynamics across South America.', '[Graesser, Jordan] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.

Remote-sensing methods can provide soil moisture estimates over very large spatial extents (continental to global) at coarse resolutions (10-40 km), but their output must be downscaled to reach fine resolutions. When large spatial extents are considered, the downscaling procedure must consider multiple coarse-resolution grid cells, yet little attention has been given to the treatment of multiple grid cells. The objective of this paper is to compare the performance of different methods for addressing multiple coarse grid cells. To accomplish this goal, the Equilibrium Moisture from Topography, Vegetation, and Soil (EMT + VS) downscaling model is generalized to accept multiple coarse grid cells, and two methods for their treatment are implemented and compared. The first method (fixed window) is a direct extension of the original EMT + VS model and downscales each coarse grid cell independently. The second method (shifting window) replaces the coarse grid cell values with values that are calculated from windows that are centered on each fine grid cell. The window values are weighted averages of the coarse grid values within the window extent, and three weighting methods are considered (box, disk, and Gaussian). The methods are applied to three small catchments with detailed soil moisture observations and one large region. The fixed window typically provides more accurate estimates of soil moisture than the shifting window, but it produces abrupt changes in soil moisture at the coarse grid boundaries, which may be problematic for some applications. The three weighting methods produce similar results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Unfortunately, in many areas existing fire occurrence datasets are known to be incomplete. Consequently, the need to systematically collect burned area information has been recognized by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which have both called for the production of essential climate variables (ECVs), including information about burned area. In this paper, we present an algorithm that identifies burned areas in dense time-series of Landsat data to produce the Landsat Burned Area Essential Climate Variable (BAECV) products. The algorithm uses gradient boosted regression models to generate burn probability surfaces using band values and spectral indices from individual Landsat scenes, lagged reference conditions, and change metrics between the scene and reference predictors. Burn classifications are generated from the burn probability surfaces using pixel-level thresholding in combination with a region growing process. The algorithm can be applied anywhere Landsat and training data are available. For this study, BAECV products were generated for the conterminous United States from 1984 through 2015. These products consist of pixel-level burn probabilities for each Landsat scene, in addition to, annual composites including: the maximum burn probability and a burn classification. We compared the BAECV burn classification products to the existing Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED; 1997-2015) and Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS; 1984-2013) data. We found that the BAECV products mapped 36% more burned area than the GFED and 116% more burned area than MTBS. Differences between the BAECV products and the GFED were especially high in the West and East where the BAECV products mapped 32% and 88% more burned area, respectively. However, the BAECV products found less burned area than the GFED in regions with frequent agricultural fires. Compared to the MTBS data, the BAECV products identified 31% more burned area in the West, 312% more in the Great Plains, and 233% more in the East. Most pixels in the MTBS data were detected by the BAECV, regardless of burn severity. The BAECV products document patterns of fire similar to those in the GFED but also showed patterns of fire that are not well characterized by the existing MTBS data. We anticipate the BAECV products will be useful to studies that seek to understand past patterns of fire occurrence, the drivers that created them, and the impacts fires have on natural and human systems.

AVHRR is the only satellite sensor providing nearly continuous global coverage since June 1979, which could generate the longest aerosol climate data records currently available from operational satellites. In the implementation of the ADL algorithm, an analytical model is used which couples an atmospheric radiative transfer model and a land surface reflectance parameterization. The radiation field can be separated into three parts: direct radiance, single scattered radiance, and multiple-scattered. Each of these parts is individually parameterized. To obtain the surface reflectance in an automatic retrieval procedure over land for AVHRR, the aerosol scattering effect at 3.75 gm was assumed to be negligible and relationships between the surface reflectances at 0.64 mu m and 3.75 mu m were evaluated for different surface types and the authors propose to use these to obtain the surface reflectance at the shorter wavelength. The 0.64 mu m surface reflectance was then used in a radiative transfer model to compute AOD at that wavelength using six different aerosol types, where optimal estimation (OE) theory is applied to minimize the difference between modeled and measured radiances.   The ADL algorithm is applied to re-calibrated Level 1B radiances from the AVHRRs on-board the TIROS-N and the Metop-B satellites to retrieve the AOD over North China and Central Europe. The results show that the AOD retrieved from these two instruments are in agreement with co-located AOD values from ground-based reference networks. Over North China, using AERONET sites, 58% of the ADLAOD values are within an expected error (EE) range of +/-(0.05 + 20%) and 53% are within the EE range of +/-(0.05 + 15%). For GAW-PFR (World Meteorological Organization, WMO, Global Atmosphere Watch, GAW) sites, part of the European ACTRIS (Aerosols, Clouds, and Trace gases Research InfraStructure) sites, 79% of the ADL AOD values are within the EE range of +/-(0.05 + 20%) and 75% are within the EE range of +/-(0.05 + 15%). Not surprisingly, the agreement is better over Europe with generally lower AOD values. An additional cross comparison of the AOD results with MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) DeepBlue aerosol products shows that the spatial distributions of the two AOD datasets are similar, but with generally lower values for ADL and lower coverage. The temporal variation of the annual mean AOD over selected AERONET sites shows that ADL values are generally between 0.2 and 0.5 over North-Eastem China and trace the MODIS and AERONET data for the overlapping years quite well.

For instance, many cities in China are experiencing a large number of rapid but subtle changes resulting from urban infrastructure construction. Information concerning such small changes is imperative for understanding the local environment and human activity, and can also provide key insights for urban planners. Undoubtedly, high-resolution remotely sensed data should play an essential role for the monitoring of such subtle changes, due to the improved observation capacity of the spatial details. However, few studies have investigated high-resolution data for change detection at a large geographic scale, due to the multi-temporal heterogeneity of the data, e.g., spatial mis-registration, parallax distortion for high architectures, and the different viewing angles. In this study, we attempted to fill this gap and resolve these problems by the use of multi-view ZY-3 satellite data, which are used to generate multi-temporal orthographic images through photogrammetric derivation. In the meantime, we present a general framework for precise urban change analysis in a multi-level ( pixel, grid, and city block) approach. Two typical Chinese megacities-Beijing and Wuhan-are chosen in the experiments. The results confirm the accuracy of the proposed multi-level method for monitoring subtle urban changes, achieving Kappa coefficients of similar to 0.8 at the pixel level and a correctness of 93-95% at the grid level. The landscape analysis further indicates that the rapid urban construction led to greater fragmentation and spatial heterogeneity of buildings and decreased minimum distance between building patches ( by similar to 1.0 m between 2012 and 2013). Moreover, the performances of ZY-3 and Landsat for the monitoring of subtle urban changes are compared, revealing that the high-resolution sensor-ZY-3 ( 2.5 m)-is essential for precisely detecting subtle urban changes, whereas the Landsat data ( 30 m) are not sensitive to most of the subtle changes that occur in the urban areas.

The technique is based on the relationship between integrated attenuated backscatter color ratio and integrated depolarization ratio, and is proven to efficiently separate snow/ice cover and surface melting from open water and land surfaces. The method has been applied to 10 years (2006-2016) of CALIOP data to study the seasonal and inter-annual variability of Arctic sea ice cover and its declining trend. Results show that the area fraction of snow cover over land at latitudes >60 degrees N varied between 0.9 during winter and 0.1 in summer. The CALIOP observations of Arctic sea ice cover exhibit a strong seasonal cycle and significant inter-annual variability, which are consistent with the passive microwave-based sea ice results. The >10 years of CALIOP continuous observations of the snow/ice cover will benefit the communities modeling snow/ice melting and climate change. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Here we present the results of a global assessment and validation of the new Geophysical Ocean Product (GOP) distributed by the European Space Agency (ESA) since April 2014, focusing on the sea surface height anomaly (SSHA), the significant wave height (SWH), and the wind speed. Our assessment involves only Low Resolution Mode (LRM) and Pseudo LRM (PLRM) data, since full SAR processing is not already operationally implemented in the GOP. The global assessment is conducted on the basis of measurement noise and along-track spectral and crossover analysis, whereas the validation is performed against a variety of in situ observations such as tide gauges, buoys and Argo floats as well as data from the WaveWatch III (WWIII) model. The performance of the GOP is compared to that of Jason-2 and CryoSat-2 data from the Radar Altimeter Database System (RADS). The mean value of the 20-Hz SSHA noise at 2 m SWH is 6.3 cm for LRM and 10.2 cm for PLRM, and the standard deviation of the crossovers is similar to 5.4 cm. The mean 20 HZ SWH noise over the global oceans is 49.4 cm and 69.8 cm, for LRM and PLRM respectively. CryoSat-2 and Jason-2 show almost identical performance when SSHAs are validated against tide gauges, with a median correlation and root mean square difference (RMSD) of 0.78 and 7.1 cm for the GOP, 0.76 and 7.3 cm for Jason-2, and 0.79 and 7.8 cm for CryoSat-2 from RADS. The median correlation with Argo-derived steric heights is 0.68 for the GOP, 0.74 for Jason-2, and 0.67 for CryoSat-2 from RADS. However, the correlation shows a strong latitudinal dependence, with higher values at low latitudes (median value larger than 0.80 in the 10 degrees S-10 degrees N band). The median RMSD between the SSHAs and steric heights is 5.3 cm for the GOP, 4.6 cm for Jason-2, and 5.1 cm for CryoSat-2 from RADS. The GOP and Jason-2 show also identical performance when SWHs are compared to buoy data, with a slope and RMS error of 0.98 and 15 cm for GOP, 0.97 and 16 cm for Jason-2, and 1.05 and 17 cm for CryoSat-2 from RADS. On the other hand, the GOP wind speed exhibits a bias of about 2 m/s relative to both Jason-2 and to buoy data. Differences between the GOP and WWIII SWH are smaller than 20% of the SWH almost everywhere. In summary the GOP products are fit for oceanographic applications.

The dominance of positive NDVI trends in the Sahel, the so-called re-greening, is sometimes interpreted as a combined effect of an increase in rainfall and cropland expansion or agricultural intensification. Yet, the impact of changes in land use has yet to be thoroughly tested and supported by empirical evidence. At present, no studies have considered the importance of the different seasonal NDVI signals of cropped and fallowed fields when interpreting NDVI trends, as both field types are commonly merged into a single \'cropland\' class. We make use of the distinctly different phonology of cropped and fallowed fields and use seasonal NDVI curves to separate these two field types. A fuzzy classifier is applied to quantify cropped and fallowed areas in a case study region in the southern Sahel (Fakara, Niger) on a yearly basis between 2000 and 2014. We find that fallowed fields have a consistently higher NDVI than unmanured cropped fields and by using two seasonal NDVI metrics (the amplitude and the decreasing rate) derived from the MODIS time series, a clear separation between classes of fields is achieved (r = 0.77). The fuzzy classifier can compute the percentage of a pixel (250 m) under active cultivation, thereby alleviating the problem of small field sizes in the region. We find a predominant decrease in NDVI over the period of analysis associated with an increased area of cropped fields at the expense of fallowed fields. Our findings couple cropping abandonment (more frequent fallow years) with positive NDVI trends and an increase in the percentage of the cropped area (fallow period shortening) with negative trends. These findings profoundly impact our understanding of greening and browning trends in agrarian Sahelian drylands and in other drylands of developing countries characterized by limited use of fertilizers.

Satellite data characterizing either freeze/thaw cycles or snow cover are both available, but these two types of data have not yet been combined to map the subnivium. Here, we characterized global patterns of frozen ground with and without snow cover to provide a baseline to assess the effects of future winter climate change on organisms that depend on the subnivium. We analyzed two remote sensing datasets: the MODIS Snow Cover product and the NASA MEaSUREs Global Record of Daily Landscape Freeze/fhaw Status dataset derived from SSM/I and SSMIS. From these we developed a new 500-m resolution dataset that captures global patterns of the duration of snow-covered ground (D-ws) and the duration of snow-free frozen ground (D-wos) from 2000 to 2012. We also quantified how D-ws and D-wos, vary with latitude. Our results show that both mean and interannual variation in D-ws and D-wos change with latitude and topography. Mean D-ws increases with latitude. Counter-intuitively though, D-wos has longest duration at about 33 degrees N, decreasing both northward and southward, even though the duration of frozen ground (either snow covered or not) was shorter than that at higher latitudes. This occurs because snow cover in mid-latitudes is low and ephemeral, leaving longer periods of frozen, snow-free ground. Interannual variation in D-ws increased with latitude, but the slopes of this relationship differed among North America, Europe, Asia, and the Southern Hemisphere. Overall, our results show that, for organisms that rely on the subnivium to survive the winter, mid-latitude areas could be functionally colder than either higher or lower latitudes. Furthermore, because interannual variation in D-wos is greater at high latitudes, we would expect organisms there to be adapted to unpredictability in exposure to freezing. Ultimately, the effects of climate change on organisms during winter should be considered in the context of the subnivium, when warming could make more northerly areas functionally colder in winter, and changes in annual variation in the duration of snow-free but frozen conditions could lead to greater unpredictability in the onset and end of winter.

In these analyses, it is common for some of the objects to be mixed in their class composition and thus violate the commonly made assumption of object purity that is implicit in a conventional object-based image analysis. Mixed objects can be a problem throughout a classification analysis, but are particularly challenging in the training stage as they can result in degraded training statistics and act to reduce mapping accuracy. In this paper the potential of using mixed objects in training object-based image classifications is evaluated. Remotely sensed data were submitted to a series of segmentation analyses from which a range of under- to over-segmented outputs were intentionally produced. Training objects were then selected from the segmentation outputs, resulting in training data sets that varied in terms of size (i.e. number of objects) and proportion of mixed objects. These training data sets were then used with an artificial neural network and a generalized linear model, which can accommodate objects of mixed composition, to produce a series of land cover maps. The use of training statistics estimated based on both pure and mixed objects often increased classification accuracy by around 25% when compared with accuracies obtained from the use of only pure objects in training. So rather than the mixed objects being a problem, they can be an asset in classification and facilitate land cover mapping from remote sensing. It is, therefore, desirable to recognize the nature of the objects and possibly accommodate mixed objects directly in training. The results obtained here may also have implications for the common practice of seeking an optimal segmentation output, and also act to challenge the widespread view that object-based classification is superior to pixel-based classification.

The results show a widespread (i.e., non-local dimension) increase in the major part of Europe, especially since the mid-1990s in the central and northern areas and in springtime. There is a mean increase of SSR of at least 2 W m(-2) per decade from 1983 to 2010 over the whole Europe, which, taking into account that the satellite-derived product lacks of aerosol variations, can be mostly related to a decrease in the cloud radiative effects over Europe. Secondly, residual series have been derived as the result of the difference between ground based and satellite-derived all-sky SSR data. The residual mean series points to a significant increase during the period 1983-2010, with higher rates of around 2 W m(-2) per decade over central and eastern Europe. The spatial variation of these residual time series, which are in line with clear-sky SSR trends over Europe reported in the literature, seem to suggest that these differences in the residual series are not just explained by calibration issues in the satellite-derived product.

Recently, satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD), with high-resolution and wide spatial-temporal coverage has been increasingly applied to estimate PM2.5 concentrations. However, these AOD-based PM2.5 concentrations were spontaneously estimated using the structure fixed models across an entire study period. While these \'structure fixed\' simplifications greatly facilitated the efficiency of model developments and enhanced their generalizability, they ignored the fact that the \'contributors\' of PM2.5 variation are not always coherent with time. For this, we propose a timely structure adaptive modeling (TSAM) method for satellite based ground PM2.5 estimation in this study by considering the timely variations of modeling predictors and magnitude of predictors at respective optimal spatial scales. Meanwhile, the reliability of TSAM for estimating national scale daily PM2.5 concentrations was tested by employing the AOD data from June 1, 2013 to May 31, 2014 over China with other multi-source auxiliary data such as meteorological factors, land use etc. While the fitting degree (R-2) of the daily TSAM models is 0.82, the one in 10-fold validation is 0.80, which are relatively higher than previous studies. These results are significantly better than those from structure-fixed models in this study. Additionally, the TSAM simulated PM2.5 concentrations show that the national annual PM2.5 concentration in China during study period is 69.71 mu g/m(3) with significant seasonal changes. These concentrations exceed the Level 2 of CNAAQS in more than 70% Chinese territory. Therefore, it can be concluded that the TSAM is a promising PM2.5 modeling method that is superior to structure-fixed modeling and could be very useful for air pollution mapping over large geographic areas.

As major contributors to biomass decomposition, fungi are important to forest bio-geochemical cycling and maintenance of vertebrate animal diversity. Many forest plant species live in a symbiotic relationship with a fungal partner that helps a host plant to acquire nutrients and water. In addition, edible fungi are recreationally as well as economically valuable. However, most fungi live in very cryptic locations (e.g. in soils and interior plant tissues) and are only visible when their ephemeral fruiting bodies are produced, making fungal occurrence difficult to detect and predict. While remote sensing has been used increasingly to identify and scale many forest characteristics (e.g. structure, function, and species diversity) related to myriad ecosystem services, the use of remotely sensed data in modelling the occurrence of fungi is largely unknown. We compared the performance of airborne lidar derived structural variables, including those associated with single tree detection, with variables derived from field inventories to model overall fungal species abundance as well as specific fungal guilds (i.e. a range of edibility from highly edible to very poisonous, and the number of fruiting bodies of saprotrophic and mutualistic ectomycorrhizal species) based on fruiting body sampling in a low range mountain forest (Bavarian Forest National Park). Lidar derived variables performed better than variables derived from field measurements to explain the abundance of all guilds combined, as well as the guilds of soil saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi, and the yield of highly edible fungi. Variables derived from field measurements performed better than lidar derived variables in explaining the yield of very poisonous fungi. Upscaling of yield and abundance of fruiting bodies to the whole study area opens the avenue for managers to identify areas of high interest by mushroom pickers, as opposed to those of potential danger to people and those that co-occur with sensitive species and habitats of conservation relevance. Moreover, the strong, guild-specific relationships found between the occurrence of fungi and lidar derived variables opens new avenues for scaling to large areas the occurrence of members of this cryptic kingdom.

Satellite images suggest that forests flooded seasonally by nutrient-poor black waters are more susceptible to fire and may suffer greater fire damage than nearby upland forests. Reasons for this difference may include the presence of a root mat, more fine fuel as litter and a drier understory in the flooded forest. We investigated this difference in the field, hypothesizing that differences in the aboveground structure of the pre-burn forest can contribute to the difference in impacts of, and susceptibility to, fires. We employed a portable profiling LiDAR (PPL), first to compare damage between adjacent black water seasonally flooded and upland forests that were burned by the same fire event, and to then assess pre-fire canopy structure attributes known to affect fire susceptibility. For both assessments, we used PPL-derived metrics of leaf area and vertical and horizontal variation in the structure of vegetation in the canopy. Four years after the fire, the LiDAR metrics showed greater combined effects of high damage and slow recovery in the seasonally flooded forest; reduction of total Leaf Area Index (LAI) after burning was only 10% for upland forest but was 71% in the flood forest. Compared to unburned upland, the canopy of unburned flood forest had structural differences that increase susceptibility to fire, including drier microclimate. It had more gaps, a more open understory and a lower upper canopy. Small patches lacking canopy closure (LAI < 1.0) were far more abundant in the unburned flood forest. We conclude that black water seasonally flooded forest suffers greater fire damage than upland forest and canopy structure contributes to its greater susceptibility to the occurrence of fires. This must be considered in assessments of future Amazon fire risks and impacts, including flood forest acting as a potential conduit for spreading fire to upland forest. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The study focused on the PALS (Passive Active L-band System) radiometer data collected during the SMAPVEXI2 (Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment 2012) field experiment which took place in southern Manitoba, Canada in 2012. The experiment domain covers croplands with high clay content as well as croplands and grasslands with sandy soils. A retrieval algorithm was parameterized for these specific land types. The formulation of the retrieval algorithm is based on a traditional surface scattering assumption. Based on this data set we found that for the clayey croplands the surface scattering assumption is inadequate, and that the algorithm needed significant tuning for the sandy soils. Empirically-based parameters for retrieving soil moisture under these conditions were developed. We also applied the parameterized algorithm to the retrieval of soil moisture for the entire experiment domain. We found that the use of sub grid modeling improves the retrieval performance to a satisfactory level despite the challenging land types encountered. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

While various algorithms were proposed in the literature so far and tested for oceanic waters of diverse constituent composition, an independent algorithm evaluation is needed for local ocean waters that have dynamic variation in optically active water constituents such as colored dissolved organic matters (CDOM) and suspended particulate matter (SPM). This paper evaluates the performance of chlorophyll algorithms for Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) radiometric data, using in situ measurements collected at 491 stations around Korea Peninsula during 2010-2014 from which there were 130 match-ups with GOCI data. For the evaluation in areas with high variation in SPM, water samples were first classified into three levels of SPM, and then the coefficients of candidate algorithms were newly derived for the turbidity cases using the in situ and GOCI remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) data. Functional forms of traditional band ratio algorithms (e.g. OC algorithms (O\'Reilly et al., 1998) and Tassan\'s algorithm (Tassan, 1994)), fluorescence line height algorithm, and near-infrared-to-red band ratio approach were tested. The evaluation results for the coincident in situ pairs of R-rs and chlorophyll measurements showed that the mean uncertainty was <35% with the correlation around 0.8 by using the 00 with turbidity consideration (OCT) and Tassan\'s algorithm with turbidity dependent coefficients (Tassan-TD). For the GOCI match-ups, the mean uncertainty for all turbidity levels was around 35% with correlation around 0.65, when OCT and Tassan-TD were used. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This paper proposes an alternative classification scheme for urban mapping based on a gradient approach for the southern portion of the West African country of Ghana. Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and European Remote Sensing Satellite-2 (ERS-2) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery are used to generate a pattern based definition of the urban context. Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) is used to classify a Landsat scene into Built, Vegetation and Other land covers. Landscape metrics are estimated for Built and Vegetation land covers for a 450 m uniform grid covering the study area. A measure of texture is extracted from the SAR imagery and classified as Built/Non-built. SMA based measures of Built and Vegetation fragmentation are combined with SAR texture based Built/Non-built maps through a decision tree classifier to generate a nine class urban context map capturing the transition from unsettled land at one end of the gradient to the compact urban core at the other end. Training and testing of the decision tree classifier was done using very high spatial resolution reference imagery from Google Earth. An overall classification agreement of 77% was determined for the nine-class urban context map, with user\'s accuracy (commission errors) being lower than producer\'s accuracy (omission errors). Nine urban contexts were classified and then compared with data from the 2000 Census of Ghana. Results suggest that the urban classes appropriately differentiate areas along the urban gradient.

Remote sensing allows indirect observation of permafrost, a subsurface phenomenon, by mapping surface features or measuring physical parameters that can be used for permafrost modeling. We have explored high temporal resolution time series of TerraSAR-X backscatter intensity and interferometric coherence for the period between August 2012 and September 2013 to assess their potential for detecting major seasonal changes to the land surface in a variety of tundra environments within the Lena River Delta, Siberia. The TerraSAR-X signal is believed to be strongly affected by the vegetation layer, and its viability for the retrieval of soil moisture, for example, is therefore limited. In our study individual events, such as rain and snow showers, that occurred at the time of TerraSAR-X acquisition, or a refrozen crust on the snowpack during the spring melt were detected based on back scatter intensity signatures. The interferometric coherence showed marked variability; the snow cover onset and snow melt periods were identified by significant reduction in coherence. Principal component analysis provided a good spatial overview of the essential information contained in backscatter and coherence time series and revealed latent relationships between both time series and the surface temperature.   The results of these investigations suggest that although X-band SAR has limitations with respect to monitoring seasonal land surface changes in permafrost areas, high-resolution time series of TerraSAR-X backscatter and coherence can provide new insights into environmental conditions.

Due to the large extent and poor accessibility of many river systems, remote sensing techniques are a potential tool for collecting information and analyzing characteristics of river ice covers. Optical data with high temporal resolution (e.g. MODIS products) are suitable for monitoring river ice phenology and mapping river ice cover extent, while radar data (e.g. RADARSAT-2 imagery) offer an optimal approach to characterizing river ice thickness, ice types and seasonal changes of ice-cover characteristics. An integrated automated approach, utilizing remotely sensed data from both active and passive sensors, was developed and applied to characterize river ice processes along the Slave River, Northwest Territories, Canada. The results show that the analysis of MODIS band 2 (841-876 nm) time series can detect the date of river ice freeze onset (FO) and water clear of ice (WCI) with a deviation of up to 12 days and 3 days, respectively. The rate of river ice breakup is much faster than the rate of river freezeup. The profiles of MODIS band 2 reflectance data along the river, however, showed insignificant differences between different breakup stages and ice types, making it challenging to map breakup ice types. In this case, RADARSAT-2 imagery can be used successfully to characterize and map four classes of water and ice covers during the breakup period, including intact ice, smooth rubble ice, rough rubble ice and open water. In association with hydrometeorological parameters, the thermal deterioration of the ice cover during breakup appears to be the primary breakup event in the Slave River. The results obtained from the analysis of MODIS and RADARSAT-2 data were compared with ground measurements of weather, flow and ice conditions (2000-2015), time-lapse photos and aerial surveys (2013-2015) along the Slave River, and show strong agreement.

In order to detect disturbances in these areas we developed an automated processing chain for the calculation and analysis of robust trends of key land surface indicators based on the full record of available Landsat TM, ETM +, and OLI data. The methodology was applied to the similar to 29,000 km(2) Lena Delta in Northeast Siberia, where robust trend parameters (slope, confidence intervals of the slope, and intercept) were calculated for Tasseled Cap Greenness, Wetness and Brightness, NDVI, and NDWI, and NDMI based on 204 Landsat scenes for the observation period between 1999 and 2014. The resulting datasets revealed regional greening trends within the Lena Delta with several localized hot-spots of change, particularly in the vicinity of the main river channels. With a 30-m spatial resolution various permafrost-thaw related processes and disturbances, such as thermokarst lake expansion and drainage, fluvial erosion, and coastal changes were detected within the Lena Delta region, many of which have not been noticed or described before. Such hotspots of permafrost change exhibit significantly different trend parameters compared to non-disturbed areas. The processed dataset, which is made freely available through the data archive PANGAEA, will be a useful resource for further process specific analysis by researchers and land managers. With the high level of automation and the use of the freely available Landsat archive data, the workflow is scalable and transferrable to other regions, which should enable the comparison of land surface changes in different permafrost affected regions and help to understand and quantify permafrost landscape dynamics.

The near-continuous time series of L-band brightness temperatures covers a total of six winter seasons, over both dry mineral soil in a forest clearing, and organic soil over a wetland site. Detailed measurements of snow and soil conditions are available from both sites. Complementing a previous theoretical study, we show that dry snow cover influences the observed L-band brightness temperatures as a result of both impedance matching and changes in the refraction angle at the snow-soil interface. Exploiting these effects, we demonstrate the retrieval of the bottom layer snow density and the influence of dry snow cover on simultaneously retrieved soil permittivity a consideration which is currently not accounted for in Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) retrievals of soil permittivity in the presence of dry snow. Depending on season, the mean bias error between retrieved and in situ snow density measured in the lower snow layers was between 6 kg m(-3) and 15 kg m(-3) for the forest clearing site, and between 37 kg m(-3) and 90 kg m(-3) for the wetland site, demonstrating the feasibility of the retrieval approach at the plot scale. In winter conditions, the ground permittivity retrieved without considering the impact of dry snow on L-band emission was, on average, 35% lower for both test sites, which indicates possible errors in current SMOS ground permittivity retrievals under dry snow conditions. The application of SMOS data to simultaneously retrieve dry snow density and ground permittivity is a complex task due to heterogeneous land cover and snow/soil conditions within SMOS pixels (approximate to 45 km resolution). An approach that considers land cover variations and the spatial variability of snow cover is required to fully determine the feasibility of the methodology to aid e.g. improving estimates snow water equivalent from other sensors, and to take into account effects of dry snow in SMOS-based retrievals of ground permittivities. The results should also be applicable to other L-band sensors in space, such as the recently launched NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The orchard was cultivated under a control treatment (ET) that received 100% of its water requirements and two regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) treatments with water supply reduced to 37% and 50% of the control level during the summer. Field measurements consisted of assimilation rate, stomata( conductance, stem water potential, leaf fluorescence and leaf reflectance. The airborne campaigns took place in 2012 and 2013, and were flown on the solar plane in order to acquire hyperspectral imagery at 40 cm resolution, 260 spectral bands and 1.85 nm/pixels in the 400-885 nm spectral region. A thermal camera was installed in tandem in all flights, acquiring imagery in the 7.5-13 mu m spectral region at 640 x 480 pixel resolution, yielding a 50 cm pixel size. The robustness of the SIF quantification through the Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) principle based on three spectral bands (FLD3), as well as the performance of physiological and structural hyperspectral indices, was evaluated in order to understand their ability to track photosynthesis at different phenological and stress stages throughout the season. Solar induced fluorescence quantified as FLD3 was the most robust indicator of photosynthesis in all the airborne campaigns performed in the course of the two-year experiment, which comprised seven midday flights and two diurnals. The relationships between fluorescence (FLD3) and assimilation rates yielded correlation coefficients (R) between 0.64 and 0.82 across all dates, these being statistically significant with p-values between p < 0.05 and p < 0.0001. Fluorescence retrievals performed better than structural and physiological indices, with the structural MTVI1 index being the only other statistically significant indicator throughout the season, although it yielded lower levels of significance than FLD3. A normalization strategy proposed for SIF FLD3 for all dates using control (ET) trees on each flight date as a reference permitted the generation of a single relationship between FLD3 normalized (FLDn) and assimilation rates for the entire year, both at tree (r(2) = 0.5; p < 0.0001) and treatment level (r(2) = 0.72; p < 0.0001), a strategy that confirmed the ability of seasonal SIF retrievals to track photosynthesis from broader resolution hyperspectral imagery (i.e. spectral resolution 1-5 nm full-width at half maximum (FWHM)) for applications in the context of precision agriculture and crop-monitoring studies.

Here, uncertainty estimates are derived using the comparison on a 12th-degree grid of coincident daily records of the remote-sensing reflectance R-RS obtained with the same processing chain from three satellite missions, MERIS, MODIS and SeaWiFS. The approach is spatially resolved and produces sigma, the part of the R-RS uncertainty budget associated with random effects. The global average of sigma decreases with wavelength from approximately 0.7-0.910(-3) sr(-1) at 412 nm to 0.05-0.1 10(-3) sr(-1) at the red band, with uncertainties on sigma evaluated as 20-30% between 412 and 555 nm, and 30-40% at 670 nm. The distribution of sigma shows a restricted spatial variability and small variations with season, which makes the multi-annual global distribution of sigma-an estimate applicable to all retrievals of the considered missions. The comparison of sigma with other uncertainty estimates derived from field data or with the support of algorithms provides a consistent picture. When translated in relative terms, and assuming a relatively low bias, the distribution of sigma suggests that the objective of a 5% uncertainty is fulfilled between 412 and 490 nm for oligotrophic waters (chlorophyll-a concentration below 0.1 mg m(-3)). This study also provides comparison statistics. Spectrally, the mean absolute relative difference between R-RS from different missions shows a characteristic U-shape with both ends at blue and red wavelengths inversely related to the amplitude of R-RS. On average and for the considered data sets, SeaWiFS R-RS tend to be slightly higher than MODIS R-RS, which in turn appear higher than MERIS R-RS. Biases between mission-specific R-RS may exhibit a seasonal dependence, particularly in the subtropical belt. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Multi-temporal image analysis of high-resolution optical and radar satellite imagery of the Southern Carpathian Mountains, Romania revealed the small dynamic nature and a slow geomorphologic evolution of rock glaciers over a 46-yr period of record (1968-2014). Nine rock glaciers located in glacial cirques and troughs within the central area of Retezat Mountain were included in this study. Overall, the estimated displacement rates are extremely low (i.e., a few cm/year) compared with other active rock glaciers from all over the world. Despite their relative attenuated activity, it appears that Judele, Valea Rea, and Pietrele are still active rock glaciers, but in an evident disequilibrium/imbalance with the actual climate. These findings document the lowest altitude and easternmost active rock glaciers at this latitude from Europe. Quantitative investigations were concentrated on Pietrele rock glacier, subject of recent field campaigns. Optical data analysis indicated a slight acceleration of the horizontal velocities at the surface of Pietrele rock glacier in recent years. This acceleration appears to be caused by an increase in the temperature of permafrost, resulting from an evident warming of external air temperature. Radar data analysis suggested seasonal variability of surface motion, with higher deformation in autumn, whereas in early summer or spring the deformation is negligible. Overall, the results obtained with cross-correlation analysis, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) coherence analysis, and Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) multitemporal interferometry, are consistent, displaying similar deformation patterns with the highest creep rates located in the southern and western portions of the glacier. These findings are supported by thermal and geophysical measurements, which suggest the probable presence of permafrost within these areas. The observed displacements were interpreted as permafrost creep, and their very low velocity rates suggest the deforming frozen layers are very thin. These results provide (i) baseline information and decadal-scale trends and a (ii) strategy for future monitoring of the health and integrity of the rock glacier environment in the Carpathian Mountains.

We compared and contrasted the ability of WorldView-2 (WV-2), ALOS AVNIR-2 (AVNIR-2) and Landsat TM (TM) image data (2 m, 10 m and 30 m pixel sizes, respectively), to estimate LAI through regression analysis at sites in Moreton Bay (Australia) and Karimunjawa Island (Indonesia). We also investigated the effect of different pixel averaging windows (3 x 3, 5 x 5, and 7 x 7 pixels) and multi-resolution segmentation scale parameters (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50) applied to the WV-2 image for LAI estimation. The results showed that LAI estimation using remote sensing data varies across sites and sensors. Estimation of LAI in this study was influenced by the local spatial variation of mangrove phenological stages and canopy cover. The regression analyses showed significant coefficient of determination (R-2) values ranging from 0.50 to 0.83 across different sensors (TM, AVNIR-2, WV-2), segmentation scales (10, 20,30, 40, 50) and SVIs (SR, NDVI, SAVI, EVI). The sensor and SVIs assessment identified the ALOS AVNIR-2 and NDVI as the optimal estimators of LAI, with R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.54 for Moreton Bay, and R-2 = 0.82, RMSE = 1.31 for Karimunjawa Island. The optimum image pixel size for estimating LAI was related to the average canopy size (about 10 m in diameter) and the field sampling size (10 m). Image segmentation significantly increased the LAI estimation accuracy by approximately 14% for both sites. The findings of this study provide an understanding of the relationship between image spatial resolution, field sampling size and spatial variation of mangrove vegetation for estimating LAI. These findings can be potentially used as a guide for selecting the optimum imagery for LAI estimation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Extensive developments were observed in the two last decades concerning both satellite, airborne, on-board and ground systems. The present paper focuses on an advanced 3D reconstruction of a gas cloud detected in the atmosphere of an urban area using a scanning infrared (IR) gas system (SIGIS2, Bruker). Several measurements were carried out from 3 different positions in order to monitor an atmospheric volume around 10(8) m(3). The images generated by the imaging remote sensing system correspond to the 2-D projections of the 3-D gas cloud. All the 2-D data are fully georeferenced (x, y, z and t). Each pixel of the 2-D images is associated to an IR spectrum, which was approximated to a linear combination of reference spectra and expressed as a coefficient of correlation (0 to 1). Data with a correlation coefficient higher than 0.75 are selected for 3-D modeling. The method for 3-D reconstruction of gas clouds is based on the combination and relocation of all the oriented and georeferenced measurement data. The 3-D gas cloud is determined from the 2-D images in the volume of interest processing a 3-D interpolation using the gOcad (R) DSI procedure. This integrated approach was applied to a local case study in an urban area. It leads to the identification and the spatial demarcation of a cloud of SO2 with a total volume of 65 x 10(6) m(3). The existence of this pollutant may be related to the presence of ancient underground tanks of gasoline, leaking because of a defect of waterproofness. Another source of SO2 can be the emission of gases stemming from diesel machines used for important public works in this urban area. This study demonstrates that the combination of scanning imaging IR spectroscopy with the measurement setup and the 3-D gOcad (R) processing can be used as a generic approach for 3-D reconstruction of gas clouds applied to any kind of ground emissive sites.

Furthermore, they yield results that are summative, representing total number of particles or total volume or weight of particles in standardized size fractions. Here, we present a novel approach that cannot only accurately quantify the number of particles, but also their size and shape. In addition, the method we present replaces the manual measurement of the particles on leaf surfaces with an automated step. We applied the well-developed object-based image analysis technique to scanning electronic microscope (SEM) micrographs of tree leaf, and tested this approach for replicate SEM micrographs of a common urban tree species. We demonstrated that: 1) this new method automatically identifies the number of particles, as well as their size and shape, in contrast to the commonly used microscopic inspection approach that can only measure the number of particles; and 2) this method achieved similar overall accuracy to that of microscopic inspection (92.17% versus 95.53%), but microscopic inspection takes fourteen times longer. It is expected that the difference in efficiency would be more significant with the increase of micrograph numbers, because micrographs can be batch processed with object-based classification. With the greatly increased efficiency and the ability of the proposed method to capture new variables about particle shape and complexity, this method can facilitate comparative research on the adsorption capacities of different plant species, and potentially identifying the source apportionment of particulate matters based on their morphological characteristics, which may provide insights for species selection for pollutant reduction.

For this, a new vegetation index (VI) is proposed using reflectance data from five bands in the visible green to shortwave infrared region. This index is called VIGS (Vegetation Index considering Greenness and Shortwave infrared), developed so that the VI can accurately detect vegetation stress caused by metal contamination of soils. A set of laboratory experiments was conducted to demonstrate the capability of VIGS, which investigates change in reflectance spectra based on the concentration of four selected metals (Cu, Pb, Zn, and Cd) in soils. The results show that VIGS values are more sensitive to vegetation stress than the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and can amplify the stress difference, depending on soil metal contents. The VIGS is further examined for a mineralized area containing hydrothermal copper deposits in Jambi, central Sumatra, Indonesia, for which a set of geochemical data of the top layer composed of weathered rocks and soils were systematically obtained. Through kriging of point content data, the spatial distributions of Cu, Pb, and Zn in soil are found to be strongly correlated with the geology and controlled by faults. Using one Landsat ETM + scene image after atmospheric correction, VIGS values are calculated by a combination of reflectances in bands 2, 3,4, 5, and 7. The effectiveness of VIGS is proven by this case study, because VIGS anomalies appeared in high-content zones common to the three metals. This concordance probably originated from the fact that plant formations (mainly primary forest) in the high metal zones are closely related to the geological units. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In an effort to extend these capabilities to Landsat Multispectal Scanner (MSS) imagery, we introduce MSS clear-view-mask (MSScvm), an automated cloud and shadow identification algorithm for MSS imagery. The algorithm is specific to the unique spectral characteristics of MSS data, relying on a simple, rule-based approach. Clouds are identified based on green band brightness and the normalized difference between the green and red bands, while cloud shadows are identified by near infrared band darkness and cloud projection. A digital elevation model is incorporated to correct for topography-induced illumination variation and aid in identifying water. Based on an accuracy assessment of 1981 points stratified by land cover and algorithm mask class for 12 images throughout the United States, MSScvm achieved an overall accuracy of 84.0%. Omission of thin clouds and bright cloud shadows constituted much of the error. Perennial ice and snow, misidentified as cloud, also contributed disproportionally to algorithm error. Comparison against a corresponding assessment of the Fmask algorithm, applied to coincident TM imagery, showed similar error patterns and a general reduction in accuracy commensurate with differences in the radiometric and spectral richness of the two sensors. MSScvm provides a suitable automated method for creating cloud and cloud shadow masks for MSS imagery required for time series analyses in temperate ecosystems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Three sub-regions of fold-and-thrust belt are the Potwar Plateau-Salt Range, Kohat Plateau-Surghar Range and the Bannu Basin-Khisor Range. The difference in deformation intensity between these regions is mainly attributed to the presence, or absence, of an Infra-Cambrian salt layer. This study investigates the active tectonics of the Potwar Plateau and Salt Range region, emphasizing the role of salt, using the Small Baseline Subset Interferometry (SBAS) technique and 2-D seismic interpretations. Ten PALSAR images and four seismic profiles from western Potwar Plateau-Salt Range region were used. SBAS results, derived from PALSAR images spanning from 2007 to 2010, suggest that the Potwar Plateau-Salt Range is active with the western portion of the region experiencing an uplift at an average rate of around 10 mm/year. Two uplift anomalies were observed, which were interpreted as zones of transpression and salt diapirism. Time-migrated seismic profiles show that the salt layer acts as a detachment. Our results show that salt has different roles in different regions of the fold-and-thrust belt; in the Potwar Plateau region the salt layer acts as a detachment, while in Salt Range salt flow-induced structures are prominent. The integration of SBAS and 2D seismic interpretation reveals that the deformation of western Potwar Plateau-Salt Range is influenced by two main faults, the dextral Kalabagh fault and the Main Frontal Thrust. Finally, this work was compared to the Kuqa fold-and-thrust belt in western China due to their structural similarities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Additionally estimating the proportion of area of each class based on the best assessment of ground condition (i.e., the reference classification) of the locations selected in the sample is often of interest for monitoring status and change in land cover. Stratified random sampling is a commonly used sampling design for accuracy assessment, and an important decision for this design is the allocation of sample size to the strata. In this article, the allocation that minimizes the sum of the variances of the estimators of user\'s accuracy, producer\'s accuracy, and area of a single targeted class for a fixed total sample size is derived for stratified random sampling. For example, the targeted class might be a rare land-cover type such as wetland or in the case of a land-cover change assessment forest loss. An Excel sample allocation calculator implements the optimization and two examples illustrate the application. Practitioners can apply these optimization results to guide sample size allocation decisions when using a stratified random sampling design for accuracy assessment and area estimation.

Here, we test if for the quantification of leaf traits an ensemble of regression models, consisting of Partial Least Squares (PLSR), Random Forest (RFR), and Support Vector Machine regression (SVMR) models, is able to improve the robustness of the spectral band selection process compared to the outcome of a single technique alone. The ensemble approach was tested using one artificial and five measured data sets of leaf level spectra and corresponding information on leaf chlorophyll, dry matter, and water content. PLSR models optimized for the goodness of fit, an established approach for band selection, were used to evaluate the performance of the ensemble. Although the fits of the models within the ensemble were poorer than the fits achieved with the reference approach, the ensemble was able to provide a band selection with higher consistency across all data sets. Due to the selection characteristics of the methods within the ensemble, the ensemble selection is moderately narrow and restrictive but in good agreement with known absorption features published in literature. We conclude that analyzing the range of agreement of different model types is an efficient way to select a robust set of spectral bands related to the foliar properties under investigation. This may help to deepen our understanding of the spectral response of biochemical and biophysical traits in foliage and canopies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we evaluated the sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface wind speed (SSW) data from the AMSR2 (ver. 1) standard product, provided by JAXA, by comparison with mooring buoy data or global products. From a comparison of the AMSR2 and Triangle Trans-Ocean Buoy Network (TRITON) data, mean differences of 0.21 degrees C and 030 m/s, and root mean square (RMS) differences of 0.49 degrees C and 125 m/s, were inferred for SST and SSW, respectively. During daytime low wind-speed conditions, SSTs from AMSR2 are significantly higher than from TRITON. This implies that SSTs from AMSR2 are strongly affected by diurnal heating. From an intercomparison of global products for the Southern Ocean, the annual-mean SSW from AMSR2 is as much as 1 m/s lower than values from other SSW products. Although the SSW data from AMSR2 have a similar accuracy to data from other products, the AMSR2 data have the advantage of fewer missing data compared with other products. Furthermore, we checked for significant differences in annual means by comparing data from WindSat, AMSR2, and AMSR for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) provided by JAXA. For the Southern Ocean, we found remarkable differences in the annual-mean values of SST and SSW. SSTs from AMSR2 are lower than from WindSat in regions of strong current in the Northern Hemisphere, and SSTs from AMSR-E JAXA are higher than from WindSat in the same regions. However, the results also suggest a risk of artificial trends in the satellite data if AMSR2, AMSR-E JAXA, and WindSat data are used continuously. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

To meet the increasing demand for more accurate satellite measurements, an integrated method is developed mainly to improve the relative calibration accuracy by combining the results from different vicarious methods. In this study, three commonly used vicarious calibration methods, the desert, Deep Convective Cloud (DCC) and ray-matching methods, are applied to the GOES-12 Imager visible data to describe the integrated method. The integrated method first combines the normalized observations of each individual method by anchoring the results on the first day of satellite operation, and then removes the deviated combined observations using a recursive filtering method. This integration is based on the fact that the GOES sensor trending functions from different methods are limy similar within 1% difference over the 7-year study period. The trending uncertainty of the integrated method is less than that of each individual one. The absolute calibration of the integrated method can be achieved by generating the calibration coefficients using the reflectance of reference targets which are well characterized with the Aqua MODIS Collection 6 (C6) data. It is found that there is less than 1% difference between the calibration coefficients derived with the DCC and desert reference targets. It is expected that this integrated method will be a useful tool to validate the GOES-R ABI on-board radiometric calibration accuracy for the solar reflective channels.

We compared the satellite-based understory NDVI series to seasonal courses of understory NDVI measured in the forests for three full growing seasons in boreal and hemiboreal sites in Northern Europe. Our results indicated both semi-empirical and physically-based approaches using MODIS BRDF data do have a potential to track seasonal changes in understory NDVI.

In this study, we estimated LAI spatially using airborne lidar in downtown Santa Barbara, California, USA. We implemented two different modeling approaches. First, we directly estimated effective LAI (LAIe) using scan angle- and clump-corrected lidar laser penetration metrics (LPM). Second, we adapted existing allometric equations to estimate crown structural metrics including tree height and crown base height using lidar. The latter approach allowed for LAI estimates at the individual tree-crown scale. The LPM method, at both high and decimated point densities, resulted in good linear agreement with estimates from ground-based hemispherical photography (r(2) = 0.82, y = 0.99x) using a model that assumed a spherical leaf angle distribution. Within individual tree crown segments, the lidar estimates of crown structure closely paralleled field measurements (e.g., r(2) = 0.87 for crown length). LAI estimates based on the lidar crown measurements corresponded well with estimates from field measurements (r(2) = 0.84, y = 0.97x + 0.10). Consistency of the LPM and allometric lidar methods was also strong at 71 validation plots (r(2) = 0.88) and at 450 additional sample locations across the entire study area (r(2) = 0.72). This level of correspondence exceeded that of the canopy hemispherical photography and allometric, ground-based estimates (r(2) = 0.53). The first-order alignment of these two disparate methods may indicate that the error bounds for mapping LAI in cities are small enough to pursue large scale, spatially explicit estimation.

Prior to generating such products, suitable algorithms have to be selected that are appropriate for the purpose. Algorithm selection needs to account for both qualitative and quantitative requirements. In this paper we develop an objective methodology designed to rank the quantitative performance of a suite of bio-optical models. The objective classification is applied using the NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Dataset (NOMAD). Using in situ Rrs as input to the models, the performance of eleven semi-analytical models, as well as five empirical chlorophyll algorithms and an empirical diffuse attenuation coefficient algorithm, is ranked for spectrally-resolved IOPs, chlorophyll concentration and the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 489 nm. The sensitivity of the objective classification and the uncertainty in the ranking are tested using a Monte-Carlo approach (bootstrapping). Results indicate that the performance of the semi-analytical models varies depending on the product and wavelength of interest. For chlorophyll retrieval, empirical algorithms perform better than semi-analytical models, in general. The performance of these empirical models reflects either their immunity to scale errors or instrument noise in R data, or simply that the data used for model parameterisation were not independent of NOMAD. Nonetheless, uncertainty in the classification suggests that the performance of some semi-analytical algorithms at retrieving chlorophyll is comparable with the empirical algorithms. For phytoplankton absorption at 443 nm, some semi-analytical models also perform with similar accuracy to an empirical model: We discuss the potential biases, limitations and uncertainty in the approach, as well as additional qualitative considerations for algorithm selection for climate-change studies. Our classification has the potential to be routinely implemented, such that the performance of emerging algorithms can be compared with existing algorithms as they become available. In the long-term, such an approach will further aid algorithm development for ocean-colour studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.', '[Brewin, Robert J.

The latter three products were derived from MERIS and VEGETATION sensors (one product from each sensor separately, and a third one from the merging of MERIS and VGT products). The reference fire perimeters were mapped from two multi-temporal Landsat TM/ETM + images at 103 non-overlapping Thiessen scene areas (TSA) selected with a stratified random sampling design. The validation results were based on cross tabulated error matrices from which six accuracy measures were computed following the requirements of end-users of burned area products. While overall accuracy (OA) exceeded 99% for all products, overall accuracy was lower for the burned class. Burned area commission error ratio was above 40% for all products and omission error ratio was above 65% for all products. The statistical significance of differences in accuracy between pairs of products was evaluated based on theory of the stratified combined ratio estimator. Statistical tests identified the MCD64 as the most accurate product, followed by MCD45 and the MERIS product. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
