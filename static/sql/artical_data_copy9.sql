Thermal infrared images were taken of a 1000 m(2) polygonal tundra area in 10 min intervals from July to September 2008 Under clear sky conditions, the individual measurements indicate temperature differences of up to 6 K between dry and wet tundra surfaces and which can exceed 12 K when dry tundra and water surfaces are compared These differences disappear when temperature averages are considered for intervals longer than the diurnal cycle, for weekly averages the spatial temperature variability decreases below 1 K The exception is the free water surface of a shallow polygonal pond where weekly averaged temperature differences of 25 K are sustained compared to the tundra surface.   The ground based thermal infrared images are upscaled to MODIS sized pixels and compared to available MODIS LST data for individual measurements and weekly averages The comparisons show generally good agreement for the individual measurements under clear sky conditions, which exist during 20% of the studied time period However, several erroneous measurements and large data gaps occur in the MODIS LST data during cloudy conditions, leading to biased weekly temperature averages inferred from the satellite observations Based on these results the following recommendations are given for future permafrost temperature monitoring based on MODIS LST products (i) high resolution surface water masks for the quality assessment in landscapes where lakes and ponds are frequent and (ii) reliable cloud cover detection in conjunction with a gap filling procedure for accurate temporal averages.

Central to this endeavor is the ability to detect the motions of internal waves, swell waves and currents and hence follow energy transport and exchange. However, the present methods of monitoring the motions of water bodies from space, such as those based on altimetry or gravity measurements, are geared mostly toward applications on large spatial scales, whereas the capacity to map the fine details of hydrospheric flows is limited. This paper describes a satellite-based method of detecting wave motion and surface currents at high (in principle metric) resolution that can be applied under specific circumstances in the confined environs of narrow sea straits, lakes and rivers and that compliments the use of other high-spatial resolution techniques such as those based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). The Along-Track Stereo Sun Glitter (ATSSG) technique makes use of images of water bodies that are separated in time by roughly 1 min and are gathered in the forward-, nadir- and backward-looking directions by space-borne optical sensors performing along-track observations. When sensor viewing geometries lead to the presence of Sun glitter in these images, surface slicks, internal waves, swell waves and other phenomena become highlighted through the surface roughness changes they induce, since these in turn modulate the reflected glitter radiance. Measurement of the differential displacements between congruent sections of the surface roughness signatures present within image pairs of the stereoscopic sequence then enables internal wave or swell wave motions to be determined, while surface currents can be deduced if \"passive\" tracers of the flow in the form of surface roughness structures (such as slicks) are present. The application of the ATSSG technique described herein makes use of data acquired at a spatial resolution of 2.5 m by the Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM) to provide the first along-track fine-scale synoptic mapping of the surface motions of individual components within a large group of internal waves and to generate supporting surface-current measurements. The PRISM data we employ were acquired to the south of the Lombok Strait (Indonesia), where highly energetic internal-wave growth takes place and where through-flow surface-current data, of the type derived by the ATSSG technique, can be of value in climate studies.

Therefore, understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of understory vegetation is essential for management and conservation. Nevertheless, detailed information on the distribution of understory vegetation across large spatial extents is usually unavailable, due to the interference of overstory canopy on the remote detection of understory vegetation. While many efforts have been made to overcome this challenge, mapping understory vegetation across large spatial extents is still limited due to a lack of generality of the developed methods and limited availability of required remotely sensed data. In this study, we used understory bamboo in Wolong Nature Reserve, China as a case study to develop and test an effective and practical remote sensing approach for mapping understory vegetation. Using phenology metrics generated from a time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data, we characterized the phenological features of forests with understory bamboo. Using maximum entropy modeling together with these phenology metrics, we successfully mapped the spatial distribution of understory bamboo (kappa: 0.59: AUC: 0.85). In addition, by incorporating elevation information we further mapped the distribution of two individual bamboo species, Bashania faberi and Fargesia robusta (kappa: 0.68 and 0.70; AUC: 0.91 and 0.92, respectively). Due to its generality, flexibility and extensibility, this approach constitutes an improvement to the remote detection of understory vegetation, making it suitable for mapping different understory species in different geographic settings. Both biodiversity conservation and wildlife habitat management may benefit from the detailed information on understory vegetation across large areas through the applications of this approach.

Surface reflectance in the middle-infrared (MIR) has been used to circumvent these difficulties because the signal is virtually unaffected by the presence of aerosols associated to biomass burning. Retrieval of the MIR reflected component from the total signal is, however, a difficult problem because of the presence of a diversity of radiance sources, namely the surface reflected solar irradiance and the surface emitted radiance that may reach comparable magnitude during daytime. The method proposed by Kaufman and Remer (1994) to retrieve surface MIR reflectance presents the advantage of not requiring auxiliary datasets (e.g. atmospheric profiles) nor major computational means (e.g. for solving radiative transfer models). Nevertheless, the method was specifically designed to retrieve MIR reflectance over dense dark forests in the middle latitudes and, as shown in the present study, severe problems may arise when applying it beyond the range of validity, namely for burned area mapping in tropical environments. The present study consists of an assessment of the performance of the method for a wide range of atmospheric, geometric and surface conditions and of the usefulness of extracted surface reflectances for burned area discrimination. Results show that, in the case of tropical environments, there is a significant decrease in performance of the method for high values of land surface temperature, especially when associated with low sun elevation angles. Burned area discrimination is virtually impaired in such conditions, which are often present when using data from instruments on-board polar orbiters, namely MODIS in Aqua and Terra, to map burned surfaces over the Amazon forest and \"cerrado\" savanna regions.

However, the processing of hyperspectral data is particularly complex both from a theoretical viewpoint [e.g. problems related to the Hughes phenomenon (Hughes, 1968) and from a computational perspective. Despite many previous investigations that have been presented in the literature on feature reduction and feature extraction in hyperspectral data, only a few studies have analyzed the role of spectral resolution on the classification accuracy in different application domains. In this paper, we present an empirical study aimed at understanding the relationship among spectral resolution, classifier complexity, and classification accuracy obtained with hyperspectral sensors for the classification of forest areas. We considered two different test sets characterized by images acquired by an AISA Eagle sensor over 126 bands with a spectral resolution of 4.6 nm, and we subsequently degraded its spectral resolution to 9.2,13.8,18.4, 23, 27.6, 32.2 and 36.8 nm. A series of classification experiments were carried out with bands at each of the degraded spectral resolutions, and bands selected with a feature selection algorithm at the highest spectral resolution (4.6 nm). The classification experiments were carried out with three different classifiers: Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Maximum Likelihood with Leave-One-Out-Covariance estimator, and Linear Discriminant Analysis. From the experimental results, important conclusions can be made about the choice of the spectral resolution of hyperspectral sensors as applied to forest areas, also in relation to the complexity of the adopted classification methodology.

Here, a simple ocean color index, namely the Floating Algae Index (FAI), is developed and used to detect floating algae in open ocean environments using the medium-resolution (250- and 500-m) data from operational MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instruments. FAI is defined as the difference between reflectance at 859 nm (vegetation \"red edge\") and a linear baseline between the red band (645 nm) and short-wave infrared band (1240 or 1640 nm). Through data comparison and model simulations, FAI has shown advantages over the traditional NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) or EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) because FAI is less sensitive to changes in environmental and observing conditions (aerosol type and thickness, solar/viewing geometry, and sun glint) and can \"see\" through thin clouds. The baseline subtraction method provides a simple yet effective means for atmospheric correction, through which floating algae can be easily recognized and delineated in various ocean waters, including the North Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea. Because similar spectral bands are available on many existing and planned satellite sensors such as Landsat TM/ETM+ and VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imager/Radiometer Suite), the FAI concept is extendable to establish a long-term record of these ecologically important ocean plants.

The proposed instrument will take measurements at four different wavelengths, which were chosen according to physiological processes altering leaf reflectance and transmittance. The modelling was used to assess both the structural and physiological information content such an instrument could provide, especially whether the normally structure-dominated return waveform would pick up small changes in reflectance at the leaf level. Multi-spectral waveforms were simulated for models of single Scots pine trees of different ages and at different stages of the growing season, including chlorophyll concentration induced changes in leaf optical properties. It was shown that the LiDAR waveforms would not only capture the tree height information, but would also pick up the seasonal and vertical variation of NDVI computed from two of the four MSCL wavelengths inside the tree canopy. The instrument concept was further tested in a simulation of a virtual forest stand constructed of 74 trees of different ages according to measurements taken on a field site being 20 by 20 meter in size. A total of 1521 NDVI profiles were computed and mean NDVI corrected backscatter was compared to the actual canopy profile of the virtual stand. The profiles picked up the seasonal variation of chlorophyll within the canopy, while the return of ground remained unchanged from June to September. Thus, it was shown that a MSCL instrument would be able to separately pick up the physiology of canopy and understorey and/or soil. It was found that occlusion would mask the lower parts of the canopy volume within the stand and the seasonal variation of this occlusion effect was quantified, being larger in September, when the absorption of canopy elements is higher. In addition, it could be demonstrated that a new multi-wavelength WAR predictor variable was able to significantly improve the retrieval accuracy of photosynthetically active biomass opposed to using a single-wavelength LiDAR alone.

Using the results from these measurements in conjunction with estimated sensor environmental noise thresholds, the theoretical minimum limit of detectability of each oil type (as a function of oil thickness) was calculated for both the hyperspectral HYMAP and multispectral Quickbird sensors. The Gippsland crude oil is discernable at layer thickness of 20 pm or more in the Quickbird green channel. The HYMAP sensor was found to be theoretically capable of detecting a layer of Gippsland crude oil with a thickness of 10 pm in approximately six sensor channels. By contrast, the North West Shelf light condensate was not able to be detected by either sensor for any thickness up to 200 pm. Optical remote sensing is therefore not applicable for detecting diagnostic absorption features associated with this light condensate oil type, which is typical of the chemistry of many hydrocarbon oils found in the Australian Northwest Shelf area and condensates world wide. We conclude that oil type is critical to the applicability of optical remote sensing for natural oil slick detection and identification. We recommend that a sensor- and oil-specific sensitivity study should be conducted prior to applying optical remote sensors for oil exploration.   The oil optical properties were obtained using two different laboratory methods, a reflectance-based approach and transmittance-based approach. The reflectance-based approach was relatively complex to implement, but was chosen in order to replicate as closely as possible real world remote sensing measurement conditions of an oil film on water. The transmittance-based approach, based upon standard laboratory spectrophotometric measurements was found to generate results in good agreement with the reflectance-based approach. Therefore, for future oil- and sensor-specific sensitivity studies, we recommend the relatively accessible transmittance-based approach, which is detailed in this paper.

However, in additional to these physical environment and sensor design factors, the ecologically determined spatial complexity of the reef itself presents significant challenges for remote sensing objectives. While previous studies have considered the spatial resolution of the sensors, none have directly drawn the link from sensor spatial resolution to the scale and patterns in the heterogeneity of reef benthos. In this paper, we will study how the accuracy of a commonly used maximum likelihood classification (MLC) algorithm is affected by spatial elements typical of a Caribbean atoll system present in high spectral and spatial resolution imagery.   The results indicate that the degree to which ecologically determined spatial factors influence accuracy is dependent on both the amount of coral cover on the reef and the spatial resolution of the images being classified, and may be a contributing factor to the differences in the accuracies obtained for mapping reefs in different geographical locations. Differences in accuracy are also obtained due to the methods of pixel selection for training the maximum likelihood classification algorithm. With respect to estimation of live coral cover, a method which randomly selects training samples from all samples in each class provides better estimates for lower resolution images while a method biased to select the pixels with the highest substrate purity gave better estimations for higher resolution images.

Degraded land, by definition, has suffered a change relative to its previous condition set by its climate, soil properties, topography and expectations of land managers. The local net production scaling (LNS) method, tested here in Zimbabwe, estimates potential production in homogeneous land capability classes and models the actual productivity using remotely-sensed observations. The difference between the potential and actual productivities provides a map of the location and severity of degradation. Six years of 250 m resolution MODIS data were used to estimate actual net production in Zimbabwe and calculate the LNS using three land capability classifications. The LNS maps agreed with known areas of degradation and with an independent degradation map. The principal source of error arose because of inhomogeneity of some land capability classes caused by, for example, the inclusion of local hot-spots of high production and differences in precipitation caused by local topography. Agriculture and other management can affect the degradation estimates and careful inspection of the LNS maps is essential to verify and identify the local causes of degradation. The Zimbabwe study found that approximately 16% of the country was at its potential production and the total loss in productivity due to degradation was estimated to be 17.6 Tg Cyr(-1), that is 13% of the entire national potential. Since the locations of degraded land were unrelated to natural environmental factors such as rainfall and soils, it is clear that the degradation has been caused by human land use, concentrated in the heavily-utilized, communal areas.

The hybrid method is based on extensive radiative transfer simulation (physical) and statistical analysis (statistical). Linear and nonlinear models were derived at 5 sensor view zenith angles (0 degrees, 15 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, and 60 degrees) to estimated LWDN using channels 27-29 and 31-34. Separate models were developed for daytime and nighttime observations. Surface pressure effect was considered by incorporating elevation in the models.

The nonlinear LWDN models explain more than 93% of variations, with standard errors less than 15.20 W/m(2). The linear and nonlinear LWDN models were applied to both Terra and Aqua TOA radiance and validated using ground data from six SURFRAD sites. The nonlinear models outperform the linear models at five sites. The averaged root mean squared errors (RMSE) of the nonlinear models are 17.60 W/m(2) (Terra) and 16.17 W/m2 (Aqua), with averaged RMSE -2.5 W/m(2) smaller than that of the linear models. LWNT was estimated using the nonlinear LWDN models and the artificial neural network (ANN) model method that predicts surface upwelling longwave radiation. LWNT was also validated using the same six SURFRAD sites. The averaged RMSEs are 17.72 (Terra) and 16.88 (Aqua) W/m(2); the averaged biases are -2.08 (Terra) and 1.99 (Aqua) W/m(2).

The Simulation results appeal-acceptable compared to observations especially for not very dense planophile vegetation. However, for erectophile dense crops (e.g. corn) the simulations appear less accurate. This inadequacy is due to the assumption that the Multiple scattered fluxes are isotropically distributed. The SAIL parameters are interpretable at the level of elementary layer components. Now, the adding method (initially proposed by Van de Hulst) provides a good framework to model the radiative transfer inside a vegetation layer, but its parameter estimation lies on very simple geometric modeling of the canopy. In this paper, we first propose an adaptation of the Adding method using the SAIL model canopy representation in the turbid case: it is called AddingS model. Such an approach allows to overcome the isotropy assumption. Second, AddingS is extended to the Discrete case: defining the AddingSDmodel. It allows to take into account the multi hot spot effect. Moreover, the AddingS and AddingSD models allow to check the energy conservation in respectively turbid and discrete cases. Finally, in order to keep reasonable time performance, a fast computation method was developed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

SeaWiFS-derived (1998-2003) data were used to monitor algal blooming patterns and anomalies in the Mediterranean basin. Yearly and monthly means of chlorophyll-like pigment concentration (chl) were computed for the 6 years available, and climatological means derived. The data set statistical variability was assessed by computing yearly and monthly chl anomalies, as the difference between each individual year/month and the corresponding climatological year/month. The space and time patterns of the chl field appear to concur with the Mediterranean general oceanographic climate, while the chl anomalies describe trends and \"hotspots\" of algal blooming. The analysis shows a general decrease of chl values in the yearly and monthly means, an increasing negative trend of chl anomalies over the basin interior, and the anticipation of the north-western spring bloom, in comparison to what seen in historical CZCS (1979-1985) data. These have been interpreted as symptoms of an increased nutrient-limitation, resulting from reduced vertical mixing due to a more stable stratification of the basin, in line with the general warming trend of the Mediterranean Sea in the last 25 years. The patterns of high chl, coupled to a positive trend of chl anomalies, recurring at near-coastal hotspots, appear to be linked to continental runoff and to a growing \"biological dynamism\" at these sites, i.e. to the intensification of noxious or harmful algal blooms, in the north-west, and of coastal fisheries, in the south-east.

One variable related to canopy height and one related to canopy density were used as independent variables in the regressions. The statistical effects of area and age class were assessed by including dummy variables in the models. Tree species composition was treated as continuous variables.

The proportion of spruce had a significant impact on both the estimated models. The proportion of broadleaves had a significant effect on above-ground biomass only, while the effect of age class was significant only in the below-ground biomass model. Because of local effects on the biomass-ALS data relationships, it is indicated by this study that sample plots distributed over the entire area would be needed when using ALS for regional or national biomass monitoring.

Suitable high resolution colour scales were applied to the SST images in order to enhance the thermal patterns and easily identify the waters with a coastal upwelling origin. The automatic identification of the areas covered by upwelling waters was developed by the authors in a previous work, through the application of fuzzy clustering and validation indexes, and here is explored as an oceanographic application to the Portuguese coastal upwelling. The fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm showed to be able to find partitions that closely defined the upwelling areas and the visualization of the fuzzy c-partitions was achieved through the application of a colour scale. The Xie-Beni validation index was used to select the c-partition that best represented the stage of the upwelling event and showed an agreement with the oceanographic interpretation in 10 of the 14 SST segmented images used in this work. Two SST images without upwelling were also used in order to check the response of the algorithm to the absence of the phenomena. The computation of the matching rate between a c-partition and the two areas split by the hand-contoured upwelling boundary also allowed the evaluation of how closely the obtained segmentation reproduced the shape of the areas covered by upwelling waters. This method successfully identified the upwelling boundary regions in 10 of the 14 SST images. The values obtained for the matching rate were higher than 0.77, thus indicating the good quality of the fuzzy partitions. The segmented images with 3 or 4 clusters were the most suitable ones to reproduce the areas covered by upwelling waters, but it was also shown that, for some cases, the upwelling areas could be reasonably well reproduced by the FCM 2-partition images. While in the latter, the area covered with upwelling waters was coincident with the first cluster, in the former, the segmented image showed two clusters within the upwelling area: the first cluster coincided with the area occupied by the most recently upwelled waters near the coast, while the second cluster was coincident with the area occupied by the \"older\" upwelling waters with its extensions offshore, the so-called cold filaments. The FCM algorithm revealed to be a promising technique in the automatic identification of upwelling areas on SST images. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The diffuse transmittance t relates the water component of the TOA radiance to that exiting the water in the same direction. As such t is a property of the ocean-atmosphere system and not just the atmosphere. Its computation requires not only the properties of the atmosphere but the angular distribution of the exiting radiance as well. The latter is not known until a determination of the water properties can be made (which is the point of measuring the radiance in the first place). Because of this, it has been customary to assume an angular distribution (uniform upward radiance beneath the water surface) in the computation of t, which is referred to as t*. However, it is known that replacing t with t* can result in an error of several percent in the retrieved water-leaving radiance. Since the error depends on sun-viewing direction, this error could be particularly important when water-leaving radiance from two or more sensors in different orbits are compared. Even given an estimate of the angular distribution of the water-leaving radiance, computation of t using full radiative transfer theory in an image processing environment is not practical. Thus, we developed a first-order correction to t for bidirectional effects in the water-leaving radiance that captures much of the variability of t with viewing direction. The correction computed across a SeaWiFS scan line shows that a t*-induced error of as much as 5-6% could occur near the edges of the scan; however, limiting the scan to polar viewing angles (0) < 60 degrees reduces the error to similar to 1%. Direct application to SeaWTFS and MODIS (AQUA) suggests that the bidirectionally-induced error in the diffuse transmittance will result in an error less than about 1% in the comparison of their normalized water-leaving radiances, as long as theta is less than about 60 degrees. We conclude that, given this constraint, the nonnalized water-leaving retrievals from these two sensors at a given location can be merged without regard for the bidirectionally-induced error in the diffuse transmittance, as the resulting uncertainty is well below that from other sources. It is important to note that this result is likely to apply to any other polar-orbiting sensor with equatorial crossing times (similar to SeaWiFS and MODIS) between 1030 and 1330 h (local time).

Focusing on mixed species forests in central south-east Queensland, this Paper outlines an approach for the generation of tree species maps at the tree crown/cluster level using 1 m spatial resolution Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI; 445.8 nm-837.7 nm wavelength) and the use of these to generate stand-level assessments of community composition. Following automated delineation of tree crowns/crown clusters, spectral reflectance from pixels representing maxima or mean-lit averages of channel reflectance or band ratios were extracted for a range of species including Acacia, Angophora, Callitris and Eucalyptus. Based on stepwise discriminant analysis, classification accuracies of dominant species were greatest (87% and 76% for training and testing datasets; n=398) when the mean-lit spectra associated with a ratio of the reflectance (rho) at 742 nm (rho(742)) and 714 nm (rho(714)) were used. The integration of 2.6 in HyMap (446.1 nm-2477.8 nm) spectra increased the accuracy of classification for some species, largely because of the inclusion of shortwave infrared wavebands. Similar increases in accuracy were achieved when classifications of field spectra resampled to CASI and HyMap wavebands were compared. The discriminant functions were applied subsequently to classify crowns within each image and produce maps of tree species distributions which were equivalent or better than those generated through aerial photograph interpretation. The research provides a new approach to tree species mapping, although some a priori knowledge of the occurrence of broad species groups is required. The tree maps have application to biodiversity assessment in Australian forests.

However, it is still difficult to observe and measure canopy gaps extensively in both space and time using field measurements or bi-dimensional remote sensing images, particularly in open and patchy boreal forests. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using small footprint lidar to map boreal canopy gaps of sizes ranging from a few square meters to several hectares. Two co-registered canopy height models (CHMs) of optimal resolution were created from lidar datasets acquired respectively in 1998 and 2003. Canopy gaps were automatically delineated using an object-based technique with an accuracy of 96%. Further, combinatorics was applied on the two CHMs and the delineated gaps to provide information on the area of old and new gaps, gap expansions, new random gap openings, gap closure due to lateral growth of adjacent vegetation or due to vertical growth of regeneration. The results obtained establish lidar as an excellent tool for rapidly acquiring detailed and spatially extensive short-term dynamics of canopy gaps. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The objective was to evaluate the level of uncertainty in lidar-based growth estimates through time so that the optimal repeat interval necessary for statistically meaningful growth measurements could be evaluated. Four airborne lidar datasets displaying similar survey configuration parameters were collected between 2000 and 2005. Coincident with the 2002 and 2005 acquisitions, field mensuration for 126 trees within 19 plots was carried out. Field measurements of stem height were compared to both coincident plot-level laser pulse return (LPR) height percentile metrics and stand level raster canopy height models (CHM).   The average plot-level field heights were found to be 23.8 in (standard deviation (sigma) = 0.4 in) for 2002 and 25.0 in (sigma = 0.6 in) for 2005, with an approximate annual growth rate of 0.4 m/yr (sigma=0.5 in). The standard deviation uncertainty for field height growth estimates over the three year period was 4 1 % at the plot-level (it = 19) and 92% at the individual tree level (it = 126). Of the lidar height percentile metrics tested, the 90th (L90), 95th (L95) and maximum (Lmax) LPR distribution heights demonstrated the highest overall correlations with field-measured tree height. While all lidar-based methods, including raster CHM comparison, tended to underestimate the field estimate of growth, Lmax provided the most robust overall direct estimate (0.32 m/yr, sigma=0.37 in). A single factor analysis of variance demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference between all plot-level field and Lmax mean growth rate estimates (P=0.38) and, further, that there was no difference in Lmax growth rate estimates across the examined time intervals (P=0.59). A power function relationship between time interval and the standard deviation of error in growth estimate demonstrated that over a one-year period, the growth uncertainty was in the range of 0.3 in (similar to 100% of total growth) reducing to less than 0.1 in (similar to 6% of total growth) after 5 years. Assuming a 10% uncertainty is acceptable for operational or research-based conifer plantation growth estimates, this can be achieved at a three-year time interval. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

A Bayesian network is a unified knowledge-inferring process that can incorporate information derived from multiple sources including remote sensing and information derived from a priori knowledge. Using this inversion approach, content of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b (Cab) and leaf area index (LAI) of winter wheat were estimated from data derived from simulations as well as field measurements. Estimations from the simulated data proved accurate, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.54 m(2)/m(2) in LAI and 4.5 mu g/cm(2) in Cab. In validating the estimates against field measurements, it was found that prior knowledge of target parameters improved the accuracy of estimates, in terms of RMSEs from 0.73 to 0.22 m(2)/m(2) in LAI and 9.6 to 4.0 mu g/cm(2) in Cab. Bayesian inference in this hybrid inversion scheme produces a posterior probability distribution, which can reveal such properties of the inferred results as updated information contained in the inversion result. Using entropy, the revision of posterior information about the parameters of interest was calculated. Including more data may allow more information to be retrieved about parameters in general. Exceptions were also observed where data from some viewing angles slightly reduced the information on the parameters of interest. It was also found that data from these viewing angles were less sensitive to the parameters. The method proposed here was also validated using LandSat ETM+ imagery provided by the BigFoot project. When used for mapping LAI with ETM+ imagery, the proposed method with an RMSE of 0.70 and a correlation of 0.67 produced a slightly better result than that from empirical regression.

The burnt area (BA) was calculated from the number of active fires, known as fire hot spots (FHS) using parameters estimated from a survey of firms in the agricultural area of south-westem Australia. The study also served as a ground validation of the capability and limitations of the MODIS sensor and associated algorithm for detection of small agricultural fires.   During the period from I March to 23 May 2005, 3240 unique FHS associated with stubble burning were detected. The majority of these FHS occurred in the afternoon in the last 3 weeks of April. To estimate the total area of stubble burning associated with these FHS, a survey was sent to 2066 farmers. This survey determined for each farm, the number of fields in which stubble was burnt, average size of field burnt (A), crop types burnt, dates and time of day of burning. Responses were received from 273 firms, 38% of whom reported over 500 stubble bums. The 3240 FHS were intersected with the polygons of the farm boundaries to determine the proportion (P) of stubble bums detected using MODIS. Only 13% (+/- 3%) of the stubble bums recorded in the farm survey were detected. Average field size burnt was 75 ha ( 6 ha). Total BA was calculated as: BA=A * 3240/P, which gave an estimated area of 1.87 million ha. This area was 27% of the total cropped area in south-westem Australia. This level of stubble burning was similar to that determined by a 1990s survey in the State of Victoria.   Neither cloud cover nor field size was significantly correlated with the low number of stubble fires that were detected. Therefore it was concluded that many stubble bums went undetected because of the lack of coincidence between the time of the MODIS overpass and when stubble bums were initiated. Also the use of additional sensors such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on NOAA satellites with afternoon overpasses would improve the fraction of stubble bums detected.   Across the whole of Australia where winter cropping occurs, there was a high correlation (r(2) = 0.96) between FHS and total cropped area in each State. This provided the basis for extrapolating the field results from south-western Australia, to estimate the total area of stubble burning in southern Australia for 2005. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

First, the sensor specific products are compared with field observations collected by a sun-photometer installed on the Acqua Alta Oceanographic Tower in the northern Adriatic Sea. Mean absolute percentage differences are approximately 21% at 412 and 443 nm, and increase with wavelength, with large overestimates in the red and near-infrared bands. The mean absolute differences are typically 0.04. When inter-compared, the 2 satellite products agree well, with mean absolute percentage differences lower than 20% at all wavelengths and little bias. The results of the comparison of the merger outputs with the field data are well in line with the validation results of the sensor specific products, and are comparable for the various merging procedures.

The Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) model has been used widely in image segmentation, but it is assumed that each pixel has a particular class label belonging to a prescribed finite set. The inixed pixel problem can be addressed by modeling the fuzzy inernbership process as a continuous Multivariate Gaussian Markov Random Field. Techniques for estimating the class membership and model parameters are discussed. Experimental results obtained by applying this technique to two Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) images show that the proposed methodology is robust with regard to noise and variation in fire characteristics as well as background. The segmentation results of our algorithm are compared with the results of a K-means algorithm, an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm (which is very similar to the Fuzzy C-Means Clustering algorithm with entropy regularization), and an MRE-MAP algorithm. Our fuzzy algorithm achieves more consistent segmentation results than the comparison algorithms for these test images with the added advantage of simultaneously providing a proportion or error map needed for the data assimilation problem.

We tested the applicability of Hyperion hyperspectral satellite imagery for mapping Phragmites in wetlands of the west coast of Green Bay in Wisconsin, U.S.A. A reference spectrum created using Hyperion data from several pure Phragmites stands within the image was used with a Spectral Correlation Mapper (SCM) algorithm to create a raster map with values ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 represented the greatest similarity between the reference spectrum and the image spectrum and I the least similarity. The final two-class thematic classification predicted monodominant Phragmites covering 3.4% of the study area. Most of this was concentrated in long linear features parallel to the Green Bay shoreline, particularly in areas that had been under water only six years earlier when lake levels were 66 cm higher. An error matrix using spring 2005 field validation points (n = 129) showed good overall accuracy - 81.4%. The small size and linear arrangement of Phragmites stands was less than optimal relative to the sensor resolution, and Hyperion\'s 30 in resolution captured few if any pure pixels. Contemporary Phragmites maps prepared with Hyperion imagery would provide wetland managers with a tool that they currently lack, which could aid attempts to stem the spread of this invasive species.

Two airborne campaigns were conducted with the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) over olive and peach orchards located in Cordoba, southern Spain. The AHS sensor was flown at three different times on 25 July 2004 and 16 July 2005, collecting 2 in spatial resolution imagery in 80 spectral bands in the 0.43-12.5 mu m spectral range. Thermal bands were assessed for the retrieval of land surface temperature using the split-window algorithm and TES (Temperature-Emissivity-Separation) method, separating pure crowns from shadows and sunlit soil pixels using the reflectance bands. Stem water potential and stomatal conductance were measured on selected trees at the time of airborne flights over the orchards. Tree fruit yield and quality parameters such as oil, weight and water content (for the olive trees), and fruit volume and weight (for the peach trees) were obtained at harvest and through laboratory analysis. Relationships between airborne-estimated crown temperature minus air temperature and stem water potential yielded r(2) = 0.5 (12:30 GMT) at the olive tree level, and r(2) = 0.81 (9:00 GMT) at the treatment level in peach trees. These results demonstrate that water stress can be detected at the crown level even under the usual water management conditions of commercial orchards. Regressions of yield and fruit quality against remote sensing estimates of crown temperature as an indicator of water stress, yielded r(2) = 0.95 (olive fruit water content) and r(2) = 0.94 (peach fruit mean diameter). These results suggest that high-spatial remote sensing thermal imagery has potential as an indicator of some fruit quality parameters for crop field segmentation and irrigation management purposes. A simulation study using ASTER spectral bands and aggregated pixels for stress detection as a function of irrigation level was conducted in order to study the applicability of medium resolution thermal sensors for the global monitoring of open-canopy tree crops. The determination coefficients obtained between the ASTER-simulated canopy temperature minus air temperature and stem water potential yielded r(2)=0.58 (12:30 GMT) for olive trees, suggesting the potential for extrapolating these methods to ASTER satellite for global monitoring of open tree canopies.

Climate influences the timing of lake ice melt and freeze onset, ice duration, and lake thermal dynamics that feedback to the climate system initiating further change. Phenology records acquired in a consistent manner and over long time periods are required to better understand variability and change in climate conditions and how changes impact lake processes. In this study, we present a new technique for extracting lake ice phenology events from historical satellite records acquired by the series of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors. The technique was used to extend existing in-situ measurements for 36 Canadian lakes and to develop records for 6 lakes in Canada\'s far north. Comparison of phenology events obtained from the AVHRR record and in-situ measurements show strong agreement (20 lakes, 180 cases) suggesting, with high confidence especially in the case of break-up dates, the use of these data as a complement to ground observations. Trend analysis performed using the combined in-situ and AVHRR record similar to 1950-2004 shows earlier break-up (average - 0.18 days/year) and later freeze-up (average 0.12 days/year) for the majority of lakes analyzed. Less confidence is given to freeze-up date results due to lower sun elevation during this period making extraction more difficult. Trends for the 20 year record in the far north showed earlier break-up (average 0.99 days/year) and later freeze-up (average 0.76 days/year). The established lake ice phenology database from the historical AVHRR image archive for the period from 1985 to 2004 will to a certain degree fill data gaps in the Canadian in-situ observation network. Furthermore, the presented extraction procedure is not sensor specific and will enable continual data update using all available satellite data provided from sensors such as NOAA/AVHRR, MetOp/AVHRR, MODIS, MERIS and SPOT/VGT.

Surface temperature variations caused by changes in albedo were corrected with visible and near-infrared ASTER bands, and a 10-meter-smoothed Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was used to correct for topographic slope effects. Field measurements of ground surface temperatures made over 24-hour periods were used to design a thermal inertia correction incorporating day and night thermal infrared images.   In the resulting processed image, background temperature variations were reduced 30-50% without reducing the intensity of geothermal anomalies, thus making it easier to distinguish geothermal activity from \'false\' anomalies caused by non-thermal springs, topographic effects, and variable rock, soil, and vegetation compositions.

The Arabian Sea experiences a large Q loss (150-200 W/m(2)) during the summer and winter monsoons, which is nearly 1.3 times of that in the Bay of Bengal. The southeasterlies are strengthened during the southern hemisphere winter. Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis captures different phases of monsoon-induced variability in wind stress and Q, ranging from seasonal to high-frequency perturbations. Coherency between time coefficients of EOF-1 for wind stress and Q suggests that former leads the latter with a temporal lag of 20-40 days for period > 322 days. At high frequencies (< 21 days) Q leads wind stress with a temporal lag of 2 days. Possible explanation for wind stress leading Q over an annual time scale is offered based on the marine atmospheric boundary layer physics and pre-conditioned ocean surface, while on shorter time scales (21 days) ocean thermodynamics through mixed layer processes cause Q to lead wind stress.

Based on a fortualized framework, i.e., the so-called Beer-Lambert law, gap fraction derived from small-footprint airborne laser scanner data was regressed against field-measured LAI. LAI was strongly (R-2 =0.87-0.93), positively, and linearly related to the log-transformed inverse of the gap fraction derived from the laser scanner data. This was as expected according to the Beer-Lambert law, as was the absence of an intercept, producing a directly proportionality of the two variables. We estimated an extinction coefficient for the first return echoes to be 0.7, fortunately fairly stable across age classes, and this is likely to be a parameter specific for the applied laser scanner system under the given flight and system settings, such as flying altitude and laser pulse repetition frequency. It was demonstrated that airborne laser was able to detect defoliation in terms of estimated changes in LAI, by three repeated laser data acquisitions over the area where severe insect attacks were going on in between the acquisitions.

Estimation of vegetation fraction from Landsat ETM+ and Quickbird allows for operational monitoring and reconnaissance at moderate resolution with calibration and vicarious validation at higher resolution. Establishing a linear correspondence between ETM-derived vegetation fraction and Quickbird-derived vegetation fraction facilitates the validation task by extending the spatial scale from 30 x 30 m to a more manageable 2.8 x 2.8 in. A comparative analysis indicates that urban reflectance can be accurately represented with a three component linear mixture model for both Landsat ETM+ and Quickbird imagery in the New York metro area. The strong linearity of the Substrate Vegetation Dark surface (SVD) mixture model provides consistent estimates of illuminated vegetation fraction that can be used to constrain physical process models that require biophysical inputs related to vegetation abundance. When Quickbird-derived 2.8 m estimates of vegetation fraction are integrated to 30 in scales and coregistered to Landsat-derived 30 in estimates, median estimates agree with the integrated fractions to within 5% for fractions > 0.2. The resulting Quickbird-ETM+ scatter distribution cannot be explained with estimate error alone but is consistent with a 3% to 6% estimation error combined with a 17 m subpixel registration ambiguity. The 3D endmember fraction space obtained from ETM+ imagery forms a ternary distribution of reflectance properties corresponding to distinct biophysical surface types. The SVD model is a reflectance analog to Ridd\'s V-I-S land cover model but acknowledges the fact that permeable and impermeable surfaces cannot generally be distinguished on the basis of broadband reflectance alone. We therefore propose that vegetation fraction be used as a proxy for permeable surface distribution to avoid the common erroneous assumption that all nonvegetated surfaces along the gray axis are completely impermeable. Comparison of mean vegetation fractions to street tree counts in New York City shows a consistent relationship between minimum fraction and tree count. However, moderate and high resolution areal estimates of vegetation fraction provide complementary information because they image all illuminated vegetation, including that not counted by the in situ street tree inventory.

The reproducibility of the method was found to have an average root-mean-squared error of approximately 30 mW m(-2) nm(-1) over the region 400-1000 nm when applied to spectra covering a range of clear-sky conditions typical of mid-latitude temperate regions. This was approximately twice as precise as the sequential method, even when the interval between target and reference panel measurements was very short (median interval 23 s). The method provides an alternative to linear interpolation between successive reference panel measurements and is particularly appropriate for conditions when irradiance is varying in a non-systematic way, for example, during the passage of sub-visual clouds.

The INFORM model was inverted with hyperspectral airborne HyMap data using a neural network approach. INFORM based estimates of forest structural variables were produced using site-specific ranges of stand structural variables. A relatively simple three layer feed-forward backpropagation neural network with two input neurons, one neuron in the hidden layer and three output neurons was employed to map leaf area index (LAI), crown coverage and stem density.   To identify the optimum 2-band spectral subset to be used in the inversion process, all 2-band combinations of the HyMap dataset were systematically evaluated for model inversion. Field measurements of structural variables from 39 forest stands were used to validate the maps produced from HyMap imagery. Using two HyMap wavebands at 837 nm and 1148 nm the obtained accuracy of the LAI map amounts to an rinse of 0.58 (relative rinse = 18% of mean, R-2 = 0.73). With HyMap data resampled to Landsat TM spectral bands and using two \"optimum\" bands at 840 nm and 1650 nm, rinse was 0.66 and relative rinse 21%. In contrast to approaches based on empirical relations between spectral vegetation indices and structural variables, the main advantage of the inversion approach is that it does not require previous calibration.

This method provided the most accurate classifications for agriculture, wetlands, grasslands, thicket and open forest. The overall classification accuracy reached 90%. The multitemporal NDVI provided a more accurate classification for the dense forest cover class. The selection of the right image dates proved to be critical for all the cases evaluated. The flexibility of these alternatives makes them promising options for rapid and inexpensive land cover mapping it) regions of high environmental variability such as tropical developing countries.

The models used were trained and tested independently using high-resolution, true-color orthoimagery with 0.3 in spatial resolution. Simple NDVI-based methods performed well for estimating f(c) regionally but overestimated f(c) in sparsely vegetated areas with bright soils, and areas with abundant non-photosynthetic vegetation (e.g. dry shrubs). Three-, four-, and five-endmember spectral mixture models (SMA3, SMA4, and SMA5) were also compared. Constrained versions of these models all produced similar accuracy regionally, but constrained and unconstrained versions of the SMA5 model best captured f(c) for the rarer landscapes (bright soils, riparian vegetation) found throughout the region. This indicates that heterogeneous landscapes can be stratified into relatively homogeneous strata, and three or four endmembers may be adequate to characterize the spectral variability within each stratum. Including NDVI along with the six reflective bands of ETM+ data, provided enough data dimensionality to support the five-endmember SMA model. This permitted a more complete representation of the range of spectral landscape types that are germane for separating out green vegetation in this semi-arid region. We also note that green woody vegetation and green grass cover should be spectrally represented by two different endmembers in SMA because these two vegetation types are spectrally different, particularly in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength.

A merged data set of Topex/Poseidon (T/P) and ERS-2 altimeter data for an 8-year period, beginning in June 1995, has been used and corrected sea surface heights were computed by applying a homogeneous set of relevant geophysical corrections. ERS-2 data were crossover adjusted to T/P. Monthly maps of sea level anomalies were created for the whole period and were used in the computation of monthly maps of absolute dynamic topography, geostrophic currents and eddy kinetic energy (EKE). The seasonal signal of the northeast Tropical Atlantic large-scale surface circulation appears as the prevailing cause of the variability in the region, particularly in the southernmost portion of the region being studied. This signal is also present in the flow field along the African coast and in the Guinea Dome. Regions of highest EKE values are clearly associated with the North Equatorial Counter-Current and with the currents along the African coast. The significant interannual variability found for 1998 seems to be associated with the 1997-1998 ENSO Pacific event, but other anomalous periods (1996-1997 and 2001-2002) uncorrelated with ENSO are also evident.

The laser ranging measurements and video from approximately one-half of that data set (1304 km) were analyzed to identify and locate forested sites that might potentially support populations of Delmarva fox squirrel (DFS, Sciurus niger cinereus). The DFS is an endangered species previously endemic to tall, dense, mature forests with open understories on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay. The airborne LiDAR employed in this study can measure forest canopy height and canopy closure, but cannot measure or infer understory canopy conditions. This airborne LiDAR profiler, then, must be viewed as a tool that identifies and locates potential, not actual, habitat. Fifty-three potentially suitable DFS sites were identified in the 1304 km of flight transect data. Each of the 53 sites met the following criteria according to the LiDAR and video record: (1) at least 120 in of contiguous forest;, (2) an average canopy height > 20 m; (3) an average canopy closure of > 80%; and (4) no roofs, impervious surface (e.g., asphalt, concrete), and/or open water anywhere along the 120 m length of the laser segment. Thirty-two of the 53 sites were visited on the ground and measurements taken for a DFS habitat suitability model. Seventy-eight percent of the sites (25 of 32) were judged by the model to be suited to supporting a DFS population. All of the LiDAR flight data, 2539 km, were analyzed to estimate county and statewide forest area in different height/canopy closure classes. Approximately 3.3% of Delaware (17,137 ha) supports forest over 20 in tall with crown closures exceeding 80%; the corresponding county percentages are Newcastle County-6.1% (6823 ha), Kent County-2.2% (3431 ha), and Sussex County-2.7% (6883 ha). Estimates of average within-patch crossing distance and average between-patch distances are reported, by county, and for the state. Study results indicate that: 1) systematic airborne LiDAR data can be used to screen extensive areas to locate potential DFS habitat; 2) 78% of sites meeting certain minimum length, height, and canopy closure criteria will support DFS populations, according to a habitat suitability model; 3) airborne LiDAR can be used to calculate county and state acreage estimates of potential habitat, and 4) the linear transect data can be used to calculate patch statistics. The authors suggest that the systematic county and state flight lines can be revisited at intervals to monitor changes to the areal extent of potential habitat over time. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Past studies have shown that WSC is particularly well suited for monitoring Sahelian pastoral regions consisting of large homogeneous herbaceous steppes (Jarlan et al., 2002a,b). On the other hand, Sahelian agro-pastoral areas are more heterogeneous in terms of WSC spatial cell resolution owing to different land use caused by anthropic pressure. The objective of this paper is to assess the suitability of WSC data in such a heterogeneous landscape. To this end, WSC data for an agro-pastoral area are compared with results presented in Jarlan et al., 2002b, which focused on 4 pastoral sites, located in Mali. The agro-pastoral area concerned is in the Fakara region (Niger), for which numerous in situ measurements are available for the 1994-2000 period over a 500 kin 2 area. WSC temporal signatures acquired at a 45 degrees incidence angle, sigma(0)(45 degrees), show the typical behaviour observed over the Sahelian areas. sigma(0)(45 degrees) values are higher than those observed by Jarlan et al. (2002b) over Northern Sahelian sites, especially during the dry season, and exhibit a lower yearly amplitude variability. The effect of land use heterogeneity on the radar signal is investigated by comparing WSC profiles acquired at a 21 degrees incidence angle, sigma(0)(21 degrees), with ERS SAR data during the year 1995. The observations are interpreted by combining a radiative transfer model and a vegetation growth model in a similar approach to the one developed by Frison et al., 1998 and Jarlan et al., 2002a, 2002b, 2003. The results indicate that at an incidence angle of 21 degrees, soil contribution is largely predominant, representing 90% of the radar signal, thus explaining the similar behaviour of radar signatures observed despite different land uses. At a 45 degrees incidence angle, even though annual vegetation and bare soil are the two main factors influencing the temporal evolution of the radar signal, the bare soil contribution is still the most significant. It is shown that over the present study site, characterised by low annual vegetation fraction cover and high sigma(0)(45 degrees) values during the dry season, vegetation makes no significant contribution to the yearly amplitude of the radar signal, sigma(0)(adr)(45 degrees). The latter can be explained by the bare soil contribution alone. Consequently, limited soil moisture due to small field capacity accounts for the small sigma(0)(adr)(45 degrees) variability observed. An inversion method to retrieve the volumetric soil moisture content, H-v, using sigma(0)(45 degrees) data is then developed. It appears that vegetation has a negligible influence over estimated Hv. As a result, the soil moisture content can be retrieved from WSC data alone, by representing the present scene as being composed of bare soil only. These results differ from those obtained over pastoral Sahelian sites, where both vegetation and soil moisture play significant roles in radar response. Moreover, the comparison between WSC sigma(0)(45 degrees) retrieved soil moisture with existing soil moisture derived from passive microwave radiometer SSM/I measurements shows a fairly good overall match.

These factors included the distance from roads, rivers, research facilities, oil facilities, markets and towns. and land ownership by colonists, native inhabitants, and an oil company. We found the annual rate of deforestation is currently only 0.11%, but that this rate is increasing with time and, assuming that the trend of increasing rate of forest loss continues, we would predict that by 2063, 50% of the forest within 2 kill of an oil access road will be lost to unhindered colonization and anthropogenic conversion. The Quechua colonists are associated with areas of the highest rate of deforestation, followed by the native Huaorani and the lowest region of deforestation was in areas Occupied by a local oil company. By far, the strongest predictor of where deforestation is predicted to occur was proximity to the road. Proximity to research sites, oil facilities, market, and rivers significantly decreases deforestation rates, and proximity to towns significantly increases deforestation rates. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Idaho has established populations in the north and southeastern regions which are spreading into new sites. This study demonstrates the ability of high resolution hyperspectral imagery to provide high quality data and consistent methods to locate small and low percent canopy cover occurrences of leafy spurge. Locating leafy spurge in its early stages of invasion is critical for land managers in order to prioritize treatment, conservation, and restoration activities. Hyperspectral data were collected in 2002 and 2003 for the study area in southeastern Idaho. The imagery was classified with the Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF) algorithm. Although classifications from single date images provided discrimination of leafy spurge at approximately 10% cover in one 3.5 m pixel, for repeatability and consistency purposes, the threshold for leafy spurge discrimination is approximately 40% cover. We hypothesize that georegistration errors, small differences in leafy spurge reflectance, training endmember selection, and image processing and field validation biases between years influence multi-date detection limits. Although hyperspectral imagery is costly, in some situations, the advantages of having reliable and repeatable mapping abilities for discrimination of economically damaging invasive species such as leafy spurge outweigh the image and processing costs.

In order to estimate the relationship between these parameters over the continental shelf of the northern Bay of Biscay, a set of in situ data has been gathered for the period 1998-2003 when SeaWiFS imagery is available. These data comprise surface measurements of the concentrations of total SPM, chlorophyll, and irradiance profiles from which is derived the attenuation coefficient of the photosynthetically available radiation, K-PAR. The performance of the IFREMER look-up table used to retrieve the chlorophyll concentration from the SeaWiFS radiance is evaluated on this new set of data. The quality of the estimated chlorophyll concentration is assessed from a comparison of the variograms of the in situ and satellite-derived chlorophyll concentrations. Once the chlorophyll concentration is determined, the non living SPM, which is defined as the SPM not related to the dead or alive endogenous phytoplankton, is estimated from the radiance at 555 nm by inverting a semi-analytic model. This method provides realistic estimations of concentrations of chlorophyll and SPM over the continental shelf all over the year. Finally, a relationship, based on non living SPM and chlorophyll, is proposed to estimate K-PAR on the continental shelf of the Bay of Biscay. The same formula is applied to non living SPM and chlorophyll concentrations, observed in situ or derived from SeaWiFS radiance. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The composite criterions that provide the most accurate images for burned land mapping were based on maximizing brightness/surface temperatures, either as the only criterion or in conjunction with minimizing sensor zenith angle or near infrared (NIR) reflectance. These composites present high discrimination capacity between burned and unburned areas, remove most clouds and cloud shadows, offer high spatial coherency and present middle-to-low sensor zenith angles. Traditional compositing criterion based on maximizing NDVI values provided poor results in most tests. Finally, standard NASA MODIS composite provides close to nadir observation angles, and good spatial coherency, but it offered lower discrimination between burned and unburned areas that those composites based on thermal data.

A reasonably strong relationship was observed between irradiance reflectance at 665 rim (R-665) and mineral suspended sediment (MSS) concentrations. Variability in the Reflectance-MSS relationship was found to be the consequence of changes in the mass-specific scattering coefficient (b(MSS)(*)) brought about by differences in particle properties such as grain size and composition. A systematic increase in the slope of the Reflectance-MSS relationship was observed with increasing b(MSS)(*). A reflectance model is presented that highlights the dependence of reflectance on b(MSS)(*) and suggests that the errors in predicted MSS concentrations can be reduced from 56% to as little as 12% with prior knowledge of the scattering properties of the sediments under study. This paper highlights the need for a complete understanding of the scattering properties of particles in order to accurately estimate MSS concentrations from reflectance measurements. It is suggested that in order to obtain quantitative estimates of MSS in moderately turbid waters from space, it may be necessary to pre-determine scattering efficiencies, b(MSS)(*), for the area of interest.

The use of remote sensing for mapping desert vegetation is made difficult by the mixing of reflectance spectra of bright desert soils with the relatively weak spectral response of sparse vegetation. To investigate ways to improve desert vegetation mapping, a comparison of the effect of supervised classification using two contrasting measures of field vegetation data as reference data was performed. We took cover- and density-based field vegetation data that had been collected by the US Army on the US Yuma Proving Ground (USYPG) in southwest Arizona, converted them into cover- and density-based reference classification schemes and used them to train both maximum likelihood (ML) and artificial neural net (ANN) classifiers. The impact on the accuracy of cover- and density-based vegetation maps were further analyzed using different combinations of input data (i.e., Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery, ERS-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, and elevation data). In spite of the fact that a cover-based plot classification is the logical training data for remote sensing classification, both cover- and density-based classified maps had similar accuracies for each data combination. The use of all data combinations gave the highest map classification accuracies, with the radar data improving the accuracy the most where the vegetation is dense. Classification accuracies of maps using the ML classifier were generally higher than those using the ANN classifier. ANN map classification accuracies improved significantly when the sigmoid transfer function was replaced with the hyperbolic tangent transfer function. Using the two contrasting measures for mapping proved complementary: the coverbased map located areas of significant tree presence that were not mapped on the density-based map and the density-based map located areas of significant cacti presence that were not mapped on the cover-based map. Creating both cover- and density-based vegetation maps may therefore better assist and land management than creating only a cover-based vegetation map. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

These factors have hampered earlier estimates of the areas and volumes of three young lava flows at Westdahl Volcano, including its most recent (1991-1992) flow. We combined information from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images with multispectral Landsat-7 data to differentiate the 1991 - 1992 flow from the 1964 flow and a pre- 1964 flow, and to calculate the flow areas (8.4, 9.2, and 7.3 km(2), respectively). By differencing a digital elevation model (DEM) from the 1970-1980s with a DEM from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) in February 2000, we estimated the average thickness of the 1991-1992 flow to be 13 in, which reasonably agrees with field observations (5-10 m). Lava-flow maps produced in this way can be used to facilitate field mapping and flow-hazards assessment, and to study magma-supply dynamics and thus to anticipate future eruptive activity. Based on the recurrence interval of recent eruptions and the results of this study, the next eruption at Westdahl may occur before the end of this decade. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The relatively short K-u-band wavelength (2.14 cm) of the space-borne NASA scatterometer (NSCAT) is sensitive to changes in dielectric properties, associated with large-scale changes in the relative abundance and phase (frozen or thawed) of canopy and surface water. We used a temporal change detection analysis of NSCAT daily radar backscatter measurements to characterize the 1997 seasonal spring thaw transition period across the 10(6) km(2) BOREAS study region of central Canada. In the spring, air temperature transitions from frozen to non-frozen conditions and surface observations of seasonal snow cover depletion were generally coincident with decreases in radar backscatter of more than 2.9 dB, regardless of regional landcover characteristics. We used a temporal classification of NSCAT daily differences from 5-day smoothed backscatter values to derive three simple indices describing the initiation, primary event and completion of the spring thaw transition period. Several factors had a negative impact on the relative accuracy of NSCAT-based results, including periodic gaps in NSCAT daily time-series information and a large (i.e., >2 cm day(-1)) spring rainfall event. However, these results were generally successful in capturing the seasonal transition of the region from frozen to non-frozen conditions, based on comparisons with regional weather station network information. These results illustrate the potential for improved assessment of springtime phenology and associated ecosystem dynamics across high latitude regions, where field based and optical remote-sensing methods are substantially degraded by frequent cloud cover, low solar illumination and sparse surface weather station networks.

Based on the linear expression y=mx+b, they-intercepts (b), slopes (m), and x-intercepts ( - b/m or nitrate depletion temperature, NDT) of four seasonal (January-March, April-June, July-September, and October-December) temperature-nitrate relationships, obtained from the combined multiyear data set, were statistically different from each other and varied around overall multiyear values of b = 72.73 muM, m = - 5.33 muM degreesC(-1), and NDT = 13.65degreesC. Three interannual temperature-nitrate relationships from February to April 1970, 197 1, and 1972 also had y-intercepts, slopes, and x-intercepts that were statistically different from each other. Nevertheless, limited variability in direct comparisons among seasonal or interannual regression lines and a 1 degreesC La Jolla NDT range compared to a 25 degreesC global NDT range supported the general utility of NDT-based comparisons. A nitrate-normalized temperature axis (T - NDT) was created for the La Jolla data set by subtracting NDT from the recorded water column temperatures (T). Chlorophyll a reached a maximum between 0 and 2 degreesC on this T-NDT axis that ranged from - 4 to 10 degreesC. Microscope-based determinations of La Jolla centric diatom, permate diatom and dinoflagellate abundances, and La Jolla chlorophyll a, partitioned in proportion to the numerical abundance of the three groups, both peaked in logical progression along the T-NDT axis. In a separate analysis of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) data from three Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) cruises (50degreesN to 52degreesS), chlorophyll a peaked below 0 degreesC and three different phytoplankton classes, nanoflagellates, large eukaryotes and prokaryotes, distributed in logical progression along a sea surface temperature (SST) minus NDT axis. To further generalize these results, a previously reported 1degrees latitude x 1degrees longitude grid of NDTs for the world ocean was applied to satellite-derived grids of SST for March 1999 through June 2000. The SST - NDT calculation provided a standard nitrate-normalized axis simultaneously applicable to all locations in the world ocean. Sixteen plots of satellite-derived chlorophyll a versus SST - NDT for March 1999 through June 2000 demonstrated the opposing seasonal movements of northern and southern hemisphere chlorophyll a along the SST-NDT axis. Based on the phytoplankton community patterns along the temperature minus NDT in the La Jolla and AMT data sets, this chlorophyll a movement along the SST-NDT axis can be associated with phytoplankton community changes related to location around SST - NDT = 0 degreesC. The SST - NDT index appears to provide a useful tool for interpreting the character of the phytoplankton community structure contributing to satellite-derived chlorophyll a in the world ocean.

Plants were exposed sequentially to 150, 300, and 650 mumol m(-2) s(-1) PAR from metal halide lamps, followed by a fourth light treatment of 650 mumol m(-2) s(-1) PAR from a mixture of metal halide and tungsten-halogen lamps. The tungsten-halogen lamps added significant amounts of near-infrared (NIR) irradiation to the background light environment provided by the metal halide lamps. Results indicated that both bean and wheat canopies generally exhibited stable blue, green, red, and far-red fluorescence emissions when plants were exposed to 150, 300, and 650 mumol m(-2) s(-1) PAR from the metal halide lamps. In contrast, when bean and wheat plants were exposed to the NIR-enriched light supplied by the tungsten-halogen lamps, blue and green fluorescence remained stable, but red and far-red fluorescence increased dramatically immediately after exposure to the NIR photons. However, the increased levels of red and far-red fluorescence observed after exposure to NIR light decreased quickly (within 55 s) and returned to \"baseline\" levels observed at the start of the rapidly changing light experiments. Results indicate that handheld LIFS instruments can be used for remote sensing of plant canopies under a diversity of lighting conditions including full darkness, dawn and dusk lighting environments, and under rapidly changing light environments similar to those encountered on partly cloudy days.

In this paper, the second of a two-part series, we present a method for validation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Leaf Area Index (MODIS LAI) product with emphasis on the sampling strategy for field data collection. Using a hierarchical scene model, we divided 30-m resolution LAI and NDVI images from Maun (Botswana), Harvard Forest (USA) and Ruokulahti Forest (Finland) into individual scale images of classes, region and pixel. Isolating the effects associated with different landscape scales through decomposition of semivariograms not only shows the relative contribution of different characteristic scales to the overall variation, but also displays the spatial structure of the different scales within a scene. We find that (1) patterns of variance at the class, region and pixel scale at these sites are different with respect to the dominance in order of the three levels of landscape organization within a scene; (2) the spatial structure of LAI shows similarity across the three sites, that is, ranges of semivariograms from scale of pixel, region and class are less than 1000 in. Knowledge gained from these analyses aids in formulation of sampling strategies for validation of biophysical products derived from moderate resolution sensors such as MODIS. For a homogeneous (within class) site, where the scales of class and region account for most of the spatial variation, a sampling strategy should focus more on using accurate land cover maps and selection of regions. However, for a heterogeneous (within class) site, accurate point measurements and GPS readings are needed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The case of semiarid vegetation is considered allowing for varying fractional cover, structure, and presence of standing litter, The error in estimation of vegetation properties using vegetation indices, linear spectral unmixing, and model inversion is compared over this dataset, quantified by a measure of signal to noise (S/N). For the estimation of f(APAR), the NDVI gave best S/N among vegetation indices (S/N 4.5). Linear mixture modelling based on library spectra showed considerable improvement over vegetation indices for estimation of total vegetation cover. LAI is not retrieved with much accuracy by any method in the presence of standing litter and variable fractional cover, Model inversion has potential to be the most accurate method for retrieving all parameters, but only if the model approximates reality within 15%. Overall, the S/N in estimating parameters by any method is considerably lower than the S/N in instrument calibration (20/1). Use of the dual-view showed potential to improve estimates, but requires accurate registration. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Environ. 61 (1997) 290] the compact airborne spectrographic imager (CASI) was used to map the absorption and scattering properties of a coastal environment.

The authors found large discrepancies between the parameters estimated from measurements (AC9) and from a biooptical model by Carder et al. [J. Geophys. Res. 104 (1999) 5403]. As a result, they adjusted the backscattering efficiency parameter of the model. We found, however. that the discrepancies may actually be due. at least in part, to an erroneous atmospheric correction used for the airborne data. Because the removal of the surface-reflected sky radiance was neglected, the estimated water-leaving radiance was erroneously augmented and used as the input of the bio-optical model. This caused a scattering overestimate and an absorption underestimate. It is suggested that the surface reflection, unlike for land applications, should always be removed to obtain the water signal for use with such biooptical models. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

We processed images of two reef sites in Florida and Hawaii acquired over short time intervals (2 weeks and 3 months). During these periods, reefs were not affected by major disturbances (phase shift, strategy shift, bleaching, and hurricanes). This stability allowed us to assess the bias in change detection analysis. Two methods for change detection analysis were applied. The first one estimates the atmospheric conditions (Rayleigh and aerosol radiances, ozone and diffuse transmittances) using an ETM+/SeaWiFS multisensor approach. The second method is an empirical correction based on pseudoinvariant features that compensates for different atmospheric conditions as well as for any sensor (noise) or environmental (water column, sea surface state) conditions. The atmospheric correction alone did not provide an accurate match in images across time due to significant whitecaps and possible sun glint and its products required an empirical adjustment. Therefore, for the images in this study there was not substantial benefit in performing an atmospheric correction compared to an empirical correction alone. Both methods resulted in a minimum uncertainty of 4, 3, and 3 digital counts, respectively, in ETM+ Bands 1-3. Finally, we completed the study of real images by the analysis of ETM+ reflectance spectra for a large variety of coral reef objects. We concluded that the assessment of the rates of change in three ubiquitous classes \'sand,\' \'background\' (including rubble, pavement, and heavily grazed dead coral structure), and \'foreground\' (including living corals and macroalgae) emerges as the most reproducible and feasible application for the ETM+ sensor.

Instrument specifications require an accurate absolute calibration, as well as accurate camera-to-camera, band-to-band and pixel-to-pixel relative response determinations. In order to achieve these requirements, MISR makes use of an on-board calibrator (OBC), as well as vicarious calibration (VC) experiments. The OBC makes use of two Spectralon diffuse panels in order to provide a flatfield illumination. Bi-monthly deployments of these panels into the camera fields-of-view will be made. At these times, solar-reflected radiance values are measured by photodiode detector standards. Accurate relative bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) data are required to transfer these photodiode-measured radiances into camera-incident values. An independent calibration pathway, known as VC, will also be implemented in order to reduce systematic errors and to provide a crosscheck on the OBC findings. Here, the top-of-atmosphere radiances are computed from in situ observations of surface reflectance and atmospheric transmittances, Key to these measurements is knowledge of the hemispheric/directional reflectance factor (HDRF) of the field reflectance standards. This report describes the BRF measurements of the MISR flight panels, and provides an estimation as to the differences between HDRF and BRF for the MISR view angles.

The estimates of the volumes by tree species at the plot level were derived by means of the cross-validation technique. Ten nearest neighbours (NNs) were applied in the estimation. Image segments were derived by two different methods: (1) a measurement space-guided clustering followed by the connected component labeling (ISOCCL) and (2) a directed trees algorithm (NG). The segmentations were fine-tuned by means of two different region-merging algorithms. The spectral features were extracted in two ways: from a fixed window (FW) around the field sample plot, and from those pixels within the FW that belonged to the same segment as the: sample plot pixel. Window sizes from 1 to 11 x 11 pixels were tested, and the average of the extracted pixel values was used in the estimation. Features from the ISOCCL-based segments gave the best estimates for the volumes of pine and spruce, as well as for the total volume. Best estimates for the volume of broad-leaved trees were obtained from NG-based segments. Compared to the estimates of the FW approach, the improvements were, however, quite small and relative root mean square errors (RMSEs) remained high. The minimum and maximum improvements of relative RMSEs were 1% and 11.3%. respectively. The NG was considered a more applicable segmentation method for forest inventory purposes at the stand level, even though the ISOCCL gave slightly better estimation results in this study. The use of image segmentation in the stratification of the image material into stand margin and within stand areas could be more suitable for the estimation of forest variables. This is the case especially if only the plot-level field information is available. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

The accuracy with which foliar biochemical concentration could be estimated: while high for all methodologies, was highest when using the two proposed by Kokaly and Clark. At an illustrative R-2 threshold of .85 (between estimated and observed biochemical concentration), all three methodologies could be used to estimate total chlorophyll, nitrogen, cellulose and sugar; in addition, the BNC methodology could be used to estimate chlorophyll a and b, and in addition to this, the BNA methodology could be used to estimate lignin and water. Given the advantages offered by the Kokaly and Clark methodologies lover and above the standard methodology) for a wide range of foliar biochemicals, it is recommended that their utility is investigated for the estimation of foliar biochemical concentration from field, airborne and spaceborne spectra.

NASA\'s Water Vapor Project (NVAP) produced a global 1 degrees x1 degrees tcwp data set for use as a tool to investigate, among other things, atmospheric variability. An independent cross-comparison of the NVAP tcwp product was performed using the TOPEX/POSEIDON (TIP) TOPEX microwave radiometer (TMR) data and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)-based range delay data set produced by Meteo-France (MF) and distributed with T/P data. When these T/P range delay data are converted to tcwp, they show that NVAP is biased dry and ECMWF/MF is biased wet relative to the independent TMR measurement. Although the absolute accuracy of the NVAP tcwp product is uncertain, results indicate its relative accuracy is sufficient for variability studies. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis and spectral analysis applied to this data set show that seasonal variability over the annual cycle accounts for about 20% of the variance (EOF1). An El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) signal is found in the annually demeaned data; the magnitude of the crosscorrelation between the temporal amplitude (TA) of EOF1 and the Nino 3.3 (SST) time series is .9. Comparisons also were made between the NVAP patterns of variability in tcwp and independent reanalysis and interpretation of numerical model generated atmospheric fields. In general, there is good agreement between the NVAP data and the reanalysis fields. Finally, specific recommendations are made for: (1) improvement of the NVAP data set upon reanalysis and (2) use of the NVAP data, in place of ECMWF/MF-based range delay data, for T/P retrievals when TMR data are not available if and when T/P data are reanalyzed. This latter recommendation is especially important for regions of the tropical Indo-Pacific (e.g., Indonesia) where islands can interfere with valid TMR retrievals. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

To provide corrections of these effects, for visible and near-infrared light, we derive two simple physicial models of vegetation reflectance, both of which have three parameters. The first model., WAK I. is applicable when illumination is by direct light only, and the second model, WAK II, is applicable when illumination is by both diffuse and direct light. The models were tested by fitting them to reflectance data of Virginia pine, irrigated wheat. and alfalfa. at large sun zenith angles, and then comparing predictions of reflectance at small sun zenith angles with measurements. The process was then reversed to do the fitting on the small sun zenith measurements and the prediction of the large sun zenith measurements. Using this method of assessment, the WAK models were found to perform better than several other published models. The WAK models were used to derive a formula for the variation of reflectance with terrain slope angle, which was tested by measuring reflectances of microcanopies set up on different slopes in the laboratory. The formula permits topographic correction of vegetation reflectance without needing to know the bidirectional reflectance factor. The simplicity and robustness of the WAK models make them useful for general correction and calibration of remotely sensed imagery. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Unfortunately, direct observations of cloud top height are generally not routinely made. This article develops a new hybrid method for estimating cloud top height from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data to help provide more abundant and accurate cloud top height estimates at low cost. It takes into account arbitrary viewing and illumination conditions which can affect the accuracy of both cloud shadow detection and cloud shadow-based cloud top height retrievals. Results were validated with data taken by NASA\'s ER-2 Cloud LIDAR System (CLS). The mean differences between the AVHRR-based cloud height estimates and the LIDAR observations for the two validation images analyzed are 0.45 km and 0.67 km. The sensitivity of the results to the parametrizations used by the new algorithm was also evaluated. Parameters can be chosen to minimize their effect on retrieved cloud top heights; the procedure executes quickly. Given the accuracy of the cloud top height retrievals, the method could be used routinely to provide cloud top heights for a wide variety of meteorological and hydrometeorological applications (e.g., numerical weather prediction, drought monitoring). With the improved spatial resolution (and reduced cost) of data from soon to be launched new satellite observing systems, proportionally higher accuracy and resolution for cloud top heights can be achieved economically using this method.

Spectral matching of pure library spectra was found to be an effective method of locating and identifying endmembers for mixture modeling although some problems were found with the false identification of gypsum. Mixture modeling could accurately estimate proportions for a large number of materials in synthetic imagery; however, it produced high variance estimates and high error estimates when presented with all nine AVIRIS endmembers because of high noise levels in the imagery. The problem of which endmembers to select was addressed by implementing a mixture model that allowed estimation of the errors on the proportions estimates, discarding the endmembers with the highest errors, recomputing the errors, and the proportions estimates, and iterating this process until the mixture maps were relatively free from noise. This methodology ensured that the lowest contrast materials were discarded. The inevitable confusion that followed was monitored the using the maps produced by spectral matching. Spectral matching was more effective than mixture modeling for geological mapping because it allowed identification and mapping of the relatively pure regions of all the surficial materials that exert an influence on the spectral response. The maps of the different clay minerals were of considerable value for mineral exploration purposes. Conversely, spectral matching was less useful than mixture modeling for rangeland vegetation studies because a classification of all pixels is needed and abundance estimates are required for many applications. Mixture modeling allowed identification of both nonphotosynthetic and green vegetation cover and thus total cover. Though the green vegetation mixture map appears to be very precise, the nonphotosynthetic vegetation estimates were poor.

A combination of field and modeling techniques wee used to quantify the relative contribution of leaf, stem, and litter optical properties (incorporating known variation in foliar biochemical properties) and canopy structural attributes to nadir-viewed vegetation reflectance data. Variability in tissue optical properties was wavelength-dependent. For green foliage, the lowest variation was in the visible (VIS) spectral region and the highest in the near-infrared (NIR). For standing litter material, minimum variation occurred in the VIS/NIR, while the largest differences were observed in the shortwave-IR (SWIR). Woody stem material slowed opposite trends, with lowest variation in the SWIR and highest in the NIR. Leaf area index (LAI) and leaf angle distribution (LAD) were the dominant controls on canopy reflectance data with the exception of soil reflectance and vegetation cover in sparse canopies. Leaf optical properties (and thus foliar chemistry) were expressed most directly at the canopy level in the NIR, but LAI and LAD strongly controlled the relationship between leaf and canopy spectral characteristics. Stem material played a small but significant role in determining canopy reflectance in woody plant canopies, especially those with LAI<5.0. Standing litter significantly affected the reflectance characteristics of grassland canopies; small increases in the percentage of standing litter had a disproportionately large affect on canopy determine the relative contribution of tissue, canopy, and landscape factors that drive variation in a reflectance signal. Deconvolution of these factors requires an understanding of the sources of variance at each scale (which is ecosystem dependent) as well as an adequate sampling (spectral, angular, and temporal) of the shortwave (400-2500 nm) spectrum.

The model allowed use of up to five surface components to characterize the selected area, since six bands (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7) of the Landsat TM sensor were used as inputs. Among the various methods commonly used to determine end-members from the satellite image, three were selected: a) identification of one \"pure\" pixel representing a particular surface component from false color composites; b) average of \"pure\" pixels to characterize a particular end-member; and c) a method based on principal components. The best characterization of end-members was achieved by using average pure pixel reflectance. The median of the abundance images showed that, in 95% of the cases, the individual pixel compositions were explained by the selected surface components. The research has demonstrated that regional patterns of soil surface erosion features can be reliably mapped using linear spectral mixture analysis. Extrapolation of this approach to other regions where soil degradation features are correlated with spectrally distinguishable surface characteristics is feasible, provided that an optimization of the unmixing model as a function of local or regional surface component types is completed.

In this paper, we apply Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data to the monitoring of seasonal changes in atmospheric water vapor, liquid water, and surface cover in the vicinity of the Jasper Ridge, CA, for three dates in 1992. Apparent surface reflectance was retrieved and water vapor and liquid water mapped by using a radiative-transfer-based inversion that accounts for spatially variable atmospheres. Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) was used to model reflectance data as mixtures of green vegetation (GV), nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), soil, and shade. Temporal and spatial patterns in endmember fractions and liquid water were compared to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The reflectance retrieval algorithm was tested by using a temporally invariant target. Atmospheric analysis showed a strongly negative linear between water vapor and elevation with significant seasonal variation in water vapor. Comparison of AVIRIS estimates of specific humidity to ground-based measures showed good correspondence for all three dates. Analysis of surface properties showed that GV, NDVI, and liquid water varied in response to green vegetation and were highly correlated. However, whereas the NDVI peaked between 0.7 and 0.85 in forests, liquid water continued to vary by as much as a factor of two. Seasonal patterns included senescence in herbaceous and nonconiferous vegetation, potential leaf growth in coniferous forests, and a general increase in shadows. This resulted in seasonal declines in NDVI, GV, and liquid water for nonforested vegetation and increases in NPV. Nonconiferous forests showed similar declines in liquid water and GV and increases in shade and NPV, but they showed an increase in NDVI. In coniferous forests, liquid water and NDVI increased seasonally, matching an interpretation of continued growth, but GV decreased owing to increased shade. The combination of retrieved surface reflectance, atmospheric modeling, and mapping of liquid water demonstrates the utility of imaging spectrometry for change detection. SMA with the use of reference end-members is an effective method for monitoring surficial changes. Temporal patterns in NDVI that contradict trends of GV and liquid water in nonconiferous forests raise additional questions about the NDVI. Liquid water may be more appropriate for analysis of high-leaf-area, shadowed forests because it overcomes the problem of saturation with NDVI.

The efficiency with which intercepted radiation was converted into biomass (epsilon) was reduced by approximately 35% in the nitrogen-limited canopy and approximately 30% in the water-limited canopy. The relative effect of the stress treatments on epsilon was sensitive to assumptions concerning solar geometry. The impact of stress on fPAR depended more on whether the canopy was nitrogen- and/or water-limited. In the second half of the season, nitrogen stress reduced fPAR by approximately 25%, whereas water stress reduced fPAR by about 70%. Reduction in leaf area index, 45% and 85% for the nitrogen-stressed and water-stressed canopies, respectively, appeared to be a major factor in the fPAR reductions. In the water-stressed canopy, wilting also contributed to the reduced fPAR. Neither of the stress treatments affected the strong correlation between fPAR and simple ratio (SR) or the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We used three approaches to calculate fPAR, with two based on a single sun position and one based on the sun position updated at hourly intervals.

The illuminated crown component and the illuminated ground component have the greatest impact on the reflectance values in the red and near-infrared region respectively The red BRDF, mainly influenced by the illuminated ground component, proves to be sensitive to canopy cover tree pattern distribution, and canopy gaps. The near-infrared BRDF, affected by the illumination crown component, is sensitive to canopy cover, crown-center height distribution, and crown shape. Th sensitivity of the BRDF to canopy gaps and crown clumping teas investigated in more detail. Reflectance measurements close to the hotspot are found to be insensitive to clumping while retaining sensitivity to crown cover Forward scattering measurements are found to be more sensitive to gap size and frequency. The spatial effects of plantations, logging, or road features on the BRDF is further analyzed.

In images of random noise, the local variation tends to be similar to the overall variance. In contrast, scenes in which large features can be discerned have clusters of pixels with similar values, which cause the local variation to be much smaller on average than the overall scene variance. A comparison of the autocorrelation of images formed by the ratios of two spectral bands is an excellent way to determine which combinations provide the best spectral representation of objects greater in size than the spatial resolution of the sensor. This is because an image formed from the ratios of two nonredundant bands will enhance spectral objects and thus tend to have greater spatial autocorrelation than the ratio of two bands that are very similar. Ratios are a particularly effective method of combining images because this operation tends to reduce the effect of illumination differences and to enhance spectral features.   Feature selection is the process of finding a subset of the original bands that provides an optimal trade-off between probability of error and classification cost (Swain and Davis, 1978). Three feature selection problems are addressed in this paper: (1) narrow band feature selection, which is the selection of a subset of individual bands; (2) broad band feature selection, in which groups of adjacent bands are selected, and (3) nonadjacent multiple band feature selection, in which selection of the groups of bands is not limited to adjacent bands. Spatial autocorrelation is useful in all three feature selection problems. Narrow band feature selection is carried out by ranking the spatial autocorrelation of all possible combination of ratioed bands. Broad band feature selection can be carried out by iteratively grouping adjacent bands that are the most similar. If the grouping is started from the previously identified best bands, it is possible to develop a metric to check that the incorporation of each additional band to the group enhances the spatial autocorrelation of all the groups of bands together. Nonadjacent multiple band feature selection is simply an extension of the broad band case, except any of the original bands can potentially be grouped in any of the features. Tests with stimulated data indicate that the spatial autocorrelation based methods consistently identify the best bands or groups of bands. Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data of easter Washington state are used to illustrate the technique on real data. The results suggest that visible and near-infrared bands provide a large proportion of the spectral and spatial information in that scene. Adjacent bands in many cases provide similar information, but there are important exceptions such as on the red edge of the infra-red plateau.

Average underestimation of non-productive lands in the Nile Delta ranges from 5% with data sets of nine images to more than 300% with data sets of two images. Average underestimation of reclaimed lands in the Western Desert ranges from 4% with six image data sets to 42% with one-image data sets.

Here, the emphasis is placed on several clearing practices and forest regeneration that can be characterized by using the sensitivity of SAR channels to vegetation biomass and canopy structure. A supervised Bayesian classifier designed for SAR signal statistics is employed to separate five classes: primary forest, secondary forest, pasture-crops, quebradao, and disturbed forest. The L- and C-band polarimetric SAR data acquired during the shuttle imaging radar-C (SIR-C)/X-SAR space-shuttle mission in 1994 are used as input data to the classifier The results are verified by field observation and comparison with the Landsat data acquired in August of 1994. The SAR data can delineate these five classes with approximately 72% accuracy. The confusion arises when separating old secondary forests from primary forest and the young ones from pasture-crops. It is shown that Landsat and SAR data carry complementary information about the vegetation structure that, when used in synergism, may increase the classification accuracy over secondary forest regrowth. When the number of land-cover types was reduced to three classes including primary forest, pasture-crops, and regrowth-disturbed forest, the accuracy of classification increased to 87%. A dimensionality analysis of the classifier showed that the accuracy can be further improved to 92% by reducing the feature space to L-band HH and HV channels. Comparison of SIR-C data acquired in April (wet period) and October (dry period) indicates that multitemporal data can be used for monitoring deforestation; however the data acquired during the wet season are not suitable for accurate land-cover classification.

The second classifier can map wet snow without using a DEM. We demonstrate some processing techniques that are necessary to discriminate wet snow front smooth, bare surfaces and to discriminate dry snow from short vegetation. For validation, we compare our results with snow maps of both binary and snow-fraction classifications obtained from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) at about the same time. The SAR is about 77% as accurate as the TM binary classification, but it underestimates snow cover when compared with snow-fraction classification, with the major differences occurring for mixed pixels of snow and trees.

We found that the spectral reflectance curves of lower plants can be similar to those of the higher ones and their derived NDVI values can be as high as 0.30 units.

These spectral signatures, referred to as endmembers, are input to a linear mixture model which can be inverted to compute endmember abundances for each data spectrum. The visualization method discussed in this article and referred to as the manual endmember selection method (MESM) is based on Inselberg\'s (1985) parallel coordinate representation of multidimensional spaces. It is novel in the field of multidimensional visualization in that it includes not only a passive representation of higher-dimensional data but also the capability to interact with and move geometrical objects in more than 3 dimensions. The spectral shape of endmembers selected with the MESM may be influenced by processes such as multiple scatterings by surface materials and other factors such as illumination geometry that affect the signal received by the sensor.

Due to the difficulty of acquiring extensive ground-based observations, increasing efforts are being devoted to estimate APAR(CAN) from optical satellite measurements. So far, APAR(CAN) has been obtained from the downwelling PAR at the surface (SFC), PAR(SFC)down arrow, and the fraction of PAR absorbed by a canopy, FPAR. This study proposes a new approach which defines APAR(CAN) as the product of APAR(SFC) and RPAR. APAR(SFC) is the total PAR absorbed by all surface materials including canopy, soil, litter, etc., while RPAR is the ratio of the PAR absorbed by the green canopy only, to APAR(SFC). The advantage of this approach is that APAR(SFC) can be determined more accurately and readily than PAR(SFC)down arrow, while the determination of RPAR is as accurate as that of FPAR with the same difficulties. The whole approach is introduced in two parts. Part I, as presented in this article, deals with the retrieval of APAR(SFC). Using a complex atmospheric radiative transfer model, APAR(SFC) is related to the upwelling PAR reflected at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), PAR(TOA)up arrow. The relationship is independent of cloud parameters and surface conditions, and moderately dependent on ozone amount and aerosol optical properties. A parameterization teas developed to estimate APAR(SFC) from PAR(TOA)up arrow, which is inferred from satellite measurements in the visible bands. Error analyses were made using data from both model simulations and field observations. The parameterization is valid to within 5 W m(-2) compared to the results of detailed radiation model simulations. A preliminary comparison against FIFE ground observations showed a bias error of - 2.7 W m(-2) and a standard error of 21.9 W m(-2) for the instantaneous estimates of APAR(SFC).', 'INTERA INFORMAT TECHNOL LTD, OTTAWA, ON, CANADA.RP Li, ZQ (通讯作者)，CANADA CTR REMOTE SENSING, 588 BOOTH, OTTAWA, ON K1A OY7, CANADA.RI Li, Zhanqing/F-4424-2010', NULL, NULL, 'Li, Zhanqing/0000-0001-6737-382X', NULL, NULL, 54, 21, 25, 0, 2, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

The parameters of the VI-P-o(0) relationships and the synaptic weights and biases of two-layer neural networks were successfully adjusted on an experimental data set and on data derived from radiative transfer model simulations. Three experimental data sets were acquired over sugar beef canopies. They expressed a large range of canopy architecture and soil background reflectance. Two of them that correspond to similar experimental procedures were merged together and then randomly split into two subsets: one for fitting the parameters of the VI-P-o(0) relationships or to train the neural network, and the other for the evaluation of the predictive performances. The third experiment is used as an additional independent data set to test the robustness of the approaches. The model simulated data set was generated using the SAIL and PROSPECT radiative transfer models, with input parameter values that were chosen to have similar distributions as observed over sugar beet canopies. As for the experimental data set, the model-simulated data set was split into a training (calibration) and a test (validation) data set. Results show that the gap fraction can be accurately estimated from the red and near-infrared reflectance without any external information except maybe the crop type (here sugar beet) and the soil line characteristics required for some of the vegetation indices.

The analysis is based on experimental data collected by the ground-based PORTOS radiometer at 1.4, 5.05, and 10.65 GHz and data simulated by a coherent model of microwave emission from layered media [Wilheit model (1978)]. In order to simulate diurnal variations of the brightness temperature (T-B), the Wilheit model is coupled to a mechanistic model of heat and water flows in the soil. The Wilheit model is validated on experimental data and its performances for estimating T-B are compared to those of a simpler approach based on a description of the soil media as a single layer (Fresnel model). When the depth of this single layer (hereafter referred to as the sampling depth) is determined to fit the experimental data, similar accuracy in T-B estimation is found with both the Wilheit and Fresnel models. The soil microwave emission is found to be strongly affected by the diurnal variations of soil moisture and temperature profiles. Consequently, the T-B sensitivity to soil moisture and temperature profiles has an influence. on the estimation, from microwave observations, of the surface soil moisture in a surface layer with a fixed depth (theta(s)): the accuracy of theta(s) retrievals and the optimal sampling depth depends both on the variation in soil moisture and temperature profile shape.', 'INRA,SCI SOL STN,F-84914 AVIGNON 9,FRANCE.

An exponential omnidirectional variogram model was used to characterize the spatial continuity of the image for use in the kriging algorithm.

The method is termed visible and near-infrared analysis (VNIRA). Although the spectra of the soils were characterized as monotonous and featureless, the methodology has yielded a prediction equation for estimating several soil constituents from the reflectance curves. The constituents were: CaCO3, Fe2O3, Al2O3, SiO2, LOI (lost-on-ignition), Fed (free iron oxides), and K2O. Several mathematic manipulations were applied to the raw data in order to derive the optimal prediction equation. Spectral compression into 6, 8, 15, 71, and 350 spectral bands and a spectral derivation technique were applied to four separate soil groups, which were selected on the basis of their chemical characteristics. The wave-lengths selected by the method for the optimal prediction equation were assigned to constituents that consisted of spectral features within the VIS-NIR region. An intercorrelation between spectrally featureless constituents and constituents with special features was found to be the major mechanism by which to predict constituents that had no spectral features within this part of the spectrum. It was shown that low spectral resolution is not necessarily a limiting factor in obtaining quantitative information about the chemistry of soil samples. All the examined soil constituents except Fed (which needed 700 spectral bands) required between 15 and 350 spectral bands for optimal prediction. It was concluded that the VIS-NIR (0.4-1.1 mum) is a suitable spectral region for obtaining quantitative information about soil chemistry. Although the VNIRA performance is not as precise as the chemical performance, the precision obtained is likely to be useful for rapid soil characterization and remote-sensing applications.

This fact is more noticeable in the near-infrared and middle-infrared regions of the spectrum. Furthermore, the visible part of the spectrum has resulted in being highly influenced by the diffuse radiation incident on the canopy, which has been quantified by two different physical parameters: the proportion of diffuse irradiance k(d) and the sky clearness epsilon. It has been shown that the reflectance factor increases linearly with increasing diffuse radiation, but only below a threshold value, above which the reflectance remains constant.

However, these techniques overlook a fundamental fact that image classification is basically a process of generalization. The outputs of this process are often intended to be cartographic objects (e.g., polygons) which are abstract models of reality and may not be verifiable at each pixel. Linking errors with cartographic objects in image classification is a challenging problem in remote sensing. This article proposes a new error assessment methodology for image classification (an error model) in which uncertainties involved in the classification process are estimated through simulations of various steps in image classification. Two error models have been developed to estimate the uncertainties involved in class modeling (training) and boundary generation (boundary pixel allocation). Results derived from two case studies show the validity of the proposed error concept for image classification and its potential for improving image classification.', 'UNIV WATERLOO,DEPT GEOG,WATERLOO N2L 3G1,ONTARIO,CANADA.', 'University of WaterlooRP WANG, MH (通讯作者)，LGL LTD,9768 2ND ST,SIDNEY V8L 3Y8,BC,CANADA.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 12, 9, 9, 0, 2, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

A technique was developed to map forest fire boundaries by subtracting a late-summer AVHRR NDVI image from an early summer scene. The locations and boundaries of wildfires within the interior region of Alaska were obtained from the Alaska Fire Service, and compared to the AVHRR-derived fire-boundary map. It was found that AVHRR detected 89.5% of all fires with sizes greater than\' 2000 ha with no false alarms and that, for most cases, the general shape of the fire boundary detected by AVHRR matched those mapped by field observers. However, the total area contained within the fire boundaries mapped by AVHRR were only 61% of those mapped by the field observers.  However, the AVHRR data used in this study did not span the entire time period during which fires occurred, and it is believed the areal estimates could be improved significantly if an expanded AVHRR data set were used.', 'ENVIRONM RES INST MICHIGAN,CTR EARTH SCI,ANN ARBOR,MI 48107.

The long-term alterations in river dis-charges from the boreal catchments, which serve as vital links between the ocean and land, are having a pro-found impact on various environmental factors, particularly ocean circulation and sea-ice content. However, comprehensive and continuous monitoring of Arctic river discharge at seasonal or higher temporal resolutions remains challenging. In this study, we propose a new approach to estimate runoff by generating monthly runoff time series at the basin scale. Our method is based on changes in water storage observed by the gravimetric satellites Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on mission since 2002. The method utilizes an empirical runoff-storage (R-S) relationship, offering simplicity and low computational burden while maintaining good accuracy in estimating runoff. To validate our method, we utilize in-situ runoff measurements from the seven largest boreal drainage basins spanning the period from 2002 to 2019, encompassing a total of 18 years. We divide these 18 years of observations into two phases: a training phase (8 years) and a testing phase (10 years). The results indicate that the R-S method established during the training phase yields monthly Nash -Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values ranging from 0.65 to 0.92 when compared to in-situ runoff measurements. Moreover, the method demonstrates a consistent performance in estimating runoff during the testing phase (monthly NSE: 0.67-0.84). With the exception of the Ob and Mackenzie basins, which exhibit distinct climatic conditions and hydrological networks, the R-S models are interchangeable across basins. This makes it suitable for both temporal and spatial extrapolation to fill data gaps, provided that accurate water and snow storage data are available. All in all, our method enables the reconstruction of monthly surface runoff across the entire boreal basins between 2002 and 2019. The results indicate an average annual runoff of 3200 +/- 160 Gt over the study area of 1.58 x 107 km2. To evaluate the accuracy of our estimates, we compare the total runoff estimates ob-tained using the R-S method with those from 12 model estimates. Our estimates exhibit the highest correlation with available in-situ runoff measurements and yield monthly NSE values >0.57 for five out of the twelve model estimates. This study presents a convenient method to address the urgent need for comprehensive, continuous, and monthly temporal resolution of runoff estimates throughout the entire boreal region.', '[Yi, Shuang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Computat Geodynam, Beijing, Peoples R China.

Optical remote sensing has the advantage of collecting information in multiple spectral bands, thus being able to classify and quantify different oil emulsions. However, most spectral characteristics of oil emulsions have been obtained from laboratory measurements, and it is unclear how to apply these lab-based findings to airborne or satellite observations of highly heterogeneous oil patches. This study proposes a three-dimensional (3D) unmixing model to explain AVIRIS image spectra of oil-containing pixels with both horizontal and vertical mixing effects. Based on the 3D unmixing model, an oil concentration lookup table (LUT) and LUT-based oil concentration mapping method are developed to quantify oil concentrations from AVIRIS observations, with the results validated through the use of a spectral similarity index. Using spatial and spectral resampling simulations, we also propose an approach to extend the LUT to different optical sensors (e.g., Landsat) in order to map oil concentrations, yet such an approach requires further research to validate and improve.', '[Jiao, Junnan; Lu, Yingcheng] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Nanjing 210046, Peoples R China.

Monitoring regional and global snow cover has increased in urgency in recent years due to warming temperatures and declines in snow cover extent. Optical satellite instruments provide large-scale observations of snow cover, but cloud cover and dense forest canopy can reduce accuracy in mapping snow cover. Remote camera networks deployed for wildlife monitoring operate below cloud cover and in forests, representing a virtually untapped source of snow cover observations to supplement satellite observations. Using images from 1181 wildlife cameras deployed by the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA), we compared snow cover extracted from camera images to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products during winter months of 2018-2020. Ordinal snow classifications (scale = 0-4) from cameras were closely related to normalized difference snow index (NDSI) values from the MODIS Terra Snow Cover Daily L3 Global 500 m (MOD10A1) Collection 6 product (R2 = 0.70). Tree canopy cover, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and image color mode influenced agreement between camera images and MOD10A1 NDSI values. For MOD10A1F, MOD10A1\'s corresponding cloud-gap filled product, agreement with cloud-gap filled values decreased from 78.5% to 56.4% in the first three days of cloudy periods and stabilized thereafter. Using our camera data as validation, we derived a threshold to create daily binary maps of snow cover from the MOD10A1 product. The threshold corresponding to snow presence was an NDSI value of 40.50, which closely matched a previously defined global binary threshold of 40 using the MOD10A2 8-day product. These analyses demonstrate the utility of camera trap networks for validation of snow cover products from satellite remote sensing, as well as their potential to identify sources of inaccuracy.', '[Breen, Catherine; Prugh, Laura] Univ Washington, Dept Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.

The direction and shape of SUHI seasonal hysteresis have been thought to be background climate dependent. However, there remains a relative paucity of knowledge about the patterns and driving mechanisms of such hysteretic phenomena across diverse climates. Here we show that the seasonal hysteretic cycles of SUHI in the daytime and nighttime across Chinese cities between 2003 and 2020 can be identified as eight and six primary patterns, characterized by diverse and complex behaviors including clockwise, anti-clockwise, twisted, concave, and convex directions/loops. The urban-rural differences in evapotranspiration (& UDelta;ET) and surface albedo (& UDelta;ABD) have been recognized as the primary contributors to SUHI in the daytime and nighttime and their seasonal hysteresis, respectively, as measured by structural equation modeling (SEM) and time lead/lag analysis. These biophysical mechanisms for diverse seasonal hysteretic cycles of SUHI in China re-emphasized climate context dependencies in SUHI terms. Furthermore, the observed divergence of SUHI hysteresis typologies within similar background climates highlighted the additional drivers of complex urban systems because SUHI is a combined result of rural background and urban characteristics. We conclude that the cost-effective UHI mitigation strategies creating synergies or avoiding trade-offs among seasons should be climate context-specific and tailored to local urbanicity.', '[Yang, Chen; Zhao, Shuqing] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.

The analytic methods are complicated enough that naive analytic error propagation is infeasible, and, in many settings, InSAR practitioners lack sufficient ground truth to assess results. Phase noise due to partial decorrelation from changes in the scattering properties of the ground is a prominent source of accuracy loss. In this paper we present a method to assess the loss of precision due to this component of phase noise. The proposed method consists of generating synthetic data stacks whose statistical properties match those of the actual input SAR data stacks, and then using the synthetic data for an ensemble calculation. The spread of the results of the ensemble calculation indicates the loss of precision.

Spatially explicit data of plant functional traits and diversity are essential for understanding biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning. Here we retrieved three morphological traits (95th quantile height, leaf area index, foliage height diversity) and three physiological traits (chlorophyll a + b content, specific leaf area, equivalent water thickness) from airborne laser scanning and multispectral Sentinel-2 data, respectively. We found airborne LiDAR-derived parameters corre-lated well with in-situ plot-level morphological data (R2 >= 0.67). For satellite-derived physiological traits, partial least squares regression (PLSR) obtained higher prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.26-0.43, cross-validation with in -situ community-weighted mean (CWM) leaf physiological trait data) than a vegetation index (VI) approach. The remotely-sensed traits were used as input to estimate multi-trait functional diversity (FD) indices in a species-rich subtropical mountainous forest. Finally, we investigated the influence of single-trait CWMs, multi-trait FD indices and environmental variables on remotely-derived aboveground ecosystem carbon stocks (aboveground biomass, AGB) and primary productivity (kernel normalized difference vegetation index, kNDVI). CWMs of all functional traits were significant predictors of AGB and kNDVI, as suggested by the mass-ratio hypothesis. Morphological FD indices were also important predictors of AGB and kNDVI, indicating effects of complementarity in crown architectures. In best-fit multivariate models, the first principal component CWM of morphological traits and that of physiological traits were the most important predictors of AGB and kNDVI, respectively. The FD index of morphological richness was additionally selected in the best-fit models for AGB and kNDVI at ecosystem and landscape scales.

However, big challenges remain in developing remote sensing-based models for mapping concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide (cCO2) in lakes at regional or global scales. We developed a cCO2 estimation model using Sentinel-3-derived lake environmental variables and near-synchronous field cCO2 data from 16 lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze and Huai River (ML_YHR) basins in Eastern China (N = 248). Stepwise quadratic polynomial regressions of several combinations of chlorophyll -a (Chl-a), water temperature (Tw), Secchi disk depth (ZSD), and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR)-related variables were tested and validated to select the best approach. The final model showed high performance in calibration and validation (R2 > 0.72, RMSE < 6.35 mu mol L-1, MAPE < 30.31%). The model sensitivity analysis, based on Monte Carlo simulations, showed the model\'s estimated bias as <25% based on uncertainties of all input variables. Spatial and temporal dynamics of dissolved CO2 concentrations in 113 lakes (>= 10 km2) in the ML_YHR basins were mapped from 2016 to 2021 using the Sentinel-3 data. The result showed that CO2 concentrations were low in the summer and autumn but high in the winter and spring with dramatic variations (e.g., mean coefficient of variation: 52.59%). The annual mean CO2 concentrations of lakes revealed that about 28% of the lakes acted as weak atmospheric CO2 sinks (14.96 +/- 1.13 mu mol L-1) while the rest were sources (19.22 +/- 2.02 mu mol L-1), compared with a mean concentration of CO2 atmospheric equilibrium (16.29 mu mol L-1). CO2 concentrations decreased with increasing eutrophication and decreasing lake size (p < 0.05). This study advances current knowledge about CO2 emissions from emerging meso-eutrophic lakes and shows how satellite remote sensing can expand the spatiotemporal coverage of lake CO2.', '[Qi, Tianci; Shen, Ming; Xiao, Qitao; Cao, Zhigang; Ma, Jinge; Luo, Juhua; Liu, Dong; Duan, Hongtao] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.

The reduction of ground observations of freshwater ice has led to an increased reliance on the use of satellite remote sensing data. There is currently interest in the retrieval of lake ice properties (e.g., ice thickness, bubble radius, roughness) using synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Roughness at the ice-water interface is particularly important as it has been identified as the dominant mechanism for increasing SAR backscatter throughout the ice season and must be considered in numerical radiative transfer models. Therefore, this study determines optimal ice-water interface roughness height for two subarctic lakes in northern Canada and models backscatter throughout two ice seasons using the snow microwave radiative transfer (SMRT) model. The two lakes for this study are Noell Lake and Malcolm Ramsay Lake. Field observations of ice thickness, snow depth, snow density, and the Canadian Lake Ice Model (CLIMo) are used to parameterize SMRT. Modelled L, C, and X-band backscatter at different incidence angles is assessed using SAR imagery from multiple satellite missions. Root mean square errors ranged from 0.38 to 1.45 dB for Noell Lake and 0.70 to 2.33 dB for Malcolm Ramsay Lake. Discrepancies between modelled and observed backscatter were found to be connected to the representation of roughness at different interfaces within the ice column and changes that occurred during freeze-melt events. These results provide insight into how changes in ice properties impact backscatter throughout the ice season. SMRT is valuable for modelling backscatter from lake ice during the cold season and could be used to develop retrieval algorithms for estimating ice-water interface roughness. This would allow for the development of other inversion models for retrieval of surface ice conditions and ice thickness.', '[Murfitt, Justin; Duguay, Claude; Gunn, Grant] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.

An accurate characterization of tundra vegetation composition is required to understand how the Arctic will respond to future climate change. However, quantifying tundra vegetation composition over large areas is challenging as commonly-used satellite observations are too coarse, spatially and spectrally, to differentiate low-lying tundra vegetation types. Recent airborne and spaceborne imaging spectroscopy platforms provide better data to characterize vegetation composition. Yet, our ability to characterize vegetation composition with imaging spectroscopy remains largely unexplored in the Arctic, particularly due to a lack of ground observations needed to train and test classification models. To address this problem, we collected very-high-resolution (VHR, similar to 5 cm) unoccupied aerial system (UAS) imagery at three lowArctic tundra sites located on the Seward Peninsula, western Alaska. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of integrating imagery from the UAS and the hyperspectral Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer, Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) airborne instrument to map the fractional composition of 12 key Arctic plant functional types (PFTs). To this end, we first mapped the 12 PFTs from our VHR UAS imagery using random forest classification. We then used these UAS-derived PFT maps as ground truth to develop partial least squares regression (PLSR) models to predict the fractional cover (FCover) of each PFT from AVIRIS-NG imagery. We evaluated the performance of our PLSR models using reserved UAS samples, as well as by mapping PFT FCover and dominant PFT for large tundra landscapes. Our results show that 1) Arctic PFTs can be effectively mapped using VHR UAS imagery, with overall accuracy between 86% and 92%, 2) when the UAS mapped PFTs were used to inform PLSR scaling models, the FCover of the 12 PFTs could be effectively estimated from AVIRIS-NG imagery with a mean absolute error (MAE) <0.13, and 3) our PLSR models outperformed traditional, fully constrained least-squares (FCLS) linear mixture analysis and produced high-quality, spatially contiguous PFT FCover and PFT maps that captured vegetation spatial patterns with similar accuracy to those developed from UAS imagery. The developed PLSR models have the potential to be broadly applied for quantifying vegetation composition with AVIRIS-NG images to help monitor tundra vegetation dynamics and improve process-based modeling of tundra ecosystems.', '[Yang, Dedi; McMahon, Andrew; Serbin, Shawn P.] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Environm & Climate Sci Dept, Upton, NY 11973 USA.

We used the VOD diurnal variations to represent the magnitude of vegetation water content buffering caused by climatic variations for a constant amount of dry biomass carbon. This magnitude of VOD diurnal variations was then used to evaluate the likelihood of VOD decadal variations in reflecting decadal dry biomass carbon changes. We found that SMOS-IC L-VOD and LPDR X-VOD can be reliably used to estimate decadal carbon dynamics for 76.7% and 69.9% of the global vegetated land surface, respectively, yet cautious use is warranted for some areas such as the eastern Amazon rainforest. Moreover, the annual VOD aggregated from the 95% percentile of the nighttime VOD retrievals was proved to be the most suitable parameter for estimating decadal biomass carbon dynamics among the temporal aggregation methods. Finally, we validated the use of annual VOD for estimating interannual carbon dynamics by comparing VOD changes between adjacent years against eddy covariance estimations of gross primary production from flux sites over several land cover classes across the globe. Despite the large difference in spatial scales between them, the positive correlation obtained supports the capability of satellite VOD in quantifying interannual carbon dynamics.', '[Dou, Yujie; Tian, Feng; Zou, Linqing] Wuhan Univ, Hubei Key Lab Quantitat Remote Sensing Land & Atm, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan, Peoples R China.

At coarse spatial resolution (> 100 m), clouds are bright and generally distinguishable from other landscape surfaces. At very high-resolution (< 3 m), detecting clouds becomes a significant challenge due to the presence of smaller features, with spectral characteristics similar to other land cover types, and thin (partially transparent) cloud forms. Furthermore, at this resolution, clouds can cover many thousands of pixels, making both the center and boundaries of the clouds prone to pixel contamination and variations in the spectral intensity. Techniques that rely solely on the spectral information of clouds underperform in these situations. In this study, we propose a multi-regional and multi-sensor deep learning approach for the detection of clouds in very high-resolution WorldView satellite imagery. A modified UNet-like convolutional neural network (CNN) was used for the task of semantic segmentation in the regions of Vietnam, Senegal, and Ethiopia strictly using RGB + NIR spectral bands. In addition, we demonstrate the superiority of CNNs cloud predicted mapping accuracy of 81-91%, over traditional methods such as Random Forest algorithms of 57-88%. The best performing UNet model has an overall accuracy of 95% in all regions, while the Random Forest has an overall accuracy of 89%.

Snow accumulation and melt vary over a broad range of spatial scales, preventing accurate extrapolation of sparse in situ observations to watershed scales. The lidar onboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation, Satellite (ICESat-2) was designed for precise mapping of ice sheets and sea ice, and here we assess the feasibility of snow depth-mapping using ICESat-2 data in more complex and rugged mountain landscapes. We explore the utility of ATL08 Land and Vegetation Height and ATL06 Land Ice Height differencing from reference elevation datasets in two end member study sites. We analyze-3 years of data for Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed in Idaho\'s Owyhee Mountains and Wolverine Glacier in southcentral Alaska\'s Kenai Mountains. Our analysis reveals decimeter-scale uncertainties in derived snow depth and glacier mass balance at the watershed scale. Both accuracy and precision decrease as slope increases: the magnitudes of the median and median of the absolute deviation of elevation errors (MAD) vary from-0.2 m for slopes <5<degrees> to >1 m for slopes >20 degrees. For glacierized regions, failure to account for intra-and inter-annual evolution of glacier surface elevations can strongly bias ATL06 elevations, resulting in under-estimation of the mass balance gradient with elevation. Based on these results, we conclude that ATL08 and ATL06 observations are best suited for characterization of watershed-scale snow depth and mass balance gra-dients over relatively shallow slopes with thick snowpacks. In these regions, ICESat-2 elevation residual-derived snow depth and mass balance transects can provide valuable watershed scale constraints on terrain parameter -and model-derived estimates of snow accumulation and melt.', '[Enderlin, Ellyn M.; Elkin, Colten M.; Gendreau, Madeline; Marshall, H.

The availability of satellite data with free access policy and high monitoring capabilities (in terms of resolution and acquisition frequency) is increasing. Moreover, the first continental displacement map of Europe will be freely available in quarter one 2022 by the latest Copernicus Service, the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS). The EGMS will provide ground displacement maps, updated every year, delivering valuable information to a wide range of users, such as public or governmental institutions, industry, academia, and citizens. This vast amount of information needs semi-automatic tools and methodologies to derive user -oriented products that can be easily used by land use and urban planning decision-makers, who are often un-familiar with PSI. This work proposes a semi-automatic procedure to identify damage prone areas in urban environments from wide-area PSI displacement maps. The proposed method identifies the most significant Active Deformation Areas (ADAs) to calculate three products based on the displacement intensity gradient: the Gradient Intensity Map, the Gradient Vectors and Time Series, and the Potential Damage Map. These products allow identifying buildings and urban structures exposed to potential damage, which could be followed by a more detailed building-based vulnerability and risk assessment. The methodology has been applied to an area of the province of Granada (Andalucta, Spain) but it can be applied to any other urban environment where PSI displacement maps are available. To demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the proposed method, results are discussed in five coastal resorts (Cerro Gordo, Punta de la Mona, Marina del Este, Alfa Mar, and Monte de los Almendros), strongly affected by slope movements. The methodology allowed to derive 175 ADAs from about 200,000 measurement points. About 15% of the resulting area has been found to correspond to high or very high gradient intensity class, and 192 out of 633 buildings have been identified to be prone to moderate or high potential damage. A damage prediction test has been realized through Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, based on a damage inventory map derived from field surveys. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology to localize damaged or potentially damaged buildings, substantially reducing the time of analysis.', '[Barra, Anna; Solari, Lorenzo; Palama, Riccardo; Crosetto, Michele; Monserrat, Oriol] Ctr Tecnol Telecomunicac Catalunya CTTC CERCA, Geomat Res Unit, Remote Sensing Grp, Av Carl Friedrich Gauss 7, Castelldefels 08860, Spain.

Therefore, using alternative images to generate moderate resolution burned area maps becomes critical to guarantee temporal continuity of these products. This paper presents the development of a hybrid algorithm based on Copernicus Sentinel-3 (S3) Synergy (SYN) data and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) 375 m active fires for global detection of burned areas. Using the synergistic and co-located measurements of OLCI and SLSTR instruments on board S3A and S3B, the SYN product offers global, near-daily surface reflectance data at 300 m for both sensors. Our algorithm relied on SYN shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands to compute a multi-temporal separability index that enhanced the burn signal. Active fires from the VIIRS sensor were used to generate spatio-temporal clusters for determining local detection thresholds. Active fires were filtered from those thresholds to obtain the seeds from which a contextual growing was applied to extract burned patches. The algorithm was processed globally for 2019 data to generate a new burned area product, named FireCCIS310. Based on a stratified random sampling, error estimates showed an important reduction of omission errors versus other global burned area products while keeping the commission errors at a similar level (Oe = 41.2% +/- 3.0%, Ce = 19.2% +/- 1.7%). The new FireCCIS310 dataset included 4.99 million km2 for the year 2019, which implied around 1 million more than the precursor FireCCI51 product, based on MODIS 250 m reflectance values. Temporal reporting accuracy was improved as well, detecting 53% of the burned pixels within a 0-1 day difference. Besides, the new product was much less affected by the border effects than FireCCI51, as a result of an improved active fire filtering process. The FireCCIS310 product is accessible through the CCI Open Data Portal (https://climate.esa.int/es/odp/#/dashboard, last accessed on July 2022).', '[Lizundia-Loiola, Joshua; Franquesa, Magi; Khairoun, Amin; Chuvieco, Emilio] Univ Alcal, Environm Remote Sensing Res Grp, Dept Geol Geog & Environm, Calle Colegios 2, Alcala De Henares 28801, Spain.

This study reports on the use of satellite-based synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral imagery for estimating AGB by correlating satellite observations with ground truth data collected on forest plots from dryland forests in the Chobe National Park, Botswana. We undertook nineteen quantitative experiments with Sentinel-1 (S1), and Sentinel-2 (S2) and tested simple and multivariate regression including parametric (linear) and non-parametric (random forests) algorithms, to explore the optimal approaches for AGB estimation. The largest AGB value of 145 Mg/ha was found in northern Chobe while a large part of the study area (85%) is characterized by low AGB values (< 80 Mg/ha), with an average estimated at 51 Mg/ha. The results show that the AGB estimated using SAR backscatter values from vertical transmit receive (VV) polari-zation is more accurate than that based on horizontal receive (VH) polarization, accounting for 58% of the variance compared to 32%. Nevertheless, the combination of S1 SAR and S2 multispectral image data produced the best fit to the ground observations for dryland forests explaining 83% of the variance with an accuracy of 89%. Furthermore, the optimal AGB model performance was achieved with a random forest (RF) regression trees algorithm using S1 (SAR) and S2 (multispectral) image data (R2 = 0.95; RMSE = 0.25 Mg/ha). From the 11 vegetation indices tested, GNDVI, Normalized Difference Red Edge (NDRE1), and NDVI obtained the highest linear relationship with AGB (R2 = 0.71 and R2 = 0.56, p < 0.001), however, GNDVI and NDRE1 improved the AGB estimation at medium to high-density forests compared to NDVI. The GRVI and EVI were the least correlated with AGB (R2 = 0.09 and R2 = 0.31) at a significance level of p < 0.001, respectively. We show that NDVI saturates in areas with >80 Mg/ha AGB, whereas the inclusion of SAR backscatter and optical red edge bands (B5) significantly reduces saturation effects in areas of high biomass. GNDVI and red edge (B5) derived vege-tation indices have more potential for estimating AGB in dryland forests than NDVI.

While frameworks for localized accuracy assessments of categorical gridded data have been proposed to account for the spatial non-stationarity of classification accuracy, such approaches have not been applied to (binary) built-up land data. Such data differs from other data such as land cover data, due to considerable variations of built-up surface density across the rural-urban continuum resulting in switches of class imbalance, causing sparsely populated confusion matrices based on small underlying sample sizes. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by testing common agreement measures for their suitability and plausibility to measure the localized accuracy of built-up surface data. We examine the sensitivity of localized accuracy to the assessment support, as well as to the unit of analysis, and analyze the relationships between local accuracy and density / structure-related properties of built-up areas, across rural-urban trajectories and over time. Our ex-periments are based on the multi-temporal Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) and a reference database for the state of Massachusetts (USA). We find strong variation of suitability among commonly used agreement measures, and varying levels of sensitivity to the assessment support. We then apply our framework to assess localized GHSL data accuracy over time from 1975 to 2014. Besides increasing accuracy along the rural-urban gradient, we find that accuracy generally increases over time, mainly driven by peri-urban densification pro-cesses in our study area. Moreover, we find that localized densification measures derived from the GHSL tend to overestimate peri-urban densification processes that occurred between 1975 and 2014, due to higher levels of omission errors in the GHSL epoch 1975.', '[Uhl, Johannes H.; Leyk, Stefan] Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Geog, 260 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.

The availability of hyperspectral data from space sensors inspired us to study the feasibility to detect and identify different types of plastics in aircraft-, Goafen-5 (GF-5) and PRISMA satellite data by means of deep-, and machine learning models trained with spectral signatures. In this context, various inhouse and public spectral libraries are used to create a compre-hensive database with mixed pixels of different plastic and non-plastic materials. The endmembers of plastic types involved in this study are polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polystyrene (PS), covering 95% of the global production. Additionally, some important varieties of industrial plastics types such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), polyamide (PA), polycarbonate (PC), and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) were included in the investigations. Different samples with varying optical properties (color, brightness, transmissivity) have been selected for each plastic type. As non-plastic materials we have chosen spectra of vegetation, rocks, soils and minerals contained in the public US libraries (ECOSTRESS and USGS). The number of spectra for the training of the deep learning and machine learning models was enlarged by a random linear mixing method and the resulting database was separated into a training and a test group for subsequent multi-label classification. Algorithms selected are a convolutional neural network (CNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). To investigate the transferability to any hyperspectral image data obtained by air-, and spacecraft sensors, we opted for a unifi-cation of the spectral response functions (SRF) and the spectral sampling intervals of all data. Validation is accomplished based on the test group of the spectral database, and tested by controlled laboratory and aircraft experiments recorded over surfaces with varying background materials. Results are further analyzed for the influence of different noise quantities and abundance levels. The performance of the three models is roughly balanced for the validation of the spectral data with an overall accuracy of 97%, 96%, and 95% for the CNN, RF, and SVM, models respectively. In the controlled lab experiments, various accuracy indicators, such as the recall rates and the comprehensive metrics F1-score, OA, and Kappa suggest the RF classifier as the most robust one, followed by the SVM and CNN models. As for the evaluation of the aircraft data from controlled experiments, the RF further outperforms the other two models, behaving most robustly and reliably against conditions with un-known plastics and unknown background surfaces. Thus, the RF was used to classify the ten types of plastics mentioned above in one GF-5 and two PRISMA satellite recordings of the same area. In comparison of both sensor systems, the RF produced high quality and transferable results for detecting plastic mainly related to green-houses, sport fields, photovoltaic constructions and industrial sites that are discussed in detail in this paper.', '[Zhou, Shanyu] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Aerosp & Geodesy, Data Sci Earth Observat, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.

To explore this, we used multi-temporal Landsat sensor data with respect to three defoliation metrics (shoot-based estimates (%), frass biomass (kg.ha(-1)), and proportion of foliar loss) across three different forest systems in the United States. While shoot-based defoliation was measured in the field, the later two defoliation metrics were estimated based on the insect phenology model, BioSIM. The systems include spruce budworm (SBW, Choristoneura fumiferana C). in heterogenous mixed forests, Minnesota, jack pine budworm (JPBW, Cho-ristoneura pinus F). in homogenous pine forests, Wisconsin, and spongy moth (SGM, Lymantria dispar dispar L). in mixed broad-leaved forests, Maryland. Our generalized annual defoliation model for budworm was poor (R-adj(2) = 0.35, RMSE = 23.70%) due to difficulty in detecting SBW defoliation in Minnesota. Thus, individual annual JPBW shoot-based defoliation models (R-adj(2) = 0.27 to 0.75 and RMSE = 19.16% to 11.32%) outperformed the SBW models (R-adj(2) = 0.08 to 0.27, RMSE = 23.18% to 34.13%). Cross-system differences between rates of change in ground-based metrics of defoliation with respect to observed change in spectral index values (dVI) were significant for shoot-based estimates of percent annual defoliation for SGM vs. JPBW (p-values < 1.00 x 10(-4)) and SGM vs. SBW (p-values < 4.60 x 10(-3)). However, such comparison between SGM and JPBW were not significant when either frass biomass (kg.ha(-1), p-value = 0.46) or proportion of foliage loss was used (p-value = 0.67). For a given unit of defoliation, the magnitude of vegetation index change, dVI, was significantly different between SGM and JPBW for each defoliation metric used (p-values < 1.00 x 10(-4)), but not between SGM and SBW (p-value = 0.47) or between JPBW and SBW (p-value = 0.06) when shoot-based annual defoliation metrics were used. This study is first to report that, for a given quantity of defoliation, substantial differences in both the magnitude and direction of vegetation index change exists for different defoliator systems, which currently precludes the development of a viable, unified defoliation model. However, outcomes of this research provide an important step in our understanding of these defoliator systems that may enable specific scaling of continuous defoliation at landscape levels and across defoliator systems in the future.', '[Thapa, B.; Wolter, P.

Although TDs can be estimated through external weather data, their spatiotemporal resolution and data availability are greatly limited, which is not applicable for individual slopes. This paper presents new TD correction methods for slopes with both small dimensions and small elevation changes. We simultaneously estimated and eliminated the TD signal from a line-of-sight (LOS) time series through a blind source separation (i.e., independent component analysis). The stratified TD sources were isolated according to a spatially elevation-linked and temporally pe-riodic independent-component (IC), which was determined via a correlation test and power spectrum analysis. Hence, the TD was corrected without the use of any external weather products/meteorological data and had unprecedented spatiotemporal details equivalent to the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The proposed method was verified using CosmoSkyMed (CSK) and Sentinel-1 (SNT-1) images covering a slope in Tai O, Lantau Island, Hong Kong, and validated using a series of geodetic, meteorological, and hydrological data. Up to 3-4-cm relative TDs were measured in the LOS directions of CSK and SNT-1. The relative TD exhibited a slower incre-ment rate than the slope elevation and was largely affected by specific air conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity) on the SAR image-acquisition days. The analysis of InSAR data yielded reasonably good estimates of millimeter-scale downslope slips (due to increases in pore-water pressure in the wet season) and upslope rebound (due to soil shrinkage in the dry season). It was found that soil swelling and shrinkage of the slope (also known as seasonal ratcheting) and the reclamation were likely regulated by rainfall and sea levels, respectively. Although the slope motion in Tai O was determined to be small (i.e., seasonal variations of 10 mm), the TD correction reduced the root-mean-square error by 42.3%, such that InSAR time-series measurements with millimeter-level accuracy (potentially 1-3 mm) were obtained.', '[Shi, Guoqiang; Huang, Bo] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Space & Earth Informat Sci, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

The theory-based primary production model (TPM), one of the earlier proposed models, is potentially applicable to a variety of water bodies because of its semi-analytical nature. Its accuracy is highly dependent on whether the photophysiological response of phytoplankton is adequately parameterized, specifically the assimilation number (P-max(B)) and the light saturation parameter (Ek). The remote assignment of P-max(B) and Ek is acknowledged to be a challenging task, and the limited progress has impeded extensive use of the TPM. In this study, we proposed a machine learning algorithm, the enhanced random forest regression (ERFR), to retrieve P-max(B) and Ek from satellite observations. The ERFR were then integrated with the TPM (together termed as TPMERFR) to estimate daily depth-integrated primary production (IPP) in clear to turbid waters. The ERFR was trained and validated using in situ datasets from a broad range of trophic and biogeographic conditions, covering oceanic, coastal, and inland water bodies. Evaluations with independent in situ data and matchup data showed that the ERFR outperformed conventional empirical and semi-analytical algorithms, and it could better capture the variability of P-max(B) and Ek than look-up-table methods. The root mean square difference (RMSD) of the satellite-based IPP estimates from the TPMERFR remained within 0.27. In contrast, the benchmark models generally yielded IPP estimates with RMSDs of 0.27-0.62. The TPMERFR was then implemented to climatological satellite products (2010-2019) to reassess global IPP. Reasonable spatial distributions of IPP were preliminarily demonstrated, especially in polar, coastal, and inland waters.

Polarimetric SAR (POLSAR) data are acquired in a quad-polarization mode, and L-band POLSAR data in particular are one of the few SAR data types that preserve the dielectric properties and structures of the scatterer. POLSAR data consist of 2 x 2 scattering matrices and consequently offer superior target recognition compared with dual-polarization data. In this study, we applied scattering power decomposition suitable for detecting deforestation in near real-time to POLSAR data obtained from the Earth observation sensor Phased Array type L band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2). The reflection symmetry condition is known to apply to natural distributed objects (i.e., the cross-correlation between co-and cross-polarization data is zero). Inspired by this, we theoretically and experimentally examined the volume scattering power component to distinguish natural forests from the surrounding area. Two important results were verified for natural forests: as the window size of the ensemble average increases, (i) the coherency matrix approaches a simple theoretical form and (ii) the volume scattering power becomes dominant among the scattering power components. Based on these results, we constructed an algorithm that applies scattering power decomposition for detecting deforestation. We produced reference data using high-resolution optical images and evaluated the performance of the derived deforestation map in the Amazon natural forest when employing various window sizes for the ensemble average. At an optimal window size of 15 x 15 pixels, the deforestation detection performance reached a user\'s accuracy of 94.9% +/- 1.5%, a producer\'s accuracy of 72.3% +/- 1.2%, and a kappa coefficient of 0.816 +/- 0.0039. Sparse trees left after logging increased the volume scattering power and reduced the producer\'s accuracy. The proposed algorithm can contribute to deforestation detection with slightly lower accuracy than that of the annual map provided by Global Forest Change. Further, the proposed algorithm is robust to the seasonal variations in tropical rainforests and temporal variations in the deforestation process. Consequently, the proposed algorithm employing the six component scattering power decomposition method can be utilized in near real-time without considering applicable areas in tropical rainforests. Subsequently, we applied our algorithm to dual-polarization data, which are acquired by PALSAR-2 much more frequently than POLSAR data. The false detection rate did not increase when using the dual-polarization data; however, the omission error increased considerably compared with that when using POLSAR data owing to the low total power obtained from the dual-polarization data.', '[Sugimoto, Ryu; Kato, Soushi; Nakamura, Ryosuke; Tsutsumi, Chiaki; Yamaguchi, Yoshio] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Digital Architecture Res Ctr, Tokyo, Japan.

The combination of SIF with other observations stemming from the FLEX/Sentinel-3 tandem mission holds the potential to assess complex ecosystem processes. The calibration and validation (cal/val) of these radiometric measurements and derived products are central but challenging components of the mission. This contribution outlines strategies for the assessment of in situ radiometric measurements and retrieved SIF. We demonstrate how in situ spectrometer measurements can be analysed in terms of radiometric, spectral and spatial uncertainties. The analysis of more than 200 k spectra yields an average bias between two radiometric measurements by two individual spectrometers of 8%, with a larger variability in measurements of downwelling radiance (25%) compared to upwelling radiance (6%). Spectral shifts in the spectrometer relevant for SIF retrievals are consistently below 1 spectral pixel (up to 0.75). Found spectral shifts appear to be mostly dependent on temperature (as measured by a temperature probe in the instrument). Retrieved SIF shows a low variability of 1.8% compared with a noise reduced SIF estimate based on APAR. A combination of airborne imaging and in situ non-imaging fluorescence spectroscopy highlights the importance of a homogenous sampling surface and holds the potential to further uncover SIF retrieval issues as here shown for early evening acquisitions. Our experiments clearly indicate the need for careful site selection, measurement protocols, as well as the need for harmonized processing.

Eddies with shorter lifespans or intermittent features are arduous to detect and might be eliminated or misclassified during the detection. However, these eddies have been reported as a majority of the mesoscale eddies in global oceans. This study developed a novel eddy identification method for those eddies. Different from the traditional eddy detection performed based on a snapshot of observations in the horizontal plane, this novel identification method was developed on the evolution of eddies in the temporal dimension. It efficiently avoids the failure in detecting eddies with inconspicuous features during some stages of their evolutions and also eliminates excessive detection. The developed method was implemented to detect Capricorn Eddies based on 26 years of sea-level anomaly from satellite altimetry. Capricorn Eddies are transient and intermittent phenomena induced as a result of the East Australian Current colliding with the continental shelf edge near the Fraser Island, Australia. Using the new identification method, the characteristics of Capricorn Eddies, including their temporal and spatial scales, intensity preferences and evolution details, were resolved. Remarkable seasonal variations of the Capricorn Eddies were also revealed. Based on these findings, a comprehensive overview of Capricorn Eddies, which is crucial for further understanding the variabilities of regional biogeochemical processes and ocean ecosystems, was provided.

Water use efficiency (WUE) is an important indicator that links the carbon and water cycles in terrestrial ecosystems.

The spatial distribution of WUE was mapped and the inter-annual and monthly variations were analysed. The mean annual WUE of forests ranged from 1.78-2.02 gC kgH2O-1. It was observed that tropical thorn forests had the highest WUE (3.52 +/- 1.08 gC kgH2O-1) and moist alpine scrub had the lowest WUE (1.05 +/- 0.17gC kgH2O-1) among the forest type groups of India. WUE of forests showed an increasing trend with latitude and decreasing trend with elevation. To understand the influence of various bio-meteorological drivers on WUE and their importance in governing these influences, Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used. The bio-meteorological drivers were able to explain 65% of the variability in WUE. Temperature was identified as the most important driver in influencing the WUE of forests.

Assessments of surface urban heat island (UHI) usually focused on using remote sensing and land cover data to quantify UHI intensity and spatial distribution within a certain period. However, the mechanisms and complex interactions in landscape dynamics and land surface thermal features are still being assessed. In this study, we developed and implemented a novel approach to characterize landscape thermal conditions by focusing on UHI intensity and its spatiotemporal variation using the recently available time series of Landsat land surface temperature and land cover change products. We analyzed land surface temperature changes in urban and surrounding non-urban lands to quantify the UHI intensity and landscape thermal conditions in the Atlanta and Minneapolis metropolitan areas of the United States. Our results revealed that UHI intensities had averages of 3.4 degrees C and 3.3 degrees C in the Atlanta and Minneapolis metropolitan areas, respectively. The dominant land cover type in rural areas and urban imperviousness cover determines the UHI intensity. Increasing trends of 0.04 degrees C/year and 0.01 degrees C/year in UHI intensity between 1985 and 2018 were found in Atlanta and Minneapolis, respectively. The UHI intensity variations in 1985 and 2018 suggest that the magnitudes and temporal variations of UHI intensity averaged from all urban land cover classes are close to the UHI intensity estimated from the low intensity urban area only while the UHI intensities are more than 2 degrees C larger in medium to high and high intensity urban areas. The UHI intensities estimated from the maximum temperature that have statistically significant increasing trends suggest that the maximum temperature is a good element for measuring UHI effect. Urban land cover dynamics play an important role in controlling temporal variation of UHI and the UHI hotspots.

Since the 1970s, remote sensing has enabled large-scale investigations of dunes at comparatively low costs and with temporally continuous observations, which greatly advances our knowledge of aeolian systems. In this context, we provide a review of recent progress in three research topics that have been greatly facilitated by remote sensing techniques. These topics are 1) mapping sand extent and dune types, 2) dune pattern quantification, and 3) monitoring dune dynamics. Sand dune mapping was the early focus of aeolian geomorphologists, and continued progress has been made in refining classification schemes and developing advanced classification techniques. Dune pattern quantification can be resolved in two geomorphometric approaches, and a careful design that takes into consideration the image resolution, the data quality, and the uncertainty in dune discretization is necessary. Dune dynamics typically exhibit as dune migration, dune interactions, and dune fine-scale morphodynamics. The wide application of change detection algorithms, especially COSI-Corr, provides great insights into dune migration, while the exploration of dune interactions is still in its infancy. Future directions are highlighted in four key areas: unifying classification schemes regarding dune morphology, developing methods that are capable of recognizing diverse dune forms at large spatial extents, designing modularized workflows and more complex matching rules to quantify dune migration, and improving quantitative analysis of dune interactions.', '[Zheng, Zhijia; Du, Shihong; Zhang, Xiuyuan] Peking Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & GIS, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.

However, SIF-GPP relationships are mostly built by statistically relating top-of-canopy (TOC) SIF observations (SIFTOC) to eddy covariance flux-tower GPP estimates. We developed a process-based model, based on the mechanistic light response (MLR) model, to mechanistically link SIFTOC with the photosynthetic activity of vegetation. To apply this mechanistic model at the canopy scale, we 1) reformulate the equations by replacing the fraction of open PSII reaction centers (q(L)) and the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Phi(Pmax)) with nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) and the quantum yield of photosystem II (Phi(P)); 2) reconstruct hemispherical broadband SIF fluxes at photosystem II (PSII) from the directional observed SIFTOC that is contributed from photosystem I and II; 3) estimate other key parameters including KDF (ratio between the rate constants for constitutive heat loss and fluorescence), C-c (chloroplastic CO2 partial pressure), and Gamma* (chloroplastic compensation point of CO2) at the canopy scale based on assumptions and in-situ measurements. A comparison against flux-tower based GPP at a winter-wheat study site, demonstrates that the modeled GPP, driven by SIFTOC at 760 nm, air temperature, incoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and directional reflectance in the red and near-infrared region, is able to quantify canopy photosynthesis with good accuracy at both half-hourly (R-2 = 0.85, RMSE = 5.62 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), rRMSE = 9.10%) and daily (R-2 > 0.90, RMSE = 3.25 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and rRMSE = 8.69%) scales. The present model enhances our ability to mechanistically estimate GPP with SIF at the canopy scale, an essential step to model carbon uptake using satellite SIF at regional and global scales.', '[Liu, Zhunqiao; Yu, Qiang; Wang, Yunfei; Lu, Xiaoliang] Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.

Identifications of slow-moving mountain slopes are possible now due to time series measurement from space using microwave satellite data and the InSAR technique, which potentially can detect displacement at millimetre level. Availability of open-source Sentinel-1 data has revolutionised the study involving landslide kinematics and predicting the time of failure. However, identification of accelerating trend, demarcation of release area and prediction of flow path after failure initiation are still challenging. In this paper, we present a novel method for time and path prediction of landslides using two large landslides (Kikruma and Kotropi) located in the Himalayas in India. Sentinel-1 data stack was processed using the Persistent Scatterer and Small Baseline Subset interferometric techniques to analyse the trend of ground deformation leading to slope failures. The displacement time series of the measurement points, analysed using inverse velocity and modified inverse velocity methods, show that the instability had commenced almost a year or more with the final onset of acceleration triggered by heavy rainfall, couple of weeks prior to the actual failure. The acceleration image created from displacement time series data was clustered using image segmentation techniques to demarcate the release area of landslides. The flow simulation was done using the Voellmy friction model with a high-resolution DEM to predict the flow path. The analysis done for Kikruma and Kotropi landslide case studies with the proposed method provided a safe prediction of the time of landslide with similar to 90% accuracy of the flow path prediction. Results show that the method demonstrated in this study may evolve as an effective tool for landslide early warning in hilly areas.', '[Roy, Priyom; Martha, Tapas R.; Khanna, Kirti; Jain, Nirmala; Kumar, K.

We investigated (1) linear relationships between s. and dw values, and (2) the effects of vegetation density and morphology on sigma degrees-d(w) relationships. We developed a new method to classify pixels with significant linear relationships of multi-temporal sigma degrees and d(w) (R-2 > 0.5 and p-value <0.04), which were termed \"Reliable Scatterer\" (RS). RS included positive, negative, and a combination of both positive and negative relationships (corresponding to RS+, RS-, RS +/-, respectively). Our analysis revealed spatially varying vegetation densities and morphologies had a significant impact on RS types, where we found RS+ type pixels for woody vegetation, RS +/- for a mix of medium- and high-density herbaceous vegetation using C-band VV (C-VV) data, and RS for sparse herbaceous vegetation using C-VH data. Overall, our study indicates that C-band dual-polarization backscatter is sensitive to water-depth variations for some vegetation types, and this sensitivity has the potential to serve as a reliable indicator for monitoring water depth in wetland environments.', '[Zhang, Boya; Wdowinski, Shimon] Florida Int Univ, Inst Environm, Dept Earth & Environm, Pc 345 Geodesy Lab, Miami, FL 33199 USA.

However, current understanding of the relative dominance of processes that drive the development of gully erosion is limited. This study investigated the development of gully erosion, and the contribution of mass movement and water erosion to gully erosion based on fourteen scouring experiments on two field plots and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). A three-dimensional (3D) method was proposed to derive the volume of gully erosion based on point clouds with topographic change information. The results showed that TLS-derived gully sediment yields were in a high agreement with the measured sediment yield (R-2 > 0.85, p < 0.01, and mean relative/absolute error < 11.38%/5.47 kg), which demonstrated the reliability of TLS and the newly proposed 3D volumetric calculation method in the gully erosion monitoring. We found that the development of gully erosion consisted of horizontal and vertical cycles. The horizontal development of gullies was dominated by a cycle of gully head retreat that was mainly driven by water erosion as well as gully head expansion that was considerably driven by collapses. The vertical development was driven by the co-evolution of collapses and caves that enhance the development of one another. Our experiments showed that mass movements were generally not a major source of gully erosion mass (1.09%-50.80%) or sediment yield (0.90%-24.71%), although they considerably contributed to the morphological development of gully heads (e.g. 26.74% to 96.09% of the increase in the maximum length of gully head and 39.03% to 94.80% of the change in gully head area). We also found that mass movements significantly impacted gully erosion mass (p < 0.05), while their relationships with sediment yield tended to be complex and depended on the impact of mass movements on the broader runoff and erosion processes. Besides, the extremely high collapses were also found to heavily impact the relationship between the collapse mass and the development of gully erosion, implying that further experiments are needed in the future to enrich the observations and thus improve the above-mentioned understanding. We conclude that by using TLS data in an experimental set-up, gully erosion processes can be captured with fine detail. This provides new insights into the process-understanding of gully erosion.', '[Gao, Chendi; Li, Pengfei; Hu, Jinfei; Yan, Lu; Yao, Wanqiang; Hao, Mingkui; Zhang, Shuhua] Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geomat, Xian 710054, Peoples R China.

Identification, classification, and interpretation of these deposits are crucial to the understanding of volcanic processes and assessing hazards. However, deposits often cover large areas and can be difficult or dangerous to access, making field mapping hazardous and time-consuming. Remote sensing techniques are often used to map and identify the deposits of volcanic eruptions, though these techniques present their own trade-offs in terms of image resolution, wavelength, and observation frequency. Here, we present a new approach for mapping and classifying volcanic deposits using a multi-sensor unoccupied aerial system (UAS) and demonstrate its application on lava and tephra deposits associated with the 2018 eruption of Sierra Negra volcano (Gal \' apagos Archipelago, Ecuador). We surveyed the study area and collected visible and thermal infrared (TIR) images. We used structure-from-motion photogrammetry to create a digital elevation model (DEM) from the visual images and calculated the solar heating rate of the surface from temperature maps based on the TIR images. We find that the solar heating rate is highest for tephra deposits and lowest for Modified Letter Turned CommaaModified Letter Turned Commaa over bar lava, with pa over bar hoehoe lava having intermediate values. This is consistent with the solar heating rate correlating to the density and particle size of the surface. The solar heating rate for the lava flow also decreases with increasing distance from the vent, consistent with an increase in density as the lava degasses. We combined the surface roughness (calculated from the DEM) and the solar heating rate of the surface to remotely classify tephra deposits and different lava morphologies. We applied both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

Variation in trait values expressed by individuals result from a combination of biological and environmental variations. Such species trait variations are increasingly recognized as drivers and responses of biodiversity and ecosystem properties. However, little has been done to comprehensively characterize or monitor such variation using leaf reflectance, where emphasis is more often on species average values. Furthermore, although a variety of platforms and protocols exist for the estimation of leaf reflectance, there is neither a standard method, nor a best practise of treating measurement uncertainty which has yet been collectively adopted. In this study, we investigate what level of uncertainty can be accepted when measuring leaf reflectance while ensuring the detection of species trait variation at several levels: within individuals, over time, between individuals, and between populations. As a study species, we use an economically and ecologically important dominant European tree species, namely Fagus sylvatica. We first use fabrics as standard material to quantify measurement uncertainties associated with leaf clip (0.0001 to 0.4 reflectance units) and integrating sphere measurements (0.0001 to 0.01 reflectance units) via error propagation. We then quantify spectrally resolved variation in reflectance from F. sylvatica leaves. We show that the measurement uncertainty associated with leaf reflectance, estimated using a field spectroradiometer with attached leaf clip, represents on average a small portion of the spectral variation within a single individual sampled over one growing season (2.7 +/- 1.7%), or between individuals sampled over one week (1.5 +/- 1.3% or 3.4 +/- 1.7%, respectively) in a set of monitored F. sylvatica trees located in Swiss and French forests. In all forests, the spectral variation between individuals exceeded the spectral variation of a single individual at the time of the measurement. However, measurements of variation within individuals at different canopy positions over time indicate that sampling design (e.g., standardized sampling, and sample size) strongly impacts our ability to measure between-individual variation. We suggest best practice approaches toward a standardized protocol to allow for rigorous quantification of species trait variation using leaf reflectance.', '[Petibon, Fanny] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Soil Sci & Biogeochem, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.

In this paper, for the first time, we assess the potential of spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal deep learning methods for large-scale classification of land-use following tropical deforestation using dense satellite time series over six years on the pan-tropical scale (incl. Latin America, Africa, and Asia). Based on an extensive reference database of six forest to land-use conversion types, we find that the spatio-temporal models achieved a substantially higher F1-score accuracies than models that account only for spatial or temporal patterns. Although all models performed better when the scope of the problem was limited to a single continent, the spatial models were more competitive than the temporal ones in this setting. These results suggest that the spatial patterns of land-use within a continent share more commonalities than the temporal patterns and the spatial patterns across continents. This work explores the feasibility of extending and complementing previous efforts for characterizing follow-up land-use after deforestation at a small-scale via human visual interpretation of high resolution RGB imagery.

Prior to the operational use of satellite ocean-colour Chl a to monitor the oceans, rigorous assessments of algorithm performance are necessary to select the most suitable products. Due to their inaccessibility, the oligotrophic open-ocean gyres are under-sampled and therefore under-represented in global in situ data sets. The Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) campaigns fill the sampling gap in Atlantic oligotrophic waters. In-water underway spectrophotometric data were collected on three AMT field campaigns in 2016, 2017 and 2018 to assess the performance of Sentinel-3A (S3-A) and Sentinel3B (S3-B) Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) products. Three Chl a algorithms for OLCI were compared: Processing baseline (pb) 2, which uses the ocean colour 4 band ratio algorithm (OC4Me); pb 3 (OL_L2M.003.00) which uses OC4Me and a colour index (CI); and POLYMER v4.8 which models atmosphere and water reflectance and retrieves Chl a as a part of its spectral matching inversion. The POLYMER Chl a for S-3A OLCI performed best. The S-3A OLCI pb 2 tended to under-estimate Chl a especially at low concentrations, while the updated OL_L2M.003.00 provided significant improvements at low concentrations. OLCI data were also compared to MODIS-Aqua (R2018 processing) and Suomi-NPP VIIRS standard products. MODIS-Aqua exhibited good performance similar to OLCI POLYMER whereas Suomi-NPP VIIRS exhibited a slight under-estimate at higher Chl a values. The reasons for the differences were that S-3A OLCI pb 2 Rrs were over-estimated at blue bands which caused the under-estimate in Chl a. There were also some artefacts in the Rrs spectral shape of VIIRS which caused Chl a to be under-estimated at values >0.1 mg m-3. In addition, using in situ Rrs to compute Chl a with OC4Me we found a bias of 25% for these waters, related to the implementation of the OC4ME algorithm for S-3A OLCI. By comparison, the updated OLCI processor OL_L2M.003.00 significantly improved the Chl a retrievals at lower concentrations corresponding to the AMT measurements. S-3A and S-3B OLCI Chl a products were also compared during the Sentinel-3 mission tandem phase (the period when S-3A and S-3B were flying 30 sec apart along the same orbit). Both S-3A and S-3B OLCI pb 2 under-estimated Chl a especially at low values and the trend was greater for S-3A compared to S-3B. The performance of OLCI was improved by using either OL_L2M.003.00 or POLYMER Chl a. Analysis of coincident satellite images for S-3A OLCI, MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS as composites and over large areas illustrated that OLCI POLYMER gave the highest Chl a concentrations and percentage (%) coverage over the north and south Atlantic gyres, and OLCI pb 2 produced the lowest Chl a and % coverage.', '[Tilstone, Gavin H.; Pardo, Silvia; Dall, Giorgio; Nencioli, Francesco] PML Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England.

TMCFs provide important ecosystem services, in particular the supply of water to their wider surroundings. Throughout the tropics (here 23.5 degrees S to 23.5 degrees N), they are under pressure from deforestation and poor land management which leads to loss of both forest area and species diversity, and reduces their capture of occult precipitation. Climate change may also reduce occult precipitation in TMCFs since the cloud base may lift in response to higher temperatures - the \'lifting cloud-base hypothesis\'. These threats to TMCFs are well understood, but their quantitative assessment is hampered by 1) uncertainty in the location and spatial extent of TMCFs and 2) limited availability of representative meteorological data. We use a Random Forest Classifier - informed by topographic data, MODIS vegetation data, TRMM precipitation data and ERA5-Land and MERRA-2 reanalysis products - to estimate the spatial distribution and extent of TMCFs (2.1 x 10(6) km(2) +/- 0.5 x 10(6) km(2)). We analyze temporal changes in climate, tree-cover and greenness of TMCFs over the past two to four decades to detect 1) multi-decadal trends, and 2) associations with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Evidence for the \'lifting cloud-base hypothesis\' in reanalysis products was inconsistent across the tropics; a lifting of the cloud base during the past four decades occurred for about 20% of TMCFs, predominantly in the Americas and a few locations in Africa, while in Asia a downward movement of the cloud base was found. However, these results in part depend on the bias correction applied to the reanalyses. Changes in TMCF tree cover and greenness varied by continent; in Africa in 50% of TMCFs tree cover declined, whereas TMCFs in the Americas and in Asia exhibited a net increase in tree cover, despite a reduction in tree cover in similar to 20% of these TMCFs. An important limitation of the tree-cover data is that they do not distinguish between natural tree cover and agro-forestry. ENSO signals were more strongly present in precipitation in American and Asian TMCFs, whereas IOD signals were stronger in TMCF temperature and dewpoint temperature across the tropics. ENSO and IOD signals were approximately equally important for precipitation in African TMCFs and in cloud-base height across the tropics. An arbitrary warming of 1 degrees C and a 100 m lifting of the cloud base, in accordance with the \'lifting cloud hypothesis\', imposed on the Random Forest classifier showed a decline in the extent of TMCFs in the Americas and Africa, but an increase in Asia - mostly at the expense of evergreen broadleaf forests. The greater vulnerability of TMCFs in Africa may be linked to their more isolated and scattered distribution across the continent and drier conditions compared to a more continuous distribution and wetter conditions in the Americas and Asia.', '[Los, Sietse O.; Street-Perrott, F.

The analysis framework incorporated recommended good practices for sampling design, response design, analysis protocols, and designbased inference for providing rigorous estimates of accuracy and precision. Further partitioning of disagreement allows users to assess the relative importance of spatial location versus total abundance of map classes to map error; we introduced a ratio of allocation disagreement to quantity disagreement for comparing relative importance of each across datasets. Assessment of fuzzy membership with linguistic scales may have minimal effect on overall accuracy, but can provide substantial improvement in user\'s accuracy and producer\'s accuracy for uncommon classes.

To date, there is no accurate and widely accepted model that relies on UAS optical surface reflectance observations for RZSM estimation at high spatial resolution. This study is aimed at the development of a new approach for RZSM estimation based on the fusion of high spatial resolution optical reflectance UAS observations with physical and hydraulic soil information integrated into Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). The H2O AutoML platform includes a number of advanced machine learning algorithms that efficiently perform feature selection and automatically identify complex relationships between inputs and outputs. Twelve models combining UAS optical observations with various soil properties were developed in a hierarchical manner and fed into AutoML to estimate surface, near-surface, and root zone soil moisture. The addition of independently measured surface and near-surface soil moisture information to the hierarchical models to improve RZSM estimation was investigated. The accuracy of soil moisture estimates was evaluated based on a comparison with Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors that were deployed to monitor surface, near-surface and root zone soil moisture dynamics. The obtained results indicate that the consideration of physical and hydraulic soil properties together with UAS optical observations improves soil moisture estimation, especially for the root zone with a RMSE of about 0.04 cm3 cm-3. Accurate RZSM estimates were obtained when measured surface and near-surface soil moisture data was added to the hierarchical models, yielding RMSE values below 0.02 cm3 cm-3 and R and NSE values above 0.90. The generated high spatial resolution RZSM maps clearly capture the spatial variability of soil moisture at the field scale. The presented framework can aid farm scale precision irrigation management via improving the crop water use efficiency and reducing the risk of groundwater contamination.', '[Babaeian, Ebrahim; Tuller, Markus] Univ Arizona, Dept Environm Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.

Though satellite-based SIF products show close relationships with terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP), there is wide variability in the magnitude of published SIF retrievals made at intermediate scales. In a meta-analysis of the tower-based and airborne SIF literature, we found that mean SIF retrievals from unstressed vegetation spanned a wide range, from 0.041 mW m- 2 nm- 1 sr-1 to 14.8 mW m- 2 nm- 1 sr-1, with a majority of values falling below 4 mW m- 2 nm- 1 sr-1. We compiled information on reported spectrometer calibration procedures, hardware characterizations, and associated corrections from these same papers, and found inconsistent reporting on if and how key calibration methodology was performed. In order to quantify the importance of such methodological differences on final SIF retrievals made at a proximal scale, we performed radiometric calibrations and corrections for electronic dark current, detector noise, atmospheric O2 absorbance, and cosine corrector effects on three field-deployed spectrometers. We found dramatic changes in SIF retrieval magnitude before and after applying calibrations and corrections, as well as significant differences between instrument performance in the field and expected performance based on laboratory characterizations. Based on these tests, and on a Monte Carlo simulation of uncertainty estimates associated with each of these corrections, it is likely that calibration methodologies and hardware characterizations explain some of the observed variability in published SIF retrievals. This wide range in baseline SIF retrieval methodologies and resultant magnitudes severely limit researchers? ability to synthesize and advance the utility of SIF in modeling GPP across scales. Further, variability in calibration and correction methodology may explain the weak SIF-GPP relationship across studies at tower scales.', '[Marrs, Julia K.; Jones, Taylor S.; Hutyra, Lucy R.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, 675 Commonwealth Ave,Rm 130, Boston, MA 02215 USA.

Using a semi-analytical modeling framework for deriving the absorption coefficient of plant canopies from reflectance spectra, we quantify the effects of functional, structural and biochemical traits of vegetation on the relationship between the absorption coefficient in the PAR region (?par) with canopy characteristics such as the fraction of PAR absorbed by photosynthetically active vegetation (fAPARgreen) and chlorophyll (Chl) content. The reflectance dataset used in the study included simulated data obtained from a canopy reflectance model (PROSAIL) and empirical data on three diverse crop species with different leaf structures, canopy architectures and photosynthetic pathways (rice, maize and soybean) acquired at proximal (i.e., using field spectroradiometers) and remote (i.e., Landsat TM and ETM+) distances. Results show the usefulness of ?par derived from reflectance data for assessing not only the photosynthetic status of vegetation, but also the effects of different functional, structural and biochemical traits on plant performance. Furthermore, these assessments can be made using data acquired by satellite sensor systems such as the Landsat series, which are available since the 1980s, thus facilitating the analysis of the photosynthetic status of terrestrial ecosystems throughout the world with a high temporal depth.', '[Gitelson, Anatoly] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.

We present the temporal variability of atmospheric aerosols over India and north Indian Ocean (NIO) for the past two decades (2000?2019). Here, the measurements from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra, Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) on Terra, and Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) measurements from Envisat, and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis data are considered. On average, the Indo Gangetic Plain (IGP) shows the largest (0.5?1.2), and NIO and Himalaya show the smallest (0.1 or smaller) Aerosol Optical depth (AOD) values. The peak AOD loading is observed in June?July-August, and IGP has a secondary peak in March owing to the stubble and biomass burning in winter months. In contrast, the peak aerosol loading in the northeast is in winter due to forest and biomass burning during the period there. The inter-annual variability is very small in NIO, Himalaya and Bay of Bengal. The trends estimated from the combined (AATSR, MISR, MODIS and MERRA-2) data show the highest positive trends at the lower IGP and east central regions, about 0.8?1.2/dec, and are statistically significant. This is consistent with the urban activity, industries and dense population there. However, the Desert, northern Himalaya and northern Arabian Sea show insignificant negative trends, from-0.2 to-0.4/dec, as the anthropogenic sources of aerosols are very limited there. The bias estimate shows that most satellite and reanalysis data are in very good agreement at all regions (within 0.1?0.2). Even though the bias in the measurements are considered, the trends estimated are still large enough to be statistically significant. The analyses, therefore, caution the increasing aerosol loading and their plausible climate feedback in these regions.

OC-SMART is a multi-sensor data analysis platform which supports heritage, current, and possible future multi-spectral and hyper-spectral sensors from US, EU, Korea, Japan, and China, including SeaWiFS, Aqua/MODIS, SNPP/VIIRS, ISS/HICO, Landsat8/OLI, DSCOVR/EPIC, Sentinel-2/MSI, Sentinel-3/OLCI, COMS/GOCI, GCOM-C/SGLI and FengYun-3D/MERSI2. The products provided by OC-SMART include spectral normalized remote sensing reflectances (R-rs values), chlorophyll_a (CHL) concentrations, and spectral in-water inherent optical properties (IOPs) including absorption coefficients due to phytoplankton (a(ph)), absorption coefficients due to detritus and Gelbstoff (a(dg)) and backscattering coefficients due to particulates (b(bp)). Spectral aerosol optical depths (AODs) and cloud mask results are also provided by OC-SMART.   The goal of OC-SMART is to improve the quality of global ocean color products retrieved from satellite sensors, especially under complex environmental conditions, such as coastal/inland turbid water areas and heavy aerosol loadings. Therefore, the atmospheric correction (AC) and ocean IOP algorithms in OC-SMART are driven by extensive radiative transfer (RT) simulations in conjunction with powerful machine learning techniques. To simulate top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiances, we solve the radiative transfer equation pertinent for the coupled atmosphere-ocean system. For each sensor, we have created about 13 million RT simulations and comprehensive training datasets to support the development of the machine learning AC and in-water IOP algorithms. The results, as demonstrated in this paper, are very promising. Not only does OC-SMART improve the quality of the retrieved water products, it also resolves the negative water-leaving radiance problem that has plagued heritage AC algorithms. The comprehensive training datasets created using multiple atmosphere, aerosol, and ocean IOP models ensure global and generic applicability of OC-SMART.   The use of machine learning algorithms makes OC-SMART roughly 10 times faster than NASA\'s SeaDAS platform. OC-SMART also includes an advanced cloud screening algorithm and is resilient to the contamination by weak to moderate sunglint and cloud edges. It is therefore capable of recovering large amounts of data that are discarded by other algorithms (such as those implemented in NASA\'s SeaDAS package), especially in coastal areas. OC-SMART is currently available as a standalone Python package or as a plugin that can be installed in ESA\'s Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP).', '[Fan, Yongzhen; Li, Wei; Chen, Nan; Stamnes, Knut] Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Phys, Light & Life Lab, Hoboken, NJ 07307 USA.

A crucial measure in pest control is the removal of infested trees before the beetles leave the bark, which generally happens before the end of June. However, stressed tree crowns do not show any significant color changes in the visible spectrum at this early-stage of infestation, making early detection difficult. In order to detect the related forest stress at an early stage, we investigated the differences in radar and spectral signals of healthy and stressed trees. How the characteristics of stressed trees changed over time was analyzed for the whole vegetation season, which covered the period before attacks (April), early-stage infestation (\'green-attacks\', May to July), and middle to late-stage infestation (August to October). The results show that spectral differences already existed at the beginning of the vegetation season, before the attacks. The spectral separability between the healthy and infested samples did not change significantly during the \'green-attack\' stage. The results indicate that the trees were stressed before the attacks and had spectral signatures that differed from healthy ones. These stress-induced spectral changes could be more efficient indicators of early infestations than the \'green-attack\' symptoms.   In this study we used Sentinel-1 and 2 images of a test site in southern Sweden from April to October in 2018 and 2019. The red and SWIR bands from Sentinel-2 showed the highest separability of healthy and stressed samples. The backscatter from Sentinel-1 and additional bands from Sentinel-2 contributed only slightly in the Random Forest classification models. We therefore propose the Normalized Distance Red & SWIR (NDRS) index as a new index based on our observations and the linear relationship between the red and SWIR bands. This index identified stressed forest with accuracies from 0.80 to 0.88 before the attacks, from 0.80 to 0.82 in the early-stage infestation, and from 0.81 to 0.91 in middle- and late-stage infestations. These accuracies are higher than those attained by established vegetation indices aimed at \'green-attack\' detection, such as the Normalized Difference Water Index, Ratio Drought Index, and Disease Stress Water Index. By using the proposed method, we highlight the potential of using NDRS with Sentinel-2 images to estimate forest vulnerability to European spruce bark beetle attacks early in the vegetation season.', '[Huo, Langning; Persson, Henrik Jan; Lindberg, Eva] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Resource Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden.', 'Swedish University of Agricultural SciencesRP Huo, LN (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Resource Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden.', 'langning.huo@slu.se; henrik.persson@slu.se; eva.lindberg@slu.seRI Lindberg, Eva/AAN-1643-2021; Persson, Henrik Jan/ABE-4211-2021', 'Lindberg, Eva/0000-0002-1792-0773; Persson, Henrik   J./0000-0002-3403-057X; Huo, Langning/0000-0001-8432-8609', 'Hildur och Sven Wingquists Foundation for Forest Research', 'The project was supported by the Hildur och Sven Wingquists Foundation   for Forest Research.', 77, 53, 54, 23, 133, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

This method establishes an observation function by exploiting the spatial correlation of adjacent point deformations based on a geo-kinematic model (i.e., SM), and it determines an accurate weight of heterogeneous observations using the VCE algorithm; this method has been demonstrated to be superior to the traditional pixel-by-pixel-based weighted least square (WLS) method. However, since the SM-VCE method employs the adjacent points\' observations to estimate 3-D deformations at a target point, it is inevitable that it results in a bias in the solution near the deformation jump area (e.g., the fault zone in an earthquake). In this paper, a Strain Model-based Adaptive Neighborhood Determining (SMAD) method is proposed to identify homogeneous deformation observations in such a way that the accuracy of the 3-D deformations estimated by the SM-VCE method can be increased, especially near the surface rupture area. This method is used for mapping 3-D coseismic deformations associated with the 2016 Mw7.8 KaikOura earthquake in New Zealand. Furthermore, with increasing SAR data available for a single event, the effect of the number/type of independent observations on the accuracy of the 3-D deformations remains poorly understood and requires further discussion. To accomplish this goal, we define a term, the deformation dilution of precision (DDOP), to represent the quality of the 3-D deformation vector; this term is similar to the position dilution of precision (PDOP) in global navigation satellite system (GNSS), and we investigate different combinations with different numbers/types of independent observations to explore the 3-D deformations of this earthquake. The results demonstrate that the type of incorporated observations can significantly dominate the accuracy of the 3-D deformations compared to the number of observations, which can provide an important reference for relevant studies that estimate 3-D deformations. Furthermore, the proposed methods and conclusions are beneficial for estimating 3-D surface deformations associated with other geophysical processes, such as volcanic eruptions.', '[Hu, Jun; Liu, Jihong; Li, Zhiwei; Zhu, Jianjun; Wu, Lixin; Wu, Wenqing] Cent South Univ, Sch Geosci & Info Phys, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China.

A primary objective of the ongoing development of TRD physical models is to perform a correction of the angular effects to obtain comparable land surface temperature products. In practice, it is advised to handle only the models having a limited number of input parameters for the purpose of operational applications. The use of semi-empirical kernel-driven models (KDMs) appears to be a good tradeoff between physical accuracy and computational efficiency as it was already demonstrated through a broad usage in the optical domain. It remains that the existing state-of-the-art 3 -parameter TIR KDMs (RossThick-LiSparseR, LiStrahlerFriedl-LiDenseR, Vinnikov, and RoujeanLagouarde) underestimate the hotspot phenomenon, especially for continuous canopies marked by a narrow peak. In this study, a new general framework of TIR kernel-driven modeling is proposed to overcome such issue. It is a linear combination of three kernels (including a base shape kernel, a hotspot kernel with adjustable width and an isotropic kernel) with the ability to simulate the bowl, dome and bell shapes in the solar principal plane. Four specific 4-parameter models (Vinnikov-RoujeanLagouarde, LiStrahlerFriedl-RoujeanLagouarde, Vinnikov-Chen, and LiStrahlerFriedlChen, named \"base shape kernel hotspot kernel\") within the new framework were studied to assess their abilities to mimic the patterns of the directional brightness temperature for both continuous and discrete vegetation canopies. These four 4-parameter KDMs and four 3-parameter KDMs were comprehensively evaluated with 306 groups of simulated multi-angle datasets generated by a modernized analytical 4-stream radiative transfer model based on the Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves (4SAIL), and a Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model considering different solar zenith angles (SZA), canopy architectures and component temperatures, and 2 groups of airborne measured multi-angle datasets over continuous maize and discrete pine forest. Results show that the four 4-parameter KDMs behave better than the four existing 3 -parameter KDMs over continuous canopies (e.g. R-2 increases from 0.661 similar to 0.970 to 0.940 similar to 0.997 and RMSE decreases from 0.17 similar to 0.71 to 0.07 similar to 0.16 when SZA = 30 degrees) and discrete canopies (e.g. R-2 increases from 0.791 similar to 0.989 to 0.976 similar to 0.996 and RMSE decreases from 0.10 similar to 0.84 to 0.08 similar to 0.21 when SZA = 30 degrees). The new general framework with four parameters (three kernel coefficients and an adjustable hotspot width) improves the fitting ability significantly, compared to the four existing three-parameter KDMs, given the addition of one more degree of freedom. Results show that the coefficients of the base shape kernel, hotspot kernel and isotropic kernel are related to the temperature difference between leaf and background, temperature difference between sunlit component and shaded component, and the nadir brightness temperature, respectively. However, the estimated hotspot width depends on vegetation structure. The new kernel-driven modeling framework has the potential to be a tool for angular correction of multi-angle satellite observations and angular optimization of future multi angle TIR sensors.', '[Cao, Biao; Liu, Qinhuo; Du, Yongming; Li, Hua; Bian, Zunjian; Hu, Tian; Qin, Boxiong; Ran, Xueting; Xiao, Qing] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

A major advantage of VPA is that it uses multiple dependent variables (i.e., surface-based drought indices) and multiple independent variables (i.e., satellite-derived drought factors) to capture varied climate and environmental characteristics. Therefore, the VPA-based indices can be adopted for different drought types (i.e., meteorological, agricultural and hydrological droughts) depending on the user\'s selection of drought factors and indices. In VPA, the weights of each drought factor are generated through correlations (r) between each dependent variable and a satellite-derived drought factor that is obtained from the new generation sensor systems, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Global Precipitation Mission (GPM). Three schemes of VPID with different combinations of variables focused on integrated-, short-, and long-term drought (VPIDinte, VPIDshort, and VPIDlong, respectively) were evaluated over the CONUS and East Asia. All three schemes showed good agreement with surface-based drought indices resulting in averaged r (from 0.42 to 0.68) across both study areas. While VPIDshort or VPIDlong were more correlated with short (1-3 months) or long (9-12 months) term surface-based drought indices, VPIDinte provided a more generalized (i.e., integrated from 1 to 12 months) index that is suitable for varied drought conditions. The spatial distributions of drought from VPIDs agreed with United States Drought Monitor (USDM) data and Emergency Events Database across East Asia for both extreme drought and normal conditions. In particular, the drought areas of VPIDinte corresponded with the USDM results with r = 0.83 and root mean square error = 9.4%. Crop yield trends were also consistent with the VPIDs results in most years for both study areas. The proposed approach, VPA and VPID, can be adopted for any region with different combinations of surface-based drought indices and satellite-derived drought factors.', '[Son, Bokyung; Park, Sumin; Im, Jungho; Park, Seohui] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol UNIST, Dept Urban & Environm Engn, Ulsan, South Korea.

However, CBT is rarely available at regional and global scales, and its application in estimating cloud sky SDLR is limited. In this study, a framework to globally estimate cloud sky SDLR during both daytime and nighttime is proposed. This framework is composed of three parts. First, a global cloudy property database was constructed by combing the extracted cloud vertical structure (CVS) parameters from the active CloudSat data and cloud properties from passive MODIS data. Second, the empirical methods for estimating cloud thickness (CT) under ISCCP cloud classification system and MODIS cloud classification system were developed. Additionally, the coefficients of CERES CT estimate models were refitted using the constructed cloud property database. With the estimated CT and reanalysis data, calculating the CBT is straightforward. The accuracy of the estimated CT for ISCCP cloud type is compared with the existing studies that were conducted at local scales. Our CT estimate accuracy is comparable to that of the existing studies. According to the validation results at ARM NSA and SGP stations, the CT estimated by the developed CT model for MODIS cloud type is better than that estimated by the original CERES CT model. Finally, the cloudy sky SDLR values were derived by feeding the estimated CBT and other parameters to the single-layer cloud model (SLCM). When validated by the ground measured SDLR collected from the SURFRAD network, the bias and RMSE are 5.42 W.m(-2) and 30.3 W.m(-2), respectively. This accuracy is comparable to the evaluation results of the mainstream SDLR products (Gui et al. 2010), the new evaluation results of SLCMs (Yu et al. 2018), and the accuracy of a new cloudy sky SDLR estimate method (Wang et al. 2018). All the derived CBTs improve the SDLR estimate accuracy more than the SLCM that directly uses cloud-top temperature (CTT). We will collect more ground measurements and continue to validate the developed framework in the future.', '[Yang, Feng; Cheng, Jie] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

Here we implement a regression-based unmixing approach to generate fractional vegetation cover on a regional scale from a simulated Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite scene derived from Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery acquired over the San Francisco Bay Area, California, USA, an area with a mixture of temperate and Mediterranean climate forests, woodlands and shrublands. A hierarchical classification scheme was implemented that considered fractional cover of vegetation as a whole (vegetation vs non-vegetation), vegetation life forms (woody vs non-woody vegetation; tree vs shrub vs grass), and tree leaf type (needleleaf vs broadleaf). A Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model was trained using synthetically-mixed training data generated from an endmember library, and mapping accuracy was assessed using an independent validation dataset across four ecoregions. Our approach was able to effectively model landscape patterns at all levels of the class hierarchy. Site-wide map accuracy was highest when mapping generic vegetation fractions (MAE = 3.8%) and expectedly decreased at more complex hierarchy levels, with highest errors observed when separating tree and shrub fractions. Still, fraction estimates of needleleaf trees (MAE = 10.6%), broadleaf trees (MAE = 13.1%) and shrubs (MAE = 15.3%) were mapped with low overall error. Using Landsat imagery led to an average decrease in map accuracy of 1.9% when compared to hyperspectral image analysis and a maximum decrease of 3.5% when separating broadleaf and needleleaf trees across all sites. Further, a single regional model was shown to yield comparable results to multiple local ecoregion-based models, facilitating the analysis of large regions without creating a separate model for each region. Our results highlight the utility of regression-based approaches for quantitative vegetation mapping, which is of particular interest for future spaceborne imaging spectroscopy missions operating across large areas at moderate spatial resolution.', '[Cooper, Sam; Okujeni, Akpona; Jaenicke, Clemens; Hostert, Patrick] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.

For mixed life-form biomes such as savannas, plant function is very difficult to parameterise due to the distinct physiological characteristics of tree and grass plant functional types (PFTs) that vary dramatically across space and time. The partitioning of their fractional contributions to ecosystem gross primary production (GPP) remains to be achieved at regional scale using remote sensing. The objective of this study was to partition savanna gross primary production (GPP) into tree and grass functional components based on their distinctive phenological characteristics. Comparison of the remote sensing partitioned GPP(tree) and GPP(grass) against field measurements from eddy covariance (EC) towers showed an overall good agreement in terms of both GPP seasonality and magnitude. We found total GPP, as well as its tree and grass components, decreased dramatically with rainfall over the North Australian Tropical Transect (NATT), from the Eucalyptus forest and woodland in the northern humid coast to the grasslands, Acacia woodlands and shrublands in the southern xeric interior. Spatially, GPP(tree) showed a steeper decrease with precipitation along the NATT compared to GPP(grass), thus tree/grass GPP ratios also decreased from the northern mesic region to the arid south region of the NATT. However, results also showed a second trend at the southern part of the transect, where tree-grass ratios and total GPP increased with decreasing mean annual precipitation, and this occurred in the physiognomic transition from hummock grasslands to Acacia woodland savannas. Total GPP and tree-grass GPP ratios across climate extremes were found to be primarily driven by grass layer response to rainfall dynamics. The grass-containing xeric savannas exhibited a higher hydroclimatic sensitivity, whereas GPP in the northern mesic savannas was fairly stable across years despite large variations in rainfall amount. The pronounced spatiotemporal variations in savanna vegetation productivity encountered along the NATT study area suggests that the savanna biome is particularly sensitive and vulnerable to predicted future climate change and hydroclimatic variability.', '[Ma, Xuanlong; Huete, Alfredo; Cleverly, James; Leng, Song; Yu, Qiang; Eamus, Derek] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Life Sci, Ultimo, NSW, Australia.

Insight into this fine scale of ecosystem functioning is also important as far as minimizing errors in upscaling are concerned. The realisation of high-resolution ground surveys of these mudflats without perturbing their surface is a real challenge. Here, we address this challenge using UAV-supported photogrammetry based on the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) workflow. We produced a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and an orthophotograph at 1 cm and 0.5 cm pixel resolutions, respectively, of a mudflat in French Guiana, and mapped and classed into different size ranges intricate morphological features, including crab burrow apertures, tidal drainage creeks and depressions. We also determined subtle facies and elevation changes and slopes, and the footprint of different degrees of benthic biofilm development. The results generated at this scale of photogrammetric analysis also enabled us to relate macrofaunal crab burrowing activity to various parameters, including mudflat elevation, spatial distribution and sizes of creeks and depressions, benthic biofilm distribution, and flooding duration. SfM photogrammetry offers interesting new perspectives in fine-scale characterisation of the geomorphology, benthic activity and degree of biofilm development of dynamic muddy intertidal environments that are generally difficult of access. The main shortcomings highlighted in this study are a drift of accuracy of the DSM outside areas of ground control points and the deployment of which perturb the mudflat morphology and biology, the water-logged or very wet surfaces which generate reconstruction artefacts through the sun glint effect, and the time-consuming task of manual interpretation of extraction of features such as crab burrow apertures. On-going developments in UAV positioning integrating RTK/PPK GPS solutions for image-georeferencing and precise orientation with high-quality inertial measurement units will limit the difficulties inherent to ground control points, while conduction of surveys during homogeneous cloudy conditions could reduce the sun-glint effect. Manual extraction of image features could be automated in the future through the use of deep-learning algorithms.', '[Brunier, Guillaume; Michaud, Emma] Univ Brest, LEMAR, IFREMER, CNRS,IRD, F-29280 Plouzane, France.

In this study, the relationship between accumulated antecedent precipitation (AAP) from 1 to 60 months and average monthly F-PV and F-NPV from the MODIS Fractional Cover Product is examined over a 17 year period from 2001 to 2018. The maximum R-2 value, regression coefficients for the maximum R-2, and number of accumulated months to the maximum R-2 were mapped for each month of the year for F-PV and F-NPV. Behaviour of responses in relation to land use, land cover, and soil water holding capacity was analysed based on pixel frequencies of classes at sub-region scale in the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation of Australia. The analysis showed that F-PV is largely dependent upon AAP in the preceding 12 months, however responses to longer periods of AAP also occur in specific land use-vegetation type combinations. The study also showed that positive responses in F-NPV could be driven by AAP from as much as 60 months, but that F-NPV is reduced in many areas in response to increased AAP. The presence or absence of domesticated livestock grazing as defined by Australian land use mapping was a major influence on response to AAP of both F-PV and F-NPV with statistical analysis indicating interactions between major natural vegetation type and grazing. In highly responsive areas (R-2 > 0.6) monitoring of land condition could be enhanced by testing of regional cover levels for major deviations from the long terms responses that might suggest land management concerns.', '[Guerschman, Juan P.; Hill, Michael J.] CSIRO Land & Water, Black Mt, ACT 2601, Australia.

Previous modelling research indicated that the resulting Landsat 5 overpass time and so acquisition solar zenith differences will have caused non-negligible reflectance and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) temporal differences. Rather than use a modelling approach this paper presents the results of a comprehensive examination of the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data. Ten years of summer Landsat 5 TM Analysis Ready Data (ARD) sampled at >19.3 million 30 m pixel locations across the conterminous United States (CONUS) are considered. The acquisition solar zenith, red, near infrared (NIR), shortwave infrared (SWIR) (similar to 2.1 mu m) surface reflectance, and NDVI, are compared between five consecutive periods (1995 versus 2006, 1996 versus 2007, 1997 versus 2008, 1998 versus 2009, and 1999 versus 2010) that span years with very different Landsat 5 overpass times, and are also compared between 1998 and 1999 that have similar overpass times. The different years of Landsat 5 TM data are plotted against each other and reduced major axis (RMA) regressions passing though the origin are developed and compared with the acquisition solar geometry changes. The red, SWIR and NDVI RMA slopes are proportional to the magnitude of solar zenith change between years and are indicative of CONUS-wide differences due to orbit drift. The greatest differences occurred between 1995 and 2006, the years with the greatest solar zenith differences (median CONUS difference 8.43 degrees) with RMA regression slopes quite far from unity (1.14 for the red and SWIR bands, 0.91 for NDVI). In years with smaller solar zenith differences the RMA slopes are closer to unity. As agricultural crops may be managed inconsistently through time, and as drought may have pronounced effects on reflectance, the analysis is also undertaken masking out crop pixels and considering locations that have similar precipitation and evapotranspiration conditions between years. These experiments indicate that, at CONUS scale, the cause of the changing RMA regression slopes between years is not due to agricultural changes or to the influence of above normal drought or wetness. The results confirm previous published modelling based findings but are based on direct examination of CONUS Landsat 5 TM data. They indicate that certain research and applications that require temporally consistent red, SWIR and NDVI data may need to take Landsat 5 orbit drift effects into account.', '[Roy, David P.; Li, Zhongbin; Huang, Haiyan] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.

Land Surface Phenology (LSP) derived from satellite imagery is useful to estimate the phenological responses of vegetation to climate variability and inform terrestrial ecosystem models at landscape to global scales. However, there is a large (and unquantified) uncertainty in estimated phenological dates due to the relatively coarse temporal resolution of typical data and methodological limitations. To assess responses of phenology and related ecological function and services, it is essential to decrease the temporal uncertainty of estimated phenological processes. In this study, we developed a new LSP estimation method using linear change point models to determine four phenological transitions using twice-daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from 2000 to 2015. We evaluated the approach using long-term phenological ground observations and compare performance of four LSP estimations generated from two data sources (i.e. 8-day and twice daily EVI time series) and two methods (i.e. double logistic and change point estimation). We found that the LSP generated from change point estimation with twice daily EVI time series had the highest accuracy (i.e. lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), mean bias, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)) for both spring and fall phenology evaluated by Harvard Forest phenology observations and a large citizen science database of phenological observations from the National Phenology Network. For example, change point estimation reduced the estimation error for fall senescence date from over 40 days in the standard MODIS phenology product (version 005) to 11.5-24 days of RMSE, -2.6 to -5.8 days of mean bias, and 7.9-20.1 days of MAE. The change point methodology also enables calculation of additional metrics to describe the biophysical process of vegetation, including rates of greenup, green-down, and senescence, EVI values at each phenological transition, and the estimation uncertainties for each transition date. Our LSP estimations will improve more comprehensive investigations of landscape phenology of deciduous forest and the associated ecosystem processes at regional to global scales.', '[Xie, Yingying; Wilson, Adam M.] Univ Buffalo, Dept Geog, 105 Wilkeson Quadrangle, Buffalo, NY 14261 USA.

Those images are one of the most valuable Earth Observation resources for local, regional and global land surface monitoring and study due to their moderate spatial resolution and rich spectral information. However, their applications are impeded largely by their relatively low revisit frequency and cloud contamination on images. In order to improve their usability, a number of studies have been conducted to blend Landsat images with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images to take merits of the two sensors. All blending models reported that they can predict synthetic Landsat images with various degrees of accuracy. However, only a couple of models reported that they can explicitly estimate uncertainty for their blended images.   In this study, we propose a new surface reflectance blending model based on a Kalman Filter algorithm (Kalman Filter Reflectance Fusion Model - KFRFM) to predict time-series synthetic Landsat images from Landsat and MODIS images, and simultaneously to estimate uncertainty of the predicted synthetic images to quantify the quality of the synthetic images. Using the model, we predicted a time-series of 38 synthetic Landsat images with a temporal interval of 4 days for a vegetation growing season spanning about 6 months from Nadir Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function adjusted MODIS product (MCD43A4), and their corresponding uncertainties. From this time-series, we calculated five vegetation indices involving all the spectral bands of the synthetic images, and compared them to those from Landsat observations. The results demonstrated that the proposed method is able to produce high quality synthetic Landsat images to meet various application demands for higher spatial and temporal resolution images. Uncertainty analysis reveals that cropland has the largest uncertainty followed by grassland while forests have the smallest uncertainties among the seven vegetation land cover types of the study area. For performance evaluation, we compared KFRFM to several published models. The comparison results reveal that KFRFM performs the best based on the assessed image quality indices.', '[Zhou, Fuqun; Zhong, Detang] Nat Resources Canada, Canada Ctr Remote Sensing, Canada Ctr Mapping & Earth Observat, 6th Floor,560 Rochester St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0E4, Canada.', 'Natural Resources Canada; Strategic Policy & Results Sector - Natural   Resources Canada; Canada Centre for Mapping & Earth Observation (CCMEO)RP Zhou, FQ (通讯作者)，Nat Resources Canada, Canada Ctr Remote Sensing, Canada Ctr Mapping & Earth Observat, 6th Floor,560 Rochester St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0E4, Canada.', 'fuqun.zhou@canada.ca; detang.zhong@canada.ca', 'Zhong, Detang/0000-0002-2438-493X', 'Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Space Agency\'s GRIP program', 'This study is a part of the research and development project \"Big Data   Analytics of Earth Observation Data in Support of Evidence-Based   Decision Making for Climate Change\" funded by Natural Resources Canada   and Canadian Space Agency\'s GRIP program.', 53, 22, 23, 5, 33, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Of importance to the success of REDD+ and similar initiatives is the provision of credible evidence of reductions in the extent of land change activities that release carbon to the atmosphere (e.g. deforestation). The criteria for reporting land change areas and associated emissions within REDD+ stipulate the use of sampling-based approaches, which allow for unbiased estimation and uncertainty quantification. But for economic compensation for emission reductions to be feasible, agreements between participating countries and donors often require reporting every year or every second year. With the rates of land change typically being very small relative to the total study area, sampling-based approaches for estimation of annual or bi-annual areas have proven problematic, especially when comparing area estimates over time. In this paper, we present a methodology for monitoring and estimating areas of land change activity at high temporal resolution that is compliant with international guidelines. The methodology is based on a break detection algorithm applied to time series of Landsat data in the Colombian Amazon between 2001 and 2016. A biennial stratified sampling approach was implemented to (1) remove the bias introduced by the change detection and classification algorithm in mapped areas derived from pixel-counting; and (2) provide confidence intervals for area estimates obtained from the reference data collected for the sample. Our results show that estimating the area of land change, like deforestation, at annual or bi-annual resolution is inherently challenging and associated with high degrees of uncertainty. We found that better precision was achieved if independent sample datasets of reference observations were collected for each time interval for which area estimates are required. The alternative of selecting one sample of continuous reference observations analyzed for inference of area for each time interval did not yield area estimates significantly different from zero. Also, when large stable land covers (primary forest in this case, occupying almost 90% of the study area) are present in the study area in combination with small rates of land change activity, the impact of omission errors in the map used for stratifying the study area will be substantial and potentially detrimental to usefulness of land change studies. The introduction of a buffer stratum around areas of mapped land change reduced the uncertainty in area estimates by up to 98%. Results indicate that the Colombian Amazon has experienced a small but steady decrease in primary forest due to establishment of pastures, with forest-to-pasture conversion reaching 103 +/- 30 kha (95% confidence interval) in the period between 2013 and 2015, corresponding to 0.22% of the study area. Around 29 +/- 17 kha (95% CI) of pastureland that had been abandoned shortly after establishment reverted to secondary forest within the same period. Other gains of secondary forest from more permanent pastures averaged about 12 +/- 11 kha (95% CI), while losses of secondary forest averaged 20 +/- 12 kha (95% CI).', '[Arevalo, Paulo; Olofsson, Pontus; Woodcock, Curtis E.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, 685 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.', 'Boston UniversityRP Arévalo, P (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, 685 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.', 'parevalo@bu.eduRI Woodcock, Curtis/Y-2478-2019; Arévalo, Paulo/AAC-9944-2020', 'Woodcock, Curtis/0000-0001-7860-6254; Arévalo, Paulo/0000-0001-7566-7561', 'NASA Carbon Monitoring System (CSM) [NNX16AP26G]; SilvaCarbon Research   grant [14-DG-11132762-347]; USGS/NASA Landsat Science Team grant; NASA   [897337, NNX16AP26G] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER', 'This study was funded by NASA Carbon Monitoring System (CSM) grant   NNX16AP26G (PI: Olofsson), SilvaCarbon Research grant 14-DG-11132762-347   (PI: Olofsson) and USGS/NASA Landsat Science Team grant (PI: Woodcock).

Time series model of each pixel was first estimated based on clear Landsat observations between 2000 and 2014, and any land surface change was detected by the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm. These coefficients and Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) of the estimated time series models were then employed as the inputs of random forest regressor. A few experiments with different combinations of variables and bands were explored to better construct random forest regression models. We successfully applied this algorithm to map subpixel urban impervious surface area (ISA%) and characterize its dynamics in Broome County, New York. Several conclusions can be drawn from the results and analyses. First, the integration of subpixel mapping technique and time series analysis in CSM can yield a relatively satisfactory ISA% result at one point in time. With higher precision and smaller bias, its mapping accuracy is better than that of National Land Cover Database (NLCD) percent developed imperviousness product, without using extensive auxiliary data, such as nighttime light image and transportation network. Second, the ISA% change of any time interval can be easily derived and detected by CSM with relatively high accuracy, which have the potential to generate sub-annual ISA% change products. Furthermore, this approach can detect not only urban expansion/intensification (ISA% gain), but also different patterns of urban transitions overtime, such as urban demolition/redevelopment to vegetation (ISA% loss), and surface modifications (no mechanical change). Finally, CSM works well in one of the cloudiest regions in the United States. This algorithm could provide a new direction to map and monitor percent urban impervious surface change in a reliable and efficient way, which also has the potential to apply to other land cover types (e.g., tree, shrub, and barren lands) at the subpixel level.', '[Deng, Chengbin] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Geog, POB 6000, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.

It is also the primary agricultural production area in the country. Groundwater levels in some regions of the valley have decreased by > 15m in the last five years. Water use estimates at the regional and the field scale for this valley are crucial for enhancing resilience and for managing competing sectorial water demands. In this research, we derive a novel time series of field-scale actual evapotranspiration for the Bekaa Valley using two one-source energy balance models for the period 1984-2017, utilizing local weather data and all available original Level 1 Landsat thermal imagery and Level 2 surface reflectance products. We compare a modified METRIC model with an automated hot and cold pixel identification procedure run in batch mode to pySEBAL, a new version of SEBAL, which also has its automated anchors pixel selection algorithm. Analysis of 1200 cloud-masked and gap-filled Landsat-derived ET products show that the two models give comparable water use estimates at the seasonal and annual time steps. We estimate an average annual ET of 652 +/- 53mm (or 800 mcm) over the heavily cultivated valley in the last 34 years (with high agreement between both METRIC and pySEBAL models). Most (64%) of the ET is consumed from blue water in the dry season of May-October. ET in the wet season of November-April consumes > 70% of the precipitation in the Bekaa valley. Annual analysis shows no discernable trend in ET across the valley, but there is an increase in irrigated agriculture in the Orontes Basin in the last five years. METRIC yields 15% higher ET than pySEBAL for the non-agricultural lands in summer. A water balance analysis shows that groundwater storage in the Litani basin is decreasing at a rate of 330 +/- 50 mm yr(-1).

Sentinel-3 is the first radar altimetry mission operating with a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) altimeter at global scale and with a new on-board tracking system (i.e. open-loop), which has great potential in terms of delivering reliable observations of inland water bodies for the next two decades (several future missions include an open-loop tracking mode). In this context, it is very important to investigate the data quality at an early stage. In this study, a comprehensive evaluation of Sentinel-3A (S3A) is conducted at 50 virtual stations (VS) located on a wide range of rivers in China.   The evaluation of Level 1 data shows that, over mountain rivers, a good prior surface elevation estimate on-board is vital to deliver useful datasets using the S3A open-loop tracking system. The Open-Loop Tracking Command version 5 (OLTC V5) has significantly improved the placement of the range window, which was misplaced and resulted in lack of data over many mountain rivers prior to OLTC V5 (March 2019). However, application of S3A over mountain rivers still requires careful evaluation, especially before March 2019.   Four retrackers are evaluated including a physical SAR Altimetry Mode Studies and Applications retracker (SAMOSA+), a traditional Offset Center Of Gravity (OCOG), a Primary Peak Center Of Gravity (PPCOG), and a modified Multiple Waveform Persistent Peak (MWaPP+) retracker. For 26 VSs in plain areas, retracked WSE data achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.12 m to 0.9 m. The comparison of retracking methods reveals that SAMOSA+, OCOG, and PPCOG are unable to handle multi-peak waveforms. But the MWaPP+ can significantly improve the accuracy of the estimated WSE over large rivers, especially when the waveforms are contaminated.   Moreover, our result shows no considerable difference between medium (ca. 300 m wide) and large (wider than 500 m) rivers. Instead, surrounding topography and homogeneity of surroundings are very important factors influencing the shape of a waveform. For rivers surrounded by lakes, man-made channels etc., special care must be taken when processing altimetry data. Dedicated retracking methods, such as MWaPP+, and sophisticated methods for outlier detection are needed to improve precision over such rivers, as demonstrated here for the Yangtze River.', '[Jiang, Liguang; Bauer-Gottwein, Peter] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.

Nearly all past studies using spaceborne FT retrievals have focused on characterizing FT specifically for natural environments. FT in the built environment is also routinely studied and a topic of great interest, especially with regards to transportation infrastructure. Whereas natural FT process are frequently investigated using spaceborne observations, FT studies of roads are often limited to local scales, using in situ or nearby weather station data only. Comparisons between FT retrievals obtained from NASA\'s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite and roads in Alaska (AK) and the Contiguous United States (CONUS) showed that spaceborne FT retrievals had good agreement with road data. But those results also indicated that NASA FT retrievals in CONUS were relatively too warm compared to road data. If SMAP FT retrievals were to be used for identifying FT transition timing for applications by the transportation community, it is also important for frozen conditions to be identified more accurately. This work is primarily concerned with improving frozen retrievals made in CONUS by calculating new Normalized Polarization Ratio (NPR) thresholds as compared to those currently used in SMAP FT. We found that focusing on a temporal subset of October through May for comparisons greatly improved the correlation between NPR and effective soil temperature (T-eff, one of SMAP\'s ancillary datasets), often from about zero to 0.6. We then applied linear regression between NPR and T-eff to obtain new NPR thresholds resulting in the FT-Roads (FT-R) product. NASA FT and FT-R were evaluated against road data at about 1000 locations in CONUS and a battery of different tests indicated that FT-R performed better under nearly all conditions compared to NASA FT. Overall, NASA FT accuracies were 69% and 80% for 6 am and 6 pm SMAP retrievals, while FT-R achieved accuracies of 79% and 82%. We also investigated the potential for using T-eff for road FT (6 am, only) and found that those comparisons were even more accurate (84%). We\'ve also quantified inter- and intraregional differences of SMAP FT performance and found that accuracy metrics vary over twice as much between geographic subdivisions (9%) as compared to between the states within a subdivision (4%). Most importantly, the main goal of improving the detection of in situ frozen conditions in CONUS was realized, with FT-R accurately detecting frozen conditions > 50% more frequently than NASA FT.', '[Kraatz, Simon; Jacobs, Jennifer M.; Schroder, Ronny; Cho, Eunsang] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Durham, NH 03824 USA.

Early quantification of crop lodging is important to prevent further losses and to facilitate harvesting operations. Crop angle of inclination (CAI) is a quantitative measure of the lodging stage and a component of lodging severity/score. CAI is an important structural parameter for lodged crops and very few studies have investigated its estimation using satellite-based remote sensing. In this study, the performance of Sentinel-1 and multi-incidence angle (FQ8-27 degrees and FQ21-41 degrees) RADARSAT-2 data were investigated for estimating CAI. Temporal crop biophysical/structural parameters (CAI and crop height) and meteorological data (rainfall and wind speed) were collected throughout May 1-June 30, 2018 in a very large commercial farm located in Jolanda di Savoia, Ferrara, Italy. Field data were grouped into different crop lodging stages (non-lodged/healthy (H), moderate lodging (ML), severe lodging (SL) and very severe lodging (VSL)) based on CAI. Quantitative relationships were established between field-measured CAI values and the RS-derived metrics for Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT-2 timeseries using support vector regression (SVR) models. The RADARSAT-2 FQ8 model performed most robustly with a R-CV(2) (cross-validated R-2) of 0.87 and a RMSECV(cross-validated RMSE) of 8.89 degrees while the performance of the Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT-2 FQ21 models were comparable with an RMSECV of 11.35 degrees and 11.63 degrees respectively. Low incidence angle data were particularly sensitive to high CAI values (VSL) while high incidence angle data were useful for predicting lower CAI (ML and SL). While the RADARSAT-2 FQ-8 model outperformed the other two, the Sentinel-1 model still explained 78% of the CAI variability in the study site, which is important in the context of operational crop lodging stage assessment.

With the advancement in satellite imagery as well as cloud storage and computing, the capability now exists to conduct planetary-scale analysis, including mapping of rangeland indicators. Combined with recent investments in the collection of large amounts of in situ data in the western U.S., new approaches using machine learning can enable prediction of surface conditions at times and places when no in situ data are available. However, little analysis has yet been done on how the temporal relevancy of training data influences model performance. Here, we have leveraged the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and a machine learning algorithm (Random Forest, after comparison with other candidates) to identify the potential impact of different sampling times (across months and years) on estimation of rangeland indicators from the Bureau of Land Management\'s (BLM) Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) and Landscape Monitoring Framework (LMF) programs. Our results indicate that temporally relevant training data improves predictions, though the training data need not be from the exact same month and year for a prediction to be temporally relevant. Moreover, inclusion of training data from the time when predictions are desired leads to lower prediction error but the addition of training data from other times does not contribute to overall model error. Using all of the available training data can lead to biases, toward the mean, for times when indicator values are especially high or low. However, for mapping purposes, limiting training data to just the time when predictions are desired can lead to poor predictions of values outside the spatial range of the training data for that period. We conclude that the best Random Forest prediction maps will use training data from all possible times with the understanding that estimates at the extremes will be biased.', '[Zhou, Bo; Okin, Gregory S.; Zhang, Junzhe] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, 1255 Bunche Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.', 'University of California System; University of California Los AngelesRP Zhou, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, 1255 Bunche Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.', 'bodacious@ucla.eduRI Zhou, Bo/AAE-5154-2021; Okin, Greg/D-3226-2019', 'Zhou, Bo/0000-0002-4331-3811; ', 'NASA [NNX17AG50G]', 'This work was funded by NASA grant NNX17AG50G.

To make full use of the information contained in vegetation spectra, however, hyperspectral observations should be used in combination with appropriate multivariate methods. Nevertheless, only very few previous studies attempted to estimate GPP directly from hyperspectral observations and did so on the basis of reflectance, with only a limited number of temporally discontinuous observations. In this study, we used long-term, continuous, half-hourly hyperspectral observations covering the visible and near-infrared spectral range to estimate GPP directly from upwelling irradiance using partial least square (PLS) regression in a rice paddy. To gain a better understanding of processes underlying the PLS estimation, we used extensive complementary field observations to run process-based simulations using the SCOPE model. We then applied PLS regression to the simulated hyperspectral data in the same way as for the observations and disentangled contributions related to relevant physiological processes, namely sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and xanthophyll cycle-related spectral changes (XC). We found that upwelling hyperspectral irradiance in the visible and near-infrared spectral range predicted GPP better than reflectance. Furthermore, PLS-based GPP estimates outperformed both far-red SIF and widely used vegetation index-based methods. However, the most relevant information for the observation-based PLS-models was not clearly related to XC or SIF as the near-infrared spectral range showed comparable performance. Also, the simple average of upwelling irradiance over the 850-900 nm range outperformed the other non-multivariate approaches, including far-red SIF. These results held for the evaluation in terms of the seasonal variation of GPP, while there was apparently a small contribution of SIF and XC for the diurnal variation. The simulation-based analysis showed that SIF and XC contributed useful information to both GPP and photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE) estimates at both seasonal and diurnal time scales. The strongest unique contribution from either SIF or XC, however, was to the diurnal variation of GPP and XC showed considerably better performance than SIF. We did not find improvements when combining the spectral regions of XC (500-570 nm) and SIF (650-800 nm) to estimate GPP. While SIF showed improvements when combined with the remaining spectral information excluding XC, this was not the case for XC. Our approach combines the strengths of process-based modeling with multivariate statistical analysis to improve our understanding of the usable information content in vegetation spectra and is highly relevant for further developing suitable methods for GPP estimation at large scales.', '[Dechant, Benjamin; Ryu, Youngryel] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Rural Syst Engn, Seoul 151921, South Korea.

To estimate supraglacial lake volumes, multi-temporal lake maps derived from Landsat-8 images are intersected with dry lake-bed topographic depressions (showing lake bathymetry) identified for two supraglacial catchments (similar to 10 km(2)) in southwestern GrIS, using high-resolution (2 m) ArcticDEMs. Intersecting remotely sensed lake shorelines with their underlying ice surface topography yields multi-temporal lake volume changes, which are then compared with cumulative runoff as simulated by four Surface Mass Balance (SMB) models (HIRHAM5, MAR3.6, RACMO2.3, and MERRA-2). Comparison of cumulative lake infilling with SMB simulations for these two lakes over the period 8-31 July 2015 indicates that SMB models overestimated surface runoff by 106 - 123%. These large offsets improved after early July, overestimating runoff by 40 - 55%. The runoff delay function incorporated into the MAR3.6 model improves simulation of early melt season runoff, signifying the importance of integrating meltwater routing schemes into SMB models for improved understanding of Greenland supraglacial hydrology and surface mass balance.', '[Yang, Kang; Lu, Yao; Li, Manchun] Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

Impervious surfaces have altered urban hydrological process, spatial and temporal distribution of water resources and water environment quality and led to increasing frequency and intensity of urban waterlogging. In view of the impact of the increase of impervious surface on urban hydrological environment, there are two problems in current research and application: (1) urban hydrological modeling and impermeability ratio are computed according to multi-level administrative units rather than watersheds; (2) the entire urban hydrological environment is an organic whole, but the urban watersheds system within a city have not been monitored dynamically by considering adjacent watersheds. In view of these two problems, the main innovative points in this research work include (1) first, urban multi-scale watersheds are defined, and impermeability ratios are calculated at multi-scale watersheds level for urban hydrological modeling. (2) Based on urban DEM analysis, considering the interconnection of multiple urban water systems by calculating the dynamic impermeability ratios, the dynamic impact of urban rainfall and runoff changes on the whole urban hydrological environment is monitored. The results show overall impervious surface ratio of each watershed is proportional to the runoff. The ratio of the impervious surface reaches 20%, and the discharge is more than twice that when impervious ratio is 4%. It can be concluded that at watershed level a higher the degree of urbanization can lead to a larger change in the total run off, and the earlier shift of the peak flow.', '[Shao, Zhenfeng; Fu, Huyan; Li, Deren; Cheng, Tao] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.

While the temporal variation of CI has been investigated in many field studies, there has not been a global CI product that captured its seasonal and inter-annual variations. In this study, a look-up table (LUT) method was developed based on an improved Normalized Difference between Hotspot and Darkspot (NDHD) method to estimate the daily CI from the MODIS V006 MCD43 BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function) product. This new CI product is consistent with field measurements at 33 sites distributed globally (R-2 = 0.38, RMSE = 0.04, and bias = -0.01). CI shows stronger seasonal variations for deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF) and mixed forests than other vegetation types. The large seasonal differences between evergreen and deciduous vegetation, especially for DBF and deciduous shrubs, allow the CI to be used to detect seasonal structural changes and classify vegetation. The global CI shows a negative correlation to the leaf area index (LAI) for all land cover types, especially forests. The global CI demonstrates an inter annual variation that correlated with global precipitation (R-2 = 0.34). In addition, the global CI shows a global decreasing trend from 2001 to 2017 (-0.007/decade) that was consistent with the increasing LAI (0.049/decade).

Most studies established LCC predictive models with either integrating sphere measured directional-hemispherical reflectance factor (DHRF) spectra or leaf clip measured bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) spectra. Given the effect of specular reflection on leaf reflectance, it remains unclear how DHRF spectra differ from the corresponding BRF spectra and whether the derived predictive models could be transferred between these two types of spectral data. To fill the gap in spectral examination and model comparison, this study aimed to examine the effect of specular reflection on leaf reflectance properties, the commonly used spectral indices or indicators, and the derived regression models across a broad variety of leaf DHRF and BRF spectra. Specifically, we quantified the difference between leaf BRF and DHRF spectra measurements and evaluated the effect of specular reflection on the estimation of LCC with 20 spectral features in four categories (simple ratio, SR; modified SR, mSR; double difference index, DD and red edge position, REP). Seven measured datasets collected from a combination of species, growing conditions, sites, and years were used to evaluate the model difference and calibrate the unified models across DHRF and BRF spectra. The robustness of those predictive models was validated with independent measured and simulated datasets comprised of both BRF and DHRF spectra.   Our results demonstrated that the BRF spectra exhibited systematically higher amplitude than DHRF spectra. The widely used vegetation indices (VIs) in the SR category exhibited the most noticeable sensitivity to specular reflection as a significant proportion in BRF spectra. The adverse effect of specular reflection can be alleviated by the other three categories to different extents. With further assessment of model comparisons, we determined four unified models from the pooled data with two DD indices and two REP metrics. Application of the unified models to the validation spectra yielded low RMSE values up to 4.5 mu g/cm(2) and would not result in a significant loss in accuracy as compared to the BRF-specific or DHRF-specific LCC predictive models derived from the four spectral features. The assessment of unified models with comprehensive measured and simulated data could help us better understand the mechanism underlying the specular reflection effect on the relationship of LCC with sensitive spectral features. It will also facilitate the direct estimation of LCC with the common types of leaf reflectance spectra, which is beneficial to rapid and non-destructive determination of LCC for the plant science and agronomy communities.', '[Li, Dong; Tian, Long; Wan, Zefu; Jia, Min; Yao, Xia; Tian, Yongchao; Zhu, Yan; Cao, Weixing; Cheng, Tao] Nanjing Agr Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab Informat Agr, MARA Key Lab Crop Syst Anal & Decis Making, NETCIA, One Weigang, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.', 'Nanjing Agricultural UniversityRP Cao, WX; Cheng, T (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab Informat Agr, MARA Key Lab Crop Syst Anal & Decis Making, NETCIA, One Weigang, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.', 'caow@njau.edu.cn; tcheng@njau.edu.cnRI Zhu, Yan/AAK-6927-2020; Li, Dong/GWN-0268-2022; Cheng, Tao/B-4807-2010', 'Zhu, Yan/0000-0002-8912-3888; Li, Dong/0000-0002-3897-7322; Cheng,   Tao/0000-0002-4184-0730', 'National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFD0300601]; National   Natural Science Foundation of China [41871259, 31470084, 31725020];   Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [KYLH201603];   Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Modern Crop Production;   Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions   (PAPD)', 'This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development   Program (2016YFD0300601), the National Natural Science Foundation of   China (41871259, 31470084, 31725020), the Fundamental Research Funds for   the Central Universities (KYLH201603), Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation   Center for Modern Crop Production, and the Academic Program Development   of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).

Biodiversity loss endangers essential ecosystem services and risks unacceptable environmental consequences. Global biodiversity observations are needed to provide a better understanding of the distribution of biodiversity, to better identify high priority areas for conservation and to help maintain essential ecosystem goods and services. Traditional in situ biodiversity monitoring is limited in time and space and is usually a costly and time-consuming enterprise. Remote sensing can provide data over a large area in a consistent, objective manner and has been used to detect plant biodiversity in a range of ecosystems, typically based on relating spectral properties to the distribution of habitat, species or functional groups. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of methods using imaging spectroscopy to assess biodiversity via plant traits or spectral information content. However, questions regarding the complex drivers of plant optical properties and the scale dependence of spectral diversity biodiversity relationship confound diversity monitoring using remote sensing and must first be better understood before these methods can be operationally applied. To address some of these topics, we (1) review the history of remote sensing approaches in biodiversity estimation, summarizing the pros and cons of different methods, (2) illustrate successes and major gaps of remote sensing of biodiversity, and (3) identify promising future directions. We focus on emerging methods using spectral diversity (optical diversity) as a proxy for terrestrial plant diversity that offer to revolutionize the study of diversity in its different dimensions (phylogenetic, taxonomic, and functional diversity) from remote sensing. We also discuss remaining knowledge gaps and ways spectral diversity might be effectively integrated into a global biodiversity monitoring system, bridging a gap between ecology and remote sensing.', '[Wang, Ran; Gamon, John A.] Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada.

By integrating fine spatial resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data and multi-temporal (2009-2017) aerial images, we developed a fully automated approach to delineate wetland inundation extent at watershed scales using Google Earth Engine. Machine learning algorithms were used to classify aerial imagery with additional spectral indices to extract potential wetland inundation areas, which were further refined using LiDAR-derived landform depressions. The wetland delineation results were then compared to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) geospatial dataset and existing global-scale surface water products to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. We tested the workflow on 26 watersheds with a total area of 16,576 km(2) in the Prairie Pothole Region. The results showed that the proposed method can not only delineate current wetland inundation status but also demonstrate wetland hydrological dynamics, such as wetland coalescence through fill-spill hydrological processes. Our automated algorithm provides a practical, reproducible, and scalable framework, which can be easily adapted to delineate wetland inundation dynamics at broad geographic scales.', '[Wu, Qiusheng] Univ Tennessee, Dept Geog, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.

To encourage the use of the C6 MODIS LST product in a wide range of applications, it is necessary to evaluate the accuracy of the C6 MODIS LST product. In this study, we validated the C6 MODIS LST product using temperature-based method over various land cover types, including grasslands, croplands, cropland/natural vegetation mosaic, open shrublands, woody savannas, and barren/sparsely vegetated. In situ measurements were collected from various sites under different atmospheric and surface conditions, including seven SURFRAD sites (BND, TBL, DRA, FPK, GCM, PSU, and SXF) in the United States, three KIT sites (EVO, KAL, and GBB) in Portugal and Namibia, and three HiWATER sites (GBZ, HZZ, and HMZ) in China. The spatial representativeness of the in situ measurements at each site was separately evaluated during daytime and nighttime using all available clear-sky ASTER LST products at 90 m spatial resolution. Only six sites during daytime are selected as sufficiently homogeneous sites despite the usually high spatial thermal heterogeneity, whereas during nighttime most sites can be considered to be thermally homogeneous and have similar LST and air temperature. The C6 MODIS LST product was validated using in situ measurements from the selected homogeneous sites during daytime and nighttime: except for the GBB site, large RMSE values ( > 2 K) were obtained during daytime. However, if only satellite LST with a high spatial thermal homogeneity on the MODIS pixel scale are used for LST validation, the best daytime accuracy (RMSE < 1.3 K) for the C6 MODIS LST product is achieved over the BND and DRA sites. Except for the DRA site, the RMSE values during nighttime are < 2 K at the selected homogeneous sites. Furthermore, the accuracy of the C6 MODIS LST product was compared with that of the C5 MODIS LST product during nighttime at the selected homogeneous sites.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as an emerging RS technique, significantly improves the spatial resolution, but has not been used for individual mangrove analysis. This study presents the first investigation into the possibility of individual tree detection and delineation (ITDD) for mangroves using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data (91 pt./m(2)) collected from UAV. Specifically, we aim to detect and measure tree height (TH) and crown diameter (CD) of each mangrove tree, and analyze the impact of crown clumping density and spatial resolution on mangrove ITDD. To this end, we combined the variable window filtering method and marker controlled watershed segmentation algorithm, and successfully delineated 46.0% of the 126 field measured mangroves. This was promising considering the complexity of mangrove forest. TH and CD were estimated with higher accuracies than previous studies. The isolated trees, with the lowest clumping density, were delineated with the highest accuracy. To identify the optimal spatial resolution of canopy height model (CHM), we defined four spatial resolutions (0.1 m, 0.25 m, 0.5 m, and 1 m) and conducted a simulation. Based on the results, we propose a rule-of thumb that the spatial resolution should be finer than one-fourth of CD for ITDD, which is also applicable to other forest types. The main difficulty for mangrove ITDD is an overall under-detection of trees, which is caused by the high clumping density and limited height difference between adjacent mangroves. We recommend combining UAV LiDAR with imagery and terrestrial LiDAR to improve the mangrove ITDD performance.', '[Yin, Dameng] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Resources Environm & Tourism, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.

Accuracy characterization in change categorization is more complicated than that in single-date classifications, especially when pursued at a local or per-pixel basis. In this paper, reference sample data consisting of reference class labels at sample locations are referred to as (model) training and validation sample data, respectively, when they are used for building and testing predictive models of local accuracy. They are preferably collocated to verify land cover and change types at the same locations across multiple single-date classifications. With collocated training data, methods devised for local accuracy mapping were usually implemented as direct extensions to those designed for accuracy predictions in single-date land cover maps, given that both response and explanatory variables are defined properly based on change maps. However, alternative methods are required when collocated training sample data are unavailable or sparse but non-collocated data collected at sample units not aligned across time exist or can be made available more conveniently and flexibly. This is typically the case for change-classification accuracy analyses, whereby prior sampling design and sample data may not remain informative in time but can be made adaptive by restructuring and augmentation to better represent strata of transitions as well as persistence. Such adaptability leads to great cost-saving in sampling than undertaking collocated sampling anew each time performing or revising accuracy mapping for a specific change analysis over a particular period. With a coherent review of related research, this paper proposes a geostatistical method for predictive mapping of local accuracies in any land-cover change maps created properly through adaptive use of complexly configured training sample data. This method works on a functional relation between accuracies in change-categorization and single-date classifications whereby temporal correlation (cross-correlation) between bi-temporal classification correctness is accommodated. In this cross-correlation-adjusted product method (named PXCOV), quantification of single-date classification accuracies is based on logistic regression. Cross correlation is estimated via cross-validation cokriging through exploiting a useful relation between traditional and pseudo cross-variograms in the absence of collocated sample data or calculated more easily on the basis of collocated sample data if available. Studies were undertaken to test this method and compare it with direct logistic-regression-kriging (named LogRK direct), its simpler version, direct logistic regression without kriging (named LogR direct), and the baseline product method (named Product, being a simpler option of PXCOV without accounting for cross-correlation), using GlobeLand30 2000 and 2010 land cover at five sites in China. For each site, eleven training samples of equal sizes but differing configurations and one independent validation sample were collected. Logistic regression was performed on map class occurrence pattern indices quantified in size-optimized moving windows for mapping local accuracies in single-date classifications (as necessary intermediate steps in Product and PXCOV) and bi-temporal change-categorization (LogR direct and LogRK direct). In LogRK direct, geostatistical modeling and kriging were based on standardized residuals after logistic regression (based on change maps directly).   In PXCOV, cross-correlation between single-date classification correctness was estimated and accounted for properly, with their non-stationarity in change vs. no-change strata of sample pixels accommodated, after estimating aforementioned single-date local accuracies. Statistical testing of relative performances of alternative methods was undertaken based on validation samples for individual study sites. It was confirmed that the proposed method PXCOV is more accurate than LogR direct and LogRK direct when there are relatively few collocated sample pixels (i.e., the typical scenarios justifying use of PXCOV). PXCOV is generally more accurate than Product and should be pursued when enough collocated data are available for estimating cross-correlation, although Product is sometimes adequate for practical purposes. LogR direct is recommended over LogRK direct because collocated sample data are often sparse due to low sampling intensities as in large area applications. Therefore, as a method complementing LogR direct and similar methods, PXCOV facilitates adaptive use of training sample data of complex configurations for increased accuracy and efficiency in predictive mapping of local change-categorization accuracies.', '[Zhang, Jingxiong; Zhang, Wangle; Mei, Yingying; Yang, Wenjing] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing Informat Engn, Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geospatial Informat, Sch Geodesy & Geomat,Dept Sociol, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.', 'Wuhan UniversityRP Zhang, JX (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing Informat Engn, Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geospatial Informat, Sch Geodesy & Geomat,Dept Sociol, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.', 'jxzhang@whu.edu.cn; zhangwl@whu.edu.cn; myy2014@whu.edu.cn;   yangwj@whu.edu.cnRI Zhang, Wangle/B-6084-2018', 'Zhang, Wangle/0000-0002-9769-4277', 'National Natural Science Foundation of China [41471375]', 'This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of   China (grant no. 41471375).

As a result, the fully covered and unbiased PM2.5 estimates will be hard to generate. Among the current approaches to deal with the data gap issue, few have considered the cloud-AOD relationship and none of them have considered the snow-AOD relationship. This study examined the impacts of snow and cloud covers on AOD and PM2.5 and made full-coverage PM2.5 predictions with the consideration of these impacts. To estimate the missing AOD, daily gap-filling models with snow/cloud fractions and meteorological covariates were developed using the random forest algorithm. By using these models in New York State, a daily AOD data set with a 1-km resolution was generated with a complete coverage. The \"out-of-bag\" R-2 of the gap-filling models averaged 0.93 with an interquartile range from 0.90 to 0.95. Subsequently, a random forest-based PM2.5 prediction model with the gap-filled AOD and covariates was built to predict fully covered PM2.5 estimates. A ten-fold cross-validation for the prediction model showed a good performance with an R-2 of 0.82. In the gap-filling models, the snow fraction was of higher significance in the snow season compared with the rest of the year. The prediction models fitted with/without the snow fraction also suggested the discernible changes in PM2.5 patterns, further confirming the significance of this parameter. Compared with the methods without considering snow and cloud covers, our PM2.5 prediction surfaces showed more spatial details and reflected small-scale terrain-driven PM2.5 patterns. The proposed methods can be generalized to the areas with extensive snow/cloud covers and large proportions of missing satellite AOD for predicting PM2.5 levels with high resolutions and complete coverage.', '[Bi, Jianzhao; Belle, Jessica H.; Liu, Yang] Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.

Several areas in Tehran, the capital city and a provincial center in north-central Iran, have been reported to be subsiding at different rates. In this study, we present the results of an Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series analysis of Tehran using different SAR data between 2003 and 2017. By constructing more than 400 interferograms derived from 39 Envisat ASAR (C-band), 10 ALOS PALSAR (L-band), 48 TerraSAR-X (X-band), and 64 Sentinel-1 (C-band) SAR datasets, we compile displacement time series from interferometric observations using the Small Baseline (SB) technique. Our analysis identifies 3 distinct subsidence features in Tehran with rates exceeding 25 cm/yr in the western Tehran Plain, approximately 5 cm/yr in the immediate vicinity of Tehran international airport, and 22 cm/yr in the Varamin Plain to the southeast of Tehran city. The temporal pattern of land subsidence, which is dominated by a decreasing trend, generally follows the regional decline in groundwater level, which suggests that anthropogenic processes caused by excessive groundwater extraction are the primary cause of land subsidence. Integrating a decadal time series of subsidence constructed from multi-sensor InSAR with in-situ observations suggests that inelastic and permanent compaction dominates the main deformation regime of the Tehran aquifer, and the ratio between elastic and inelastic deformation is approximately 0.4. A geological analysis indicates that the shape of the subsidence bowl in the western Tehran Plain does not follow the trend of major mapped faults in the region. In contrast, the subsidence bowl in Varamin is controlled by the Pishva Fault, which suggests that either this fault acts as a hydrologic barrier to the groundwater flow in this region or that the differences in sediment thickness causes the discontinuity in land subsidence.', '[Haghighi, Mahmud Haghshenas; Motagh, Mahdi] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Dept Geodesy, Sect Remote Sensing, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.

To reduce computation time, current models work with schematic landscapes or with small-scale realistic scenes. The computer graphics community provides the most accurate and efficient models (known as renderers) but they were not designed specifically for performing scientific radiative transfer simulations. In this study, we propose LESS, a new 3D radiative transfer modeling framework. LESS employs a weighted forward photon tracing method to simulate multispectral bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) or flux-related data (e.g., downwelling radiation) and a backward path tracing method to generate sensor images (e.g., fisheye images) or large-scale (e.g. 1 km(2)) spectral images. The backward path tracing also has been extended to simulate thermal infrared radiation by using an on-the-fly computation of the sunlit and shaded scene components. This framework is achieved through the development of a user-friendly graphic user interface (GUI) and a set of tools to help construct the landscape and set parameters. The accuracy of LESS is evaluated with other models as well as field measurements in terms of directional BREs and pixel-wise simulated image comparisons, which shows very good agreement. LESS has the potential in simulating datasets of realistically reconstructed landscapes. Such simulated datasets can be used as benchmarks for various applications in remote sensing, forestry investigation and photogrammetry.', '[Qi, Jianbo; Xie, Donghui; Yan, Guangjian; Li, Linyuan; Zhang, Wuming; Mu, Xihan] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing Normal Univ & Inst Remote Sensing & Digit, Beijing Engn Res Ctr Global Land Remote Sensing P, Fac Geog Sci,State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.

Shape parameters were calculated from rock objects in segmented mineral maps. Object area, object perimeter, object hull perimeter and fitted ellipses were used to calculate shape parameters such as compactness, convexity and a cookie-cutter parameter. Shape parameters were used to describe a variety of microstructures and microstructural elements. The parameters were tested on microstructures in artificial imagery and subsequently applied to hyperspectral mineral maps of rocks.   Analyses of parameters calculated on artificial imagery showed that object shapes could be measured by the flattening of fitted ellipses as a measure of sphericity and elongation, together with the cookie-cutter parameters that measured angularity. Compactness and convexity could differentiate between euhedral, subhedral and anhedral crystal shapes. Aphanitic, phaneritic and porphyritic igneous microstructures could be identified and differentiated by homogeneity and relative object size parameters. The degree of sorting of sedimentary rocks was measured by the distribution of object sizes and statistical parameters describing the distribution. Orientation of single objects was measured by the angle between the major axis of a fitted ellipse and the vertical of the image. Preferred orientations in the rock microstructure were determined by calculation of a standardized resultant of orientation vectors and a mean angle. Layering and banding of the rock was identified by the length of major axes of fitted ellipses relative to the image dimension.   The shape parameters calculated on objects in segmented hyperspectral mineral maps of rock specimens were able to discriminate between sedimentary and volcanic microstructures using the size distribution of mineral objects, the presence of a preferred orientation of the rock and a layered microstructure. The volcanic microstructures could be differentiated by the size distribution of amygdales, phenocrysts and xenocrysts in the rock. Shape parameters could be used to differentiate between xenocrysts and phenocrysts, the latter being more elongated in the studied samples.   The study shows that object shape parameters can be used to measure microstructure and microstructural elements in mineral maps, and subsequently discriminate between different rock types and microstructures. The expression of microstructure into numeric parameters is a first step towards quantification of microstructures in mineral maps of rocks. Further development of the methodology could contribute to the creation of unbiased classification scheme of rocks, improved statistical modeling of compositional rock parameters such as mineral ore grades, and the automated recognition of microstructures in large image databases of rocks and drill-core.', '[van Ruitenbeek, F.

Misrepresentation of this phenomena results in uncertainties when inferring, for instance, surface soil moisture in retrieval algorithms that commonly utilize the tau-omega model which is most applicable for a weakly scattering medium. In this study, we investigate the degree to which multiple-scattering is prevalent over a range of land cover classifications (from lightly vegetated grasslands to dense forests) at the satellite scale by explicitly accounting for multiple-scattering in a first-order radiative transfer model, developed here. Even though the tau omega model with effective parameters can possibly capture higher-order scattering contributions, deliberately partitioning scattering into different components is required to estimate multiple-scattering properties. Specifically, we aim to determine how one can partition between zeroth and first-order radiative transfer terms within a retrieval algorithm without ancillary information, determine whether this method can detect first-order scattering at the SMAP measurement scale without ancillary information, and quantify the magnitude of detected scattering. A simplified first-order radiative transfer model which characterizes single interactions of microwaves with a scattering medium is developed for implementation within retrieval algorithms. This new emission model is implemented within a recently developed retrieval algorithm, the multi-temporal dual channel algorithm (MT-DCA), which does not require ancillary land use information. Scattering parameters as well as SM and vegetation optical depth (tau) are retrieved simultaneously in Africa and South America using the first year of SMAP brightness temperature measurements on a 36 km grid. Specifically, an introduced time invariant first-order scattering coefficient (omega(1)) is retrieved representing microwave emission interaction with the canopy. We find that omega(1) is typically zero in lightly vegetated biomes and non-zero (similar to 0.06) in 74% of the forest pixels. In forest-dominated pixels, the median first-order emissivity is 0.04, or about 4.3% of a given SMAP radiometer brightness temperature measurement. Additionally, explicitly accounting for first-order scattering terms in the radiative transfer model tends to increase SM and tau retrievals by a median of 0.02 m(3)/m(3) and 0.1, respectively, only in forested regions. This study demonstrates the first attempt to explicitly partition higher order scattering terms in a retrieval algorithm at a satellite scale and ultimately provides a fundamental understanding and quantification of multiple-scattering from grasslands to forests.', '[Feldman, Andrew F.; Akbar, Ruzbeh; Entekhabi, Dara] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.', 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)RP Feldman, AF (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.', 'afeld24@mit.eduRI Feldman, Andrew/AAM-9257-2020', 'Feldman, Andrew/0000-0003-1547-6995; Entekhabi, Dara/0000-0002-8362-4761', 'NASA [1510842]', '\"The authors thank Maria Piles for providing SMOS V620 optical depth   data for comparison.

We treat the sea ice-snow system as one layer with reduced density, which we approximate by means of a priori information about the snow depth to sea-ice thickness ratio. We derive this a priori information directly from ICESat total freeboard data using empirical equations relating in-situ measurements of total freeboard to snow depth or sea-ice thickness. We apply our new algorithm (one-layer method or OLM), which uses the buoyancy equation approach without the need for auxiliary snow depth data, to compute sea-ice thickness for every ICESat GLAS footprint from a valid total freeboard. An improved method for sea-ice volume retrieval is also used to derive ice volume at 6.25 km scale. Spatio-temporal variations of sea-ice thickness and volume are then analyzed in the circumpolar Antarctic as well as its six sea sectors: Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Weddell East, Weddell West, Bell-Amund Sea, and Ross Sea, under both interannual and seasonal scales.

Wet soils in fields of flowering canola are a concern with respect to the development of sclerotinia as this pathogen feeds on the petals of the canola flower. As such, determining if canola is in bloom during periods of high moisture is important in deciding whether to take action to mitigate this disease. In this paper, RADARSAT-2 quad polarization and TerraSAR-X dual polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data were used with a novel dynamic filtering framework to estimate canola growth stages. In this process, a new crop growth stage indicator was developed and SAR polarimetric parameters sensitive to changes in phenology were identified. Model development used multi-year SAR satellite and field data for one site in Manitoba, Canada. The crop growth estimator was then tested on unseen data from three sites, one in each of Canada\'s Prairie provinces. This independent validation established that the growth estimator was able to accurately determine canola growth stage and date of flowering with high accuracy.

Several baseflow estimation methods require river discharge measurements, which can be difficult to obtain at high spatio-temporal resolution for large basins. The future Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission will provide discharge estimations for large rivers ( > 50-100 m wide) even in ungauged basins. The frequency of these estimations depends mainly on latitude and ranges from zero to more than ten values in the 21-day satellite cycle. This work aims at answering the following question: can baseflow be estimated from SWOT observations during the mission lifetime? An algorithm based on hydrograph separation by Chapman\'s filter was developed to automatically estimate the baseflow in a river network at regional scale ( > 10 000 km(2)). The algorithm was applied to the Seine river basin (75 000 km(2), France) using the discharge time series simulated at daily time step by a coupled hydrological-hydrogeological model to obtain the reference baseflow estimations. The same algorithm is then forced with discharge time series sampled at SWOT observation frequency. The average baseflow is estimated with good accuracy for all the reaches which are observed at least once per cycle (relative bias less than 8%). The time evolution of baseflow is also rather well retrieved, with a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient above 0.7 for 96% of the network length. An analysis of the effect of SWOT discharge uncertainties on baseflow estimation shows that bias is the component of discharge error that most contributes to the error on baseflow. Anyway, when the combined effect of SWOT discharge sampling and SWOT discharge uncertainties is considered, the error on baseflow estimates is slightly smaller than that on discharge.

Yangon is a city on the periphery of the Irrawaddy delta in Myanmar where little is known about the true extent of this hazard, while its effects can potentially harm millions of its inhabitants. This research presents the magnitude and extent of the subsidence hazard in Yangon through a Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) time-series analysis on the Sentinel-1 data archives in the period of December 2015 through April 2017. The PSI analysis revealed four distinct zones of varying sizes where vertical velocity differences over 20 mm/yr were found, locally exceeding 110 mm/yr. The significant subsidence zones are exclusively located in young Alluvium deposits and 95% of velocity differences over 10 mm/yr are found at Quaternary age deposits. The addition of loads, such as buildings, predominantly affect subsidence rates in the first decade after placement. Estimates of groundwater extraction for domestic supply, used by more than 2 million inhabitants, correlate with the township average subsidence rates which shows that most subsidence in Yangon can be explained by groundwater extraction. Current operation of groundwater extraction wells induces an aquifer volume loss of 5.5 million cubic meter per year in the aquifer system of Yangon city.

In this study, we performed a quantitative analysis of pond detection using a normalised difference water index (NDWI) applied to several widely used satellite sensors, which offer multispectral information at high radiometric precision. These data include: RapidEye (5 m spatial resolution), Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) (10-20 m), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) multispectral imagery (30 m). We demonstrate a method to derive an optimum NDWI value for pond classification using a subset reference dataset of 285 ponds classified using fine-resolution (0.5 m) imagery. We then applied the optimised NDWI (NDWI-O) to the remaining images to assess pond classification accuracy against a broader reference dataset of 898 ponds. NDWI values calculated using Sentinel-2 imagery showed the best spectral contrast between water and surrounding debris cover, and the strongest relationship with pixel water content (R-2 = 0.56), followed by the RapidEye NDWI (R-2 = 0.45). We conclude that RapidEye and Sentinel-2 imagery is best suited for accurate pond classification using a multispectral classification approach, which is important for quantifying their role in glacier ablation, meltwater regulation, and lake development. By comparison, the impact of using coarse-resolution Landsat 8 imagery to characterise surface water dynamics is minimised when applied to large glacier lakes, where the area-to-perimeter ratio is greater.', '[Watson, C.

Manual animal censuses are dangerous and expensive, hence Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with consumer level digital cameras are becoming a popular alternative tool to estimate livestock. Several works have been proposed that semi-automatically process UAV images to detect animals, of which some employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a recent family of deep learning algorithms that proved very effective in object detection in large datasets from computer vision. However, the majority of works related to wildlife focuses only on small datasets (typically subsets of UAV campaigns), which might be detrimental when presented with the sheer scale of real study areas for large mammal census. Methods may yield thousands of false alarms in such cases. In this paper, we study how to scale CNNs to large wildlife census tasks and present a number of recommendations to train a CNN on a large UAV dataset. We further introduce novel evaluation protocols that are tailored to censuses and model suitability for subsequent human verification of detections. Using our recommendations, we are able to train a CNN reducing the number of false positives by an order of magnitude compared to previous state-of-the-art. Setting the requirements at 90% recall, our CNN allows to reduce the amount of data required for manual verification by three times, thus making it possible for rangers to screen all the data acquired efficiently and to detect almost all animals in the reserve automatically.', '[Kellenberger, Benjamin; Marcos, Diego; Tuia, Devis] Wageningen Univ Sc Res, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, Wageningen, Netherlands.RP Kellenberger, B (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ Sc Res, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, Wageningen, Netherlands.', NULL, 'benjamin.kellenberger@wur.nlRI Marcos, Diego/JHT-0827-2023; Tuia, Devis/AAE-9339-2019', 'Tuia, Devis/0000-0003-0374-2459; Marcos, Diego/0000-0001-5607-4445', 'Swiss National Science Foundation [PZ00P2-136827]', 'This work has been supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation   (grant PZ00P2-136827 (DT, http://p3.snf.ch/project-136827).

MR satellites are typically operated privately and imagery can be costly. However in recent years, the price of individual acquisitions has dropped and their revisit times have improved, making them promising tools for remote sensing of inland and coastal waters. Due to the spatial resolution requirements of these satellites, the bands on the sensors are relatively wide (60-140 nm on Pleiades) in order to achieve an acceptable signal to noise ratio. This bandwidth and the limited number of bands can pose problems for the AC as the water signal may not be negligible in any band, especially over turbid waters. Since the MR sensors have a relatively narrow swath (20 km for Pleiades) the atmosphere can generally be assumed to be homogeneous over a scene or subscene. This assumption allows the atmospheric path reflectance (rho(path)) to be estimated from multiple targets in the scene, which are selected according to the lowest observed top-of-atmosphere reflectances (rho(TO)(A)) in all bands. Rather than using pre-defined \"dark\" bands (e.g. in the NIR and SWIR) such as is common in other water-focused AC methods, the best band is selected automatically, i.e. the one yielding the lowest rho(path). This criterion avoids unrealistic negative (\"overcorrected\") reflectances after the AC. Furthermore, for inland waters the NIR bands are usually affected by scattering from adjacent land and vegetation pixels, resulting in unrealistic rho(path) when used in the AC. The spatial resolution of the sensors is used as an advantage here, since ground-level object shadows (e.g. from trees and buildings) can be spatially resolved and are usually the pixels selected by the automated procedure for the determination of rho(path). In fact, it is proposed that using these shadow pixels gives better performance than using any kind of water pixel for these broad-band MR sensors. The method is demonstrated using several Pleiades images, showing good performance in retrieval of the aerosol optical thickness (tau(a)) for an urban (Brussels) and a coastal (Zeebrugge) site. Match-ups with water reflectances measured at the Zeebrugge AERONET-OC station show promising performance, although there is a significant spectral mismatch between the bands on the satellites and the CIMEL radiometer. Pleiades imagery of Zeebrugge reveals a turbid wake associated with the MOW1 measurement station, which opens perspectives of using MR satellites for the characterisation of monitoring and validation sites.

However, very few modeling frameworks exist that conjointly use the above sensors to produce mutually and physically consistent earth system records. To this goal, a prototype of multi-sensor land data assimilation system is developed by linking the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4) and a series of forward models with the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). The deterministic Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF) within the DART is utilized to estimate global soil moisture and snow by assimilating brightness temperature, snow cover fraction, and daily total water storage observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), respectively. A 40-member of Community Atmosphere Model version 4 (CAM4) reanalysis is adopted to introduce ensemble spread in CLM4 land states and some methods are used to reduce the computational load. Data assimilation with different combinations of sensors is implemented for 2003-2009 to investigate individual contributions from different satellite observations. Evaluation results and cross-comparison of open-loop and data assimilation cases suggest that 1) assimilation of MODIS snow cover fraction slightly improves snow estimation in mid and high latitudes; 2) lower and higher frequencies of AMSR-E brightness temperature play complementary roles in improving global soil moisture and snow estimation; 3) assimilation of GRACE tends to degrade soil moisture estimation but poses potential in improving snow depth estimation in most high-latitude regions.

Although numerous classification methods have been developed for obtaining land-use information in urban areas, the accuracy and efficiency of these methods are insufficient to meet the requirements of real-world applications such as urban planning and land management. In recent years, deep learning techniques, especially deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), have achieved an astonishing level of performance in image classification. However, the traditional DCNN methods do not focus on multispectral remote sensing images with more than three channels, and they are limited by their training samples. In addition, these methods uniformly decompose large images into small processing units, which chop up the land-use patterns and produce land-use maps with obvious \"blocks\". In this study, a semi-transfer deep convolutional neural network (STDCNN) approach is proposed to overcome these weaknesses. The proposed STDCNN has three parts: one part involves a transferred DCNN with deep architecture; another part is designed to analyze multispectral images; and the final part fuses the first two parts into a classification layer. Moreover, a skeleton-based decomposing method using street block data is devised to maintain the integrity of the land-use patterns. In two case studies, the proposed method is used to generate urban land-use maps from a WorldView-3 image of a 143 km(2) area of Hong Kong and a WorldView-2 image of a 25 km(2) area of Shenzhen. The results show that the proposed STDCNN obtains an overall accuracy (OA) of 91.25% and a Kappa coefficient (Kappa) of 0.903 for Hong Kong land-use classification, and an OA of 80% and a Kappa of 0.780 for Shenzhen land-use classification.

The study is based on quad-polarization data acquired by the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar over experimental oil slicks under relatively high winds of 10-12 m/s over an 8-hour period. The data is collected over a wide range of incidence angles and alternates between looking upwind (UW) and downwind (DW). The unique time series enables a detailed study of the behavior of multipolarization parameters over clean sea and oil slicks under varying imaging geometry to be carried out for the first time. For clean sea backscatter, our findings are in agreement with previous studies, showing decreasing backscatter as the incidence angle increases and from UW to DW, with the highest sensitivity in the HH channel. We also find similar variations in oil covered areas. The results suggest that the oil slick backscatter is slightly more sensitive to the relative wind direction than the clean sea, and higher oil-sea damping ratios are found in DW than in UW cases, particularly in the HH channel. All multipolarization features investigated have some degree of dependency on imaging geometry. The lowest sensitivities are found in the magnitude of the copolarization correlation coefficient, the standard deviation of the copolarized phase difference, the polarization difference, the mean scattering angle and the entropy. Several features clearly change behavior when the signal approaches the sensor noise floor, and we find that the measurements and derived parameters may be affected at even higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels than previously proposed, i.e., closer to 7-9 dB above the sensor noise floor. Overall, the polarization difference is clearly identified as the most interesting parameter for oil spill observation, producing high oil-sea contrast in addition to low sensitivity to imaging geometry. The results show that both the relative wind direction and the incidence angle, in combination with the SNR, should be taken into account when developing operational methods based on multipolarization SAR data.', '[Skrunes, Stine; Brekke, Camilla; Espeseth, Martine M.] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Phys & Technol, Tromso, Norway.

This research aimed to overcome the failure of radar sensor in SMAP satellite as well as the failure to generate the radar/radiometer combined SMC product at a spatial resolution of 9 km x 9 km.   A disaggregation technique, based on the Smoothing Filter based Intensity Modulation (SFIM), enabled us to obtain co-located SMAP and AMSR2 brightness measurements at L, C, X, Ku and Ka bands at approximately 10 km x 10 km on the selected test area, which corresponds to the entire Italian territory.

Distributed SMC reference values for implementing and validating the algorithm were obtained from the Soil Water Balance hydrological model, SWBM.

Directional brightness temperature (BT) models that describe this anisotropic behavior of TIR emissions can be applied to separate component temperatures using multi-angle observations. The surface temperature differences that occur between sunlit and shaded areas and the leaf clumping phenomenon jointly affect the directional signatures of out-of-canopy directional BTs. However, these factors are not fully considered in existing directional BT models. This paper therefore extends the FR97 analytical model to 1) a four-component scene containing sunlit and shaded soil and leaves by incorporating the effective emissivity values of the sunlit and shaded parts and 2) row-planted crop and forest canopies by introducing a leaf clumping index. The proposed model was assessed using a synthetic dataset that was generated by the Thermal Radiosity-Graphics Combined Model (TRGM) under various conditions. The evaluation results indicated that the proposed model performed as well as the Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves (4SAIL) model over continuous canopies with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) lower than 0.3 degrees C. Over non-continuous crops and forests, the behavior of the proposed model displayed improved agreement with the TRGM with RMSEs lower than 0.65 degrees C. The proposed model also displayed a robust performance over both the maize and pine canopies, which was evaluated against the directional anisotropy of measured datasets that were collected at the Huailai remote sensing test site and the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA), respectively.

This study proposed a framework that calculates the solar irradiance on roofs and facades of city-scale buildings, as well as the potential reductions in energy consumption and CO2 emissions that can be derived from solar energy utilization. This framework consolidates data acquired using 3D remote sensing techniques (e.g., light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data and digital photogrammetry) with existing 3D building vector models from urban planning and building design. To further the economical use of solar energy, the framework provides a new strategy based on three aspects (threshold, structure, and orientation), for a more realistic analysis of the available area of roofs and facades, by combining street view images and point clouds. Nanjing, China, was selected as a study area for validating and analyzing the proposed framework. The experimental area covers approximately 30 km(2) and 5216 buildings. The reliability of the proposed method was validated by comparing the results with the computation modules of mainstream commercial programs and previous international studies. The following conclusions were drawn from the experimental area. (1) Annual solar energy on the roofs of all buildings was 9647.89 GWh, corresponding to a PV yield of 1447.18 GWh, which equates to reductions of 584.66 kt in standard coal consumption and 1261.94 kt in CO2 emissions. The annual solar energy on the facades was 5364.63 GWh, corresponding to a PV yield of 804.69 GWh, which equates to reductions of 325.10 kt in standard coal consumption and 701.69 kt in CO2 emissions. (2) Based on the calculated potential solar energy utilization of the building envelopes, it was shown that the utilization of solar radiation on roofs and facades would promote low-carbon urban development. The utilization of solar energy on the facades of high buildings will contribute to the supply of energy for these buildings and help balance their energy consumption. (3) As the solar incidence angle changes over time, the reductions in energy consumption and CO2 emissions related to PV power generation are maximal in summer for building roofs, whereas no significant seasonal differences were observed for facades. (4) Incorporating the available area translates the utilization of solar energy and potential CO2 reductions from theory to practical application by reducing inefficient and invalid areas. The percentages of available area of roof and facade were estimated at 47% and 16% by comprehensive calculations considering three aspects (threshold, structure, and orientation). The corresponding potential of solar energy on the roofs and facades in the validation area B are 167.18 GWh and 53.63 GWh, respectively, compared to the original theoretic values of 316.97 GWh and 237.98 GWh.', '[Cheng, Liang; Li, Manchun] Nanjing Univ, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Geog Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

However, the importance of landscape fragmentation on land loss has seldom been examined. This paper evaluates the effects of landscape fragmentation on land loss in the Lower Mississippi River Basin region. The research hypothesis is that the higher the degree of fragmentation in a locality, the greater the amount of land loss in the next time period. We used Landsat-TM data with a pixel size of 30 m x 30 m in 1996 and 2010 and transformed the images into either land or water pixels. We then calculated the fractal dimension and Moran\'s I spatial autocorrelation statistics and used them to represent the degree of landscape fragmentation. Four sample box sizes, including sizes of 101 x 101, 71 x 71, 51 x 51, and 31 x 31 pixels, were used to detect if there is a relationship between fragmentation and land loss at different neighborhood (context) scales. For each box size, 100 samples were randomly selected. To isolate the fragmentation effect so that it can be better evaluated, we used only sample boxes with a 50% land-water ratio. Regression results between fragmentation and land loss show that the R-2 values for box sizes of 71 x 71, 51 x 51 and 31 x 31 were statistically significant (0.20, 0.45, 0.35; p < 0.001 for Moran\'s I) but not for the 101 x 101 box size. These results imply that land protection may be most effective by prioritizing areas with land patches that have the least fragmentation. Furthermore, the neighborhood scale at which the R-2 value is the highest indicates the scale at which the effects are most likely to be observed (51 x 51 box size, approximately 1.5 x 1.5 km(2), R-2 = 0.45), which suggests that future land loss modeling using this neighborhood scale would be most effective.', '[Lam, Nina S. -N.; Cheng, Weijia; Zou, Lei; Cai, Heng] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.', 'Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State UniversityRP Lam, NSN (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.', 'nlam@lsu.eduRI Zou, Lei/AAV-8227-2020; Cai, Heng/AAK-6514-2020; Lam, Nina/AAQ-1097-2020', 'Zou, Lei/0000-0001-6206-3558; Cai, Heng/0000-0001-6068-5150; ', 'U.S. National Science Foundation under the Dynamics of Coupled National   Human Systems (CNH) Program [1212112]; U.S. National Science Foundation   under the Coastal Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability   (Coastal SEES) Program [1427389]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic   Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1212112] Funding Source:   National Science Foundation; Division Of Earth Sciences; Directorate For   Geosciences [1427389] Funding Source: National Science Foundation', 'This work was supported in part by two grants from the U.S. National   Science Foundation, one under the Dynamics of Coupled National Human   Systems (CNH) Program (#1212112) and the other under the Coastal   Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability (Coastal SEES)   Program (#1427389).

Remote sensing is a critical means of providing up-to-date information on the location, magnitude, and extent of mortality across a broad geographic area. We used eleven Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) flight lines, resampled to 30 by 30 m pixel size and acquired on six separate dates as part of the HyspIRI Preparatory Campaign to simulate spaceborne imaging spectroscopy. We also spectrally degraded the AVIRIS images to simulate Landsat-8 data. We tested the ability of single-date and multi-temporal remote sensing to identify red stage conifer mortality, healthy conifer, and non-conifer dominated pixels using a random forest algorithm. Accuracy was assessed with an independent validation dataset acquired via WorldView imagery in areas spatially separate from where training data were collected, as well as through comparison with aerial detection survey and canopy water loss data, with generally good agreement. We found that classifications based on imaging spectroscopy significantly outperformed broadband multispectral feature sets (with a highest overall accuracy of 85.1% obtained by imaging spectroscopy and 80.2% obtained by the simulated multispectral images). We also found that classifications based on multi-temporal imaging spectroscopy were more accurate than single-date imaging spectroscopy (the highest overall accuracy obtained for single-date imaging spectroscopy was 83.4%). Imaging spectroscopy that included interseasonal data from the end of the drought outperformed all other datasets, including interannual data that included only images collected in the summer. Multi-date analysis also improved accuracy using broad band systems.

The Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) has achieved sufficient enhanced radiometric performance to quantify visible and near infrared (VNIR) to shortwave infrared (SWIR) radiance emitted from thermal anomalies during nighttime. We propose a method to simultaneously retrieve the brightness temperature and corresponding area of a subpixel hotspot assuming a single isothermal heat source using the spectral radiances in VNIR and SWIR regions (bands 3-7) from nighttime Landsat 8 01,1 data. We conducted a prescribed fire experiment coincident with a Landsat 8 overpass on January 24, 2015. The brightness temperature retrieved from the OLI data agreed with the peak temperature of the time series thermocouple record within 60 K. The retrieved area of fire was 19% of the true fire area. The blackbody assumption (emissivity = 1) might cause the underestimated retrieved area. We applied the hotspot brightness temperature and area retrieval to 17 Landsat 8 scenes that cover Kanto, Japan to validate the proposed method. More than 79% of the detected results were confirmed as true positives based on the land use for each scene. Meanwhile, the obvious false positive was only up to 1% of the detected results. The remaining ambiguous results, mostly found in areas regarding agriculture, were possibly caused by occasional burnings because these locations were never repetitively detected. Time series comparison of the retrieved results in cement plants as a typical stable heat source revealed that the brightness temperature is accurately retrieved, though the retrieval of area is somewhat sensitive to noise on OLI imagery. The proposed method had founded more than twice of the hotspots detected using Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) fire products in the studied area. More than 82% among the hotspots from VIIRS were detected by OLI. However our method failed to detect spatially broad but slightly cool hotspots. Higher spatial resolution at an appropriate spectral configuration enabled enhanced sensitivity to detect small heat sources, as well as quantification of the subpixel hotspots.', '[Kato, Soushi; Kouyama, Toru; Nakamura, Ryosuke] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Cent 1,Umezono 1-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058560, Japan.

It aims to decompose a mixed pixel into a collection of spectrally pure components (called endmembers), and their corresponding proportions (called fractional abundances). In recent years, many studies have revealed that unmixing using spectral information alone does not sufficiently incorporate the spatial information in the remotely sensed hyperspectral image, as the pixels are treated as isolated entities without taking into account the existing local correlation among them. To address this issue, several spatial preprocessing methods have been developed to include spatial information in the spectral unmixing process. In this paper, we present a new spatial preprocessing method which presents several advantages over existing methods. The proposed method is derived from the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) method, which adapts the global search scope of the clustering into local regions. As a result, the spatial correlation and the spectral similarity are intrinsically incorporated at the clustering step, which results in O(N) computational complexity of the clustering procedure with N being the number of pixels in the image. First, a regional clustering is iteratively performed by using spatial and spectral information simultaneously. The obtained result is a set of clustered partitions that exhibit both spectral similarity and spatial correlation. Then, for each partition we select a subset of candidate pixels with high spectral purity. Finally, the obtained candidate pixels are gathered together and fed to a spectral-based endmember extraction method to extract the final endmembers and their corresponding fractional abundances. Our newly developed method naturally integrates the spatial and the spectral information to retain the most relevant endmember candidates. Our experimental results, conducted using both synthetic and real hyperspectral scenes, indicate that the proposed method can obtain accurate unmixing results with less than 0.5% of the number of pixels used by other state-of-the-art methods. This confirms the advantages of integrating spatial and spectral information for hyperspectral unmixing purposes.', '[Xu, Xiang] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Zhongshan Inst, Zhongshan 528402, Peoples R China.

Near real time detection and response activities enable to better manage the required resources at the incident area for clean-up and control operations. Multi temporal remote sensing (RS) technologies are widely used to detect and monitor oil spills on the Ocean surfaces. However, current techniques using RS data for oil spill detection are time consuming and expensive in terms of computational cost and related infrastructure. The main focus of this work is oil spill detection from voluminous multi-temporal LANDSAT-7 imagery using high performance computing technologies such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and Message Passing Interface (MPI) to speed up the detection process and provide rapid response. Kepler compute architecture based GPU (Tesla K40) with Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), which is a parallel programming mechanism for GPU is used in the development of the detection algorithms. Oil spill detection techniques that were adapted to GPU based processing include band-ratio and Morphological attribute profile (MAP) based on six structural and shape description attributes namely, Gray mean, standard deviation, elongation, shape complexity, solidity and orientation. Experimental results show the significant gains in the computational speed of these techniques when implemented on a GPU and MPI. A GPU vs. CPU comparison shows that the proposed approach achieves a speedup of around 10 x for MAP and 14 x for band ratio approaches, which includes the data transfer cost. However, the MPI implementation using 64 cores outperforms the GPU, and executes the time intensive task of computing the above said attributes in only 18 min, whereas a GPU consumes around an hour.

However, it has several vulnerabilities associated with the partitioning of the available energy (AE) at the land surface. We introduce a two stage energy restraint process into the SEBS algorithm (SEBS-ER) to overcome these vulnerabilities. The first offsets the remotely sensed surface temperature to ensure the surface to air temperature difference reflects AE, while the second stage uses a domain based image search process to identify and adjust the proportions of sensible (H) and latent (lambda E) heat flux with respect to AE. We effectively implemented SEBS-ER over 61 acquisitions over two Landsat tiles (path 90 row 84 and path 91 row 85) in south-eastern Australia that feature heterogeneous land covers. Across the two areas we showed that the SEBS-ER algorithm has: greater resilience to perturbed errors in surface energy balance algorithm inputs; significantly improved accuracy (p < 0.05) at two eddy covariance flux towers in heavily forested (RMSE 62.3 W m(-2), R-2 0.879) and sub-alpine grassland (RMSE 33.2 W m(-2), R-2 0.939) land covers; and greater temporal stability across 52 daily actual evapotranspiration (ETa) estimates compared to a temporally stable and independent ETa dataset. The energy restraint within SEBS-ER has reduced exposure to the complex errors and uncertainties within remotely sensed, meteorological, and land type SEBS inputs, providing more reliable and accurate spatially distributed ETa products.

In recent years, high spatial resolution airborne hyperspectral images have shown their potential for deriving accurate land cover maps. In this paper, a new spectral mixture analysis model for mapping urban environments using high spatial resolution airborne hyperspectral data is proposed. First, non-local self-similarity is exploited to partition the scene into groups of similar pixels. The spectral signals of the pixels in each of these groups are assumed to be comprised of the same endmembers, but with different abundance values. Then, the similar pixels in each group are simultaneously unmixed using a jointly sparse spectral mixture analysis method. The proposed method was applied to map land cover in Pavia city, northern Italy, using airborne ROSIS data. An overall classification accuracy of 97.24% was achieved for the Vegetation - Impervious surface - Soil model. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed jointly sparse spectral mixture analysis model is well suited for mapping land cover in urban environments using high resolution hyperspectral data.

Here we report agreement statistics between map and reference labels for NLCD 2011, which includes land cover for ca. 2001, ca. 2006, and ca. 2011. The two main objectives were assessment of agreement between map and reference labels for the three, single-date NLCD land cover products at Level II and Level I of the classification hierarchy, and agreement for 17 land cover change reporting themes based on Level I classes (e.g., forest loss; forest gain; forest, no change) for three change periods (2001-2006, 2006-2011, and 2001-2011). The single-date overall accuracies were 82%, 83%, and 83% at Level II and 88%, 89%, and 89% at Level I for 2011, 2006, and 2001, respectively. Many class-specific user\'s accuracies met or exceeded a previously established nominal accuracy benchmark of 85%. Overall accuracies for 2006 and 2001 land cover components of NLCD 2011 were approximately 4% higher (at Level II and Level I) than the overall accuracies for the same components of NLCD 2006. The high Level I overall, user\'s, and producer\'s accuracies for the single-date eras in NLCD 2011 did not translate into high class specific user\'s and producer\'s accuracies for many of the 17 change reporting themes. User\'s accuracies were high for the no change reporting themes, commonly exceeding 85%, but were typically much lower for the reporting themes that represented change. Only forest loss, forest gain, and urban gain had user\'s accuracies that exceeded 70%. Lower user\'s accuracies for the other change reporting themes may be attributable to the difficulty in determining the context of grass (e.g., open urban, grassland, agriculture) and between the components of the forest-shrubland-grassland gradient at either the mapping phase, reference label assignment phase, or both. NLCD 2011 user\'s accuracies for forest loss, forest gain, and urban gain compare favorably with results from other land cover change accuracy assessments.

While stability can sometimes be inferred from field measurements, current methods are lacking robustness and the ability to be automated and applied over large areas and long time scales to ensure safety and document change in the context of transportation, indigenous ice uses and industrial development. This paper introduces an inverse model capable of reconstructing three-dimensional deformation fields from one-dimensional interferometric L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) phase patterns. We apply this method at three landfast ice locations on the Alaska Beaufort Sea coast near Barrow and Prudhoe Bay. We find the small-scale displacements estimated from the model consistent with regional patterns of ice motion. Our study suggests that interferometry can provide planning and decision -support information for ice road development and structures operating within ice. Moreover, InSAR can potentially increase our understanding of sea ice on a fundamental level in terms of large-scale stability and long-term changes in ice dynamics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The Sentinels of the European Space Agency (ESA), together with other satellite missions, provide a variety of data from different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, at different spatial scales, and with different temporal resolutions. In a case study we demonstrate the advantage of merging data from different spaceborne instruments for analysing ice conditions and ice dynamics in and around the frequently occurring Terra Nova Bay Polynya (TNBP) in the Ross Sea in the Antarctic. Starting with a list of polynya parameters that are typically retrieved from satellite images, we assess the usefulness of different sensor types. On regional scales (several 100 km), passive microwave radiometers provide a view on the mutual influence of the three Ross Sea polynyas on sea ice drift and deformation patterns. Optical sensors with meter-scale resolution, on the other hand, allow very localized analyses of different polynya zones. The combination of different ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum is essential for recognition and classification of ice types and structures. Radar images together with data from thermal infrared sensors, operated at tens to hundreds of meters resolution, improve the separation of the outlet zone of the polynya from the adjacent pack ice. The direct comparison of radar and passive microwave images reveals the visibility of deformed ice zone in the latter. A sequence of radar images was employed to retrieve ice drift around the TNB, which allows analysing the temporal changes of the polynya area and the extension and structure of the outlet zone as well as ice movements and deformation that are influenced by the katabatic winds.

Since the thermal bands suffer less by the shadows as compared to the optical bands, it is imperative to investigate the effect of shadow on the optical and thermal snow indices. The investigation comprises determination of (a) difference of means between the sunlit snow cover and snow cover under shadow for thermal snow indices, optical snow cover indices and optical snow cover characteristic indices and (b) correlation coefficient of the thermal snow indices with the respective optical snow cover indices and optical snow cover characteristic indices. The study was conducted in the test sites of the Chenab basin, western Himalayas using the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor data.   The mean values of different snow indices exhibit significant difference between the sunlit and shadow test sites with Z-values ranging between 68.92 and 1220.39 (p < 0.0001). Shadow significantly increases correlation of the thermal snow indices with the optical snow cover indices with r >= 0.81, while r-values lie below 0.29 in the sunlit test site (Student\'s t-test, p < 0.0001). On the other hand, thermal snow indices exhibit low correlation with both optical snow cover characteristic indices in either site; however, shadow induces negative correlation between them (r = 0.37 to 0.62, p < 0.0001). The results ascertain the varying influence of shadow on the optical and thermal snow indices and their interrelationship, which could be significantly helpful for accurate radiative transfer modelling of snow in the light of the seasonal variation in the earth-sun geometry.

This research estimated ice velocities of PIGIS from an ensemble of image matching of Landsat time series multispectral data obtained from 2000 to 2014. Orientation correlation was adopted for the image matching of blue, green, red, near infrared, panchromatic, and the first principal image of the Landsat multispectral data, from which the results were combined and averaged. The multispectral image matching proposed in this research produced similar to 35% more ice velocity vectors than the use of a single band (i.e., panchromatic band) image matching. The erroneous matches were filtered through simple but rigorous statistical evaluations. The ice velocity of PIGIS accelerated by similar to 55% during 2000-2010, and the acceleration of the image northing velocity component (similar to 13 km a(-1)) was higher than that of the image easting velocity component (similar to 0.8 km a-1). During 20102012, the ice velocity of PIGIS slowed down by similar to 10%. The ice velocity in 2014 increased by 5% from 2012, but was still lower than the peak values observed in 2010. The surface strain rate fields of PIGIS were derived from the ice velocity fields. The longitudinal ice compression was observed near the grounding line and the geographically northern part of the central ice shelf of PIGIS, while a fast-flowing band was observed near the southern margin of the ice shelf. The transverse strain rate showed that ice divergence in the hinge zone of the central ice shelf has increased since 2000. The width of the shear margins of the central ice shelf of PIGIS is similar to 25 km, which has been stable since 2000. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, this technique is restricted to clear-sky conditions. Because of this limitation, satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) records are frequently interrupted, sometimes even becoming temporally sparse and, accordingly, climatically less representative. Given this challenge, we propose a strategy that incorporates an annual temperature cycle (ATC) model to perform temporal upscaling of the SUHI from a climatic perspective. Using two mega-cities (Beijing and Shanghai) as case studies, our major findings include: (1) urbanization tends to enlarge the amplitude of annual daytime LST series for both cities; (2) urbanization in Beijing narrows the diurnal LST range on annual average but broadens it in Shanghai; (3) within an annual cycle, the daytime SUHI intensity (SUHII) reaches its maximum one month later than the daytime LST maximum for Beijing, whereas this time difference is negligible for Shanghai; and (4) compared with the observation-based and moving-window-based temporal aggregations, the ATC-based temporal aggregation allows to produce a clear-sky SUHI climatology that is more representative and becomes potentially valuable for prediction or application purposes. From a climatic perspective, the temporal upscaling of the SUHI, therefore, provides insights into the impacts on local thermal environments that are induced by urbanization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The assessment, maintenance and restoration of a diversified forest structure have become major foci in the effort to preserve forest ecosystems from loss of biological diversity. However, the assessment of forest biodiversity is difficult because it involves multiple components and is characterized using multiple variables. The objective of the study was to develop a methodological approach for predicting, mapping, and constructing a statistical inference for a multiple-variable index of forest structural diversity. The method included three key components: (i) use of the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) technique, field plot data, and airborne laser scanning metrics to predict multiple forest structural diversity variables simultaneously, (ii) incorporation of multiple diversity variable predictions into a single index, and (iii) construction of a statistically rigorous inference for the population mean of the index. Three structural diversity variables were selected to illustrate the method: growing stock volume and the standard deviations of tree diameter at breast-height and tree height. Optimization of the k-NN technique produced mean relative deviations less in absolute value than 0.04 for predictions for each of the three structural diversity variables, R-2 values between 050 and 0.66 which were in the range of values reported in the literature, and a confidence interval for the population mean of the index whose half-width was approximately 5% of the mean. Finally, the spatial pattern depicted in the resulting map of forest structural diversity for the study area contributed to validating the proposed method.

First, we describe the average relationship between three input spectral bands and an output band by developing a look-up table (WT) based on the fully normalized Rrs from the MODIS AQUA sensor. By dividing the Rrs measured at the output wavelength by the prediction from the LUT, we obtain several anomalies depending on the combination of input and output bands. None of these anomalies are correlated with chlorophyll concentration on the global scale. Some anomalies are strongly correlated with previously described data products (e.g., CDOM index, backscattering coefficients from semi-analytical inversion models), but others are not correlated with any product currently distributed by NASA. In the latter case, new information about oceanic optical properties is extracted from the ocean color spectra, which allows identification of water masses that was otherwise impossible with standard ocean color products. It was not possible, in some cases, to identify the optical source of this information, which may be spatially and temporally variable. We also show that by removing the main source of variability, the anomalies show interesting potential to identify subtle shifts in sensor response in satellite time series. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The algorithm uses salinity and the light absorption coefficient of colored dissolved organic matter at 443 nm [a(CDOM)(443), m(-1)] derived from SMOS/MIRAS and Aqua/MODIS satellite sensors, respectively, to identify the fraction of three end-members (i.e., seawater, ice melt water, and river water including precipitation) through the mass balance equations. An uncertainty analysis showed that fractions of river water can be derived reasonably, with caution of fractions for ice melt water and seawater. Application of this algorithm may lead to the discrimination of water sources in the surface layer of the Arctic Ocean in various environments where seawater, ice melt water, and river water are intermingled, which might be useful to improve our understanding of physical and biogeochemical processes related to each water source.

The k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) technique is a non-parametric, multivariate approach to prediction that has emerged as particularly popular for use with forest inventory and remotely sensed data and has been shown to contribute substantially to increasing precision. k-NN predictions are calculated as linear combinations of observations for sample units that are nearest in a space of auxiliary variables to the population unit for which a prediction is desired. Implementation of a nearest neighbors algorithm requires four choices: (i) a distance metric, (ii) specific auxiliary variables to be used with the distance metric, (iii) the number of nearest neighbors, and a (iv) scheme for weighting the nearest neighbors. Regardless of the choices for a distance metric and weighting scheme, emerging evidence suggests that optimization of the technique, including selection of an optimal subset of auxiliary variables, greatly enhances prediction. However, optimization can be computationally intensive and time-consuming. A promising approach that is gaining favor is based on genetic algorithms, a technique that uses search heuristics that mimic natural selection to solve optimization problems.   The objective of the study was to compare optimized k-NN configurations with respect to inferences for mean volume per unit area using airborne laser scanning variables as auxiliary information. For two study areas, one in Norway and one in Minnesota, USA, the analyses focused on optimizing k-NN configurations that used the weighted Euclidean and canonical correlation distance metrics and two neighbor weighting schemes. Novel features of the study include introduction of a neighbor weighting scheme that has not previously been used for forestry applications, simultaneous optimization of all four k-NN choices, and basing comparisons on confidence intervals, rather than intermediate products such as prediction accuracies. Two conclusions were primary: (1) optimized selection of feature variables produced greater precision than using all feature variables, and (2) computational intensity necessary to optimize the weighted Euclidean metric was considerably greater than for the canonical correlation analysis metric. Specific findings were that optimization produced pseudo-R-2 as large as 0.87 for the Norwegian dataset and as large as 0.89 for the Minnesota dataset. For the optimized canonical correlation distance metric, widths of approximate 95% confidence intervals as proportions of the estimated means were as small as 0.13 for the Norwegian dataset and as small as 0.15 for the Minnesota dataset.

Over the past few decades, SWE has been estimated with passive microwave (PM) sensors with generally good results in wide, flat, terrain, and lower reliability in densely forested, complex, or high-elevation areas.   In this study, we use raw swath data from five satellite - sensors the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSMI) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) (1987-2015, F08, F11, F13, F17), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E, 2002-2011), AMSR2 (2012-2015), and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM, 2014-2015) - in order to understand the spatial and temporal structure of native sensor, topographic, and land cover biases in SWE estimates in HMA. We develop a thorough understanding of the uncertainties in our SWE estimates by examining the impacts of topographic parameters (aspect, relief, hillslope angle, and elevation), land cover, native sensor biases, and climate parameters (precipitation, temperature, and wind speed). HMA, with its high seasonality, large topographic gradients and low relief at high elevations provides an excellent context to examine a wide range of climatic, land-cover, and topographic settings to better constrain SWE uncertainties and potential sensor bias.   Using a multi-parameter regression, we compare long-term SWE variability to forest fraction, maximal multiyear snow depth, topographic parameters, and long-term average wind speed across both individual sensor time series and a merged multi-sensor dataset. In regions where forest cover is extensive, it is the strongest control on SWE variability. In those regions where forest density is low (<5%), maximal snow depth dominates the uncertainty signal. In our regression across HMA, we find that forest fraction is the strongest control on SWE variability (75.8%), followed by maximal multi-year snow depth (7.82%), 90th percentile 10-m wind speed of a 10-year December-January-February (DJF) time series (5.64%), 25th percentile DJF 10-m wind speed (5.44%), and hillslope angle (5.24%). Elevation, relief, and terrain aspect show very low influence on SWE variability (<1%). We find that the GPM sensor provides the most robust regression results, and can be reliably used to estimate SWE in our study region.   While forest cover and elevation have been integrated into many SWE algorithms, wind speed and long-term maximal snow depth have not. Our results show that wind redistribution of snow can have impacts on SWE, especially over large, flat, areas. Using our regression results, we have developed an understanding of sensor specific SWE uncertainties and their spatial patterns.

Airborne imaging spectrometers like the next generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) are well suited for locating CH4 point sources due to their ability to map concentrations over large regions with the high spatial resolution necessary to resolve localized emissions. AVIRIS-NG was deployed during a field campaign to measure controlled CH4 releases at the Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center (RMOTC) in Wyoming, U.S. for multiple flux rates and flight altitudes. Two algorithms were applied to AVIRIS-NG scenes, a matched filter detection algorithm and a hybrid retrieval approach using the Iterative Maximum a Posteriori Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (IMAP-DOAS) algorithm and Singular Value Decomposition. Plumes for releases as low as 14.16 m(3)/h (0.09 kt/year) were consistently observed by AVIRIS-NG at multiple flight altitudes and images of plumes were in agreement with wind directions measured at ground stations. In some cases plumes as low as 3.40 m(3)/h (0.02 kt/year) were detected, indicating that AVIRIS-NG has the capability of detecting a wide range of fugitive CH4 source categories for natural gas fields. This controlled release experiment is the first of its kind using AVIRIS-NG and demonstrates the utility of imaging spectrometers for direct attribution of emissions to individual point source locations. This is particularly useful given the large uncertainties associated with anthropogenic CH4 emissions, including those from industry, gas transmission lines, and the oil and gas sectors.

River ice breakup research is restricted by the sparse distribution of hydrological stations in the Arctic, where limited available data suggests a trend towards earlier ice breakup. The specific climatic mechanisms driving this trend, however, are complex and can vary both regionally and within river systems. Consequently, understanding the response of river ice processes to a warming Arctic requires simultaneous examination of spatial and temporal patterns in breakup timing. In this paper, we describe an automated algorithm for river ice breakup detection using MODIS satellite imagery that enables identification of spatial and temporal breakup patterns at large scales. We examine breakup timing on the Mackenzie, Lena, Ob\' and Yenisey rivers for the period 2000-2014. By dividing the rivers into 10 km segments and classifying each river pixel in each segment as snow/ice, mixed ice/water or open water based on MODIS reflectance, we determine breakup dates with a mean uncertainty of +/- 13 days. All statistically significant temporal trends are negative, indicating an overall shift towards earlier breakup. Considerable variability in the statistical significance and magnitude of trends along each river suggests that different climatic and physiographic drivers are impacting spatial patterns in breakup. Trends detected on the lower Mackenzie corroborate recent studies indicating weakening ice resistance and earlier brealcup timing near the Mackenzie Delta. In Siberia, the increased magnitude of trends upstream and strong correlation between breakup initiation and whole-river breakup patterns suggest that earlier onset of upstream discharge may play the dominant role in determining breakup timing. Exploratory analysis demonstrates that MODIS imagery may also be used to differentiate thermal and mechanical breakup events.

Past studies achieve LIM mainly using on-screen interpretation of aerial photos, and little attention has been paid to developing more automated methods. In recent years, the use of multitemporal remote sensing images makes it possible to map landslides semi-automatically. Although numerous methods have been proposed, only a few methods are competent for some specific situations and there is large room for improvement in their degree of automation. For these reasons, a semi-automated approach is proposed for reliable and accurate LIM from bitemporal aerial orthophotos. Specifically, it consists of two principal steps: 1) change detection-based thresholding (CDT) and 2) level set evolution (LSE). CDT is mainly used to generate the initial zero-level curve (ZLC) for LSE, thus automating the proposed method considerably. It includes three substeps: 1) generating difference image (DI) using change vector analysis (CVA), 2) detecting landslide candidates using a thresholding method, and 3) removing errors using morphology operations. Then, landslide boundaries are detected using two types of LSE, i.e., edge-based LSE (ELSE) and region-based LSE (RISE). Finally, the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed methods are corroborated by a series of experiments. Given its efficiency and accuracy, it can be applied to rapid responses of natural hazards. This study is the first attempt to apply LSE to LIM from bitemporal remote sensing images.

The bloom appeared to be anomalous relative to a historical monthly chlorophyll FLH mean (August 2002 to 2010), and was attributed by others to the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill accident. Here we tested an alternative hypothesis that the eastward dispersal of the Mississippi River plume entrained in wind-driven currents contributed to the development of this phytoplankton bloom. We examined Mississippi River discharge and nutrient records, ship-based surface salinity data, and the rime-series of MODIS ocean color and FLH images. Wind measurements from buoys showed winds >6 m s(-1) first in a southerly (northward) direction August 8-10, and then in a northerly (southward) direction until August 26. Results from the American Seas-Navy Coastal Ocean Model (AmSeas-NCOM) show how coastal water was advected in wind-driven currents into the area of the northeastern Gulf of Mexico where the bloom was documented.   Between July 9 and September 8, 2010, the discharge of the Mississippi River exceeded the 20-year mean. During this time, the northeastern Gulf received an estimated excess volume of approximately 8.3 x 10(9) m(3) relative to the 20-year mean. Together with findings from a particle trajectory model, we conclude that nutrients and other materials (e.g., sediments) from the excessive discharge of the Mississippi River and adjacent marshes and wind-driven currents likely contributed to the anomalous bloom observed during August 2010 and to the anomalously high organic matter sedimentation rates observed in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

This research assesses the estimation of forest structure, composition and deadwood variables from small-footprint airborne lidar data, both discrete return (DR) and full waveform (FW), acquired under leaf-on and leaf-off conditions. The field site, in the New Forest, UK, includes managed plantation and ancient, semi-natural, coniferous and deciduous woodland. Point clouds were rendered from the FW data through Gaussian decomposition. An area-based regression approach (using Akaike Information Criterion analysis) was employed, separately for the DR and FW data, to model 23 field-measured forest variables. A combination of plot-level height, intensity/amplitude and echo-width variables (the latter for FW lidar only) generated from both leaf-on and leaf-off point cloud data were utilised, together with individual tree crown (ITC) metrics from rasterised leaf-on height data. Statistically significant predictive models (p < 0.05) were generated for all 23 forest metrics using both the DR and FW lidar datasets, with R-2 values for the best fit models in the range R-2 = 0.43-0.94 for the DR data and R-2 = 028-0.97 for the FIN data (with normalised RMSE values being 18%-66% and 16%-48% respectively). For all but two forest metrics the difference between the NRMSE of the best performing DR and FW models was <= 7%, and there was an even split (11:12) as to which lidar dataset (DR or FW) generated the best model per forest metric. Overall, the DR data performed better at modelling structure variables, whilst the FW data performed better at modelling composition and deadwood variables. Neither showed a clear advantage at modelling variables from a particular vegetation layer (canopy, shrub or ground). Height, intensity/amplitude, and ITC-derived crown variables were shown to be important inputs across the best performing models (DR or FW), but the additional echo-width variables available from FW point data were relatively unimportant. Of perhaps greater significance to the choice between lidar data type (i.e. DR or FW) in determining the predictive power of the best performing models was the selection of leaf-on and/or leaf-off data. Of the 23 best models, 10 contained both leaf-on and leaf-off lidar variables, whilst 11 contained only leaf-on and two only leaf-off data. We therefore conclude that although FW lidar has greater vertical profile information than DR lidar, the greater complimentary information about the entire forest canopy profile that is available from both leaf-on and leaf-off data is of more benefit to forest inventory, in general, than the selection between DR or FW lidar.

The use of the dual view capability of the ATSR-type instruments allows for the accurate and precise, day-rime and night-rime retrievals of cloud free TCWV over oceans. The retrieval scheme uses the instrument physical characteristics, in combination with advanced radiative transfer models and a sea surface spectral emissivity database. The retrievals therefore do not require algorithm tuning or adjustments to independent water vapour datasets.   Inter-comparisons with the Remote Sensing Systems Special Sensor Microwave Imager (RSS SSM/I) and ECMWF ERA-Interim total water vapour column products have been carried out for a set of test cases and are discussed in detail. The initial results show that the ATSR TCWV data, aggregated at the SSMM/I or ECMWF spatial resolution, have no median bias with respect to the collocated datasets, and have an estimated precision of about 4% for the ATSR-2 and AATSR instruments and up to 15% for the ATSR-1 instrument. The TCWV precision for the 1 x 1 km(2) resolution is of the order of 12% for ATSR-2 and AATSR, while is about 30% for ATSR-1.   This new physical algorithm can be readily extended to dual view radiometers similar to ATSR such as the upcoming Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) instrument on the European Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite series.

A seasonal model is typically used to account for seasonality, but fitting a seasonal model is difficult when there are not enough data in the time series. Here, we propose a new approach that reduces seasonality in satellite image time series using spatial context. With this spatial context approach, each pixel value in the image is spatially normalised using the median value calculated from neighbouring pixels whose pixel values are above the 90th percentile. Using Landsat data, we compared our spatial context approach to a seasonal model approach at a humid tropical forest in Brazil and a thy tropical forest with strong seasonality in Bolivia. After reducing seasonal variations in Landsat data, we detected deforestation from the same data using the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) method. We show that, in dry tropical forest, deforestation events are detected much earlier when the spatial context approach is used to reduce seasonal variations in Landsat data than when a seasonal model is used. In the dry tropical forest, the median temporal detection delay for deforestation from the spatial context approach was two observations, seven times shorter than the median temporal detection delay from the seasonal model approach (15 observations). In the humid tropical forest, the difference in the temporal detection delay between the spatial context and seasonal model approach was not significant. The differences in overall spatial accuracy between the spatial context and seasonal model were also not significant in both dry and humid tropical forests. The main benefit for using spatial context is early detection of deforestation events in forests with strong seasonality. Therefore, the spatial context approach we propose here provides opportunity to monitor deforestation events in dry tropical forests at sub-annual scales using Landsat data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The dynamics of this event are related to the coupling of subtropical jet and polar jet over the Saudi Arabia region, resulting in massive dust storm generation and dust transport through Rub\' al Khali and the Persian Gulf to the UAE region. AOD and PM10, values showed a fourfold increase during the event reaching a maximum of 1.8 and 1653 mu g/m(3) respectively. The spatial extent of the dust storm is evident from high values of MODIS AOD (similar to 1.5) and OMI aerosol index (4.5) covering the entire Middle East. The total attenuated backscatter at 550 nm from CALLIPSO showed the vertical extent of dust up to 8 km. In addition, surface temperature showed a decrease of almost 15 degrees C during the event signifying the intensity of the dust storm. Aerosol radiative forcing estimates during the dust storm showed a cooling at the surface and warming in the atmosphere, with a maximum forcing value reaching up to similar to-210 Wm(-2) (185 Wm(-2)). Hence, it is evident from the present study that the dust layer caused an additional warming of similar to 150 Wm(-2) in the atmosphere over this region. The present event showcases the importance of dust storm induced aerosol optical and physical processes, and associated atmospheric dynamics over UAE as well as other affected regions.

It is also known that global satellite products generally contain more noise than ground-based estimates. Data validation of satellite data often treats ground-based estimates as the \'gold standard\': without error or uncertainty. In the estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) however, ground-based estimates have considerable uncertainty, caused by the input components of the ET equations. This research presents an analysis of uncertainty of reference ET (ET0) caused by these input components. A dataset of correlated random variables is generated for a country with a diverse climate and diverse density of ground observations: New Zealand. The uncertainty analysis shows that: ET() is most sensitive to temperature, followed by solar radiation, relative humidity, and cloudiness ratio; and that uncertainty varies between 10% and 40% of ET0, and depends on the ET0 value. Using this uncertainty analysis, a set of correlated random variables, and a Monte-Carlo fitting approach, MOD16 satellite PET data becomes a \'soft interpolator\' between ground-based ET0 estimates. The resulting 1 km x I km monthly nation-wide dataset has the advantage of: taking into account land cover and vegetation characteristics through the use of satellite data; still abiding to local climate diversity and locally used standards through the use of ground-based estimates; and containing an uncertainty estimate. Further comparison suggests that original MOD16 satellite PET could estimate real PET better than using ground-based estimates of ET0. Further research recommends combination with other existing gridded ET estimates, and further validation of real PET estimates. (C) 2015 The Author. Published by Elsevier Inc.', '[Westerhoff, R.

Field plots are typically used to construct models that relate the variable of interest to explanatory variables derived from the remotely sensed data. The models may then be used in combination with the field plots to provide estimates for a geographical area of interest with corresponding estimates of precision using model-assisted estimators. Previous studies have shown that field plot sizes found suitable for pure field surveys may be sub-optimal for use in combination with remotely sensed data. Plot boundary effects, co-registration problems, and misalignment problems favor larger plots because the relative impact of these effects on the models of relationships may decline by increasing plot size. In a case study in a small boreal forest area in southeastern Norway (852.6 ha) a probability sample of 145 field plots was measured twice over an 11 year period (1998/1999 and 2010). For each plot, field measurements were recorded for two plot sizes (200 m(2) and 300/400 m2). Corresponding multitemporal ALS (1999 and 2010) and InSAR data (2000 and 2011) were also available. Biomass for each of the two measurement dates as well as biomass change were modeled for all plot sizes separately using explanatory variables from the ALS and InSAR data, respectively. Biomass change was estimated using model-assisted estimators. Separate estimates were obtained for different methods for estimation of change, like the indirect method (difference between predictions of biomass for each of the two measurement dates) and the direct method (direct prediction of change). Relative efficiency (RE) was calculated by dividing the variance obtained for a pure field-based change estimate by the variance of a corresponding estimate using the model-assisted approach. For ALS, the RE values ranged between 7.5 and 15.0, indicating that approximately 7.5-15.0 as many field plots would be required for a pure field-based estimate to provide the same precision as an ALS-assisted estimate. For InSAR, RE ranged between 1.8 and 2.5. The direct estimation method showed greater REs than the indirect method for both remote sensing technologies. There was clearly a trend of improved RE of the model-assisted estimates by increasing plot size. For ALS and the direct estimation method RE increased from 9.8 for 200 m(2) plots to 15.0 for 400 m(2) plots. Similar trends of increasing RE with plot size were observed for InSAR. ALS showed on average 32-6.0 times greater RE values than InSAR. Because remote sensing can contribute to improved precision of estimates, sample plot size is a prominent design issue in future sample surveys which should be considered with due attention to the great benefits that can be achieved when using remote sensing if the plot size reflects the specific challenges arising from use of remote sensing in the estimation. That is especially the case in the tropics where field resources may be scarce and inaccessibility and poor infrastructure hamper field work. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Existing terrestrial laser scanners can provide accurate representation of forest canopy structure, but the sensors are expensive, data processing is complex, and measurements are typically confined to a single event, which severely limits their utility in the interpretation of canopy trends indicated by remotely sensed data. We tested a novel, low-cost terrestrial laser scanner for its capacity to provide reliable and successive assessments of canopy PAL in an evergreen eucalypt forest. Daily scans comprised of 920 range measurements were made by three scanners at one forest site over a two-year period, providing mostly consecutive estimates of PAI, and of vertical structure profiles (as Plant Area Volume Density, PAVD). Data filtering, involving objective statistical methods to identify outliers, indicated that scan quality was adversely affected by moist weather and moderate wind speeds (>4 m s(-1)), suggesting limited utility in some forest environments. Data cleaning (associated with sensor malfunctions) plus filtering removed 32 to 49% of scans, leaving on average 57% of data over the two-year period. Nonetheless, we found strong agreement between lidar-derived PAI estimates, and those from monthly hemispherical images ( 0.1 PAI); with both methods indicating mostly stable PAI over multiple seasons. The PAVD profiles from the laser scanner indicated that leaf flush in the upper canopy concomitantly balanced leaf loss from the middle canopy in summer, which was consistent with measured summer peaks in litter fall. This clearly illustrated the advantages of three-dimensional lidar data over traditional two-dimensional PAI estimates in monitoring tree phenology, and in interpreting changes in canopy reflectance as detected by air- and space-borne remotely sensed data.

This combination allows us to explore the multiple influences of bedrock, climate, biota, landscape and time on regolith development and properties: an interdisciplinary geoscience modeling problem. From a wide variety of available data for Australia, we select remotely sensed geophysical, geomorphological and mineralogical inputs with good spatial coverage. We use Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), a topologically constrained unsupervised statistical learning algorithm, to characterize the geophysical and mineralogical signatures of regolith and bedrock. Regolith materials cover more than 80% of the Australian continent, range in age from Precambrian to Quaternary and vary in thickness from less than a meter to more than a kilometer. The diversity of regolith cover type and character across Australia provides an opportunity to demonstrate knowledge discovery from remote sensing data. The outputs of our SOM analysis are combined with ground observations from locations showing naturally occurring anomalous concentrations of nickel, tin and uranium. We identify a minimum number of natural clusters indicating subtle but significant differences in regolith and bedrock mineralization characteristics. Our results show that SOM identifies spatially contiguous regions representing unique regolith and bedrock materials. In the Yilgarn Craton we observe key differences in landscape character, density of the crust, and relative abundance of radioactive elements and alumino-silicate and ferric oxide minerals. These properties discriminate between nickel-prospective residual deeply weathered regolith formed on mafic and/or ultramafic bedrock and uranium-prospective Cainozoic paleochannels containing felsic bedrock source materials. National-scale data are publicly available for many continental regions, as in the Australian example, and our approach has general applicability. We demonstrate that remote sensing data may be used to understand the regolith, revealing the interplay between environmental history and bedrock character at regional scales, and differences between residual and transported regolith, provenance of source materials and their relative ages.

Some observations also suggest that earthquakes can damage landslide prone areas or cause slow-moving landslides to accelerate, with a risk of evolution to rapid landslides in the following months after the earthquake. Here, we use optical images from the Pleiades satellites to detect slow-moving landslides and quantify the effect of earthquakes on the landslide motion. We process multi-temporal Pleiades images acquired in March, April, and July 2013 over an area of 210 km(2) in the Colca valley (South Peru), to obtain two Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and three displacement fields of the area. The processed DEMs have an uncertainty of 0.6 m (1 sigma), an order of magnitude better than two global and freely available DEMs (GDEM-v2 and SRTM), whereas the displacement fields have an uncertainty of between 0.11 and 0.18 m (1 alpha) in both horizontal directions. Using these data, we detect 9 slow-moving landslides and compare their velocities during the March-April and April-July periods. We find that landslide velocities are highest during the wet season, which suggests a strong groundwater control, and we also highlight a landslide acceleration caused by a regional Mw 6.0 earthquake. The major parameters controlling the acceleration of the slow-moving landslides are the rock type and the distance to the source, suggesting that friction at the basal interface in the weeks after the earthquake is dependent on the shaking intensity.

We developed a satellite-based hybrid algorithm to determine the Priestley-Taylor (PT) parameter for estimating global terrestrial LE across multiple biomes. The hybrid algorithm combines a simple empirical equation with physically based ecophysiological constraints to obtain the sum of the weighted ecophysiological constraints (f(e)) from satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and ground-measured air temperature (TO, relative humidity (RH), vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and LE for 2000 to 2009 provided by 240 globally distributed FLUXNET eddy covariance (ECOR) tower sites. Cross-validation analysis indicated that the optimization at a PFT level performed well with a RMSE of less than 0.15 and a R-2 between 0.61 and 0.88 for estimated monthly f(e). Cross-validation analysis also revealed good performance of the hybrid-based PT method in estimating seasonal variability with a RMSE of the monthly LE varying from 43 W/m(2) (for 6 deciduous needleleaf forest sites) to 18.1 W/m(2) (for 34 crop sites) and with a R-2 of more than 0.67. The algorithm\'s performance was also good for predicting among-site and inter-annual variability with a R-2 of more than 0.78 and 0.70, respectively. We implemented the global terrestrial LE estimation from 2003 to 2005 for a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees by recalibrating the coefficients of the hybrid algorithm using Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) meteorological data, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI product and ground-measured LE. This simple but accurate hybrid algorithm provides an alternative method for mapping global terrestrial LE, with a performance generally improved as compared to other satellite algorithms that are not calibrated with tower. The calibrated f(e) differs for different PFTs, and all driving forces of the algorithm can be acquired from satellite and meteorological observations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This paper describes the generation of a regionally optimized land cover dataset for West Africa with a spatial resolution of 250 m, which is based on earth observation data from three optical and radar instruments. The choice of sensors is based on their individual strengths and weaknesses in assessing specific land surface types. Annual profiles of the optical Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are analyzed for the classification of vegetated classes including agriculture. The classification approach builds on random forest classification with learning data extracted from higher resolution land cover maps. Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) Wide Swath (WS) time series are used, in combination with MODIS data, to delineate permanent and seasonal water bodies. Here, an approach integrating threshold classification and morphological operations is applied. Built-up areas of different densities are identified based on a seamless coverage of radar imagery collected by the satellites TanDEM-X and TerraSAR-X. The detection of settlements is based on an unsupervised classification scheme which exploits texture metrics and backscattering amplitudes of the fine resolution radar sensors. The accuracy assessment of the multi-sensor land cover map yields an overall accuracy of 80% at legend level 1 (9 classes) and 73% at the more detailed legend level 2 (14 classes). Comparisons with available wall-to-wall datasets of the region demonstrate the valuable information content of the presented West African land cover map. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

A proposed hypothesis for these fluctuations involves the overgrazing of vegetation on herd summer ranges at high herd densities resulting in a reduction in available forage. Semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) herds in Scandinavia negatively affect vegetation productivity at high herd densities and exclosure experiments have indicated that overgrazing may also affect barren ground caribou herds. However, overgrazing of summer range vegetation has yet to be tested at the landscape level or related to herd densities for barren ground caribou herds. Accordingly, the question examined in this study was does barren ground caribou herd density have an effect on summer range vegetation productivity? To answer this question, summer home ranges for four herds in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, Canada, were delineated using caribou telemetry data. Yearly overall productivity and vegetation seasonality (the change between the maximum and minimum productivity throughout the year) metrics were calculated by year using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer data and related to herd densities. Overall vegetation productivity was negatively related to herd density, indicating that some summer range degradation may have occurred at high densities. Conversely, and contrary to our expectations, vegetation seasonality was positively related to herd density. The Bathurst herd, which experienced densities more than three times those of the other herds examined, had the least negative association with overall productivity. Given the negative relationship detected between each herd\'s densities and overall vegetation productivity, it is likely that some summer range degradation occurred as herd densities increased. Considering the results of the Bathurst herd however, it is difficult to conclude that overgrazing has been a major factor governing herd abundance in the herds examined here. This study demonstrated the utility of archived remotely sensed productivity data and how productivity indices can be useful tools for providing information on large mammal grazing impacts.

Moreover, there is currently no global forest map that is consistent with forest statistics from FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations). By combining these diverse data sources into a single forest cover product, it is possible to produce a global forest map that is more accurate than the individual input layers and to produce a map that is consistent with FAO statistics. In this paper we applied geographically weighted regression (GWR) to integrate eight different forest products into three global hybrid forest cover maps at a 1 km resolution for the reference year 2000. Input products included global land cover and forest maps at varying resolutions from 30 m to 1 km, mosaics of regional land use/land cover products where available, and the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields product. The GWR was trained using crowdsourced data collected via the Geo-Wiki platform and the hybrid maps were then validated using an independent dataset collected via the same system. Three different hybrid maps were produced: two consistent with FAO statistics, one at the country and one at the regional level, and a \"best guess\" forest cover map that is independent of FAO. Independent validation showed that the \"best guess\" hybrid product had the best overall accuracy of 93% when compared with the individual input datasets.

In recent decades, due to increasing population and food demand and the backdrop of global warming, croplands have been expanding into higher latitude regions. One such hotspot is paddy rice expansion in northeast China. However, there are no maps available for documenting the spatial and temporal patterns of continuous paddy rice expansion. In this study, we developed an automated, Landsat-based paddy rice mapping (Landsat-RICE) system that uses time series Landsat images and a phenology-based algorithm based on the unique spectral characteristics of paddy rice during the flooding/transplanting phase. As a pilot study, we analyzed all the available Landsat images from 1986 to 2010 (498 scenes) in one tile (path/row 113/27) of northeast China, which tracked paddy rice expansion in epochs with five-year increments (1986-1990, 1991-1995, 1996-2000, 2001-2005, and 2006-2010). Several maps of land cover types (barren land and built-up land; evergreen, deciduous and sparse vegetation types; and water-related land cover types such as permanent water body, mixed pixels of water and vegetation, spring flooded wetlands and summer flooded land) were generated as masks. Air temperature was used to define phenology timing and crop calendar, which were then used to select Landsat images in the phenology-based algorithms for paddy rice and masks. The resultant maps of paddy rice in the five epochs were evaluated using validation samples from multiple sources, and the overall accuracies and Kappa coefficients ranged from 84 to 95% and 0.6-0.9, respectively. The paddy rice area in the study area substantially increased from 1986 to 2010, particularly after the 1990s. This study demonstrates the potential of the Landsat-RICE system and time series Landsat images for tracking agricultural land use changes at 30-m resolution in the temperate zone with single crop cultivation.

This study assessed the daily MODIS fractional snow-covered area (FSC) products over seven catchments with a mixed snow-rain hydrological regime, covering the Atlas chain in Morocco. For this purpose, more than 4760 daily MODIS tiles (MOD10A1 version 5) from September 2000 to June 2013 were processed, based on a spatio-temporal filtering algorithm aiming at reducing cloud coverage and the problem of discrimination between snow and cloud. The number of pixels identified as cloudy was reduced by 96% from 22.6% to 0.8%. In situ data from five snow stations were used to investigate the relative accuracy of MODE snow products. The overall accuracy is equal to 89% (with a 0.1 m. threshold for snow depth). The timing of the seasonal snow was also correctly detected with 11.4 days and 9.4 days of average errors with almost no bias for onset and ablation dates, respectively. The comparison of the FSC products to a series of 15 clear sky FORMOSAT-2 images at 8 m resolution in the Rheraya sub-basin near to Marrakech showed a good correlation of the two datasets (r = 0.97) and a reasonable negative bias of -27 km(2). Finally, the FSC products were analyzed through seasonal indicators including onset and melt-out dates, the Snow Cover Duration (SCD) and the maximum snow cover extent (SCAmax) at the catchment level: (1) the dynamic of the snow cover area is characterized by a very strong inter-annual signal with a variation coefficient of the SCAmax reaching 77%; (2) there is no evidence of a statistically significant long-term trend although results have pointed out that the SCD increased in February-March and, to a lesser extent, decreased in April-May for the 2000-2013 period. The study concludes that the daily MODIS product can be used with reasonable confidence to map snow cover in the South Mediterranean area despite difficult detection conditions.

The results are presented as composite maps of the entire region for the months of January, April, July and October and as time series averaged over 2 week intervals for three selected locations representing different mixing regimes. Annual cycles in a(mss)(488) were observed in most areas, with maximum values occurring in winter when increased vertical mixing brought fine sediments to the surface. Euphotic depths were strongly influenced by a(mss)(488) cycles, but sharp reductions were superimposed wherever phytoplankton blooms occurred. A key hydrographic feature of this region is the formation of a front in St. George\'s Channel between mixed and seasonally stratified water bodies. On the mixed side of the front, single peaks in a(cHL).(488) were observed in summer when the euphotic zone was at its deepest. On the stratified side, double peaks in a(cHL)(488) occurred in spring and autumn while low summer values of a(cHL)(488) coincided with high values of Z(1%pAR). The remote sensing evidence indicates, therefore, that phytoplankton growth (as reflected by net accumulation at the surface) in summer was limited by light availability in mixed waters, and nutrient availability in the stratified region. We conclude that observations of spatio-temporal patterns in phytoplanIcton and mineral particle absorption coefficients and euphotic depths derived from ocean colour sensors can provide insights into the processes determining the depth of penetration of solar radiation, and also the factors limiting near-surface primary production, in optically complex and spatially heterogeneous shelf seas.

To provide a clearer, synoptic view of the field this review has organised the literature by the unit of analysis and the comparison method used to identify change. This significantly reduces the conceptual overlap present in previous reviews giving a succinct nomenclature with which to understand and apply change detection workflows. Under this framework, several decades of research have been summarised to provide an overview of current change detection approaches. Seven units of analysis and six comparison methods were identified and described highlighting the advantages and limitations of each within a change detection workflow. Of these, the pixel and post-classification change methods remain the most popular choices. In this review we extend previous summaries and provide an accessible description of the field. This supports future research by placing a clear separation between the analysis unit and the change classification method. This separation is then discussed, providing guidance for applied change detection research and future benchmarldng experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Radar remote sensing has proven to be particularly useful to monitor forests especially in the tropics due to weather and daytime independence. Radar data from the TanDEM-X mission provide a potential opportunity to monitor large areas of tropical forests due to the multi-temporal global coverage and the high resolution.   Tropical peat swamp forests are difficult to access and thus high effort to conduct field measurements is necessary. Therefore, aboveground biomass was estimated from a limited amount of in-situ measurements of relatively undisturbed peat swamp forest and a LiDAR based canopy height model to achieve a representative amount of biomass estimates for radar analysis. The LiDAR and field measurements resulted in an identical estimate of mean biomass and thus provided a reliable source to correlate with SAR (synthetic aperture radar) features from the TanDEM-X mission and ultimately up-scale the found relation to the entire study site.   The relationship of interferometric coherence of the bistatic TanDEM-X data showed a moderate to high correlation with the biomass (R-2 = 05) and RMSE of 53 t/ha corresponding to a biomass range from 183 to 495 t/ha. Thus, it could be used to indicate forest degradation areas, which are characterized by larger opening of the canopy cover and thus lower biomass. The results indicate that interferometric coherence is useful for quantification of aboveground biomass in tropical peat swamp forest TanDEM-X coherence can at minimum serve as a stratification to assess spatial distribution of qualitative biomass classes in the context of REDD + monitoring, reporting, and verification schemes and for the identification of forest degradation areas.

Accurate estimation of low phycocyanin concentration (PC) is critical for issuing an early warning of potential risks of cyanobacterial population growth to the public. To monitor cyanobacterial biomass in eutrophic inland waters, an approach is proposed to partition non-water absorption coefficient (a(t-w)(lambda)) into the contribution of colored dissolved matter (CDM), non-phycocyanin pigments, and phycocyanin with the aim of improving the accuracy in remotely estimated PC, in particular for low PC. The proposed algorithm extends the IOP Inversion Model of Inland Waters (IIMIW) that derives a(t-w)(lambda) and chlorophyll-a concentration from remote sensing reflectance. The extended IIMNV retrieves absorption spectra of both CDM (a(cdm)(lambda)) and phytoplankton (a(ph)(lambda)) with R-2 >= 0.80 and a relative root mean square error (rRMSE) <= 31.79% for a(cdm)(412), a(ph)(443), a(ph)(620), and a(ph)(665) when validated with data collected in 2010 from three Indiana reservoirs. In fact, comparison of our algorithm with other partitioning models demonstrates the new algorithm to be more suitable for inland waters. The algorithm also achieved more accurate PC estimation with R-2 = 0.81, rRMSE = 33.60%, and mean relative error (RE) = 49.11% than the widely used semi-empirical algorithm with R-2 = 0.73, rRMSE = 45.09%, and mean RE = 182.29% for the same dataset The validation of our algorithm against the data collected in other years shows that the proposed algorithm worked for a wide range of limnological conditions. In particular, low PC (PC <= 50 mg m(-3)) values of for all datasets used in this study were well predicted by the proposed algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Reliable extraction of vegetation information from spatial and spectral high resolution spectroscopy data requires accurate retrieval schemes to account for the complex radiative transfer in the coupled vegetationatmosphere system. Particularly the coupling of the atmosphere and vegetation considering combined effects of anisotropy, absorption and scattering typically relies on many assumptions, rendering estimates of direct (E-dir) and diffuse (E-dif) surface irradiance error prone. This impacts the reliability of retrieved vegetation properties. In this study we discuss and quantify the retrieval sensitivity of vegetation information using high resolution IS data to inaccurate assumptions of direct and diffuse surface irradiance. We use observations and simulations and focus on the two vegetation indices normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the photochemical reflectance index (PRI), and on sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (Fs). Our results indicate that, even if the irradiance field (E) is exactly known, reflectance based vegetation indices show an inherent variation of 9% (NDVI) and 12% (PRI) respectively. These variations are caused by complex interactions of surface irradiance and reflectance anisotropy. The emitted Fs signal was found to be almost unaffected by those variations, if the retrieval considers surface anisotropy. Further, estimation of vegetation properties is subject to large uncertainties if instantaneous E fields are unknown. In that case, they range up to 13% for the NDVI, up to 32% for the PRI, and up to 58% for Fs. We conclude that retrieval sensitivities of vegetation indices and Fs to illumination effects must be carefully considered in data interpretation and suggest using coupled surface-atmosphere models to exploit the full information content of IS data.

The estimation of biochemical constituents of leaves from remotely sensed data is of high interest revealing insight on photosynthetic processes, plant health, plant functional types, and species composition. However, upscaling leaf level observations to canopy level is not a trivial task, in particular due to the inherent structural complexity of forests. A common solution for scaling spectral information is the use of physically-based radiative transfer models. We parameterize the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model based on airborne and in situ measurements. At-sensor radiances were simulated and compared with measurements of the Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) imaging spectrometer. The study was performed on the Laegern site (47 degrees 28\'43.0 N, 8 degrees 21\'53.2 E, Switzerland), a temperate mixed forest characterized by steep slopes, a heterogeneous spectral background, and a high species diversity. Particularly the accurate 3D modeling of the complex canopy architecture is crucial to understand the interaction of photons with the vegetation canopy and its background. Two turbid medium based forest reconstruction approaches were developed and compared; namely based on a voxel grid and based on individual tree detection. Our study shows that the voxel grid based reconstruction yields better results. When using a pixel-wise comparison with the imaging spectrometer data, the voxel grid approach performed better (R-2 = 0.48, lambda 780 nm) than the individual tree approach (R-2 = 0.34, lambda 780 nm). Spatial patterns as compared to APEX data were similar, whereas absolute radiance values differed slightly, depending on wavelength. We provide a successful representation of a 3D radiative regime of a temperate mixed forest, suitable to simulate most spectral and spatial features of imaging spectrometer data. Limitations of the approach include the high spectral variability of leaf optical properties between and within species, which will be further addressed. The results also reveal the need of more accurate parameterizations of small-scale structures, such as needle clumping at shoot level as well as leaf angle. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Based on the results, the validity of assimilating the SMOS soil moisture retrievals into a land surface model is further evaluated. The ground truth is obtained by spatial upscaling from the network measurements within an area of approximately 10,000 km(2). Results show that both SMOS L2 and the preliminary version of L3 soil moisture products have large biases at the SMOS node scales (15 and 25 km), but they can reflect the surface wetness conditions well when averaged at a 100-km scale during the unfrozen season (June to October). This finding indicates the applicability of SMOS retrievals is scale-dependent. Meanwhile, very few retrievals are available in winter due to the presence of frozen soil and snow cover, and the accuracy of ascending retrievals degrades during transition when diurnal freezing-thawing cycle occurs. Considering the SMOS L2 product has a better accuracy than that of 13, we assimilate it into a land surface model using a dual-pass land data assimilation scheme. The data assimilation estimate without insitu tuning proves superior to either remote sensing or land surface modeling in estimating surface soil moisture for the unfrozen season, and its accuracy fulfills the SMOS measurement requirements (RMSD <= 0.04 m(3) m(-3)). Thus, the assimilation of SMOS retrievals holds promise to produce regional soil moisture dataset with acceptable accuracy for the Tibetan Plateau semi-arid region. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

On the other hand, it is known that for forest canopies the variation of reflectance with the sun-view-geometry is significant. The study examines different approaches to extract spectro-directional information from airborne imagery and explores its use in forest type classification. The images were acquired in a standard aerial survey. They were taken with a common forward and side overlap with the result that each point on the ground is observed from several view directions.   To obtain directional information that might be useful in forest type classification, two widely used semi-empirical models of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) were tested, i.e., the Rahman-Pinty-Verstraete model (RPV; with 3 and 4 parameters) (Rahman et al., 1993) and the RossThick-LiSparse model (RTLS; with 3 and 5 parameters) (Wanner et al., 1995). For each sample plot, observations from at least 10 view directions were available. The models were inverted against the observations applying a look-up table approach. The estimated model parameters were used 1) directly as explanatory variables in the classification, and 2) to estimate the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) for selected sun-view-geometries, referred to as modeled BRFs. The BRFs also served as explanatory variables in the classification. For the classification the Random Forests classifier was used.   Both models proved to provide information that can be successfully used in forest type classification outperforming conventional (single-angle) multi-spectral data. The 3-parameter version of the RPV model was found most effective. Compared to the conventional dataset, the overall classification accuracy increased from 72% (kappa: 0.64) to 85% (kappa: 0.81), when the parameters of this model were used as explanatory variables. The 4-parameter version of RPV and the 5-parameter version of RTLS fitted the observed data more accurately than the corresponding 3-parameter versions. However, the classification accuracies obtained with the estimated model parameters were significantly lower than those obtained with the 3-parameter models. All tested models yielded higher classification accuracies with the modeled BRFs than with the model parameters. Again, the highest classification accuracy was obtained with the RPV-3P model (overall accuracy: 92%; kappa: 0.89). The classification accuracy varied with the sun-view-geometry. These differences could partly be explained by the angular sampling scheme and partly by the models\' capability to estimate the reflectance at angles that were not observed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We first adapted and parallelized a watershed segmentation algorithm to delineate individual crowns from a gridded canopy maxima model. From each segment, we extracted all spectra exceeding a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) threshold and a suite of crown structural metrics computed directly from the three-dimensional lidar point cloud. The variables were fused and crowns were classified using canonical discriminant analysis. The full complement of spectral bands along with 7 lidar-derived structural metrics were reduced to 28 canonical variates and classified. Species-level and leaf-type level maps were produced with respective overall accuracies of 83.4% (kappa = 82.6) and 93.5%. The addition of lidar data resulted in an increase in classification accuracy of 4.2 percentage points over spectral data alone. The value of the lidar structural metrics for urban species discrimination became particularly evident when mapping crowns that were either small or morphologically unique. For instance, the accuracy with which we mapped the tall palm species Washingtonia robusta increased from 29% using spectral bands to 71% with the fused dataset Additionally, we evaluated the role that automated segmentation plays in classification error and the prospects for mapping urban forest species not included in a training sample. The ability to accurately map urban forest species is an important step towards spatially explicit urban forest ecosystem assessment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Here we present a method to quantify such dependencies on land surface characteristics, sun illumination and satellite position. The method uses a geometric model to describe the surface elements viewed by an air-borne sensor and relies on parallel-ray geometry to calculate the projections of tree canopies and sunlit and shaded ground: these are considered as basic surface elements responsible for most of the spatial variability of LST. For a woodland landscape we demonstrate that modeling the fractions of these basic surface elements within the sensor field-of-view allows us to quantify the directional effects observed on satellite LST with sufficient accuracy.   Geometric models are an effective tool to upscale in situ measurements for the validation of LST over discontinuous canopies (e.g. forests). Here we present the application of a model to observations of brightness temperature from the LSA-SAF validation site in Evora (Portugal), an area of oak woodland, over the one-year period from October 2011 to September 2012. The resulting composite temperature is compared against LSA SAF LST products from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) onboard Meteosat as well as against MYD11A1/MOD11A1 (collection 5) products from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard AQUA and TERRA. Comparisons with modeled ground LST show that SEVIRI LST has a bias of 0.26 degrees C and a RMSE of 1.34 degrees C, whereas MODIS LST (MYD11A1 and MOD11A1, collection 5) has a bias of -1.54 degrees C and a RMSE of 2.37 degrees C. Both MODIS and SEVIRI LST are closer to in situ values obtained with the geometric model than to those obtained when disregarding the effects of viewing and illumination geometry. These results demonstrate the need to consider the directional character of LST products, especially for validation purposes over heterogeneous land covers. For the new MODIS LST product (MOD21), which is based on the Temperature-Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm, comparisons with in-situ LST show an improved bias of 0.81 degrees C and a RMSE of 1.48 degrees C (daytime values only). The TES based product presents lower emissivity values than those used for retrieving MYD11A1/MOD11A1 LST, which may partially explain the improved match with in-situ LST.   Discrepancies between LST retrievals obtained from different sensors, especially those on different orbits can also be partly explained by their viewing/illumination geometries. In this study the geometric model is used to correct LST deviations between simultaneous MODIS and SEVIRI LST estimations related to those effects. When the model is used to correct the variable MODIS viewing geometry there is a reduction in standard deviation of about 0.5 degrees C. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we propose a MODIS-based Photosynthetic Capacity Model (PCM) to estimate GPP in Northern China and the Tibetan Plateau. The PCM follows the logic of the light use efficiency model and is only driven by the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI). Multi-year eddy CO2 flux data from five vegetation types in North China (temperate mixed forest, temperate steppe) and the Tibetan Plateau (alpine shrubland, alpine marsh and alpine meadow-steppe) were used for model parameterization and validation. In most cases, the seasonal and interannual variation in the simulated GPP agreed well with the observed GPP. Model comparisons showed that the predictive accuracy of the PCM was higher than that of the MODIS GPP products and was comparable with that of the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) and the potential PAR-based GPP models. The model parameter (PCmax) of the PCM represents the maximum photosynthetic capacity, which showed a good linear relationship with the mean annual nighttime Land Surface Temperature (LSTan). With this linear function, the PCM-simulated GPP can explain approximately 93% of the variation in the flux-observed GPP across all five vegetation types. These analyses demonstrated the potential of the PCM as an alternative tool for regional GPP estimation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

These datasets were analyzed to investigate the hydrologic properties at the basin scale, including the speed with which vegetation and soil moisture respond to precipitation anomalies. We also looked at the basin-specific normalized radar surface-backscattering cross-sections from NASA\'s QuikSCAT Scatterometer, to obtain information on the vegetation regimes of the various Malagasy basins. Finally, we correlated the basin response to the precipitation forcing, and compared the amplitude and time lag of the correlations across watersheds with high elevation headwaters versus those with low elevation headwaters in the aim of evaluating the drought-response hypothesis of Wilme et al. (2006). Our results indicate that the vegetation water content time series exhibit several features that are consistent with those of the majority of the bioclimatic zones of the island. Specifically, although the speed of the response of the vegetation water content varies significantly among the different basins, it is inter-annually consistent for each watershed, while the soil-moisture time series are less consistent than the vegetation water content time series. This study is a first step in the quantification of the hydrologic properties derived from microwave remote sensing, and which could potentially shed new light on the different intra-annual responses of watersheds to precipitation anomalies. Furthermore, this analysis offers important insights into the hydro-geomorphologic drivers associated with biodiversity patterns in Madagascar, contributing to a better understanding of the mechanisms that determine biotic diversification across the various bioclimatic regions of the island.

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) has proven useful for estimating carbon density patterns outside of field plot inventory networks. However, the accuracy and generality of calibrations between LiDAR-assisted ACD predictions (EACD(LiDAR)) and estimated ACD based on field inventory techniques (EACD(field)) must be increased in order to make tropical forest carbon mapping more widely available. Using a network of 804 field inventory plots distributed across a wide range of tropical vegetation types, climates and successional states, we present a general conceptual and technical approach for linking tropical forest EACD(field) to LiDAR top-of-canopy height (TCH) using regional-scale inputs of basal area and wood density. With this approach, we show that EACD(LiDAR) and EACD(field) reach nearly 90% agreement at 1-ha resolution for a wide array of tropical vegetation types. We also show that Lorey\'s Height - a common metric used to calibrate LiDAR measurements to biomass - is severely flawed in open canopy forests that are common to the tropics. Our proposed approach can advance the use of airborne and space-based LiDAR measurements for estimation of tropical forest carbon stocks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Remote sensing provides a synoptic view of ongoing processes, which addresses the intricate nature of water surfaces and allows an assessment of the pressures placed on aquatic ecosystems. However, the main challenge in identifying water surfaces from remotely sensed data is the high variability of spectral signatures, both in space and time. In the last 10 years only a few operational methods have been proposed to map or monitor surface water at continental or global scale, and each of them show limitations. The objectives of this study are to develop, demonstrate and validate the adequacy of a generic multi-temporal and multi-spectral image analysis method to detect water surfaces automatically, and to monitor them in near real-time at the African continental scale as a first step towards global scale coverage. The proposed approach, based on a transformation of the RGB color space into HSV, provides dynamic information at the continental scale. Two different validations were done at the continental scale over Africa: i) The algorithm validation checked the ability of the proposed algorithm to perform as effectively as human interpretation of the image: it showed an accuracy of 96.6% and no commission errors. ii) The product validation was carried out by using an independent dataset derived from high resolution imagery: the continental permanent water surface product showed an accuracy of 91.5% and few commission errors. Potential applications of the proposed method have been identified and discussed. The methodology that has been developed is generic: it can be applied to sensors with similar bands with good reliability, and minimal effort. Moreover, this experiment at the African continental scale showed that the methodology is efficient for a large range of environmental conditions. Additional preliminary tests over other continents indicate that the proposed methodology could also be applied at the global scale without too many difficulties. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Analysis of long-term remotely sensed LST data remains a challenge for researchers. Most previous studies explored urban thermal pattern over space and time using a limited number of clear-sky images or by removing cloud-contaminated pixels. The limitation in the number of image scenes prevents from deriving long-term LST climatology for a particular region. Moreover, simply eliminating cloudy pixels inevitably obscures the spatial and temporal patterns of LST. This research attempts to characterize the annual and seasonal temperature behaviors during the period of year 2000 to year 2010 in Los Angeles by employing an annual temperature cycle (ATC) model. All 115 image scenes (path 41, row 36) of less than 30% of cloud cover available from the Landsat archive were utilized for the analysis. Three ATC parameters, i.e., mean annual surface temperature (MAST), yearly amplitude surface temperature (YAST), and the phase shift, were optimized with the Levenberg-Marquardt minimization scheme to understand the annual and seasonal characteristics of LST. The overall RMSE of 7.36 K was achieved for the optimization for all 115 images; while for the median monthly composite, the RMSE reached 2.85 K. The monthly median composite partly removed day-specific anomalies and the impact of cloud cover and reflected LSTs largely under clear sky conditions, leading to the improvement in the modeling result. The MAST and YAST derived from the modeling result of the monthly median composite data were further analyzed to relate to three normalized indices, i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI). The results showed that the mean temperature of urban areas in LA was as high as in the barren land area, reaching almost 310 K, but the urban areas possessed a less fluctuation. Seasonal analysis suggested that in winter, the urban areas observed a higher temperature than the barren land/desert, implying that urban materials held a larger amount of heat for a longer time than the barren land. The separation of cloudy scenes into cloud percentage groups made it possible for the evaluation of the effect of cloud cover on the ATC modeling process. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the inclusion of cloudy images brought about a decrease in MAST ranging from 0.18 to 2.0 K, depending on the percentage of cloud cover and the number of cloudy scenes used for the modeling. The decrease is due likely to the inclusion of cloud temperatures in analysis rather than shaded or other land surface temperatures. When all cloudy images were included in the modeling, a decrease of 2 K in MAST and an increase of 0.15 in YAST were observed. The regression analysis demonstrated that NDBI and NDVI were the main factors influencing the spatial variations of MAST and YAST with the R-2 value of 0.63 and 0.49, respectively. In addition, the spatial variation of VAST was found more complex than that of MAST, since the three indices can only explain up to 53% of its variance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper we analyse remotely sensed sea surface temperature, sea level anomaly, salinity and chlorophyll concentration from 2010 to describe and quantify the extent, strength and seasonality of the plume and to explain its behaviour in relation to winds, ocean currents and fresh water discharge. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis reveals strong seasonal and coastal upwelling signals, potential bimodal seasonality and responses to fresh water discharge peaks in all data sets. Salinity and chlorophyll are significantly negatively correlated (-0.4 to -0.9) across a 500 km(2) zone west of the river mouth. Lagged correlations with river discharge show the westward translation, dispersal and strengthening of a similar sized region of positive chlorophyll-discharge and negative salinity-discharge correlations. Peaks in chlorophyll lag the discharge by 1-4 months, although it is not possible from ocean colour alone to distinguish increases in chlorophyll resulting from the dispersal of nutrient rich river discharge from other physical and biological mechanisms that promote changes in surface chlorophyll, or indeed have confidence that the signal has not been contaminated by other optically active substances. The strongest plume-like signatures from EOF analysis are found in the salinity and colour data sets, which are then also analysed using a statistically based water mass detection technique to isolate the behaviour of the plume. The validity of the technique is checked against ARGO profiles. Throughout the year the main axis of the fresh water plume extends between 400 and 1000 km, northwest along the coastline, or west southwest out into the open south Atlantic. Changes in the magnitude and direction of wind stress and hence wind driven surface currents are the principal driving force behind this far-field variability, although the strength and direction of the Angola and Benguela Coastal currents may also play a role. The mean surface salinity within the plume and its surface area have qualitative links to the seasonal cycle in river discharge and wind stress. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Three different satellite precipitation products (CMORPH, TRMM-3B42 and PERSIANN) were used in this study. The new algorithm was evaluated over three 0.25 x 0.25 degrees areas in Niger, Mali and Benin and precipitation estimates (before and after correction) were compared to observed ground-based precipitation measurements. An assessment was also conducted at the regional scale using 48 independent rainfall stations located in Togo, Niger and Burkina Faso. The proposed methodology showed that, after correction, the three satellite precipitation products converge to the ground-based precipitation measurements, demonstrating the robustness of the methodology. In addition, soil moisture estimates derived from the methodology were found to be in good agreement with ground-based soil moisture measurements (R-2 > 0.78 in Niger, R-2 > 0.54 in Mali and R-2 > 0.64 in Benin).

Such models often make assumptions regarding crown shape to simplify parameter retrieval and crown archetypes are typically assumed to contain a turbid medium to account for within-crown scattering. However, these assumptions may make it difficult to relate derived structural parameters to measurable canopy properties. Here, we test the impact of crown archetype assumptions by developing a new set of analytical expressions for modelling LiDAR signals. The expressions for three crown archetypes (cuboids, cones and spheroids) are derived from the radiative transfer solution for single order scattering in the optical case and are a function of crown macro-structure (height and crown extent) and LAI. We test these expressions against waveforms simulated using a highly-detailed 3D radiative transfer model, for LAI ranging from one to six. This allows us to control all aspects of the crown structure and LiDAR characteristics. The analytical expressions are fitted to both the original and the cumulative simulated LiDAR waveforms and the CV(RMSE) of model fit over archetype trees ranges from 03% to 21.2%. The absolute prediction error (APE) for LAI is 7.1% for cuboid archetypes, 18.6% for conical archetypes and 4.5% for spheroid archetypes. We then test the analytical expressions against more realistic 3D representations of broadleaved deciduous (birch) and evergreen needle-leaved (Sitka spruce) tree crowns. The analytical expressions perform more poorly (APE values up to 260.9%, typically ranging from 39.4% to 78.6%) than for the archetype shapes and ignoring clumping and lower branches has a significant influence on the performance of waveform inversion of realistic trees. The poor performance is important as it suggests that the assumption of crown archetypes can result in significant errors in retrieved crown parameters due to these assumptions not being met in real trees. Seemingly reasonable inferred values may arise due to coupling between parameters. Our results suggest care is needed in inferring biophysical properties based on crown archetypes. Relationships between the derived parameters and their physical counterparts need further elucidation. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The surface reflectance and aerosol optical depth are inverted from AVHRR Channel 1 data using a model for the earth-atmosphere system which couples an atmospheric radiative transfer model with the Ross-Thick-Li-sparse bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) model. Basic assumptions are that the surface bidirectional reflective property does not vary over a 2-4 day periods and that the aerosol characteristics are uniform within a 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees window (approximately 10 km x 10 km). The LABITS algorithm is applied to data from AVHRR on the NOAA-15, NOAA-16, and NOAA-18 satellites over four distinct areas, namely, North America, Europe, the Sahara and India, to simultaneously retrieve the aerosol optical depth (AOD), BRF parameters and surface albedo. Preliminary results show that AOD and reflectance retrieved from the three different instruments are in good agreement and that LABITS provides good results over both bright surfaces, e.g. the Sahara, and dark surfaces, e.g. Europe. Evaluation of the AOD versus data from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) provides a correlation coefficient R-2 of 0.88 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of approximately 0.07; and the uncertainty is approximately Delta tau= +/- 0.05 +/- 0.20 tau. Comparing our results with the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD products, over many areas, provides biases in the range of +/- 0.05. The surface albedo values calculated from the retrieved BRF parameters are similar to those provided by the MODIS albedo product (MCD43). The robustness and applicability of the LABITS algorithm are demonstrated with the retrieval of AOD over China during August 2008. Daily and monthly averaged results show good agreement with collocated AERONET observations and AQUA MODIS products (MYD04 and MYD08). The AOD uncertainty is estimated as Delta tau = +/- 10.05 +/- 030 tau. The preliminary analysis of time series over selected AERONET sites shows that the temporal variations of the AOD values retrieved by application of LABITS to AVHRR data are overall similar to temporal variations of AOD provided by the MODIS and AERONET. The algorithm has the potential to retrieve global AOD over land for long time series of NOAA AVHRR data going back to the 1980s, which are urgently needed for studies on aerosol climatology and global climate change.

The importance of LST is being increasingly recognized and there is a strong interest in developing methodologies to measure LST from space. However, retrieving LST is still a challenging task since the LST retrieval problem is ill-posed. This paper reviews the current status of selected remote sensing algorithms for estimating LST from thermal infrared (TIR) data. A brief theoretical background of the subject is presented along with a survey of the algorithms employed for obtaining LST from space-based TIR measurements. The discussion focuses on TIR data acquired from polar-orbiting satellites because of their widespread use, global applicability and higher spatial resolution compared to geostationary satellites. The theoretical framework and methodologies used to derive the LST from the data are reviewed followed by the methodologies for validating satellite-derived LST. Directions for future research to improve the accuracy of satellite-derived LST are then suggested. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The correct modeling of the contribution of the glaciers meltwater to the total runoff of the Tarim River is hampered by the lack of mass balance data. Multi-temporal digital terrain models (DTMs) allow the determination of volume changes for large samples of glacier. Here, we present the mass changes for 12 glaciers using 1976 KH-9 Hexagon, 2000 SRTM3 and 2009 SPOT-5 datasets. The results show that most of the glaciers have been losing mass since 1976. The largest glaciers, Koxkar and West Qongterang, lost -0.27+/-0.15 m w.e.a(-1) and -0.43+/-0.15 m w.e.a(-1) between 1976 and 2009, despite thick debris cover. However, some smaller glaciers show mass gain at their tongues indicating glacier surges. Using SRTM3 data the volume gain of Qinbingtan Glacier No. 74 could be dated to the time period 1999-2009. The overall mass budget of -0.33+/-0.15 m w.e.a(-1) (for 1976-2009) of the investigated glaciers is within the variability range of the global average. However, in the recent years (1999-2009) a slightly decelerated mass loss of -0.23+/-0.19 m w.e.a(-1) could be observed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The study area is the Upper Tena Valley (Central Spanish Pyrenees), where mostly very slow earth flows, have caused direct damage estimated at approximately 15 ME in the last decade. The advanced DInSAR processing of ascending orbit ALOS PALSAR images (2006-2010) and descending orbit ERS & Envisat (2001-2007) and TerraSAR-X (2008) datasets, has provided heterogeneous displacement velocity measurements. The projection along the steepest slope of LOS displacements reduces the geometrical differences introduced by each satellite. These results were compared and validated with available D-GPS measurements. In a second step PS displacement data are combined with a landslide inventory, increasing the number of monitored landslides with sufficient PS from 4% to 19%, obtained from C- and X-band data, to 38% of the total (294). Finally, the retrieved multi-sensor landslides velocities are classified with respect to the magnitude of road damages that occurred in the 2008-2010 period. At local scale, the combination of multi-sensor data was useful to differentiate different landslide displacement directions, to measure different velocity patterns within the same moving mass, and to distinguish the slower (natural) and faster (human induced) landslides. The analysis of displacement time series permitted to evaluate the acceleration caused by a destabilising anthropogenic change, and the correlation between displacement variability and seasonal precipitation and melting.

These maps are more valuable to the scientific community and land managers when the accuracy of their classifications has been assessed. Here, we assessed the accuracy of a map of forest disturbance in the watersheds of lake Superior and Lake Michigan based on an improved version of the Vegetation Change Tracker algorithm (VCTw). We constructed a probability-based sampling design using two stages of sampling with stratification at each stage. Results are presented for the portion of the map within the U.S. as well as separately for the U.S. portion of Lake Superior\'s watershed and for lake Michigan\'s watershed. We also present estimates and standard errors of the percent cover for each land cover class that incorporate both the map\'s data and our sample data. The overall accuracy for the U.S. portion of the map is estimated to be 91% with a standard error of 0.8%. We discuss the relative strengths of the VCTw algorithm as well as the dependence of such an algorithm\'s success on the characteristics of the landscape being mapped.

The ESA retrieval procedure for the fast-delivery level 2 ASAR wave spectra has undergone an important update since October 2007. Testing the benefit of the new procedure against ground truth is not straightforward, due to a lack of other independent ocean wave spectral observations; however an indirect comparison of the ASAR wave spectra with altimeter and buoy observations is made possible via a wave model. In addition to the conventional significant wave height (SWH), four spectral sub-range wave heights (SRWHs) are used to illustrate the spectral characteristics of these observations. The indirect comparison is applied on the updated ASAR wave spectra for over one year (November 2007 to December 2008). Results indicate that the updated ASAR spectra are better than the pre-October 2007 data since the updated procedure removes erroneous long waves, and improves the treatment of short waves beyond the detection range of the instrument Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

The approach was applied to the twelve flux sites of the Canadian Carbon Program (CCP) that include grassland, wetland, and temperate and boreal forests across an east-west continental gradient. The spatial variation within the footprint area was evaluated by examining the spatial structure of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and land cover using geostatistical analyses of frequency distribution, variogram and window size. The results show that at most sites (i) the percentages of the target vegetation functional type (dominant land cover) observed by the CCP towers were higher than 60%; (ii) to some extent, most of the CCP sites presented anisotropically distributed patterns of NDVI in the 90% annual footprint climatology area; and (iii) the land surface heterogeneity within the flux footprint area differed among sites. Overall, the forest sites had larger fine-scale spatial variation than the grassland and wetland sites. The coniferous boreal forest sites had greater spatial variability than the two wetland sites and a coniferous temperate forest site. We conclude that the combination of footprint modeling, semivariogram and window size techniques, together with moderate spatial resolution remotely-sensed image data, is a pragmatic approach for assessing the spatial representativeness of flux tower measurements.

Such configurations were found recently by Vlasenko et al. (2010) in numerical simulations carried out with the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm). They showed that the short internal waves, which have wavelengths of 1.5 km and amplitudes of 20 m, ride on second mode ISWs. The existence of these short internal waves, which follow a first mode ISW, can be explained in terms of the Taylor-Goldstein equation that includes a shear in the background current associated with a second mode ISW. The simulations predict that the short internal waves occur in two distinct areas, one close to the Luzon Strait (LS) and the other further west. In the first area, they are generated by the disintegration of a baroclinic bore, which is generated by the interaction of the tidal current with the steep two-ridged topography in the LS. In the second area, they are generated when the faster first mode ISW overtakes the second mode ISW of the previous tidal cycle. We have screened the ASAR archive of the European Space Agency (ESA) and found many SAR images acquired over the northern SCS showing sea surface signatures of such short internal waves trailing a much longer first mode strong ISW. The detailed analysis of six of these SAR images shows good correlation between modeled and observed internal wave fields. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Here we investigated the January 2010 LZS bloom and climatological state using in situ and remote sensing data, including the MODIS phytoplankton absorption coefficient at 443 nm (Aph) as a preferable pigmentation index. Blooming patches of Aph >= 0.02 m(-1) overlaid on a background level of 0.01 m(-1) were discernible for both situations. A twin-core structure of the bloom was identified; the major core lay far offshore in the deep basin to the northwest of Luzon, with a maximum horizontal scale of similar to 250 km, and the other core was nearshore in the Babuyan Channel, with a maximum scale of similar to 100 km. Variations in climatological monthly mean Aph indicate that the LZS bloom as a whole persists from November to February, peaking in December. Further investigations with satellite altimetry and sea surface temperature suggest that the bloom is primarily associated with the Kuroshio and its intrusion, which generate various meso-scale processes and thus induce enhanced nutrient pumping/entrainment from depth when interacting with the topography of the Luzon Strait and the circulation of the northeastern South China Sea (i.e. the Luzon Gyre). Meanwhile, upwelling at the center of the Luzon Gyre contributes to the offshore bloom. The nearshore bloom is substantially enhanced by nutrient input from the Cagayan River. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, passive microwave emissions originate from deeper layers with respect to the skin temperature. So, this inconsistency in sensitivity depths between skin temperatures and microwave temperatures may introduce a discrepancy in the determined emissivity. Previous studies showed that this inconsistency can lead to significant differences between day and night retrievals of land emissivity which can exceed 10%. This study proposes an approach to address this inconsistency and improve the retrieval of land emissivity using microwave observations from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). The diurnal cycle of the microwave brightness temperature (Tb) was constructed over the globe for different frequencies/polarizations using a constellation of satellites. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to evaluate the spatial variation of the Tb diurnal cycle. The diurnal amplitudes of microwave temperatures observed in desert areas were not consistent with the larger amplitudes of the diurnal cycle of skin temperature. Densely vegetated areas with more moisture have shown smaller amplitudes. A lookup table of effective temperature (T-eff) anomalies is constructed based on the Tb diurnal cycle to resolve the inconsistencies between infrared and Tb diurnal variation. This lookup table of T-eff anomalies is a weighted average over the layers contributing to the microwave signal, for each channel and month. The integration of this T-eff in the retrieval of land emissivity reduced the differences between day and night retrieved emissivities to less than 0.01 for AMSR-E observations.

The methodology is based on the application of an algorithm that ensures accurate image geometric registration and the use of a new algorithm for sub-pixel shoreline extraction, both at the sub-pixel level. The analysis of the initial errors shows the influence that differences in reflectance of land cover types have over shoreline detection, allowing us to create a model to substantially reduce these errors. Three correction models were defined according to the type of gain used in the acquisition of the original Landsat images. Error assessment tests were applied on three artificially stabilised coastal segments that have a constant and well-defined land-water boundary. A testing set of 45 images (28 TM, 10 ETM high-gain and 7 ETM low-gain) was used. The mean error obtained in shoreline location ranges from 1.22 to 1.63 m, and the RMSE from 4.69 to 5.47 m. Since the errors follow a normal distribution, then the maximum error at a given probability can be estimated. The results confirm that the use of Landsat imagery for detection of instantaneous coastlines yields accuracy comparable to high-resolution techniques, showing the potential of Landsat TM and ETM images in those applications where the instantaneous lines are a good geomorphological descriptor.

Fuel mapping or biomass estimation requires knowing the diversity and boundaries of the forest patches, as well as their spatial pattern. This includes the thickness of the main vegetation layers, but also the spatial arrangement and size of the individual plants that compose each stratum. In order to decompose the ALS point cloud into genuine 3-D segments corresponding to individual vegetation features, such as shrubs or tree crowns, we apply a statistical approach based on the mean shift algorithm. The segments are progressively assigned to a forest layer: ground vegetation, understory or overstory. Our method relies on a single biophysically meaningful parameter, the kernel bandwidth, which is related to the local forest structure. It is validated on 44 plots of a Portuguese forest, composed mainly of eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus Labill.) and maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) trees. The number of detected trees varies with the dominance position: from 98.6% for the dominant trees to 12.8% for the suppressed trees. Linear regression models explain up to 70% of the variability associated with ground vegetation and understory height. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

For understanding long-term changes in terrestrial ecosystems (post-1981), data collected by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on board the satellites of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) series is a unique source of information. In this paper, we describe a new processing methodology for a comprehensive AVHRR data set at 1 km spatial resolution acquired over Canada, the northern United States and Greenland post-1981. The methodology incorporates a pre-processing algorithm, Canadian AVHRR Processing System (CAPS), recently developed by the Canada Centre of Remote Sensing (CCRS), which enables highly accurate geolocation and ortho-rectification. at efficiency rates of > 90%. Once image navigation is completed, our approach consists of five key steps: first, two clear-sky composites for each 10 day interval are generated from the forward or backward scattering hemisphere; second, AVHRR Channel 1 and 2 reflectances are normalized to the AVHRR/3 on board NOAA-17 to account for differences in the spectral response function among the AVHRR sensors; third, atmospheric correction is performed using the Simplified Method for Atmospheric correction (SMAC) algorithm, using standard meteorological data sets (water vapor, surface level air pressure, ozone); fourth, NDVI is calculated based on atmospherically corrected Channel 1 and 2 reflectances; and finally, the NDVI is adjusted for directional effects based on the Ross-Thick Li-Sparse Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model. The processed NDVI data are compared to an equivalent spatially and temporally overlapping MODIS NDVI data set from 2001 to 2005 for validation. Results at continental scale indicate that time series of MODIS and AVHRR were similar for a wide range of biomes and generalized ecoregions. Analysis stratified by land cover indicated that the correlation was strongest for homogeneous land cover types, such as cropland, when compared to structurally more diverse classes, such as deciduous broadleaf forests. The comparison of the NDVI at the local scale at seven sites of the Fluxnet Canada Research Network resulted in the correlation coefficient r = 0.95. Given confidence in the processing approach, this NDVI data set can be a valuable source of information for climate and vegetation-related studies over Canada and the northern United States.

However, this is not always possible with the high cost and the limited availability of data. Here, we present a technique based on the analysis of multi-temporal Landsat-TM images for studying the dynamics of different dune morphologies from five dune-field sites around the world. A pair of Landsat-TM images for each site has been used after performing several steps of image pre-processing and enhancement (i.e. image co-registration, radiometric calibration and histogram equalization). RGB-clustering is a commonly used algorithm for data compression and iso-clustering. In this study, we implemented this technique as an unconventional change-detection algorithm with 32 clustering partitions per band. A bi-temporal layerstack of the near-infrared bands was the input for the RGB-clustering process. RGB-clustering produced thematic maps that gave an immediate insight into the dune dynamics at the dune-field scale given the availability of Landsat images. The technique gave the best results with dunes developed under uni-directional wind pattern. In addition, it was also easier to detect migration of simple dunes than in compound or complex dunes. These maps can be used as a bi-temporal digital atlas of large dune-systems and help in defining areas for detailed field measurements on dune dynamics and migration. Moreover, it can be implemented in analyzing aeolian systems where field measurements are practically impossible (i.e. large and extra-terrestrial aeolian systems). (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Landsat Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and Brightness Temperature (BT) are used as inputs. Fmask first uses rules based on cloud physical properties to separate Potential Cloud Pixels (PCPs) and clear-sky pixels. Next, a normalized temperature probability, spectral variability probability, and brightness probability are combined to produce a probability mask for clouds over land and water separately. Then, the PCPs and the cloud probability mask are used together to derive the potential cloud layer. The darkening effect of the cloud shadows in the Near Infrared (NIR) Band is used to generate a potential shadow layer by applying the flood-fill transformation. Subsequently, 3D cloud objects are determined via segmentation of the potential cloud layer and assumption of a constant temperature lapse rate within each cloud object. The view angle of the satellite sensor and the illuminating angle are used to predict possible cloud shadow locations and select the one that has the maximum similarity with the potential cloud shadow mask. If the scene has snow, a snow mask is also produced. For a globally distributed set of reference data, the average Fmask overall cloud accuracy is as high as 96.4%. The goal is development of a cloud and cloud shadow detection algorithm suitable for routine usage with Landsat images. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Phenology is also important because it exerts significant control on terrestrial carbon cycling and sequestration. High-quality measurements of green leaf phenology are therefore increasingly important for understanding the effects of climate change on ecosystem function and biosphere-atmosphere interactions. In this paper, we compare \"near-surface\" and satellite remote sensing-based observations of vegetation phenology at four deciduous forest sites. Specifically, we addressed three questions related to how observations of plant phenology measured by red-green-blue (RGB) cameras mounted on towers above forest canopies are related to measurements of phenology acquired by moderate resolution sensors on satellites. First, how are estimated phenophase transition dates or the observable stages in the life cycle of plants influenced by the choice of vegetation index (VI) measured by remote sensing? Second, are VIs and phenological metrics derived from near-surface and satellite remote sensing comparable, and what is the nature and magnitude of covariation between near-surface and satellite-remote sensing-based estimates of phenology at seasonal and interannual time scales? Third, does near-surface remote sensing data provide a basis for validating satellite-derived land surface phenology products and what are the requirements for achieving this goal? Our study provides substantial support for future efforts linking satellite and near-surface remote sensing. We show significant agreement between phenological time series and metrics derived from these two data sources. However, issues of scale and representation strongly influence the relationship between near surface and satellite remote sensing measures of phenology. In particular, intra- and interannual correlation between time series from each source are dependent on how representative the camera FOV is of the regional landscape. Further, our results show that the specific VI used to monitor phenology exerts substantial influence on satellite VI derived phenological metrics, and by extension, how they compare to VI time series and metrics obtained from near-surface remote sensing. These results improve understanding of how near-surface and satellite remote sensing complement each other. However, more work is required to develop formal protocols for evaluating, calibrating and validating satellite remote sensing phenology products using near surface remote sensing at a regional to continental scale.

In this paper we present a regional algorithm (RATE) for automatically monitoring the rate of carbon fixation (as measured by NPP) of tropical forests in South America. The algorithm is based on a modification of the SITE ecosystem model and uses data obtained from the procedures for aggregation and correction of data from the MOD12Q1 and MOD15A2 products and meteorological data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). A correction procedure for the MOD15A2 Leaf area index (LAI) and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) used by the RATE algorithm produced satisfactory LAI and FAPAR estimates when compared against observed values. The algorithm was successfully validated in eight field sites from two types of tropical forests in South America (Amazon rainforest and the Atlantic forest), producing an average error of only 4.72%. When applied to Amazonia, RATE indicates that NPP showed little variation in the 2005 and 2010 drought years (NPP = 1.28 kg-C m(-2) year(-1)) in comparison to non-drought years (NPP = 1.31 kg-C m(-2) year RATE also provides some limited evidence for small decreasing trends in Amazonia carbon assimilation during the period 2001-2010.

Dynamics of the major wetland cover types (Water, Mudflat, Vegetation and Sand) were investigated both as transitions among primary classes based on maximum membership value, and as changes in memberships to all classes even under no change in a primary class. Fuzzy classification accuracy was evaluated as match frequencies between classification outcome and a) the best reference candidate class (MAX function) and b) any acceptable reference class (RIGHT function). MAX-based accuracy was relatively high for Vegetation (>= 90%), Water (>= 82%), Mudflat (>= 76%) and the smallest-area Sand (>= 75%) in all scenes; these scores improved with the RIGHT function to 87-100%. Classification uncertainty assessed as the proportion of fuzzy object area within a class at a given fuzzy threshold value was the highest for all classes in November 2007, and consistently higher for Mudflat than for other classes in all scenes. Vegetation was the dominant class in all scenes, occupying 41.2-49.3% of the study area. Object memberships to Vegetation mostly declined from November 2007 to February 2008 and increased substantially only in February-March 2008, possibly reflecting growing season conditions and grazing. Spatial extent of Water both declined and increased during the study period, reflecting precipitation and hydrological events. The \"fuzziest\" Mudflat class was involved in major detected transitions among classes and declined in classification accuracy by March 2008, representing a key target for finer-scale research. Future work should introduce Vegetation sub-classes reflecting differences in phenology and alternative methods to discriminate Mudflat from other classes. Results can be used to guide field sampling and top-down landscape analyses in this wetland. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The goal of the study was to select the algorithm which provides the highest and the most uniform SST accuracy within the area observed by the geostationary sensor. The previously established algorithms, such as Non-Linear Regression (NLR) and Optimal Estimation (OE) were implemented along with two new algorithms, Incremental Regression (IncR) and Corrected Non-Linear Regression (CNLR), developed within preparations for the GOES-R ABI mission. OE. IncR and CNLR adopt the first guesses for SST and brightness temperatures (BT) and retrieve deviations of SST from the first guess (increments). OE retrieves SST increments with inversion of the radiative transfer model, whereas CNLR and IncR use regression equations. The difference between CNLR and IncR is that CNLR uses NLR coefficients, whereas IncR implies optimization of coefficients specifically for incremental formulation. Accuracy and precision of SST retrievals were evaluated by comparison with drifting buoys. The major observations from this study are as follows: 1) all algorithms adopting first guesses for SST and BTs are capable of improving SST accuracy and precision over NLR; and 2) IncR delivers the highest overall SST precision and the most uniform distributions of regional SST accuracy and precision. This paper also addresses implementation and validation issues such as bias correction in simulated BTs; preserving sensitivity of incremental SST retrievals to true SST variations; and selection of criteria for optimization and validation of incremental algorithms.

Circumpolar tree canopy cover (TCC) throughout the ecotone was derived by averaging MODIS VCF data from 2000 to 2005 and adjusting the averaged values using linear equations relating MODIS TCC to Quickbird-derived tree cover estimates. The adjustment helped mitigate VCFs overestimation of tree cover in lightly forested regions. An image segmentation procedure was used to group pixels representing similar tree cover into polygonal features (segmentation objects) that form the map of the transition zone. Each polygon represents an area much larger than the 500 m MODIS pixel and characterizes the patterns of sparse forest patches on a regional scale. Those polygons near the boreal/tundra interface with either (1) mean adjusted TCC values from 5 to 20%, or (2) mean adjusted TCC values <5% but with a standard deviation >5% were used to identify the ecotone. Comparisons of the adjusted average tree cover data were made with (1) two existing tree line definitions aggregated for each 1 longitudinal interval in North America and Eurasia, (2) Landsat-derived Canadian proportion of forest cover for Canada, and (3) with canopy cover estimates extracted from airborne profiling lidar data that transected 1238 of the TCC polygons. The adjusted TCC from MODIS VCF shows, on average, <12% TCC for all but one regional zone at the intersection with independently delineated tree lines. Adjusted values track closely with Canadian proportion of forest cover data in areas of low tree cover.

The previously published vegetation map of the Amazon River floodplain (Hess et al., 2003), based on data acquired in 1996, shows enormous difference in vegetation cover classes between the regions upstream and downstream of the city of Manaus. The upper floodplain is mostly covered by forests, while the lower floodplain is predominantly occupied by grasses and shrubs.   This study assesses deforestation in the Lower Amazon floodplain over a similar to 30 year period by producing and comparing a historical vegetation map based on MSS/Landsat images acquired in the late 1970s with a recent vegetation map produced from TM/Landsat images obtained in 2008. The maps were generated through the following steps: 1) normalization and mosaicking of images for each decade; 2) application of a linear mixing model transformation to produce vegetation, soil and shade fraction-images; and 3) object-oriented image analysis and classification. For both maps, the following classes were mapped: floodplain forest, non-forest floodplain vegetation, bare soil and open water. The two maps were combined using object-level Boolean operations to identify time transitions among the mapped classes, resulting in a map of the land cover change occurred over similar to 30 years. Ground information collected at 168 ground points was used to build confusion matrices and calculate Kappa indices of agreement. A survey strategy combining field observations and interviews allowed the collection of information about both recent and historical land cover for validation purposes. Kappa values (0.77, 0.75 and 0.75) indicated the good quality of the maps, and the error estimates were used to adjust the estimated deforested area to a value of 3457 km(2) +/- 1062 km(2) (95% CI) of floodplain deforestation over the similar to 30 years.

Accurate burned area estimates are important for modeling fire-induced trace gas emissions and rehabilitating post-fire landscapes. High spatial and spectral resolution MODIS/ASTER (MASTER) airborne simulator data acquired over three 2007 southern California burns were used to evaluate the sensitivity of different spectral indices at discriminating burned land shortly after a fire. The performance of the indices, which included both traditional and new band combinations, was assessed by means of a separability index that provides an assessment of the effectiveness of a given index at discriminating between burned and unburned land. In the context of burned land applications results demonstrated (i) that the highest sensitivity of the longer short wave infrared (SWIR) spectral region (1.9 to 2.5 mu m) was found at the band interval from 2.31 to 2.36 mu m, (ii) the high discriminatory power of the mid infrared spectral domain (3 to 5.5 mu m) and (iii) the high potential of emissivity data. As a consequence, a newly proposed index which combined near infrared (NIR), longer SWIR and emissivity outperformed all other indices when results were averaged over the three fires. Results were slightly different between land cover types (shrubland vs. forest-woodland). Prior to use in the indices the thermal infrared data were separated into temperature and emissivity to assess the benefits of using both temperature and emissivity. Currently, the only spaceborne sensor that provides moderate spatial resolution (<100 m) temperature and emissivity data is the Advanced Spaceborne and Thermal Emission Radiometer (ASTER). Therefore, our findings can open new perspectives for the utility of future sensors, such as the Hyperspectral Infrared (HyspIRI) sensor. However, further research is required to evaluate the performance of the newly proposed band combinations in other vegetation types and different fire regimes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The annual extent of fire-damaged forest in Amazonia remains uncertain due to difficulties in separating burning from other types of forest damage in satellite data. We developed a new approach, the Burn Damage and Recovery (BDR) algorithm, to identify fire-related canopy damages using spatial and spectral information from multi-year time series of satellite data. The BDR approach identifies understory fires in intact and logged Amazon forests based on the reduction and recovery of live canopy cover in the years following fire damages and the size and shape of individual understory burn scars. The BDR algorithm was applied to time series of Landsat (1997-2004) and MODIS (2000-2005) data covering one Landsat scene (path/row 226/068) in southern Amazonia and the results were compared to field observations, image-derived burn scars, and independent data on selective logging and deforestation. Landsat resolution was essential for detection of burn scars < 50 ha, yet these small burns contributed only 12% of all burned forest detected during 1997-2002. MODIS data were suitable for mapping medium (50-500 ha) and large (> 500 ha) burn scars that accounted for the majority of all fire-damaged forests in this study. Therefore, moderate resolution satellite data may be suitable to provide estimates of the extent of fire-damaged Amazon forest at a regional scale. In the study region, Undsat-based understory fire damages in 1999 (1508 km(2)) were an order of magnitude higher than during the 1997-1998 El Nino event (124 km(2) and 39 km(2), respectively), suggesting a different link between climate and understory fires than previously reported for other Amazon regions. The results in this study illustrate the potential to address critical questions concerning climate and fire risk in Amazon forests by applying the BDR algorithm over larger areas and longer image time series.

Validation of remotely sensed estimates was conducted during almost two growth cycles (August 2007-October 2008) over seven sites that differed in soil properties, water status and canopy structure. S-SEBI and WDI were also intercompared at the watershed extent by considering ASTER imagery collected between 2002 and 2008. In order to alleviate the experimental efforts devoted to the validation exercise, ground truthing relied on in situ estimates from the HYDRUS-1D model that simulates water transfers within the vadose zone after calibration against measured soil moisture profiles. For two of the seven validation sites, the consistency of the HYDRUS-1D simulations was beforehand controlled against direct measurements with eddy covariance devices. Thus, it was shown the HYDRUS-1D simulations could be used as ground truthing.   Despite the use of simple differencing methods over a complex row-structured landscape, the obtained accuracies (0.8 mm.d(-1) for S-SEBI and 1.1 mm.d(-1) for WDI) were similar to those reported in the literature for simpler canopies, and fulfilled requirements for further applications in agronomy and hydrology. WDI performed worse than S-SEBI, in spite of more determinism within the derivation of evaporative extremes used for temperature differencing. This raised the question of compromising between process description and measurement availability. Analyzing validation results suggested that among the possible factors that could affect model performance (spatial variability, soil type and color, row orientation), the first-order influence was row orientation, a property that can be characterized from very high spatial resolution remote sensing data. Finally, intercomparing S-SEBI and WDI at the watershed extent showed estimates from both models agreed within 1 mm.d(-1), a difference similar to the model accuracies as estimated by the validation exercise. Then, time averaged maps suggested the existence of spatial patterns at the watershed extent, which may be ascribed to combined effects from soil type, soil depth and watertable level.

To date, the relationship between spectral reflectance and GWC in leaves is poorly understood due to the confounding effects of unpredictably varying water and dry matter ratios on spectral response. Few studies have attempted to estimate GWC from leaf reflectance spectra, particularly for a variety of species. This paper investigates the spectroscopic estimation of leaf GWC using continuous wavelet analysis applied to the reflectance spectra (350-2500 nm) of 265 leaf samples from 47 species observed in tropical forests of Panama. A continuous wavelet transform was performed on each of the reflectance spectra to generate a wavelet power scalogram compiled as a function of wavelength and scale. Linear relationships were built between wavelet power and GWC expressed as a function of dry mass (LWCD) and fresh mass (LWCF) in order to identify wavelet features (coefficients) that are most sensitive to changes in GWC. The derived wavelet features were then compared to three established spectral indices used to estimate GWC across a wide range of species.   Eight wavelet features observed between 1300 and 2500 nm provided strong correlations with LWCD, though correlations between spectral indices and leaf GWC were poor. In particular, two features captured amplitude variations in the broad shape of the reflectance spectra and three features captured variations in the shape and depth of dry matter (e.g., protein, lignin, cellulose) absorptions centered near 1730 and 2100 nm. The eight wavelet features used to predict LWCD and LWCF were not significantly different; however, predictive models used to determine LWCD and LWCF differed. The most accurate estimates of LWCD and LWCF obtained from a single wavelet feature showed root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 28.34% (R-2 = 0.62) and 4.86% (R-2 = 0.69), respectively. Models using a combination of features resulted in a noticeable improvement predicting LWCD and LWCF with RMSEs of 26.04% (R-2 = 0.71) and 4.34% (R-2 = 0.75), respectively. These results provide new insights into the role of dry matter absorption features in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral region for the accurate spectral estimation of LWCD and LWCF.

In this study, a water optical classification algorithm is developed, and two semi-analytical algorithms (three- and four-band algorithm) for estimating Chla are calibrated and validated using four independent datasets collected from Taihu Lake, Chaohu Lake, and Three Gorges Reservoir. The optical classification algorithm is developed using the dataset collected in Taihu Lake from 2006 to 2009. This dataset is also used to calibrate the three- and four-band Chla estimation algorithms. The optical classification technique uses remote sensing reflectance at three bands: Rrs(G), Rrs(650), and Rrs (NIR), where G indicates the location of reflectance peak in the green region (around 560 nm), and NIR is the location of reflectance peak in the near-infrared region (around 700 nm). Optimal reference wavelengths of the three- and four-band algorithm are located through model tuning and accuracy optimization. The three- and four-band algorithm accuracy is further evaluated using other three independent datasets. The improvement of optical classification in Chla estimation is revealed by comparing the performance of the two algorithms for non-classified and classified waters.   Using the slopes of the three reflectance bands, the 138 reflectance spectra samples in the calibration dataset are classified into three classes, each with a specific spectral shape character. The three- and four-band algorithm performs well for both non-classified and classified waters in estimating Chla. For non-classified waters, strong relationships are yielded between measured and predicted Chla, but the performance of the two algorithms is not satisfactory in low Chla conditions, especially for samples with Chla below 30 mg m(-3). For classified waters, the class-specific algorithms perform better than for non-classified waters. Class-specific algorithms reduce considerable mean relative error from algorithms for non-classified waters in Chla predicting. Optical classification makes that there is no need to adjust the optimal position to estimate Chla for other waters using the class-specific algorithms. The findings in this study demonstrate that optical classification can greatly improve the accuracy of Chla estimation in optically complex waters. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Accurate vegetation heights can be determined using waveform metrics that include vertical extent and extent of the waveform\'s trailing and leading edges. All three indices are highly dependent upon the signal strength, background noise and signal-to-noise ratio of the waveform, as the background noise contribution to the waveforms has to be removed before their calculation. Over the last six years, GLAS has collected data during thirteen observation periods using illumination from three different lasers. The power levels of these lasers have changed over time, resulting in variable signal power and noise characteristics. Atmospheric conditions vary continuously, also influencing signal power and noise.   To minimize these effects, we optimized a noise coefficient which could be constant or vary according to observation period or noise metric. This parameter is used with the mean and standard deviation of the background noise to determine a noise level threshold that is removed from each waveform. An optimization analysis was used with a global dataset of waveforms that are near-coincident with waveforms from other observation periods; the goal of the optimization was to minimize the difference in vertical extent between spatially overlapping GLAS observations. Optimizations based on absolute difference in height led to situations in which the total extent was minimized as well; further optimizations reduced a normalized difference in height extent. The simplest optimizations were based on a constant value to be applied to all observations; noise coefficients of 2.7, 3.2, 3.4 and 4.0 were determined for datasets consisting of global forests, global vegetation, forest in the legal Amazon basin and boreal forests respectively. Optimizations based on the power level or the signal-to-noise ratio of waveforms best minimized differences in waveform extent, decreasing the percent root mean squared height difference by 25-54% over the constant value approach. Further development of methods to ensure temporal consistency of waveform indices will be necessary to support long-term satellite lidar missions and will result in more accurate and precise estimates of canopy height.

RefL1b is a new reflectance dataset produced for this study using ASTER Level 1B data, crosstalk correction, radiance correction factors, and concurrently acquired level 2 MODIS water vapor data The AST_07XT data product, available from EDC and ERSDAC. incorporates crosstalk correction and non-concurrently acquired MODIS water vapor data for atmospheric correction. Spectral accuracy was determined using difference values which were compiled from ASTER band 5/6 and 9/8 ratios of AST_07XT or RefL1b data subtracted from similar ratios calculated for field sample and AVIRIS reflectance data. In addition, Spectral Analyst, a statistical program that utilizes a Spectral Feature Fitting algorithm, was used to quantitatively assess spectral accuracy of AST_07XT and RefL1b data.   Spectral Analyst matched more minerals correctly and had higher scores for the RefL1b data than for AST_07XT data. The radiance correction factors used in the RefL1b data corrected a low band 5 reflectance anomaly observed in the AST_07XT and AST_07 data but also produced anomalously high band 5 reflectance in RefL1b spectra with strong band 5 absorption for minerals, such as alunite Thus, the band 5 anomaly seen in the RefL1b data cannot be corrected using additional gain adjustments. In addition, the use of concurrent MODIS water vapor data in the atmospheric correction of the RefL1b data produced datasets that had lower band 9 reflectance anomalies than the AST_07XT data Although assessment of spectral data suggests that RefL1b data are more consistent and spectrally more correct than AST_07XT data, the Spectral Analyst results indicate that spectral discrimination between some minerals, such as alunite and kaolinite, are still not possible unless additional spectral calibration using site specific spectral data are performed.

The presence of sulfur springs associated with glacial ice is extremely rare in a terrestrial context, and the resulting deposits may provide a field analog to non-ice materials on the surface of Europa. Spectral characterization of the supraglacial deposits in the visible-near infrared (VIS-NIR) range, 0.4-2.5 mu m, was carried out using reflectance spectra collected in situ using a field spectrometer during the 2006 field season. These spectra, while dominated by melting snow, ice, and sulfur, show that some absorption features of the sulfates are shifted in wavelength with respect to library spectra due to the effects of mixing or temperature. Absorption features of calcite are largely absent, potentially due to mineral partitioning effects within the deposits. Investigations into changes in mineralogy within the deposits over the course of the active season using data collected by the Hyperion hyperspectral visible/infrared spectrometer aboard the Earth Observing 1 spacecraft (EO-1) were limited by low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios in the data, although they indicate that sulfur is remaining stable. This is confirmed by seasonal data on the extent of the deposits, obtained using a classification algorithm running onboard the satellite, which continued to detect the presence of sulfur until snow obscured the site. Ground truth for the observations is provided by mineralogical analyses obtained by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements and laboratory reflectance spectra from 0.2-25 mu m obtained of samples returned from the site in 2006. We show that while sulfur, the main constituent of the deposits, is well represented in Hyperion data, minor constituents such as calcite and gypsum can be partially or entirely masked in the data. In spite of these effects, autonomous detection methods can be utilized to monitor the generation and extent of the deposits, whose spectral properties show similarities with those of Europa\'s non-ice materials.

As a consequence, models to predict height from diameter measurements have been widely developed in the forestry literature. Through the use of airborne laser scanning technology (e.g., LiDAR), tree variables such as height and crown diameter can be measured accurately, a development which has spawned the need for models to predict diameter from airborne laser-derived measurements. Although some work has been done for fitting such models, none have incorporated spatial information to improve the accuracy of the predicted diameters. Using a simple linear model for predicting tree diameter from laser-derived tree height and crown diameter measurements, we compared the performance of ordinary least squares (OLS), generalized least squares with a non-null correlation structure (GLS), linear mixed-effects model (LME), and geographically weighted regression (GWR). Our data were obtained from 36 sample plots established in Norway. This is the first study to examine the use of spatial statistical models for tree-level LiDAR data. Root mean square prediction errors in tree diameter with LME are 3.5%, with GWR are 10%, and with OLS and GLS are 17%. LME also exhibited low variability in predicting performance across all the validation classes (based on laser-derived height). Giving the difficulties of using parametric statistical inference (such as maximum likelihood-based indices) for GWR, we used permutation tests as a way for detecting statistical differences. LME was significantly better than the other models, as well as GWR was to OLS and GLS. Our results indicate that the LME model produced the best predictions of tree diameter from LiDAR-based variables to a degree that has previously not been possible. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Greenland Climate Network (GC-Net) measurements from 1997 through 2007 exhibit the trend of modest surface brightening with increasing SZA on both diurnal and seasonal timescales. SZA explains up to 50% of seasonal albedo variability. The two other environmental factors considered, temperature and cloudiness, play much less significant roles in seasonal albedo variability at the five stations studied. Compared to the 10-year record of these GC-Net measurements, the five-year record of MODIS satellite-retrieved snow albedo shows a systematic negative bias for SZA larger than about 55 degrees. Larger bias of MODIS snow albedo exists at more northerly stations. MODIS albedos successfully capture the snow albedo dependence on SZA and have a relatively good agreement with GC-Net measurements for SZA<55 degrees. The discrepancy of MODIS albedo with in situ albedo and with theory is determined mainly by two related factors. SZA and retrieval quality. While the spatioternporal structure, especially zonal features, of the MODIS-retrieved albedo may be correct for large SZA, the accuracy deteriorates for SZA>55 degrees and often becomes physically unrealistic for SZA > 65 degrees. This unphysical behavior biases parameterizations of surface albedo and restricts the range of usefulness of the MODIS albedo products. Seasonal-to-interannual trends in surface brightness in Greenland, and in polar (i.e., large SZA) regions in general, and model simulations of these trends, should be evaluated in light of these limitations.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), like other polar-orbiting wide field of view satellite sensors, can provide global observations on a nearly daily basis, but the sparseness of valid observations due to cloud, residual atmospheric effects, and sensor anomalies, may result in gaps in the derived reflectance time series. This paper presents an approach for the generation of temporally complete daily MODIS 500 m nadir view BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) time series. The research is illustrated and assessed quantitatively using two years of cloud and snow screened, daily MODIS Terra and Aqua reflectance data at four sites in Africa, and demonstrated for phenology monitoring using NBAR derived NDVI time series. The components of the approach include: 1) an outlier detection algorithm to remove residual anomalous daily observations undetected in the upstream processing, 2) the dynamic generation of NBAR time series on a daily basis when seven or more observations are available for a day under consideration over a 16-day period, and 3) the means to gap fill the NBAR time series where less than 7 observations are available. The MODIS Ross-Thick/Li-Sparse-Reciprocal BRDF model is used with a rolling approach whereby a 16-day BRDF inversion window is moved on a daily overlapping basis to provide more reliable outlier detection and daily NBAR. NBAR gap filling in periods of missing observations is investigated using static land cover specific archetype BRDF parameters and using BRDF parameters defined adaptively from the temporally closest 16-day periods with 7 or more observations. Scaling factor estimators using ordinary least squares (OLS) and median-based robust least squares regression are investigated, and the robust method is demonstrated to provide on average temporally more coherent gap filled NBAR values. For regions with persistent clouds, the utility of the adaptive NBAR gap filling method is demonstrated to be severely limited due to the decreased likelihood that the surface BRDF at each gap can be described reliably. The reliability of the NBAR gap filling methodology is evaluated statistically using a cross-validation approach. For the small number of study site considered, the adaptive method is shown to provide more accurate results than the archetype method when there are more than an average of similar to 4-5 observations per 16-day window, or when a gap day is on average less than about 30 days from a 16-day period with 7 or more observations. The resulting gap free daily NBAR time series and derived daily NBAR NDVI generated by the approach is shown to capture phenological variations in a coherent temporally consistent manner, suggesting that it is a fruitful avenue for future research and validation.

The algorithm uses SSM/I brightness temperatures recorded in the early morning. Three critical indices are used as classification criteria-the scattering index (SI), the 37 GHz vertical polarization brightness temperature (T-37v), and the 19 GHz polarization difference (PD19). The thresholds of these criteria were obtained from samples of frozen soil, thawed soil, desert, and snow. The algorithm is capable of distinguishing between frozen soil, thawed soil, desert and precipitation. In-situ 4-cm deep soil temperatures on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau were used to validate the classification results, and the average classification accuracy was found to be 87% Regarding the misclassified pixels, about 40% and 73% of them appeared when the surface soil temperature ranged from -0.5 degrees C to 0.5 degrees C and from -2.0 degrees C to 2.0 degrees C, respectively, which means that most misclassifications occurred near the soil freezing point In addition, misclassifications mainly occurred from April to May and September to October, the transition periods between warm and cold seasons. A grid-to-grid Kappa analysis was also conducted to evaluate the consistency between the map of the actual number of frozen days obtained using the decision tree classification algorithm and the reference map of geocryological regionalization and classification in China. The overall classification accuracy was 91.7%, and the Kappa index was 80.5%. The boundary between the frozen and thawed soil was consistent with the southern limit of seasonally frozen ground from the reference map. The statistics show that the maximum area of frozen soil is about 6.82 x 10(6) km(2) in late January, accounting for 69% of total Chinese land area. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The method operates by representing the shape of the function that maps model parameters to spectral reflectance by an adaptive look-up tree (ALUT) that evenly distributes the discretization error of tabulated reflectances in spectral space. A post-processing step organizes the data into a binary space partitioning tree that facilitates an efficient inversion search algorithm. In an example shallow water remote sensing application, the method performs faster than an implementation of previously published methodology and has the same accuracy in bathymetric retrievals. The method has no user configuration parameters requiring expert knowledge and minimizes the number of forward model runs required, making it highly suitable for routine operational implementation of image analysis methods. For the research community, straightforward and robust inversion allows research to focus on improving the radiative transfer models themselves without the added complication of devising an inversion strategy.

For example, the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) provides a measure of greenness of the vegetation that can be used to predict net primary production. However, ecosystem models relying on remote sensing data for EVI or other vegetation indices are limited by the time series of the satellite data record. Our objective was to develop a statistical model to predict EVI in order to extend the time series for modeling applications. To explain the functional behavior of the seasonal EVI curves, a two-stage multiple regression fitting procedure within a semi-parametric mixed effect (SPME) model framework was used. First, a linear mixed effect (LME) model was fitted to the EVI with climate indexes, crop and irrigation information as predictor variables. Second, Penalized B-splines were used to explain the behavior of the smooth residuals, which result from a smooth model fit to the smooth EVI data curve, in order to describe the uncertainty of the EVI curve. Individual models were fit within individual Major Land Resources Areas (MLRAs). Predicted seasonal EVI, derived from our regression equations, showed a strong agreement with the observed EVI and was able to capture the site by site and year by year variation in the EVI curve. Out-of-sample prediction produced excellent results for a majority of the sites, except for sites without clear seasonal patterns, which may have resulted from cloud contamination and/or snow cover. Therefore, given the appropriate climate, crop, and irrigation information, the proposed approach can be used to predict seasonal EVI curves for extending the time series into the past and future.

Several aspects however potentially introduce noise in the NDVI data set due to the AVHRR sensor design and data processing. More recent NDVI data sets from both Terra MODIS and SPOT VGT data are considered an improvement over AVHRR and these products in theory provide a possibility to evaluate the accuracy of GIMMS NDVI time series trend analysis for the overlapping period of available data. In this study the accuracy of the GIMMS NDVI time series trend analysis is evaluated by comparison with the 1 km resolution Terra MODIS (MOD13A2) 16-day composite NDVI data, the SPOT Vegetation (VGT) 10-day composite (S10) NDVI data and in situ measurements of a test site in Dahra, Senegal. Linear least squares regression trend analysis on eight years of GIMMS annual average NDVI (20002007) has been compared to Terra MODIS (1 km and 8 km resampled) and SPOT VGT NDVI data 1 km (20002007). The three data products do not exhibit identical patterns of NDVI trends. SPOT VGT NDVI data are characterised by higher positive regression slopes over the 8-year period as compared to Terra MODIS and AVHRR GIMMS NDVI data, possibly caused by a change in channels 1 and 2 spectral response functions from SPOT VGT1 to SPOT VGT2 in 2003. Trend analysis of AVHRR GIMMS NDVI exhibits a regression slope range in better agreement with Terra MODIS NDVI for semi-arid areas. However, GIMMS NDVI shows a tendency towards higher positive regression slope values than Terra MODIS in more humid areas. Validation of the different NDVI data products against continuous in situ NDVI measurements for the period 2002-2007 in the semi-arid Senegal revealed a good agreement between in situ measurements and all satellite based NDVI products. Using Terra MODIS NDVI as a reference, it is concluded that AVHRR GIMMS coarse resolution NDVI data set is well-suited for long term vegetation studies of the Sahel-Sudanian areas receiving < 1000 mm rainfall, whereas interpretation of GIMMS NDVI trends in more humid areas of the Sudanian-Guinean zones should be done with certain reservations.

Monitoring forest changes arising from such disturbances and the post-disturbance recovery processes is essential for assessing the conditions of the NFs and the effectiveness of management approaches. In this study, we used time series stacks of Landsat images (LTSS) to evaluate the dynamics of seven NFs in eastern United States, including the De Soto NF the Talladega NF the Francis Marion NF and the Uwharrie NF in southeastern U.S., and the Chequamegon NF, the Hiawatha NF, and the Superior NF in northern U.S. Each LTSS consisted of 12-14 Landsat images acquired for the same location, spanning from 1984 to 2006 with a nominal interval of one image every 2 years. Each LTSS was analyzed using a vegetation change tracker (VCT) algorithm to map forest disturbance. Accuracy assessments of the derived disturbance maps revealed that they had overall accuracy values of about 80%, with most of the disturbance classes having user\'s accuracies ranging from 70% to 95%. The producer\'s accuracies were generally lower, with the majority being in the range between 50% and 70%. While this may suggest that the disturbance maps could slightly underestimate disturbances, a more detailed assessment of the omission errors revealed that the majority of the disagreements were due to minor disturbances like thinning or storm damages that were identified by the image analysts but were not captured by the VCT algorithm.   The derived disturbance year maps revealed that while each of the seven NFs consisted of 90% or more forest land, significant portions of the forests were disturbed since 1984. Mapped disturbances accounted for about 30%-45% of total land area in the four NFs in southeastern U.S. and about 10%-20% in the three NFs in northern U.S. The disturbance rates were generally higher in the buffer zones surrounding each NF, and varied considerably over time. The time series approach employed in this study represents a new approach for monitoring forest resources using the Landsat or similar satellite data records. The disturbance products derived using this approach were spatially explicit and contained much more temporal details than conventional bi-temporal change products, and likely will be found more useful by many users including ecologists and resources managers. The high disturbance rates found in the southeastern U.S. suggest that this region may have a more significant role in modulating the atmospheric carbon budget than currently recognized.

The former is mainly sensitive to the colored dissolved organic material (CDOM), albeit influenced by the a [gal content as depicted by the chlorophyll concentration, ([Chl]); in contrast, the latter is essentially depending on [Chl], although it is also influenced by CDOM. Therefore the signatures of CDOM and [Chl] which are not truly separable. can nevertheless be identified by considering simultaneously the two ratios. The concomitant variations in these ratios can be established via a bio-optical model developed for Case I waters. This model implicitly includes a \"mean\" relationship between CDOM and [Chl], and thus produces a unique curve relating R-443(412) and R-555(490). Deviations with respect to this mean relationship can be introduced through a factor (phi), with (phi)>1 (excess) or <1 (deficit), applied to the CDOM[Chl] ratio. A family of R-443(412) and R-555(490) curves is thus generated, in correspondence with the discrete values given to (phi); this \"grid\" (or numerically, a 2-D lookup table) allows the phi-[Chl] couple to be unambiguously derived for any R-443(412) and R-555(490) couple. By applying this straightforward algorithm to actual reflectance ratios derived from ocean color imagery, the relative anomalies in CDOM with respect to its standard (Chl-related) values can be efficiently assessed. Within the global ocean (discarding the coastal zones), the phi factor is widely varying, between at least and 3, and is roughly log-normally distributed around similar to 1 (no anomaly). The spatial distributions of the phi factor in the whole ocean are Strongly featured according to latitude, season, and hydrographic regimes, and these features are regularly reproducible, from year to year (2002-2007). This simple method is also validated against available in situ data, and its results compare favorably, for instance, to those of the GSM (Garver-Siegel-Maritorena) inversion method, in terms of retrieved CDOM concentrations and distribution patterns.

It mainly consisted of assessing the FORMOSAT-2 spectral and directional configurations that are unusual, with a single off nadir viewing angle over four visible-near infra red wavebands. Images were collected over an agricultural region located in South Eastern France, with a three day frequency from the growing season to post-harvest. Simultaneously, numerous ground based measurements were performed over various crops such as wheat, meadow, rice and maize. Albedo and LAI were estimated using empirical approaches that have been widely used for usual directional and spectral configurations (i.e. multidirectional or single nadir viewing angle over visible-near infrared wavebands). Two methods devoted to albedo estimation were assessed. based on stepwise multiple regression and neural network (NNT). Although both methods gave satisfactory results, the NNT performed better (relative RMSE=3.5% versus 7.3%), especially for low vegetation covers over dark or wet soils that corresponded to albedo values lower than 0.20. Four approaches for LAI estimation were assessed. The first approach based on a stepwise multiple regression over reflectances had the worst performance (relative RMSE=65%), when compared to the equally performing NDVI based heuristic relationship and reflectance based NNT approach (relative RMSE=34%).The NDVI based neural network approach had the best performance (relative RMSE=27.5%), due to the combination of NDVI efficient normalization properties and NNT flexibility. The high FORMOSAT-2 revisit frequency allowed next replicating the dynamics of albedo and LAI, and detecting to some extents cultural practices like vegetation cuts. It also allowed investigating possible relationships between albedo and LAI. The latter depicted specific trends according to vegetation types, and were very similar when derived from ground based data, remotely sensed observations or radiative transfer simulations. These relationships also depicted large albedo variabilities for low LAI values, which confirmed that estimating one variable from the other would yield poor performances for low vegetation cover with varying soil backgrounds. Finally, this empirical study demonstrated, in the context of exhaustively describing the spatiotemporal variability of surface properties, the potential synergy between 1) ground based web-sensors that continuously monitor specific biophysical variables over few locations, and 2) high spatial resolution satellite with high revisit frequencies.

Previous studies using remotely sensed data to retrieve burn severity, as measured by the Composite Burn Index (CBI), have found inconsistencies, since spectral indices work well in some ecosystems but not in others. These inconsistencies may be caused by the lack of spectral uniqueness in the CBI definition, or by the performance of the spectral indices used. This paper analyses the former aspect, using a simulation analysis to study the relationships between the CBI and reflectance. Subsequently, a modified version of this index, called GeoCBI, is proposed to improve the retrieval of burn severity from remotely sensed data. GeoCBI takes into account the fraction of cover (FCOV) of the different vegetation strata used to compute the CBI. Moreover, it also includes the changes in the leaf area index (LAI) for the intermediate and tall tree strata (D+E). Field and simulation results show that GeoCBI is more consistently related to spectral reflectance than CBI for different ranges of burn severities, while keeping its ecological meaning.

We use an empirical approach that removes the first order effects of [ChI] from satellite ocean color, thus allowing us to quantify the impact on the ocean color signal of optical anomalies that vary independently of the global mean trends with remotely sensed [ChI]. We then present statistical and modeling analyses to interpret the observed anomalies in terms of their optical sources (i.e. absorption and backscattering coefficients). We identify two main sources of second order variability for a given [ChI]: 1) the amount of non-algal absorption, especially due to colored dissolved organic matter; and 2) the amplitude of the backscattering coefficient of particles. The global distribution of the anomalies displays significant regional and seasonal trends, providing important information for characterizing the marine optical environment and for inferring biogeochemical influences. We subsequently use our empirically determined anomalies to estimate the backscattering coefficient of particles and the combined absorption coefficient for colored detrital and dissolved materials. This purely empirical approach provides an independent assessment of second order optical variability for comparison with existing methods that are generally based on semi-analytical models.

These relationships were assessed during the annual March-September dry down period for both individual sites, and sites pooled by functional type. The visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI) consistently had the strongest relationships for individual site regressions. An independent method of accuracy assessment, cross validation. was used to determine model robustness for pooled site regressions. Regression models were developed with n-1 datasets and tested on the dataset that was withheld. Additional variables were included in the regression models to account for site-specific and interannual differences in vegetation amount and condition. This allowed a single equation to be used for a given functional type. Multiple linear regression models based on pooled sites had slightly lower adjusted R-2 values compared with simple linear regression models for individual sites. The best regression models for chaparral and CSS were inverted, and LFM was mapped across Los Angeles County, California (LAC). The methods used in this research show promise for monitoring LFM in chaparral and may be applicable to other Mediterranean shrubland communities. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Visible to near-infrared (VNIR) reflectance spectra were measured in the field over the 2004-2006 growing seasons to assess the phenological variability of the dominant marsh plant species, Spartina patens, Phragmites australis and Typha spp. Phragmites was best distinguished from other species by its high NIR response late in the growing season. Typha spp. had a high red/green ratio and S. patens had a unique green/blue ratio relative to other species throughout the bulk of the growing season. The field spectra and single date (2004) LiDAR canopy height data were used to define an object-oriented classification methodology for the three plant communities in multi-temporal QuickBird multispectral imagery collected over the same time interval. The classification was validated using an extensive field inventory of marsh species. Overall maximum fuzzy accuracy for the classification was 97% for Phragmites, 63% for Typha spp. and 80% for S. patens meadows and improved to 97%, 76%. and 92%, respectively, using a fuzzy acceptable match measure. This study demonstrated the importance of the timing of image acquisition for the identification of targeted plant species in a heterogeneous marsh. These datasets and protocols may provide coastal resource managers, municipal officials and researchers a set of recommended guidelines for remote sensing data collection for marsh inventory and monitoring.

Various sources of noise affect the information received by satellites, making it difficult to differentiate the surface signal from noise and complicates attempts to obtain homogeneous time series. We compare different procedures developed to create homogeneous time series of Landsat images, including sensor calibration, atmospheric and topographic correction, and radiometric normalization. Two seasonal time series of Landsat images were created for the middle Ebro Valley (NE Spain) covering the period 1984-2007. Different processing steps were tested and the best option selected according to quantitative statistics obtained from invariant areas, simultaneous medium-resolution images, and field measurements. The optimum procedure includes cross-calibration between Landsat sensors, atmospheric correction using complex radiative transfer models, a non-lambertian topographic correction, and a relative radiometric normalization using an automatic procedure. Finally, three case studies are presented to illustrate the role of the different radiometric correction procedures when analyzing and explaining gradual and abrupt temporal changes in vegetation cover, as well as temporal variability. We have shown that to analyze different vegetation processes with Landsat data, it is necessary to accurately ensure the homogeneity of the multitemporal datasets by means of complex radiometric correction procedures. Failure to follow such a procedure may mean that the analyzed processes are non-recognizable and that the obtained results are invalid. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Variations in the spectral absorption features of lattice CH and oxygen on the mineral Surface due to the combination of different heavy metals were linked to actual concentrations of heavy metals. The ratio of 610 to 500 nnn (R-610,R-500 nm) in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) range, absorption area at 2200 nm (Area(2200 nm)), and asymmetry of the absorption feature at 2200 nm (ASYM(2200 nm)) showed significant correlations with concentrations of Pb, Zn, and As, respectively. The resulting spectral gradient maps showed similar spatial patterns to geochemical gradient maps. The ground-derived spectral Parameters showed a reliable quantitative relationship with heavy metal levels based on multiple linear regression. To examine the feasibility to applying these parameters to a HyMAP image, image-derived spectral parameters were compared with ground-derived parameters in terms of R-2, one-way ANOVA, and spatial patterns in the gradient map. The R-1344,R-778 nm and Area(2200 nm) parameters showed a weak relationship between the two datasets (R-2 > 0.5), and populations of spectral parameter values, Depth(500 nm) R-1344,R-778 nm, and Area(2200 nm) derived from the image pixels were comparable with those of ground-derived spectral parameters along a section of the stream channel. The pixels classified in the rule image of Depth(500 nm), R-1344,R-778 nm, and Area(2200 nm), derived from a HyMAP image showed similar spatial patterns to the gradient maps of ground-derived spectral parameters. The results indicate the potential applicability of the parameters derived from spectral absorption features in Screening and mapping the distribution of heavy metals. Correcting for differences in spectral and spatial resolution between ground and image spectra should be considered for quantitative mapping and the retrieval of heavy metal concentrations from HyMAP images.

We conclude then, that over a forest stand we are observing the direct effects of photosynthetic down-regulation on leaf-level reflectance at 531 nm. Key to our conclusion is our ability to simultaneously measure the LUE and reflectance of the Douglas-fir stand as a function of shadow fraction from the \"hot spot\" to the \"dark spot\" and a new finding herein, based on radiative transfer theory, that the magnitude of a normalized reflectance difference index (NDRI) such as PRI can vary with shadow fraction only in case the reflectance of the shaded and sunlit leaves differ in at least one of the NDRI bands.   Our spectrometer measurements over a nearly 6 month period show that at a forest stand scale, only two NDRIs (both containing a band near 570 nm) vary with shadow fraction and are correlated with LUE: an NDRI with a band centered at 531 nm roughly 50 nm wide, and another near 705 nm. Therefore, we are able to conclude that only these two bands\' reflectance differ between the sunlit and the shaded elements of the canopy. Their reflectance changes on time scales of a few minutes or less. Our observations also show that the reflectance changes at 531 nm are more highly correlated with variations in canopy light use efficiency when only sunlit canopy elements are viewed (the hot spot), than when only shaded elements (the dark spot) are viewed. Taken together then, these results demonstrate that the observed sub-hourly changes in foliage reflectance at 531 nm and 705 turn can only result from corresponding variations in photosynthetic rates. The importance of our results are as follows: (1) We show that variations in PRI with LUE are a direct result of rapid changes in foliage reflectance at 531 nm resulting from photosynthetic down-regulation, and can be observed at forest scales. (2) Our findings also suggest a new sensor and methodology for the direct retrieval from space of changes in forest LUE by measuring PRI as a function of shadow fraction using a multi-angle spectrometer simultaneously retrieving both shadow fraction and PRI.

With no bias corrections to either prior fields or forward model, the SSTs retrieved by OE minus drifter SSTs have mean and SD of -0.16 and 0.49 K respectively. The reduction in SD below the \"best possible\" regression results shows that OE deals with structural limitations of the NLSST and MCSST algorithms. Using simple empirical bias corrections to improve the OE, retrieved minus drifter SSTs are obtained with mean and SD of -0.06 and 0.44 K respectively. Regional biases are greatly reduced, such that the absolute bias is less than 0.1 K in 61 % of 10 degrees-latitude by 30 degrees-longitude cells. OE also allows a statistic of the agreement between modelled and measured brightness temperatures to be calculated. We show that this measure is more efficient than the current system of confidence levels at identifying reliable retrievals, and that the best 75% of satellite SSTs by this measure have negligible bias and retrieval error of order 0.25 K.

It has been widely assumed that the effect of sub-pixel misregistration between the two models on resultant image differences is negligible, yet this has not previously been tested in detail. The aim of this study was to determine the impact that various levels of misregistration have on image differences between SRTM and DEMs. First, very accurate image co-registration was performed at two study sites between higher resolution DEMs and SRTM data, and then image differences (SRTM-DEM) were performed after various levels of misregistration were systematically introduced into the SRTM data. It was found that: (1) misregistration caused an erroneous and dominant correlation between elevation difference and aspect across the landscape; (2) the direction of the misregistration defined the direction of this erroneous and systematic elevation difference; (3) for sub-pixel misregistration the error due solely to misregistration was greater than, or equal to the true difference between the two models for substantial proportions of the landscape (e.g., greater than 33% of the area for a half-pixel misregistration); and(4)the strength of the erroneous relationship with aspect was enhanced by steeper terrain. Spatial comparisons of DEMs were found to be sensitive to even sub-pixel misregistration between the two models, which resulted in a strong erroneous correlation with aspect. This misregistration induced correlation with aspect is not likely specific to SRTM data only; we expect it to be a generic relationship present in any DEM image difference analysis.

The algorithm is based on the exact solutions of the HYDROLIGHT numerical radiative transfer model to support retrieval in optically complex waters with varying sensor wide swath viewing geometry. The algorithm estimates the concentrations by minimizing the difference between observed and modeled reflectance spectra. The use of a look-up table and polynomial interpolation greatly reduces computation time, allowing operational and near-real time processing of large sets of satellite imagery. Because the remote sensing reflectance was tabulated as a function of in-water light absorption and scattering, rather than actual constituents concentrations, the algorithm can be applied with any definition of the specific inherent optical properties of CHL, SPM and CDOM. A statistical measure for the goodness-of-fit and the formal standard errors in the fitted concentrations are provided, thus producing error maps with each thematic chlorophyll image, often lacking in most applications of innovative algorithms. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated for multispectral observations of the North Sea, a shallow coastal sea with large concentration gradients in SPM (due to resuspension) and CDOM (from riverine influx). The standard errors of estimated chlorophyll-a concentrations ranged between 0.5 and 3 (mg to 3) for mean concentrations between 2 and 20 (mg m(-3)), quite acceptable results for these optically complex waters.

This multi-temporal classification method consists of a training data automation (TDA) procedure and uses the advanced support vector machines (SVM) algorithm. The TDA procedure automatically generates training data using input satellite images and existing land cover products. The derived high quality training data allow the SVM to produce reliable forest cover change products. This approach was tested in 19 study areas selected from major forest biomes across the globe. In each area a forest cover change map was produced using a pair of Landsat images acquired around 1990 and 2000. High resolution IKONOS images and independently developed reference data sets were available for evaluating the derived change products in 7 of those areas. The overall accuracy values were over 90% for 5 areas, and were 89.4% and 89.6% for the remaining two areas. The user\'s and producer\'s accuracies of the forest loss class were over 80% for all 7 study areas, demonstrating that this method is especially effective for mapping major disturbances with low commission errors. IKONOS images were also available in the remaining 12 study areas but they were either located in non-forest areas or in forest areas that did not experience forest cover change between 1990 and 2000. For those areas the IKONOS images were used to assist visual interpretation of the Landsat images in assessing the derived change products. This visual assessment revealed that for most of those areas the derived change products likely were as reliable as those in the 7 areas where accuracy assessment was conducted. The results also suggest that images acquired during leaf-off seasons should not be used in forest cover change analysis in areas where deciduous forests exist. Being highly automatic and with demonstrated capability to produce reliable change products, the TDA-SVM method should be especially usefial for quantifying forest cover change over large areas.

However, this integration is important for the analysis of ecosystems which are hierarchical in nature, with different ecological processes occurring at different spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to introduce a multi-temporal hierarchical image segmentation (MTHIS) methodology to generate a hierarchical set of segments based on spatial similarity of remote sensing time series. MTHIS employs the similarity of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) components of multi-seasonal time series to group pixels with similar temporal behavior into hierarchical segments at different scales. Use of the FFT allows the distinction between noise and vegetation related signals and increases the computational efficiency. The MTHIS methodology is demonstrated on the area of South Africa in an MTHIS protocol for Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. Firstly, the FFT components that express the major spatio-temporal variation in the NDVI time series, the average and annual term, are selected and the segmentation is performed based on these components. Secondly, the results are visualized by means of a boundary stability image that confirms the accuracy of the algorithm to spatially group pixels at different scale levels. Finally, the segmentation optimum is determined based on discrepancy measures which illustrate the correspondence of the applied MTHIS output with landcover-landuse maps describing the actual vegetation. In future research, MTHIS can be used to analyze the spatial and hierarchical structure of any type of remote sensing time series and their relation to ecosystem processes. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Non-linear estimation processes of land surface variables derived from remote sensing data can be biased by the surface spatial heterogeneity within the moderate spatial resolution pixel. Quantifying this surface spatial heterogeneity is thus required to correct non-linear estimation processes of land surface variables. The first step in this process is to properly characterize the scale of spatial variation of the processes structuring the landscape. Since the description of land surface processes generally involves various spectral bands, a multivariate approach to characterize the surface spatial heterogeneity from multi-spectral remote sensing observations has to be established.   This work aims at quantifying the landscape spatial heterogeneity captured by red and near infrared high spatial resolution images using direct and cross-variograms modeled together with the geostatistical linear model of coregionalization. This model quantifies the overall spatial variability and correlation of red and near infrared reflectances over the scene. In addition, it provides an explicit understanding of the landscape spatial structures captured by red and near infrared reflectances and is thus appropriate to describe landscapes composed of areas with contrasted red and near infrared spectral properties.   The application of the linear model of coregionalization to 18 contrasted landscapes provides a spatial signature of red and near infrared spectral properties characterizing each type of landscape. Low vegetation cover sites are characterized by positive spatial correlation between red and near infrared. The mosaic pattern of vegetation fields and bare soil fields over crop sites generates high and negative spatial correlation between red and near infrared and increases the spatial variability of red and near infrared. On forest sites, the important amount of vegetation limits the spatial variability of red and the shadow effects mainly captured by near infrared induce a low and positive spatial correlation between red and near infrared.   Finally, the linear model of coregionalization applied to red and near infrared is shown to be more powerful than the univariate variogram modeling applied to NDVI because the second order stationarity hypothesis on which variogram modeling relies is more frequently verified for red and near infrared than for NDVI.

We developed and assessed the LST-VPD models using three data sets: (1) instantaneous and daytime average ground-based VPD and radiometric temperature from the Soil Moisture Experiments in 2002 (SMEX02); (2) daytime average VPD from AmeriFlux eddy covariance flux tower observations; and (3) estimated daytime average VPD from Global Surface Summary of Day (GSSD) observations. We estimated model parameters for VPD estimation both regionally (MODI I A2) and globally (MOD11 C2) with RMSE values ranging from .32 to .38 kPa. VPD was overestimated along coastlines and underestimated in and regions with low vegetation cover. Also, residuals were larger with higher VPDs because of the non-linear function of saturation vapor pressure with LST.

Satellite-bome sensors measure the mean intensities emanating from heterogeneous vegetated pixels. The theory of radiative transfer in stochastic media provides the most logical linkage between satellite observations and the three-dimensional canopy structure through a closed system of simple equations which contains the mean intensity and higher statistical moments directly as its unknowns. Although this theory has been a highly active research field in recent years, its potential for satellite remote sensing of vegetated surfaces has not been fully realized because of the lack of models of a canopy pair-correlation function that the stochastic radiative transfer equations require. The pair correlation function is defined as the probability of finding simultaneously phytoelements at two points. This paper presents analytical and Monte Carlo generated pair correlation functions. Theoretical and numerical analyses show that the spatial correlation between phytoelements is primarily responsible for the effects of the three-dimensional canopy structure on canopy reflective and absorptive properties. The pair correlation function, therefore, is the most natural and physically meaningful measure of the canopy structure over a wide range of scales. The stochastic radiative transfer equations naturally admit this measure and thus provide a powerful means to investigate the three-dimensional canopy structure from space. Canopy reflectances predicted by the stochastic equations are assessed by comparisons with the PARABOLA measurements from coniferous and broadleaf forest stands in the BOREAS Southern Study Areas. The pair correlation functions are derived from data on tree structural parameters collected during field campaigns conducted at these sites. The simulated canopy reflectances compare well with the PARABOLA data. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

GLAS records a vertical profile of the returned laser energy from its footprint. To help understand the application of the data for forest spatial structure studies in our regional projects, an evaluation of the GLAS data was conducted using NASA\'s Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) data in an area near NASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, USA. The tree height indices from airborne large-footprint lidars such as LVIS have been successfully used for estimation of forest structural parameters in many previous studies and served as truth in this study.   The location accuracy of the GLAS footprints was evaluated by matching the elevation profile from GLAS with the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM. The results confirmed the location accuracy of the GLAS geolocation, and showed a high correlation between the height of the scattering phase center from SRTM and the top tree height from GLAS data. The comparisons between LVIS and GLAS data showed that the GLAS waveform is similar to the aggregation of the LVIS waveforms within the GLAS footprint, and the tree height indices derived from the GLAS and LVIS waveforms were highly correlated. The best correlations were found between the 75% waveform energy quartiles of LVIS and GLAS (r(2) =0.82 for October 2003 GLAS data, and r(2)=0.65 for June 2005 GLAS data). The correlations between the 50% waveform energy quartiles of LVIS and GLAS were also high (0.77 and 0.66 respectively). The comparisons of the top tree height and total length of waveform of the GLAS data acquired in fall of 2003 and early summer of 2005 showed a several meter bias. Because the GLAS footprints from these two orbits did not exactly overlap, several other factors may have caused this observed difference, including difference of forest structures, seasonal difference of canopy structures and errors in identifying the ground peak of waveforms.

However, it is apparent that growth models developed for single species stands are not directly transferable to a more general situation of mixed species plantations. This paper evaluates the ability of small footprint, dual-return, pulsed airborne LiDAR data to estimate the proportion of the productive species when mixed with a nurse crop in closed canopy plantations. A study area located in Galloway Forest District in Scotland is used as an example of Lodgepole pine and Sitka spruce mixed plantation; this area contains good examples of a wide range of pure and mixed species plantation types. Three species groups are studied: areas of pure Sitka spruce, areas of pure Lodgepole pine and areas where the two species have been planted together. Two approaches are assessed for detection of plantation mixtures: the first uses LiDAR intensity data to separate spruce and pine species and the second uses LiDAR-derived canopy density measures, coefficient of variation, skewness, percent of ground returns (which provides a measure of canopy openness) and the mean canopy height, which enables areas with height variations to be identified. From analysis of LiDAR data extracted from 54 study plots using logistic regression, the coefficient of variation and LiDAR intensity data provide the most useful predictors of the proportion of spruce in a pine/spruce mixture with coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.914 and 0.930 respectively. The method could be developed as a mapping tool, which in combination with existing inventory data should help to improve timber volume forecasting for mixed species even-aged plantations.

The new method, called the \"calibrated maximum likelihood classification\" involves an automated and iterative adjustment of prior weights until class frequency in the output corresponds to class frequency as calculated from objective (field-inventoried) estimates. This modification compensates for the maximum likelihood algorithm\'s tendency to over-represent dominant classes and under-represent less frequent ones. National forest inventory plot data measured from a five-year period are used to estimate relative frequency of class occurrence and to derive spectral signatures for each forest class. The classification method was implemented operationally within an automated production system which allowed rapid production of a country-wide forest type map from Landsat TM/ETM+ satellite data. The production system automated the retrieval and updating of forest inventory plots, a plot-to-image matching routine, illumination and haze correction of satellite imagery, and classification into forest classes using the calibrated maximum likelihood classification. This paper describes the details of the method and demonstrates the result of using an iterative adjustment of prior weights versus unadjusted prior weights. It shows that the calibrated maximum likelihood algorithm adjusts for the overclassification of classes that are well represented in the training data as well as for other classes, resulting in an output where class proportions are close to those as expected based on forest inventory data.

However, currently such data have limited availability and only at low temporal resolution, while coarser resolution thermal data (similar to 1000 m) are routinely available, but not as useful for identifying environmental features for many landscapes. An algorithm for sharpening thermal imagery (TsHARP) to higher resolutions typically associated with the shorter wavebands (visible and near-infrared) used to compute vegetation indices is examined over an extensive corn/soybean production area in central Iowa during a period of rapid crop growth. This algorithm is based on the assumption that a unique relationship between radiometric surface temperature (T-R) relationship and vegetation index (VI) exists at multiple resolutions. Four different methods for defining a VI-T-R basis function for sharpening were examined, and an optimal form involving a transformation to fractional vegetation cover was identified. The accuracy of the high-resolution temperature retrieval was evaluated using aircraft and Landsat thermal imagery, aggregated to simulate native and target resolutions associated with Landsat, MODIS, and GOES short- and longwave datasets. Applying TsHARP to simulated MODIS thermal maps at 1-km resolution and sharpening down to similar to 250 in (MODIS VI resolution) yielded root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.67-1.35 degrees C compared to the \'observed\' temperature fields, directly aggregated to 250 m. Sharpening simulated Landsat thermal maps (60 and 120 m) to Landsat VI resolution (30 m) yielded errors of 1.8-2.4 degrees C, while sharpening simulated GOES thermal maps from 5 km to I km and 250 m yielded RMSEs of 0.98 and 1.97, respectively. These results demonstrate the potential for improving the spatial resolution of thermal-band satellite imagery over this type of rainfed agricultural region. By combining GOES thermal data with shortwave VI data from polar orbiters, thermal imagery with 250-m spatial resolution and 15-min temporal resolution can be generated with reasonable accuracy. Further research is required to examine the performance of TsHARP over regions with different climatic and land-use characteristics at local and regional scales.

Accuracy depends on many factors, including the availability of a complete catalog of particle types with their associated size distributions, shapes, single-scattefing albedos, vertical profiles, and spectral radiative characteristics. Co-equal to this need is the availability of a well-designed, well-characterized instrument, with a calibration that is maintained post-launch. This allows accurate radiance and retrieval products to be made, adjusting for instrument changes. MISR performance has been intensively studied throughout the design, pre-flight, and post-launch mission phases. To establish the absolute radiometric scale, annual vicarious calibration (VC) exercises have been conducted. In addition, an on-board-calibrator (OBC) allows more frequent testing of camera degradations. Together, the VC and OBC processes have allowed MISR to achieve an absolute calibration uncertainty of 4% or better (la confidence level) for bright land targets. Additional fine-tunings have been made following analysis of lunar-view campaign data, and from a statistical analysis of Earth observations. These studies led to slight camera-to-camera adjustments, which are important in improving the aerosol retrieval process. Validation of the response at the lower end of the dynamic range has also been accomplished using a dark-water study. With these studies complete, MISR calibration is now in an operational mode, and data users can be assured the resulting data products are stable with time. Such records meet the needs of a program designed to support climate change and provide long-term monitoring of the Earth\'s atmosphere and radiative fluxes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

First, wind speeds retrieved from a series of 91 ERS-2 SAR and Envisat ASAR images, at moderate wind speeds (2-15 in s(-1)), were validated against in situ measurements from an offshore mast in the North Sea. The wind direction input, necessary for SAR wind speed retrievals, was obtained from the meteorological mast and from a local gradient analysis of wind streaks in the SAR images. A wind speed standard deviation of similar to 1.1 in s(-1) was found when in situ wind directions were used. The use of local gradient wind directions yielded a standard deviation of similar to 1.3 in s(-1). Wind speeds retrieved from three geophysical model functions (CMOD-IFR2, CMOD4, and CMOD5) were compared. The best approximation to the in situ measurements of wind speed was found for CMOD-IFR2, despite a bias on the order of - 0.3 in s(-1). CMOD4 retrievals also underestimated the wind speed, whereas the bias on CMOD5 retrievals was negligible. Then, wind resource assessments were made from the SAR-based wind observations to show how errors in wind speed from the different SAR wind retrievals were reflected in the wind statistics. The mean wind speed, obtained for all of the 91 SAR scenes, was linked closely to the bias of SAR wind retrievals. Agreement to +/- 15% of the in situ measurements was found for all the wind retrieval methods tested. The accuracy of power density estimates for the entire data set was evaluated by the standard deviation of SAR wind retrievals relative to the in situ measurements. SAR wind fields retrieved with CMOD-IFR2, using in situ wind direction inputs, exactly yielded the power density predicted from in situ measurements alone. The SAR-based wind resource assessment also corresponded well to predictions from longer time series of in situ measurements. This indicates that a reliable wind resource assessment may be achieved from a series of randomly selected SAR images. The findings presented here could be useful in future wind resource assessment based on SAR images. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, we have carried out a quantitative assessment of the SBAS procedure performance by processing SAR data acquired by the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS) sensors and comparing the achieved results with geodetic measurements that are assumed as reference. The analysis has been focused on the Napoli bay (Italy) and Los Angeles (California) test areas where different deformation phenomena are present and, at the same time, a large amount of ERS SAR data is available as well as geometric leveling (in the Napoli zone) and continuous GPS (in the Los Angeles zone) measurements, to be used for our performance analysis. Moreover, due to the presence of large urbanized zones, the selected test sites are also characterized by extended, highly coherent areas in the DInSAR maps.   The presented study shows that the SBAS technique provides an estimate of the mean deformation velocity with a standard deviation of about 1 mm/year for a typical ERS data set including between 40 and 60 images. Moreover, the single displacement measurements, computed with respect to a reference point of known motion, show a sub-centimetric accuracy with a standard deviation of about 5 mm, consistently in both the SAR/leveline and SAR/GPS comparisons; we also show that there is an increase of this standard deviation value as we move away from the reference SAR pixel, with an estimated spatial variation value of about 0.05 mm/km.

To overcome this problem, an algorithm for delineating tree crowns has been developed using eCognition Expert and hyperspectral Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI-2) data acquired over a forested landscape near Injune, central east Queensland, Australia. The algorithm has six components: 1) the differentiation of forest, non-forest and understorey; 2) initial segmentation of the forest area and allocation of segments (objects) to larger objects associated with forest spectral types (FSTs); 3) initial identification of object maxima as seeds within these larger objects and their expansion to the edges of crowns or clusters of crowns; 4) subsequent classification-based separation of the resulting objects into crown or cluster classes; 5) further iterative splitting of the cluster classes to delineate more crowns; and 6) identification and subsequent merging of oversplit objects into crowns or clusters. In forests with a high density of individuals (e.g., regroAqh), objects associated with tree clusters rather than crowns are delineated and local maxima counted to approximate density. With reference to field data, the delineation process provided accuracies > similar to 70% (range 48-88%) for individuals or clusters of trees of the same species with diameter at breast height (DBH) exceeding 10 cm (senescent and dead trees excluded), with lower accuracies associated with dense stands containing several canopy layers, as many trees were obscured from the view of the CASI sensor. Although developed using I-m spatial resolution CASI data acquired over Australian forests, the algorithm has application elsewhere and is currently being considered for integration into the Definiens product portfolio for use by the wider community.

The findings correspond well the physical characteristics of the cropping system in the Mekong Delta, which have changed over time in response to localized and seasonal changes in water resources. One such example is the double-irrigated rice-cropping system commonly employed in the upper Mekong Delta in the dry season to avoid damage due to the subsequent floods. The shortage of suitable irrigation water and intrusion of saline water in the coastal regions during the dry season has constrained the practice dry-season cropping and has meant that the double- and single-rainfed rice-cropping systems are employed in the rainy season. A triple-irrigated rice-cropping system is used in the central part of the Mekong Delta which is located midway between the flood-prone and salinity intrusion areas. Analysis of annual changes in the rice cropping systems between 2002 and 2003 showed that the triple-cropped rice expanded to the flood- and salinity-intrusion areas. This expansion indicates that the implementation of measures to limit the extent of flooding and salinity intrusion by improved farming technologies and improvements in land management. The heading dates in the upper Mekong Delta in 2003 were earlier than in 2002 by approximately 20 to 30 days. The reasons for this would be due to decreased flood runoff in 2002 compared to 2001, and implementation of government policies regarding early sowing of dry-season crops. Subsequent analysis of the MODIS data confirmed that the spatial distribution of rice-cropping systems was closely related to seasonal changes in river runoff regime in the Mekong Delta.

Using MODIS ocean band 11 at 531 nm, we tried to detect variations in canopy reflectance related to the xanthophyll cycle. We tested several other MODIS bands as the reference band because the 570 nm reference band that had been determined to be optimum for calculating PRI in earlier studies is not available on MODIS.   While LUE varied greatly within the 2001, 2002, and 2003 growing seasons, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from tower sensors remained stable. LUE had a negative exponential relationship with vapor pressure deficit and air temperature, and was at a maximum when absorbed PAR was <200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The range and magnitude of tower-based LUE values were smaller on clear days, when MODIS acquisitions were possible, than they were overall. Furthermore, the orbital parameters of the Terra and Aqua satellites restricted MODIS acquisitions to a 2.5-h period in early afternoon at out study site when LUE values were typically lower than they were earlier in the day.   Strong correlations between MODIS-sPRI and LUE were found only for backscatter reflectance scenes when band 13 (667 nm) was used as the reference band. The correlations were higher for sPRI calculated from top of atmosphere reflectances than for surface reflectances (r(2) = 0.76 and 0.53, respectively). The absolute backscatter reflectance of bands 11, 12 (551 nm), and 13 all decreased with increasing LUE. The decrease in band 13 suggests that the correlation between sPRI and LUE that we observed was caused by reductions in canopy chlorophyll content from 2001 to 2003 and/or by increased visibility of brighter non-photosynthetic material. Regional values of sPRI from 260 deciduous forest pixels in the 10,000 km(2) Vicinity of the tower for two contrasting days, one in 2001 and one in 2003, were consistent with that observed for the flux tower footprint.

The Tasseled Cap (TC) transformation for Landsat data has been used in several disturbance-mapping projects because of its ability to highlight relevant vegetation changes. We used an automated composite analysis procedure to test four multi-date variants of the TC transformation (called \"data structures\" here) in their ability to facilitate identification of stand-replacing disturbance. Data structures tested included one with all three TC indices (brightness, greenness, wetness), one with just brightness and greenness, one with just wetness, and one called the Disturbance Index (DI) which is a novel combination of the three TC indices. Data structures were tested in the St. Petersburg region of Russia and in two ecologically distinct regions of Washington State in the US. In almost all cases, the TC variants produced more accurate change classifications than multi-date stacks of the original Landsat reflectance data. In general, there was little overall difference between the TC-derived data structures. However, DI performed better than the others at the Russian study area, where slower succession rates likely produce the most durable disturbance signal. Also, at the highly productive western Washington site, where the disturbance signal is likely the most ephemeral, DI and wetness performed worse than the larger data structures when a longer monitoring interval was used (eight years between image acquisitions instead of four). This suggests that both local forest recovery rates and the re-sampling interval should be considered in choosing a Landsat transformation for use in stand-replacing disturbance detection.

With a given accuracy threshold, the developed algorithm is sufficiently robust for data with noise up to 15% for certain hydro-optical conditions. To avoid inadequate retrieval results, the algorithm identifies and eventually discards the pixels with inadequate atmospheric correction and/or water optical properties incompatible with the applied hydro-optical model.

We tested the generality of imaging spectroscopy with \"tied\" red-edge and shortwave-infrared (RESWIR2) spectral mixture modeling for automated analysis of the lateral distribution of plant tissues and bare substrate across diverse bioclimatic gradients in Hawai\'i. Unique quantities of the fractional cover of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic vegetation (PV, NPV) and bare substrate identified fundamental differences in ecosystem Structure across life zones. There was a similar to 20-fold increase in fractional PV cover with a 10-fold increase in inean annual precipitation (<= 250-2000 mm year(-1)). This rate of increase diminished from 2000 to 3000 mm year(-1) of rainfall, suggesting that photosynthetic canopy cover may be limited by water saturation at 3000 mm year(-1). The amount of exposed surface senescent material (NPV) remained nearly constant at similar to 50% in ecosystems with a mean annual precipitation < 1500 mm year(-1). Thereafter, NPV steadily declined to a minimum of similar to 20% at 3000 mm year(-1) of rainfall. Bare substrate fractions were highest (similar to 50%) at precipitation levels < 750 mm year(-1), then declined to < 20% in the 750-1000 mm year(-1) zones. The combination of low bare substrate and high NPV cover in the 750-1000 mm year-1 rainfall zones identified these areas as high fire risk. Remotely sensed fractional cover of PV+NPV was poorly correlated with canopy leaf area index (LAI), showing the uniqueness of the lateral structural measurement afforded by automated RE-SWIR2 spectroscopy approaches. The results indicate the accuracy, precision and applicability of imaging spectroscopy for ecological research across a wide range of bioclimatic conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Radiant temperature was strongly correlated with field-based CBI when a post-fire image from autumn was used. Indices that used red and near-infrared bands performed poorly relative to indices that incorporated mid-infrared bands. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), which incorporates near- and mid-infrared bands, was ranked within the top three indices for each of the four burns using post-burn images, and for three of the four burns using pre- and post-burn images. When indices were summed based on ranked correlations, the NBR was highest for both the post-burn and pre/post-burn approaches. The NBR had high correlations with the field-based CBI in closed needleleaf, mixed, and broadleaf forest classes. However, the NBR was useful as an index of burn severity only for forested sites.

Normalization methods have relied on matching identical and assumed invariant features in both images of an overlapping pair, or on invariant targets that are not necessarily the same features. Problems with overlap normalization methods include sensitivity to outliers in overlap data caused by atmospheric or land cover change between scenes, which can lead to radiometric error propagation across a mosaic caused by a normalized scene becoming a reference for the subsequent scene entered into the mosaic. Solutions to such problems include interactive Outlier removal to generate a non-nalization function using a \' no change \' data set and methods that are robust against outliers to automatically generate normalization functions with minimal user input. This paper compares two normalization methods that use a robust regression technique called Theil-Sen with an established overlap normalization method. The first method uses Theil-Sen regression to generate a nonnalization function between overlap regions, while the second uses Theil-Sen to normalize to coarse-resolution composite reflectance data from the SPOT VEGETATION (VGT) sensor. The results of the normalizations were evaluated in two ways: (1) using statistics generated between overlap regions; and (2) separately using coarse-resolution data as a reference. Both overlap normalization methods performed almost identically; however, Theil-Sen was faster and easier to implement than its traditional counterpart due to its insensitivity to outliers and capability for full automation. While overlap and coarse-resolution normalizations each outperformed the other when evaluated against its calibration set, error propagation caused by outliers in overlap samples was avoided in the normalization to coarse-resolution imagery. Advantages offered by normalization to coarse-resolution data using robust regression, including full automation, make this method particularly attractive for generation of large area mosaics containing 100 Landsat scenes or more.

In fact, it takes into account wind and insolation variations during the day, that effectively drive the SST diurnal cycle.   This parameterization, has been tested on 6 months of NOAA-16 AVHRR images acquired and processed at CNR with Pathfinder algorithm. The tests evidenced some limits for a correct estimation of the DV in low-wind regimes for any insolation condition, and in high insolation regimes (> 600 W/m(2)) when the wind intensity increases or decreases of more than 2 m/s during the morning. The limits of applicability of the DV correction to NOAA-16 AVHRR data (at least for the Mediterranean area) were thus identified, and data outside these limits were flagged. However, some anomalous heating were not corrected even with these constraints, due to the lack of accuracy in the wind field used for the correction. As a result, a strategy to flag residual outliers in the corrected daily images has been developed, based on the comparison to an optimally interpolated night SST field of the previous day.

Application to old growth conifer forests offer unique technical issues including high variability in tree size and dominance, strong tree shading and obscuration, and varying ages and states of health. The capabilities of individual tree analysis are examined with two acquisitions of 70-cm resolution CASI imagery over a hemlock, amabilis fir, and cedar dominated old growth site on the west coast of Canada. Trees were delineated using the valley following approach of the Individual Tree Crown (ITC) software suite, classified according to species (hemlock, amabilis fir, and cedar) using object-based spectral classification and tested on a tree-for-tree basis against data derived from ground plots.   Tree-for-tree isolation and species classification accuracy assessment, although often sobering, is important for portraying the overall effectiveness of species composition mapping using single tree approaches. This accuracy considers not only how well each tree is classified, but how well each automated isolation represents a true tree and its species. Omissions and commissions need to be included in overall species accuracy assessment. A structure of rules for defining isolation accuracy is developed and used. An example is given of a new approach to accuracy analysis incorporating both isolation and classification results (automated tree recognition) and the issues this presents.   The automated tree isolation performed well on those trees that could be visually identified on the imagery using ground measured stem maps (approximately 50-60% of trees had a good match between manual and automated delineations). There were few omissions. Commission errors, i.e., automated isolations not associated with a delineated ground reference tree, were a problem (25%) usually associated with spurious higher intensity areas within shaded regions, which get confused in the process of trying to isolate shaded trees. Difficulty in classifying species was caused by: variability of the spectral signatures of the old growth trees within the same species, tree health, and trees partly or fully shaded by other trees. To accommodate this variability, several signatures were used to represent each species including shaded trees. Species could not be determined for the shaded cases or for the unhealthy trees and therefore two combined classes, a shaded class and unhealthy class with all species included, were used for further analysis. Species classification accuracy of the trees for which there was a good automated isolation match was 72%, 60%, and 40% for the non-shaded healthy hemlock, balsam, and cedar trees for the 1996 data. Equivalent accuracy for the 1998 imagery was 59% for hemlock, 80% for balsam, with only a few cedar trees being well isolated. If all other matches were considered an error in classification, species classification was poor (approximately 45% for balsam and hemlock, 25% for cedar). However, species classification accuracies incorporating the good isolation matches and trees for which there was a match of an isolations and reference tree but the match was not considered good were moderate (60%, 57%, and 38% for hemlock, balsam, and cedar from the 1996 data; 62%, 61%, and 89%, respectively, for the 1998 imagery).   Automated tree isolation and species classification of old growth forests is difficult, but nevertheless in this example useful results were obtained.

Furthermore, they provide information on snow mass. i.e., snow water equivalent (SWE), which is critically important for hydrological modeling and water resource management. However. the errors associated with the passive microwave measurements of SWE are well known but have not been adequately quantified thus far. Understanding these errors is important for correct interpretation of remotely sensed SWE and successful assimilation of such observations into numerical models.   This study uses a novel approach to quantify these errors by taking into account various factors, that impact passive microwave responses from snow in various climatic/geographic regions. Among these factors are vegetation cover (particularly forest cover). snow morphology(crystal size), and errors related to brightness temperature calibration. A time-evolving retrieval algorithm that considers the evolution of snow crystals is formulated. An error model is developed based on the standard error estimation theory. This new algorithm and error estimation method is applied to the passive microwave data from Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) during the 1990-1991 snow season to produce annotated error maps for North America. The algorithm has been validated for seven snow seasons (from 1988 to 1995) in taiga, tundra, alpine, prairie, and maritime regions of Canada using in situ SWE data from the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) and satellite passive microwave observations. An ongoing study is applying this methodology to passive microwave measurements: from Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR); future study will further refine and extend the analysis globally, and produce an improved SWE dataset of more than 25 years in length by combining SSMR and SSM/I measurements.

Our algorithm provides for the estimations of the tendencies of NDVI to increase or decrease starting from selected reference conditions by means of linear fits that cover time periods increasing at a 1-year rate. The times at which such trends change their sign (first return times) are estimated, and the distribution that best fits their histogram is determined. Such a distribution reflects the character, stationary or not, of NDVI changes and allows for estimating persistence probability and for quantifying possible characteristic time scales. In order to check the algorithm\'s performances, we estimated persistence probability at a 1.1-km resolution over the test site of Southern Italy and selected subareas. Histograms of return times aggregated according to vegetation classes were also analyzed. In all of the cases, we found the exponential decay taw that is typical of processes that attain to long-term stationary patterns. Estimated mean life times of decreasing processes were generally shorter than those characterizing the increasing ones. Our findings express a good ability of vegetation to recover from disturbances and to efficiently exploit resources. Overall, rather stable conditions seem to characterize the test site and local exceptions can be easily explained with independent ground data. The good agreement between our inferences and results from independent studies suggests that dynamics estimated from AVHRR data can provide interesting information on vegetation resilience and response to human/climate forcing. In particular, quantitative information can be a key tool for the characterization and parameterization of vegetation changes and for the development and validation of dynamical models.

According to weak nonlinearity shallow water theory, internal solitary waves (ISWs) in stratified oceans may be either depression or elevation waves, depending on the sign of the quadratic nonlinearity coefficient in the KdV equation. It has been confirmed that ISWs can convert their polarity when passing through a turning point, where the quadratic nonlinearity coefficient changes sign. For a two-layer stratified ocean, the turning point is located where the upper and lower layer depths are equal. The authors suggest that depression, elevation and broadening ISWs can be discerned according to their different signatures in SAR images. It is also found that a SAR image can record a continuous evolution process from depression to elevation ISWs in its spatial domain, under conditions of a spatially inhomogeneous ocean environment. Therefore, the upper and lower layer depths can be calculated by determining the polarity conversion of ISWs observed in satellite SAR images. Furthermore, the density difference between the upper and lower layers can also be estimated, when the wave speed is known. We extract ocean stratification parameters, including upper layer depth and density difference, from polarity conversion of ISWs observed in a RADARSAT-1 SAR image taken over the northeastern South China Sea. Comparing the estimated results with field measurements, we find that this method can estimate the upper layer depth with considerable success. In estimating the density difference between the upper and lower layers, it also gives a quite reasonable result. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Five events were considered, during which eruptions from eight volcanoes injected ash into the upper troposphere or lower stratosphere. For one of the eruptions, at Miyakejima, Japan, at least five aircraft encountered volcanic ash Clouds, and the cost to three operators alone exceeded US $12,000,000 in aircraft repairs, diversions, and lost operating time. We performed \'reverse\' absorption and \'pattern analysis\' using GMS-5/VISSR, MODIS and AVHRR data, and we examined TOMS SO2 and Aerosol Index data, surface-based observations, pilot reports, and dispersion model output. Our results verify that the introduction of \'reverse\' absorption using the geostationary GMS-5 platform significantly enhanced our capacity to monitor volcanic ash clouds in the region. In one case, we tracked an eruption cloud for approximately 80 It. The primary impediment to remote monitoring is the presence of overlying cloud, or substantial amounts of ice within the volcanic Clouds. TOMS data showed success in identifying volcanic clouds during these conditions. but was limited by the infrequency of observations. More effective future operation of the IAVW relies on developing complementary methods of volcanic cloud remote sensing, and greatly increasing the amount and quality of available surface and air observations. including observations of precursor activity. An understanding of the likely future limitations of remote sensing techniques will aid in the refining of IAVW procedures. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

With regard to the degradation of natural vegetation covers, we discriminate between climate-triggered and human-induced vegetation degradation by analyzing the natural response pattern of vegetation to rainfall. For the monitoring of vegetation covers, we used composited 10-day interval 8-km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from 1981 to 1996. A consistently changing response of vegetation to rainfall over this time period, expressed in the residuals of the NDVImax/Rainfall linear regression calculations, is interpreted as nonclimate or human driven, where correlations between residuals and the time of their occurrence produce correlation coefficients >\\0.6\\. Pixels showing a negative temporal trend in residuals coincide with areas that are most heavily used by humans. Heavily used areas were located through detecting nomadic campsites from Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS)-1C data. By combining campsite distribution with census data, such as flock size, average annual offtake, and grazing habits, we assess grazing pressures and put them in relation to the natural resources. This information provided the basis for the definition of protected areas or rehabilitation plots, and for elaborating measures to support the Steppe dwellers. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The combined SSM/I and SMMR time series of dual polarized, multichannel, spacebome passive microwave brightness temperatures extends back to 1978, providing a lengthy time series for algorithm assessment. In this study, 5-day average (pentad) passive microwave-derived SWE imagery for 18 winter seasons (December, January, February 1978/79 through 1995/96) was compared to SWE estimates taken from a distributed network of surface measurements throughout western Canada.   Results indicated both vegetative and snowpack controls on the performance of MSC algorithms. In regions of open and low-density forest cover, the in situ and passive microwave SWE data exhibited both strong agreement and similar levels of interannual variability. In locations where winter season SWE typically exceeded 75 mm, and/or dense vegetative cover was present, dataset agreement weakened appreciably, with little interannual variability in the passive microwave SWE retrievals. These results have important implications for extending the SWE monitoring capability of the MSC algorithm suite to northern regions such as the Mackenzie River basin.

The non-local method uses data at both the target pixel and neighboring pixels to retrieve cloud properties such as pixel-averaged cloud optical thickness and effective droplet radius. Radiance data to be observed from space were simulated by a three-dimensional (3D) radiation model and a stochastic boundary layer cloud model with two-dimensional (horizontal and vertical) variability in cloud liquid water and effective radius. An adiabatic assumption is used for each cloud column to model the geometrical thickness and vertical profiles of cloud liquid water content and effective droplet radius, neglecting drizzle and cloud brokenness for simplicity. The dependence of radiative smoothing and roughening on horizontal scale, optical thickness and single scattering albedo are investigated. Then, retrieval methods using 250-m horizontal resolution data onboard new generation satellites are discussed. The regression model for the MSN method was trained based on datasets from numerical simulations. The training was performed with respect to various domain averages of optical thickness and effective radius, because smoothing and roughening effects are strongly dependent on the two variables. Retrieval accuracy is discussed here with datasets independent of those used in the training, towards assessing the generality of the technique. It is demonstrated that retrieval accuracy of cloud optical thickness, which is often retrieved from single-spectral visible-wavelength data, is improved the most using neighboring pixel data and secondly using multi-spectral data, and ideally with both. When the IPA retrieval method is applied to optical thickness and effective radius, the root-mean-square relative errors can be 15-90%, depending on solar and view directions. In contrast, the MSN method has errors of 4-10%, which is smaller than IPA by a factor of 2 - 10. It is also suggested that the accuracy of the MSN method is insensitive to some assumptions in the inhomogeneous cloud input data used to train the regression model. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

In the first step, an appropriate ground spectral reflectance model with a small number of parameters was defined. To this end, spectral bidirectional reflectance measurements of typical sands were analyzed. Then, an adjustment method using a heterogeneous set of satellite data acquired under similar conditions over a given reference site was applied to recover ground spectral model parameters. The robustness of the method is demonstrated using a simulated satellite level dataset generated with realistic errors and uncertainties. The last section describes application of the method to a real satellite dataset extracted from the SADE database: \"Structure d\'Accueil de Donnees d\'Etalonnage\", a data repository built by \"Centre National d\'Etudes Spatiales\" (CNES) for collecting and storing data acquired over various ground reference areas including desert reference sites. The recovered ground model was then transferred to the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and compared with an available Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) spectral measurement. The comparison shows good agreement on the spectral shape and a total bias of less than +/-3%. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

In forested ecosystems, management decisions are driven by variables such as forest composition, forest structure (both vertical and horizontal), and other ancillary data (i.e., topography, soils, slope, aspect, and disturbance regime dynamics). Vertical forest structure is difficult to quantify and yet is an important component in the decision-making process. This study investigated the use of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data for classifying this attribute at landscape scales for inclusion into decision-support systems. Analysis of field-derived tree height variance demonstrated that this metric could distinguish between two classes of vertical forest structure. Analysis of LiDAR-derived tree height variance demonstrated that differences between single-story and multistory vertical structural classes could be detected. Landscape-scale classification of the two structure classes was 97% accurate. This study suggested that within forest types of the Intermountain West region of the United States, LiDAR-derived tree heights could be useful in the detection of differences in the continuous, nonthematic nature of vertical forest structure with acceptable accuracies.

An experimental burn has been used to test the ability of FI to identify clearly fires. A second algorithm based on an intraband analysis, the Mid-IR Fire Index (MFI), has been proposed to give complementary information to FI. Evolution of FI and MFI values with distance for different IR sources has been calculated.

A publicly available Digital Elevation Model (DEM), at a scale of 1:50,000, is used to model the radiance variation of the scene as a function of topography, assuming a Lambertian surface. Skylight is estimated and removed from the airborne data using a dark object correction. The CASI data is corrected on a pixel-by-pixel basis to normalize the scene to a uniform solar illumination and viewing geometry. The results show that topography has the effect of expanding end member clusters at times resulting in the overlap of clusters and that the correction process can effectively reduce the variation in detected radiance due to changes in local illumination. When topographic effects are embedded in the hyperspectral data, methods typically used for the selection of end members, such as the convex hull method, can miss end members or result in the selection of nonrepresentative pixels as end members. Thus, end members selected by some conventional methods are very likely \"incomplete\" or \"nonrepresentative\" if the topographic effect is embedded in the data. As shown in this study, the topographic correction can reveal hidden end members and achieve a better representation of end members via the statistical center of isolated clusters.

This paper presents an initial analysis of the MODIS NDVI and EVI performance from both radiometric and biophysical perspectives. We utilize a combination of site-intensive and regionally extensive approaches to demonstrate the performance and validity of the two indices. Our results showed a good correspondence between airborne-measured, top-of-canopy reflectances and VI values with those from the MODIS sensor at four intensively measured test sites representing semi-arid grass/shrub, savanna, and tropical forest biomes. Simultaneously derived field biophysical measures also demonstrated the scientific utility of the MODIS VI. Multitemporal profiles of the MODIS VIs over numerous biome types in North and South America well represented their seasonal phenologies. Comparisons of the MODIS-NDVI with the NOAA-14, 1-km AVHRR-NDVI temporal profiles showed that the MODIS-based index performed with higher fidelity. The dynamic range of the MODIS VIs are presented and their sensitivities in discriminating vegetation differences are evaluated in sparse and dense vegetation areas. We found the NDVI to asymptotically saturate in high biomass regions such as in the Amazon while the EVI remained sensitive to canopy variations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

These measurements collect laser-induced signals as a function of laser wavelengths and water temperatures. For each laser wavelength, the laser energies simultaneously induce dissolved organic material (DOM) fluorescence, alga fluorescence, and Raman signals. For the water samples used, these measurements show that DOM and Raman signal amplitudes are insensitive to water temperatures. However, alga fluorescence signals increases slowly with increases in water temperatures. The wavelength-dependent measurements show that Raman signal amplitudes decrease with increases in excitation laser wavelengths between 490 and 535 nm, the wavelength range used in these measurements. The alga fluorescence signal amplitudes also decrease with increase in excitation laser wavelengths. However. these decreases are insignificant compared to that of Raman signals. Within the excitation laser wavelength range studied, the DOM fluorescence does not show significant spectral structures that depend on laser wavelengths. The measurement results suggest optimum laser wavelengths for studying laser-induced inelastic scattering in coastal waters. These data also suggest that for both active and passive coastal water remote sensing, Raman signals may bias alga fluorescence measurement results depending on relative alga fluorescence and Raman signal intensity.

This index uses radiances or reflectances from a red channel at 0.66 mum and near-infrared channel at 0.86 mum. Thin cirrus clouds frequently contaminate remotely sensed data acquired from aircraft and satellite platforms. They introduce additional scattered radiances to the 0.66-mum and 0.86-mum channels. To obtain unbiased estimates of NDVI values from remotely sensed data, the cirrus scattering effects must be removed. We recently have developed an empirical technique for removing thin cirrus scattering effects using the sensitive 1.375-mum cirrus-detecting channel. In this article, we demonstrate that the estimates of NDVI values van be improved quantitatively after the removal of thin cirrus effects. Pairs of spectral imaging data, with and nearly without thin cirrus contamination, acquired with the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) are used in this study. Because a special channel centered at 1.375 mum has been implemented on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) for detecting thin cirrus clouds from space, it is possible to remove thin cirrus scattering effects from MODIS channels below 1 mum and to yield improved global estimates of NDVI values from MODIS data.

This work forms an element of the Grassland Prototype Validation Exercise initiative, a prelaunch Earth Observing System field experiment conducted in May 1997 at Jornada, NM, USA. In lieu of MODIS data, we present albedo comparisons using 1.1-km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer and 6x7-km Polarisation and Directionality of the Earth\'s Radiation data. To derive broadband albedo from the satellite data, we calculate spectral albedo through the multiangular inversion of a semiempirical bidirectional reflectance distribution function model and perform narrowband-to-broadband albedo conversion using an observed spectrum as interpolator and extrapolator of spectral albedo. Comparisons of ground-based albedo values to the satellite-derived values meet the +/-0.05 suggested accuracy requirement for global climate modeling and are close to the +/-0.02 suggested standard. Spatial modeling based on assigning typical albedos to three land cover classes obtained through classification of 12-m resolution Thematic Mapper Simulater data over the 1.1X1.1-km area of an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer pixel shows that the instrument tower at the field site, in the vicinity of which the ground albedo measurements were made, was located in an area where the local spatial heterogeneity of albedo is similar to that at the coarser satellite resolution. This explains the agreement between the ground-based and the satellite-derived albedo values despite the difference in spatial scale.

However, they are prone to interpolation errors where climate stations are sparsely distributed. Snow cover is clearly discernible using satellite-obtained optical data because of the high albedo of snow, yet the surface is often obscured by cloud cover. Satellite-obtained passive microwave data, compared with optical data, is relatively unaffected by clouds; however, the snow-cover signature is significantly affected by melting snow and the microwaves may be transparent to thin snow (<3 cm). Both optical and microwave sensors have problems discerning snow beneath forest canopies. This paper describes a method that combines ground and satellite-derived optical and passive microwave data to produce a multiple-dataset snow-cover product. Comparisons with current snow-cover products show that the multiple-dataset product draws together the advantages of each of its component products while minimizing the potential errors. Improved estimates of the snow-covered area are derived through the addition of two snow-cover classes (\"thin or patchy\" and \"high elevation\" snow cover) and from the analysis of the climate station data within each class. The compatibility of this method for use with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data, which will be available in 1999, and with Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer data, available in 2000, is also discussed. With the assimilation of these data, the resolution of the multiple-dataset product would be improved both spatially and temporally and the analysis would become completely automated.

We assessed the BRF sensitivity to some major experimental parameters (scale of analysis, viewing and illumination directions, sky radiation) and compared it with BRF sensitivity to commonly studied biophysical quantities: Leaf area index (LAI) and leaf optical properties. Simulations show;ed that BRF directional anisotropy is very large for all forests. For example, maximum relative reflectance difference with view zenith angle less than 25 degrees is around 0.5 in the visible, 0.4 in the short wave infrared and 0.25 in the near-infrared for tropical forest. We showed that this BRF variability associated with experimental conditions can hamper the remote detection of forest LAI and tree cover change such as deforestation of tropical forest. DART BRFs of the boreal sites were favourably compared with ground (PARABOLA) and airborne (POLDER) measured BRFs, This work stressed 1) the potential of the DART model, 2) the importance of accurate field data for validation approaches, and 3) the very strong influence of canopy architecture on forest BRF; for example, depending on forest sites, a LAI increase may imply that nadir near-infrared reflectance increases or decreases.

Reflectance spectra over the 400-2500 nm range with a spectral resolution of 2 nm and the content of chlorophylls a, b, a+b, and total carotenoids were determined for leaves from several Eucalyptus species covering a wide range of chlorophyll a content (0.0121-0.0435 mg/cm(2)). Maximum sensitivity of reflectance to variation in pigment content was found in the green wavelength region at 550 nn and at 708 nun in the far-red wavelengths. The reflectance in the main pigment absorption regions in the blue (400-500 nm) and red (660-690 nm) wavelengths proved to be insensitive to variation in pigment content. The ratio R672/(R550XR708) correlated best with chlorophyll a, chlorophyll a+b, and total carotenoid contents. The ratio R672/R550 correlated best with chlorophyll b content. Reflectance ratios involving near infrared bands such as R750/R550 and R750/R700 did not correlate well with pigment content. This was due to the differential scattering effects of the wide range of young and mature leaf samples. A method was developed for adjusting all spectra to the same level of scatter. The near-infrared-based reflectance ratios from the scatter adjusted spectra showed high sensitivity to pigment content. The ratio R860/(R550XR708) from the scatter adjusted spectra correlated best with chlorophyll a, chlorophyll a+b, and total carotenoid contents, while R860/R550 correlated best with chlorophyll b content. The newly developed algorithms were tested on a validation data set and allowed accurate estimates of leaf pigment content. The pigment contents estimated by the ratios from untransformed spectra, R672/(R550XR708) and R672/R550, were found to be not significantly different from the estimates obtained using the scatter-adjusted reflectance ratios, R860/(R550XR708) and R860/R550.

Ocean color remote sensing provides a convenient method of determining these concentrations from upwelling radiances. In the open ocean, it is not difficult to derive empirical algorithms relating the received radiances to surface concentrations of chlorophyll. In tur-bid coastal waters, however, this is much more difficult due to the presence of high concentrations of suspended sediments and dissolved organic material, which overwhelm the spectral signal of chlorophyll. Neural networks have been proven successful in modeling a variety of geophysical transfer functions. Here, a neural network is employed to model the transfer function between the chlorophyll and sediment concentrations and the satellite-received radiances. It was found that a neural network with two hidden nodes, using the three visible Landsat Thematic Mapper bands as inputs, was able to model the transfer function to a much higher accuracy than,multiple regression analysis. The RMS errors for the neural network were <10%, while the errors for regression analysis were >25%.

This model consists of a two-source surface component describing the relation between T-RAD and sensible heat flux, coupled with a time-integrated component connecting surface sensible heating with planetary boundary layer development. By tying together the time-dependent behavior of surface temperature and the temperature in the boundary layer with the flux of sensible heat from the surface to the atmosphere, the need for ancillary measurements of near-surface air temperature is eliminated. This is a significant benefit when T-RAD is acquired remotely. Air temperature can be strongly coupled to local biophysical surface conditions and, if the surface air and brightness temperature measurements used by a model are not collocated, energy flux estimates can be significantly corrupted. Furthermore, because this model uses only temporal changes in radiometric temperatures rather than absolute temperatures, time-independent biases in T-RAD, resulting from atmospheric effects or other sources, do not affect the estimated fluxes; only the time-varying component of corrections need be computed. The algorithm also decomposes the surface radiometric temperature into its soil and vegetation contributions; thus the angular dependence of T-RAD can be predicted from an observation of T-RAD at a single view angle. This capability is critical to an accurate interpretation of off-nadir measurements from polar orbiting and geosynchronous satellites. The performance of this model has been evaluated in comparison with data collected during two large-scale field experiments: the first International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project field experiment, conducted in and around the Konza Prairie in Kansas, and the Monsoon \'90 experiment, conducted in the semiarid rangelands of the Walnut Gulch Watershed in southern Arizona. Both comparisons yielded uncertainties comparable to those achieved by models that do require air temperature as an input and to measurement errors typical of standard micrometeorological methods for flux estimation. A strategy for applying the two-source time-integrated model on a regional or continental scale is briefly outlined.

Soil reflectance has a direct relationship with soil color, as well as to other parameters such as texture, soil moisture, and organic matter. Earlier studies have quantified the relationship between reflectance and soil color using simple linear regression equations having correlation coefficients of about 0.5. In the present study, a method called optimal rotational transformation technique has been employed to maximize the correlation between soil color and transformed reflectance. Seventy-six soil samples having a wide range of soil color were employed in the laboratory measurements. Multispectral reflectances were measured using an Exotech radiometer in the visible and near-infrared bands of the Landsat MSS sensor, and soil color was measured using the Munsell color charts. The soil color data were quantified using the RGB color coordinate system since colors recorded in the Munsell system are not readily usable in numerical analysis. Simple linear regression models using the raw reflectance data yielded correlations of about 0.5. Optimal rotational transformation of the reflectance data and multiple linear regressions showed an improved correlation of r more than 0.8, and the models predicted the main color component (viz. hue) with acceptable accuracy. Hue images can be used for identification and discrimination of soils and lithological formations, since hue is independent of illumination and therefore capable of suppressing shadows. Optimal models can be developed to predict soil reflectance using color data since metamerism is rarely observed in the care of soils. Results of this study have a potential application for identification and mapping of soil and geologic materials of nonvegetated or sparsely vegetated regions using data received from airborne and space-borne remote sensors operating in the visible and near-infrared bands.

Twenty such sites are selected with a spatial uniformity better than 3% in relative value in a multitemporal series of cloud-free images. These sites are among the driest sites in the world. Their meteorological properties are here described in terms of cloud cover with ISCCP data and precipitation using data from a network of meteorological stations. Most of the selected sites are large sand seas, the geomorphology of which can be characterized with Spot data. The temporal stability of the spatially averaged reflectance of each selected site is investigated at seasonal and hourly time scales with multitemporal series of Metcosat-4 data. It is found that the temporal variations, of typical peak-to-peak amplitude 8-15% in relative value, are mostly controlled by directional effects. Once the directional effects are removed, the residual rms variations, representative of random temporal variability, are on the order of 1-2% in relative value.

Surface roughness maps and vegetation classification maps derived from AIRSAR data provide useful ancillary information regarding the extent of salinity in the region, but they are not as diagnostic as the determined dielectric constants. The magnitudes of P band radar-determined dielectric constants most closely approach those expected from field determinations, although the distribution of L-band-determined dielectric constants gives the best discrimination between saline and nonsaline areas as seen at the surface. C-band-determined dielectric constants are much lower than expected from field determinations and show saline areas as anomalous only in the bare, most severely affected, areas.

The study area teas the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest on the Blue River Ranger District of the Willamette National Forest in western Oregon. Timber harvesting has occurred in this forest over the past 45 years and has a recorded forest management history. The study area was extracted from a georeferenced TM scene acquired on 7 July 1991. A coincident digital terrain model (DTM) derived from digital topographic elevation data was also acquired. Using this DTM and an image processing software package, slope and aspect images were generated over the study area. Sites were chosen to cover the entire range of forest stand age and slope and aspect. The oldest recorded clearcut stands were logged in 1950. A number of sites were chosen as primary forest which had no recorded history of cutting. Various feed-forward neural networks trained with back propagation were tested to predict forest age from TM data and topographic data. The results demonstrated that neural networks can be used as an initial model for inferring forest age. The best network was a 6-->5-->1 structure with inputs of TM Bands 3, 4, and 5, elevation, slope and aspect. The rms values of the predicted forest age were on the order of 5 years.

Consequently, litter will affect spectral indices designed to be sensitive to green vegetation, soil brightness or other features. The main objectives of the current research were to 1) evaluate the spectral properties of green vegetation and litter and 2) quantify the effect of standing litter on the performance of spectral indices. The SAIL (scattering by arbitrarily inclined leaves) model teas used to generate canopy reflectance \'\'mixtures\'\' and to estimate fractions of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) with varying leaf area index (LAI), soil background, combinations of vegetation, component spectral properties, and one or two horizontal vegetation layers. Spectral measurements of different bare soils and mature green and senescent leaves of representative plant species at the HAPEX-Sahel (Hydrological Atmospheric Pilot Experiment) study sites were used as input. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and the modified NDVI (MNDVI) and mixture model spectral indices were selected to evaluate their performance with respect to standing litter and green vegetation mixtures. Spectral reflectance signatures of leaf litter varied significantly, but strongly resembled soil spectral characteristics. The biophysical parameters (LAI, fAPAR), derived from spectral vegetation indices, tended to be overestimated for randomly distributed, sparse green and fitter vegetation cover mixtures, and underestimated for randomly distributed dense green and litter vegetation cover mixtures. All spectral indices and their biophysical interpretation were significantly altered by variability in 1) green leaf, leaf litter, and bark optical properties, 2) the amount and position of standing leaf litter, 3) leaf angle distribution, and 4) soil background. The NDVI response to these variables was inconsistent, and was the most affected by litter. The spectral mixture model indices, designed to be sensitive to litter were shown to be promising for the identification of litter present among different ecosystems.RP vanLeeuwen, WJD (通讯作者)，UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT SOIL WATER & ENVIRONM SCI, 429 SHANTZ BLDG 38, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA.RI van Leeuwen, Willem/ABB-6711-2020; van Leeuwen, Willem/A-6547-2008;   Huete, Alfredo R/C-1294-2008', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'van Leeuwen, Willem/0000-0002-3188-7172; Huete, Alfredo   R/0000-0003-2809-2376', NULL, NULL, 64, 145, 149, 4, 42, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

However, crops with similar phenology behave radiatively as optically homogeneous canopies. In such cases, a logistic function using five parameters describes the annual time profile of the NDVI. Two of the five parameters are the ascending and descending inflection points, which convey important information about the development of the crop.  Over a region like Beauce (approximately 10,000 km2), the relative area and phenology of the crops grown results in two time profiles, one for winter crops and one for summer crops. Consequently, two logistic functions were combined to describe the variations of the NDVI derived from NOAA /AVHRR data.  The equations are fitted using a nonlinear least squares procedure against data sets that included hand-held radiometer measurements in fields of the individual crops, and two kinds of AVHRR data: actual data and synthetic data contaminated by artificial noise. The use of synthetic data indicates that the inflection points are retrieved with good accuracy, even with noise. When the inversion scheme is applied to actual AVHRR data, it appears that a priori knowledge about the asymptotic values reached by the NDVI of the various crops is required in order to correctly estimate the dates of the inflection points, and then to obtain some useful information about the development of the crops.RP FISCHER, A (通讯作者)，LERTS,CNES,CNRS,UNITE MIXTE,18 AVE E BELIN,BPI 2801,F-31055 TOULOUSE,FRANCE.RI Bondeau, Alberte/E-9909-2012', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Bondeau, Alberte/0000-0002-8729-5061', NULL, NULL, 24, 134, 167, 1, 50, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Uniform sample sites representing cropland, deciduous and coniferous forest, and wetlands were chosen using Landsat images. The effect of atmospheric corrections and the performance of three vegetation indices were also assessed. The results showed that BRD effects in the AVHRR data depend on land cover type, spectral band, the viewing geometry, and the degree of atmospheric correction. Atmospheric corrections increased the value of NDVI but reduced its variation with satellite zenith angle. BRD dependence in AVHRR Channels 1 and 2 could be modeled quite accurately, but spectral band- and land cover-specific model parameters were required for a good fit with the measurements. it is concluded that in AVHRR compositing based on the maximum NDVI value, the most-cloud-free pixel selection should precede atmospheric corrections and the correction for BRD effects.

These data provided information on the spatial and temporal variations Of surface parameters such as vegetation indices, surface temperature, and surface soil moisture. The Pushbroom Microwave Radiometer (PBMR) was used to collect passive microwave brightness temperature data. This four-beam sensor operates at the 21 -cm wavelength, providing cross-track coverage approximately 1.2 times the aircraft altitude, Observed brightness temperatures for the period were high, ranging from above 240 K to about 290 K.

When results from wetter soil conditions encountered in another experiment were included, the regression improved dramatically.

[A dimictic lake is a lake where a complete turnover of the water occurs twice a year (in spring and autumn).] The thermal bar is a zone of mixing that separates waters with temperatures above and below 4-degrees-C. Its practical importance is due to the possibility that it might isolate the nearshore region from the offshore region (as seen from the thermal bar), which may cause a serious pollution problem along the beach. This article presents a study of the thermal bar and its temporal behavior in Lake Ladoga, Russia, using NOAA-AVHRR CH4/CH5 data. As the thermal bar is associated with a rather characteristic temperature pattern, that is, relatively large temperature changes from the shore to the bar and weak gradients beyond implying almost isothermal conditions, satellite data can provide a good means of detecting the existence of a thermal bar. The satellite-derived water surface temperature distributions, calibrated with some in situ temperature data, show that the thermal bar progresses from the shallow southern region to the deep northern part of the lake. The thermal bar progression during spring, obtained from sequences of satellite images, is also compared with predictions from a simple theoretical model. The model assumes that the heat entering through the surface of a water column remains within the column (i.e., horizontal heat fluxes are neglected) and that complete vertical mixing takes place by convective water movements. The comparison shows a good agreement between satellite-derived an model-predicted thermal bar locations (although there are uncertainties as to certain inputs to the model). This indicates that advective and diffusive horizontal heat fluxes are not of primary importance for the thermal bar displacement and that the model is a good first approximation for predictions of the thermal bar location.', 'UNIV LUND,DEPT WATER RESOURCES ENGN,BOX 118,S-22100 LUND,SWEDEN.', 'Lund UniversityRI Malm, Joakim G B/JFA-2440-2023', NULL, 'Malm, Joakim G B/0000-0002-5755-3373', NULL, NULL, 17, 13, 15, 0, 3, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Five aircraft flights were flown along a north-south transect between about 147-degrees-W and 152-degrees-W, and extending from about 63-degrees-N (south of Fairbanks, Alaska) to the Arctic Ocean coastline, with an Aircraft Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (AMMR) on-board operating at 92 GHz, 37 GHz, 21 GHz, and 18 GHz. Passive microwave data from the satellite-borne Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI), operating at 85.5 GHz, 37 GHz, 21 GHz, 18 GHz, and 10 GHz, were obtained concurrently. A good correspondence in brightness temperature (T(B)) trends between the aircraft and satellite data was found. However, an expected inverse correlation between depth hoar thickness and T(B) was not found to be strong. A persistent T(B) minimum in both the aircraft and the satellite data was detected along the northern foothills of the Brooks Range. In an area located at about 68-degrees-50\'N, 149-degrees-20\'W, the T(B) as recorded from the aircraft microwave sensor dropped by 55 K Satellite microwave measurements showed a T(B) decrease of up to 45 K at approximately the same location. Snow pit measurements did not reveal notable differences in snow characteristics or depth in this location. examination of passive microwave satellite data from 1978 to 1987 revealed that similar low late-winter T(B) values were found in approximately the same locations as those observed in March 1988. According to the satellite data, the zone of low T(B) develops as the snow deepens, and reaches the lowest values in March or April each year. The cause of this T(B) minimum is unknown but thought to be related to snow stratigraphy. The observed difficulty in relating the ground measurements to data collected using aircraft and satellite passive microwave sensors is attributed to the fact that the snow depth and character are highly variable in central and northern Alaska. This variability is exemplified in the field measurements as well as in the passive microwave measurements.', 'COLD REG RES & ENGN LAB,FAIRBANKS,AK.   UNIV ALASKA,INST GEOPHYS,FAIRBANKS,AK 99701.

Due to the spatial and temporal resolution of satellite remote sensing instruments, many formulations have been developed to convert remotely sensed data into estimates of albedo.  Most of these equations depend upon the assumption of isotropic reflection and, therefore, use only nadir measurements; only in recent years have investigators attempted to model the anisotropic nature of terrestrial surfaces.  A Barnes Modular Multiband Radiometer (MMR) was used to collect remotely sensed data from prairie vegetation at seven view zenith angles in the solar principal plane.  An equation to estimate albedo from bidirectional reflectance data is proposed and evaluated in this paper.  The estimates of albedo were greater than values obtained with simultaneous pyranometer measurements:  a more conventional approach.  The overestimation was systematic.  Potential sources of error are discussed and include:  1) extrapolation of the bidirectional reflectance data out to a view zenith angle of 90-degrees; 2) use of inappropriate weighting coefficients in the numerator of the albedo equation; 3) surface shadowing caused by the A-frame instrumentation used to measure the incoming and outgoing radiation fluxes; 4) errors in estimates of the denominator of the proposed albedo equation (i.e., incoming shortwave radiation); and 5) a \"hot spot\" contribution in bidirectional data measured by the MMR.', 'UNIV NEBRASKA,DEPT AGR METEOROL,LINCOLN,NE 68588.

However, the previous studies have not effectively corrected these deviations and outliers. To this end, we propose a method for correcting the terrain elevation of the ATL08 product in urban areas, which is an auto-refinement method for the terrain elevation. Based on the data characteristics of this type of terrain elevation data and the distribution characteristics of urban buildings, the proposed method innovatively corrects the deviated part of the terrain elevation by a water pump deployment criterion with the vertical contour of the terrain. To increase its applicability, the proposed method uses a strategy of mixing the terrain elevation data that are from the strong- and weak-beam observations, allowing the deviated terrain in one beam with a higher missing data rate to be corrected with the aid of the other beam with a lower missing data rate. We used airborne LiDAR data from several areas (New York, Amsterdam, and Palmerston North) with different city sizes to validate the corrected results. The results show that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the terrain elevation in urban areas is reduced from -4 m to -1 m after correction. The correction results also show that the proposed method can correct the deviated terrain elevation, while ensuring that the high-quality terrain elevation can be effectively retained.', '[Li, Binbin; Xie, Huan; Liu, Shijie; Sun, Yuan; Xu, Qi; Tong, Xiaohua] Tongji Univ, Coll Surveying & Geoinformat, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.

Reducing poverty has become a crucial objective for global sustainable development. Timely and consistently monitoring poverty status plays a vital role in evaluating the efficiency of poverty reduction policies. Nighttime light images from satellites allow for frequent monitoring of poverty status by recording lighting intensity. The coarse spatial resolution of the recent, widely used, publicly available nighttime light images hinders research on smaller unit scales, such as county level. The SDGSAT-1 satellite, with a glimmer sensor and a spatial resolution of 10-m, was launched in 2021 to meet the sustainable development goals. This study proposes a model to sharpen the existing nighttime light images with a coarse spatial resolution to expand the available period of nighttime light images with a 10-m spatial resolution in discriminating illuminating ground objects. The expanded nighttime light images with discriminated illuminating ground objects are then utilized to calculate the time-series county-level poverty index for three typical Chinese urban agglomerations with a statistically significant correlation coefficient of 0.675 (p < 0.01). Compared to the poverty statistics derived from the Chinese county statistical yearbook, the estimated poverty index can explore county-level poverty status change more effectively by completing the missing census. The time-series county-level poverty analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of Chinese endeavor in poverty reduction. >90% of the counties experienced a reduction in poverty in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region due to time-series economic development. Statistical analysis of the poverty index of impoverished counties demonstrates a remarkable reduction of poverty in the study areas and the significance of the persistent poverty reduction policy implementation. This study\'s proposed pipeline compensates for the lack of nighttime light images with a higher spatial resolution prior to 2021 and provides a reliable poverty analysis foundation for sustainable development and policymaking.', '[Yu, Bo; Chen, Fang; Ye, Cheng; Wang, Ning; Wang, Lei] Int Res Ctr Big Data Sustainable Dev Goals, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.

An automatic front detection algorithm applied to satellite-based observations is a fundamental approach to acquiring frontal occurrence information. Histogram-based algorithms have been widely used in previous studies, and, despite being the most popular front detection algorithm, continuous improvements have been needed to address imperfect detection issues (undetected coastal fronts, discontinuities of fronts and repeated detection of fronts). In this study, a new algorithm is proposed to address the issues by coupling inverse distance weighting and mathematical morphology operators. Using 14,610 images acquired from 1982 to 2021, a series of comparisons between the new and existing algorithms have been implemented to validate the improvements. Statistical results suggest that the number of frontal pixels detected by our algorithm increased by 58.45% in the coastal domain when compared to previous methods. Statistical analysis also shows most of these increased fronts can be supported by a classic gradient-based method which is superior in detecting coastal fronts, which demonstrates the improvement of new algorithm in detecting coastal fronts. Furthermore, visual analyses suggest that our algorithm can better connect discontinuous fronts and reduce repeated detections, and statistical comparisons in the open seas present a 34.50% improvement in the average length of frontal segments. Moreover, based on an automated objective delineation method, an analysis of 40 years of seasonal frontal occurrences (as detected by our algorithm) produced a dataset that shows a detailed map of 59 persistent fronts around the China Seas. This map updates previously hand-delineated frontal positions and identifies some previously unreported persistent fronts. Further analyses show that the frontal occurrence or intensity of a majority of persistent fronts around the China Seas presents significant (P < 0.05) long-term variability over the last 40 years. The improved algorithm, together with its application in identifying persistent fronts around the China Seas, is expected to be extended to other waters to better investigate the response of marine ecosystems to front dynamics and predict the distribution of marine organisms within a changing climate.', '[Xing, Qinwang; Yu, Haiqing; Wang, Hui] Shandong Univ, Inst Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China.

While existing bio-optical algorithms provide valuable information, relying solely on satellite ocean color data remains insufficient to obtain high-precision retrieval of PG due to the intricate nature of the bio-optical signal and PG composition itself. An interdisciplinary approach combining advancements in machine learning with big data from ocean observations and simulations offers a promising avenue for more accurate quantification of PG composition. In this study, an ensemble learning approach, called the spatial-temporal-ecological ensemble (STEE) model, is developed to construct a robust prediction model for eight distinct phytoplankton groups (i.e., Diatoms, Dinoflagellates, Haptophytes, Pelagophytes, Cryptophytes, Green Algae, Prokaryotes, and Prochlorococcus). The proposed method introduces multiple data simultaneously: ocean color, physical oceanographic, biogeochemical, and spatial and temporal information. An ensemble strategy is applied to increase the performance of the model by merging three advanced machine-learning algorithms. The combined validation of multiple cross-validation (CV) strategies (i.e., standard, spatial block, and temporal block CVs) shows that the proposed STEE model has superior robustness and generalization ability. In addition, the analysis shows a high degree of concordance between the independent datasets and the modeled estimations for long-time series sites, indicating that the STEE model is capable of effectively monitoring long-term trends in phytoplankton group composition. Finally, the proposed model was utilized to retrieve global monthly phytoplankton group products (STEE-PG) over an extended period (September 1997 to May 2020), and comparisons demonstrated better rationality of spatio-temporal distribution than existing satellite-derived phytoplankton group products. Hence, this new model comprehensively integrates all kinds of observation data and yields long-term global PG products with high accuracy, which will enhance our understanding of the response of marine ecosystems to environmental and climate change.', '[Zhang, Yuan; Shen, Fang] East China Normal Univ, Ctr Blue Carbon Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Shanghai, Peoples R China.

Most current vegetation monitoring methodologies rely on spectral vegetation indices (VIs) observed by polar-orbiting satellites, which provide one or a few observations per day. This study proposes a new methodology based on diurnal changes in land surface temperatures (LSTs) using Japan\'s geostationary satellite, Himawari-8/Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI). AHI thermal infrared observation provides LSTs at 10-min frequencies and similar to 2 km spatial resolution. The DTC parameters that summarize the diurnal cycle waveform were obtained by fitting a diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) model to the time-series LST information for each day. To clarify the applicability of DTC parameters in detecting vegetation drying under humid climates, DTC parameters from in situ LSTs observed at vegetation sites, as well as those from Himawari-8 LSTs, were evaluated for East Asia. Utilizing the record-breaking heat wave that occurred in East Asia in 2018 as a case study, the anomalies of DTC parameters from the Himawari-8 LSTs were compared with the drying signals indicated by VIs, latent heat fluxes (LE), and surface soil moisture (SM). The results of site-based and satellite-based analyses revealed that DTR (diurnal temperature range) correlates with the evaporative fraction (EF) and SM, whereas T-max (daily maximum LST) correlates with LE and VIs. Regarding other temperature-related parameters, T-0 (LST around sunrise), T-a (temperature rise during daytime), and delta T (temperature fall during nighttime) are unstable in quantification by DTC model. Moreover, time-related parameters, such as t(m) (time reaching T-max), are more sensitive to topographic slope and geometric conditions than surface thermal properties at humid sites in East Asia, although they correlate with EF and SM at a semi-arid site in Australia. Additionally, the spatial distribution of the DTR anomaly during the 2018 heat wave corresponds with the drying signals indicated as negative SM anomalies. Regions with large positive anomalies in T-max and DTR correspond to area with visible damage to vegetation, as indicated by negative VI anomalies. Hence, combined T-max and DTR potentially detects vegetation drying indetectable by VIs, thereby providing earlier and more detailed vegetation monitoring in both humid and semi-arid climates.', '[Yamamoto, Yuhei] Chiba Univ, Inst Adv Acad Res IAAR, 1-33 Yayoi cho,Inage ku, Chiba 2638522, Japan.

Debris layer makes the melting process of glaciers complicated, and the correlation between the spatial melt differences of glacier and its surface features is still not clear. The aim of this study was to identify possible causes of thickness changes for Himalayan debris-covered glaciers. Firstly, three high resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) datasets including SRTM DEM, AW3D and TanDEM-X DEM were used to estimate glacier thickness changes from 2000 to 2013. By checking and removing geometric displacements, systematic deviations and elevation-related bias, as well as correction of radar wave penetration depth in the clean glacier areas, reliable thickness change information in this complex glaciated region were provided. Then debris thicknesses on the glaciers were estimated. The surface lowering caused by ice cliffs or supraglacial ponds significantly reduces debris thickness. Finally, some surface features including debris thicknesses, spatial patterns of supraglacial ponds and ice cliffs extracted from high-resolution satellite images in different times, were comprehensively used to evaluate the main drivers of glacier melting differences. Results demonstrate that spatial variability of glacier melting in Himalayas is caused by the combined effects of debris thicknesses, ice cliffs and supraglacial lakes, with different dominant factors for different regions. The thickened glacier region, which mostly appears above 5300 m a.s.l., with minimal debris cover, displayed large patches of thickening and partial serious thinning in the debris-free areas. Although the thick debris layer (> 0.20 m) would slow down the glacier melting at the low-elevations, it leads to the heavy glacier thinning for the regions located 5000-5300 m a.s.l., where there are dense ice cliffs. In some areas with >1 m of average debris thickness, glaciers have thinned slowly because of erosion from the ice cliffs or large supraglacial ponds. Area and number of cliffs have proven to be key factors in controlling regional ablation for debris-covered glaciers, and supraglacial lakes serve as assistance.', '[Chen, Fang; Wang, Jinxiao; Li, Bin; Yang, Aqiang; Zhang, Meimei] Int Res Ctr Big Data Sustainable Dev Goals, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.

Sun glint areas remain a challenge for the existing cloud and SWDR algorithms based on the visible channel since surface specular reflection has a sig-nificant impact on satellite retrieval. In this study, a set of algorithms for cloud detection and cloud microphysical parameter estimation were developed using infrared multichannel data from the new generation geostationary satellite Himawari-8 based on the random forest method. The results indicated that the cloud retrieval algorithm exhibited better performance in the sun glint areas where the official Himawari-8 products (cloud detection and cloud optical thickness) were overestimated. We developed a new SWDR estimation algorithm combining the radiative transfer model and machine learning techniques by considering the cloud properties from the cloud retrieval algorithm. The results indicated that the SWDR and cloud radiative forcing derived by the new algo-rithm were more consistent with those of the well-known radiation products Cloud and the Earth\'s Radiant Energy System than those estimated using the official-based cloud product, with decreases in the root mean square error of approximately 22% and 41%, respectively.

Therefore, identifying areas and environmental features that allow certain organisms to be less exposed to the effects of the current global warming is priority for biodiversity conservation. In this study, we describe a novel approach for the identification of microclimatic refugia in rugged mountain areas, specifically for the detection of most thermally stable areas, using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) capable of recording in the visible and thermal infrared spectral bands. We estimated land surface temperatures (LST) at very-high spatial resolution in six topographically complex sectors of the Pyrenees (NE Spain), across seasons with vegetative activity (summer 2020, autumn 2020, spring 2021, and summer 2021), and at two thermally contrasted times of the day (early in the morning: LSTmin, and in the afternoon: LSTmax). LST were validated with a network of miniaturized temperature sensors in the field. LSTmin and LSTmax allowed us to calculate the daily thermal range of each sector across the seasons, and thus the most thermally stable areas over the year. To reveal the importance of different variables on low and narrow thermal ranges we applied Gradient Boosted Models to seven terrain variables derived from ALS-LiDAR (slope, northness, eastness, heat load, wind exposure index, SAGA\'s topographic wetness index, and vector ruggedness measure) and a proxy of forest density through the three-dimensional point clouds of the UAV data. The northness was the variable that most promoted thermal stability, followed by the slope and forest density, so that microclimatic refugia resulted to be located in northern slopes, small sites under rocky cliffs, and forested areas. Our results demonstrate that thermal UAVs can become promising tools for the identification of microclimatic refugia in topographically complex areas, providing information at unprecedented spatial resolution, and thus of high interest for biodiversity conservation.', '[Hoffren, Raul] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Geog & Land Management, Geoforest IUCA, Pedro Cerbuna 12, Zaragoza 50009, Spain.

Changes in ET have important consequences for water-related ecosystem services as well as for forest produc-tivity. Forests play a critical role in ET: active trees sequester carbon at the expense of losing water, yet if they are not active, water remains in the trees, but productivity stalls. We estimated the capacity of forests to recover (resilience) from extreme water or productivity losses based on modeled ET through remote sensing methods across the conterminous USA. Results show there is a spatial tradeoff in resilience to water or productivity losses. Forests were more resilient to water loss in the drier west, and more resilient to productivity loss in the wetter east. Still, resilience was highly heterogeneous across the continent. Projections under climate change indicate both declines and increases of up to 13% in forest resilience, with broad regional trends but high spatial het-erogeneity within regions.

However, existing products of urban building heights at a regional or global scale are mostly subject to coarse grid size or long-time lags. Fineresolution building height maps remain unavailable for most regions to present recent vertical information. Also, the lack of sampled building heights with spatial and temporal consistency at larger scales makes it difficult to update building height maps. The newly available spaceborne lidar data from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) are expected to overcome these critical barriers. Here we propose a generalizable approach to mapping large-scale distributions of building heights by fusing GEDI-derived relative height metrics, optical data (i.e., Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2), and radar data (Sentinel-1). We applied our approach to the Yangtze River Delta region (YRD), one of China\'s largest urban agglomerations. We investigated the availability of building height samples generated from GEDI-based relative height metrics and the optimal grid size of building height mapping into 30-m (about footprint level) and 150-m (regional level) grid sizes. We finally developed a random forest model using active and passive sensors to extrapolate GEDI-derived samples discretely to the continuous building height map at the 150-m grid size in 2019. We revealed the spatial distribution patterns of building heights and the urbanization effect on the city\'s mean building heights in the YRD region. We found that: (1) GEDI-derived building height samples were highly consistent with the reference building height data at the footprint (i.e., Pearson\'s r = 0.86, RMSE = 9.25 m, n = 237) and regional (i.e., Pearson\'s r = 0.76, RMSE = 6.36 m, n = 69) levels. (2) The Pearson\'s correlation coefficient (r) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the final spatially continuous and up-to-date building height map were 0.85 and 5.03 m, respectively. (3) The resulting map showed a strong positive correlation between the city\'s mean building height and urbanization level.

However, LST is subject to considerable angular variation, particularly in urban areas caused by a large variation of sensor viewing angles and non-isothermal facades of 3D urban structures. Anisotropy varies seasonally and diurnally, and is sensitive to sensor viewing geometry, solar angles, and urban surface properties. Current studies focus on urban thermal anisotropy of individual cities, comparative study and the resultant driving factor analysis are still lacking. To bridge this critical knowledge gap, a systematic comparative assessment of satellite-based urban thermal anisotropy is required. Here, we modify and validate a satellite-based anisotropy estimation approach and compare the seasonal and diurnal anisotropy variations over 25 global cities to answer the following research questions: 1) How do the anisotropy magnitude and profile shapes vary among different cities? 2) What are the factors influencing the anisotropy? The results show that off-nadir observations are up to 3.5 K cooler on average than nadir LST during summer whereas the effective anisotropy ranges between 2.1 K and 5.8 K for all cities. Winter anisotropy is much smaller (similar to 1 K), where the warm or cold bias is determined by solar zenith angle (morning/afternoon overpasses), and its bias magnitude is linearly proportional to the sensor zenith angle. Urban thermal anisotropy is partly influenced by geographic location (e.g., latitude, longitude), urban vegetation (measured by NDVI) and urban geometry (building height-street width ratio, h/w), where low latitude cities or cities with less vegetation tend to have a greater angular variation in summer, and the anisotropy tends to increase with more complex urban morphology (i.e., higher building aspect ratio). High vegetation cover makes the anisotropy distribution shape more asymmetric along the cross-track direction (or sensor zenith angle). Our findings help understand the seasonal and diurnal impact of anisotropy for wide-swath LST applications in cities and offers insights for addressing anisotropy in future satellite products.', '[Wang, Dandan; He, Xiaoyu] China Univ Geosci, Sch Land Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.

However, the reference values are affected by various kinds of errors, which tend to make the reported accuracies of the remote sensing-based predictions worse than they are. The more accurate the remote sensing techniques are becoming, the more pronounced this problem will be. This paper addresses the impact of uncertainties in field reference data due to measurement errors, model errors, and position errors when evaluating the accuracy of biomass predictions from airborne laser scanning at plot level. We present novel theoretical analysis methods that take the interactions of the error sources into account. Further, an error characterization model (ECM) is used to describe the error structure of the remote sensing-based predictions, and we show how the parameters of the ECM can be adjusted when field references contain errors. We also show how root mean square error (RMSE) estimates can be adjusted. Based on data from Scandinavian forests, we conclude that the field reference errors have an impact on the remote sensing-based predictions. By accounting for these errors the RMSE of the remote sensing-based predictions was reduced by 6-18%. The most influential sources of error in the field references were found to be the residual errors of the allometric biomass model and the field plot position errors. Together, these two sources accounted for 97% of the variance while measurement errors and biomass model parameter uncertainties were negligible in our study.', '[Persson, Henrik Jan; Ekstrom, Magnus; Stahl, Goran] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Forest Resource Management, Umea, Sweden.

Traditionally, oceanographic parameters have been monitored using different sensors. With the development of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) observations have been found to oscillate due to the interference between direct and reflected signals. GNSS-interferometry reflectometry (GNSS-IR) utilizes the characteristics of these oscillations to retrieve the parameters of a reflecting surface. For GNSS marine application, GNSS-IR sea-level retrieval technology has considerably improved and is undergoing rapid development; however, only a few studies have estimated significant wave height (SWH) and wind direction using GNSS-IR. The cut-off elevation, an SNR parameter, is the elevation angle at which the dominant power of one SNR arc switches between coherent and incoherent energy and is related to SWH and wind direction. Methods to estimate SWH and wind direction were presented based on the cut-off elevation. Moreover, we introduced the Generalized Shallow Water Wave Growth (GSWWG) model to estimate the wave peak period based on retrieved SWH. The sea level, wind direction, SWH, and wave peak period were estimated using a geodetic GNSS receiver. Data were collected before and after Hurricane Delta using the GNSS site CALC, Louisiana, USA. First, the classical GNSS-IR method was used to retrieve sea levels. Second, the wavelet analysis method was processed to SNR arcs to form wavelet spectra showing the nonstationary power and estimate their cut-off elevations. Third, the lower cut-off elevation was used to estimate the wind direction, and the upper cut-off elevation was used to estimate the SWH. Finally, the wave peak period was estimated from the retrieved SWH based on the GSWWG model. The results showed a root mean square error of 4.72 cm between sea-level measurements and sea-level retrievals, and a correlation coefficient > 80% between wind speed measurements and SWH retrievals estimated from GPS L5 and GLONASS R2. The points of SWH retrievals vs. wind speeds of GPS L5 and GLONASS R2 corresponded well to the wind-SWH relationship deduced from the GSWWG model. These results indicated that GNSS-IR technology could estimate the wave peak period in addition to its previously known applications for retrieving sea level, wind direction, and SWH, providing additional oceanographic services.', '[Wang, Xiaolei; He, Xiufeng; Chen, Shu; Niu, Zijin] Hohai Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, Nanjing 211100, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

Over the last few decades, the role of satellite sensors in river discharge estimation is significantly increased thanks to the strong growth in technologies and applications. Focusing on daily river discharge measurements, a non-linear regression model has been used to link the near-infrared (NIR) reflectance ratio between a dry and a wet pixel around the section of a river to the ground measurements of river discharge. The use of medium-resolution satellite data, such as those from MODIS sensors, enables to monitor high and low flows in medium-sized catchments (<100,000 km2), thanks to satellite frequent revisit time and wide spatial coverage. However, such sensors are not suitable to provide information for medium-narrow rivers (< 250 m wide), nor to study river features and patterns that are averaged within a single pixel. Here, we investigated the use of Sentinel-2 NIR reflectances to support the hypothesis that a higher spatial resolution, i.e. 10 m, is able to better identify the wet pixels, more related to the river dynamics, with obvious advantages for river discharge estimation compared to the medium resolution sensors (e.g., MODIS at 250 m). Moreover, it also allows both a finer distinction between vegetation, soil and water and the characterization of water turbidity in the river area. A new formulation enriched by the sediment component is proposed together with a first step toward an uncalibrated procedure to select the wet pixels. Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform has been employed for the data analysis, allowing to avoid the download of big amounts of data, fostering the reproducibility of the analysis in different locations. The accuracy of the river discharges derived from Sentinel-2 reflectances is evaluated against the in-situ observations from selected gauging stations along two Italian rivers, Po and Tiber. The results confirm the good performances obtained with high-resolution images over the Po River, with average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency ranging between 0.39 and 0.56 for the different configurations adopted. Relatively worse results were obtained over the Tiber River where the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency ranged between 0.2 and 0.61, due to an issue on the registration of Sentinel-2 images.', '[Filippucci, Paolo; Brocca, Luca; Tarpanelli, Angelica] CNR, Res Inst Geohydrol Protect, Perugia, Italy.

The framework of the study is multiphase modeling, where AGB field data and wall-to-wall airborne laser scanning (ALS) and Sentinel-2 data are used to produce proxy ALS plots on ICESat-2 track positions. Models between the predicted proxy AGB and the ICESat-2 photon data are then formulated and evaluated by subsets, such as only strong beam data captured in snowy conditions.   Our results indicate that, if possible, strong beam night data from snowless conditions should be used in AGB estimation, because our models showed clearly smallest RMSE (26.9%) for this data subset. If more data are needed, we recommend using only strong beam data and constructing separate models for the different data subsets. In the order of increasing RMSE%, the next best options were snow/night/strong (30.4%), snow/day/strong (33.5%), and snowless/day/strong (34.1%).

Multiple methods have been developed to address the problem of cloud detection in satellite imagery and a number of cloud masking algorithms have been developed for optical sensors but very few studies have carried out quantitative intercomparison of state-of-the-art methods in this domain. This paper summarizes results of the first Cloud Masking Intercomparison eXercise (CMIX) conducted within the Committee Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Calibration & Validation (WGCV). CEOS is the forum for space agency coordination and cooperation on Earth observations, with activities organized under working groups. CMIX, as one such activity, is an international collaborative effort aimed at intercomparing cloud detection algorithms for moderate-spatial resolution (10-30 m) spaceborne optical sensors. The focus of CMIX is on open and free imagery acquired by the Landsat 8 (NASA/USGS) and Sentinel-2 (ESA) missions. Ten algorithms developed by nine teams from fourteen different organizations representing universities, research centers and industry, as well as space agencies (CNES, ESA, DLR, and NASA), are evaluated within the CMIX. Those algo-rithms vary in their approach and concepts utilized which were based on various spectral properties, spatial and temporal features, as well as machine learning methods. Algorithm outputs are evaluated against existing reference cloud mask datasets. Those datasets vary in sampling methods, geographical distribution, sample unit (points, polygons, full image labels), and generation approaches (experts, machine learning, sky images). Overall, the performance of algorithms varied depending on the reference dataset, which can be attributed to differences in how the reference datasets were produced. The algorithms were in good agreement for thick cloud detection, which were opaque and had lower uncertainties in their identification, in contrast to thin/semi-transparent clouds detection. Not only did CMIX allow identification of strengths and weaknesses of existing algorithms and potential areas of improvements, but also the problems associated with the existing reference datasets. The paper concludes with recommendations on generating new reference datasets, metrics, and an analysis framework to be further exploited and additional input datasets to be considered by future CMIX activities.', '[Skakun, Sergii; Roger, Jean-Claude] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, Pk 1153 LeFrak Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

These process dynamics complicate assessments of plant-water relations but also offer various access points to advance understanding of vegetation responses to environmental change. Remote sensing (RS) provides large capacity to quantify sensitive and robust information of vegetation responses and underlying abiotic change driver across observational scales. Retrieved RS based vegetation parameters are often sensitive to various environmental and plant specific factors in addition to the targeted plant response. Further, individual plant responses to water limitation act at different temporal and spatial scales, while RS sampling schemes are often not optimized to assess these dynamics. The combination of these aspects complicates the interpretation of RS parameter when assessing plant-water relations. We consequently aim to advance insight on the sensitivity of physiological, biochemical and structural RS parameter for plant adaptation in response to emerging soil water limitation. We made a field experiment in maize in Tuscany (Central Italy), while irrigation was stopped in some areas of the drip-irrigated field. Within a period of two weeks, we measured the hydraulic and physiological state of maize plants in situ and complemented these detailed measurements with extensive airborne observations (e.g. sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), vegetation indices sensitive for photosynthesis, pigment and water content, land surface temperature). We observe a double response of far-red SIF with a short-term increase after manifestation of soil water limitation and a decrease afterwards. We identify different response times of RS parameter representing different plant adaptation mechanisms ranging from short term responses (e.g. stomatal conductance, photosynthesis) to medium term changes (e.g. pigment decomposition, changing leaf water content). Our study demonstrates complementarity of common and new RS parameter to mechanistically assess the complex cascade of functional, biochemical and structural plant responses to evolving soil water limitation.', '[Damm, A.; Fritsche, L.; Sturm, J.] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.

Agricultural drought assessment is based on a deficit of soil moisture (SM) during the plant-growing season, whereas meteorological drought corresponds to subnormal precipitation over months to years. However, satellite-derived agricultural and meteorological drought indices (including those comprising root-zone SM) have not been comprehensively compared to evaluate their ability for drought delineation and particularly forecasting across climate regimes, land cover and soil types, and irrigation management (irrigated vs. rainfed) in the contiguous USA (CONUS). Here, we did so from 2015 to 2019 within the CONUS. In most regions except the US Midwest and Southeast, SM-based indices (e.g., Palmer Z, SMAP, SWDI) delineated agricultural drought better than meteorological (e.g., SPI, SPEI) and hybrid (Comprehensive Drought Index, CDI) drought indices. In contrast, the SPI and SPEI showed strong correlation with the aridity index in most part of the CONUS except the Midwest. SM-based and hybrid indices also demonstrated skills for agricultural drought forecasting (represented by end-of-year cumulative GPP), predominantly in the early growing season and particularly in irrigated rather than rainfed croplands. These findings indicate the leading role of SM in controlling ecosystem dryness and confirm \"drought memory\", possibly due to SM-memory in land-atmosphere coupling. Proper application of meteorological and agricultural drought indices and their contrasting spatial-temporal controls on plant growth and ecosystem dryness has the potential to improve our understanding of drought evolution and provide early drought forecasting across large regions with diverse climate regimes, land cover types, soil textural classes, and irrigation management.', '[Chatterjee, Sumanta; Huang, Jingyi] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Soil Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

Widely used indicators to assess the efficiency and sustainability of settlement development are the compactness and density of the built-up area. However, at global scale, a temporally consistent and spatially detailed survey of the distribution and concentration of the building stock - meaning the total area and volume of buildings within a defined spatial unit or settlement, commonly referred to as building density - does not yet exist. To fill this data and knowledge gap, an approach was developed to map key characteristics of the world\'s building stock in a so far unprecedented level of spatial detail for every single settlement on our planet. The resulting World Settlement Footprint 3D dataset quantifies the fraction, total area, average height, and total volume of buildings for a measuring grid with 90 m cell size. The World Settlement Footprint 3D is generated using a modified version of the World Settlement Footprint human settlements mask derived from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery at 10 m spatial resolution, in combination with 12 m digital elevation data and radar imagery collected by the TanDEM-X mission. The underlying, automated processing framework includes three basic workflows: one estimating the mean building height based on an analysis of height differences along potential building edges, a second module determining the building fraction and total building area within each 90 m cell, and a third part combining the height information and building area in order to determine the average height and total built-up volume at 90 m gridding. Optionally, a simple 3D building model (level of detail 1) can be generated for regions where data on the building footprints is available. A comprehensive validation campaign based on 3D building models obtained for 19 regions (similar to 86,000 km(2)) and street-view samples indicating the number of floors for >130,000 individual buildings in 15 additional cities documents that the novel World Settlement Footprint 3D data provides valuable and, for the first time, globally consistent information on key characteristics of the building stock in both, large urban agglomerations as well as small-scale rural settlements.

In this study, we investigated the relationship between the solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence at 760 nm (SIF760) and the gross primary productivity (GPP), as well as the underlying mechanisms in coastal salt marshes that are regularly flooded by tides, based on continuous observations of the SIF760 and GPP throughout the growing season of Phragmites australis during 2019. The results show that the SIF760 was significantly correlated with the GPP on the half-hourly, daily, and weekly scales in different phenological stages, and the linearity of the SIF760-GPP relationship generally improved as the time scale increased. Moreover, we found that the canopy structure (i.e., leaf area index and spatial distribution of leaf angles) plays a major role in explaining the relationship between the SIF760 and photosynthesis on half-hourly and daily scales at the study site. Tidal flooding significantly suppressed the strength of the correlation between SIF760 and GPP in the early and rapid growth vegetation stage. Furthermore, the tides generally lowered the degree of the correlation between the light use efficiency for photosynthesis (LUEp) and the SIF yield, and between the LUEp and the canopy SIF760 escape probability. This indicates that tidal inundation diminished the roles of the plant physiology and canopy structure in explaining the relationship between the SIF760 and photosynthesis, and thus, it had a negative effect on the SIF760-based GPP estimation. The results of this study demonstrate that tidal inundation exerts a significant influence on the relationships between the SIF760 and GPP and their responses to the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, which leads to a better understanding of the mechanism linking the SIF760 and photosynthesis in tidal wetlands and provides new insights into reliable blue carbon quantification in a large scale domain.', '[Huang, Ying; Zhou, Cheng; Du, Minghui; Yuan, Lin; Tang, Jianwu] East China Normal Univ, Ctr Blue Carbon Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Shanghai, Peoples R China.

Satellite earth observation provides an unparalleled source of freely available data for studying dynamic coastlines through time and across large spatial extents. However, previous satellite-derived shoreline mapping approaches have been challenged by two key limitations: the medium spatial resolution of freely available satellite data, and the confounding influence of tides that can obscure longer term patterns of coastal change. In this study we present Digital Earth Australia Coastlines, a new continental dataset documenting three decades of coastal change across Australia. We combine sub-pixel waterline extraction with a new pixel-based tidal modelling method to seamlessly map almost 2 million km of tide-datum shorelines along the entire Australian coast from 1988 to 2019. Our tidally-constrained median composite approach maps the dominant annual position of the shoreline at 0 m Above Mean Sea Level each year, suppressing the short-term influence of tides and sub-annual shoreline variability. Using this robust mid-term shoreline proxy, long-term coastal change rates spanning the last three decades were accurately quantified and mapped at the continental scale. We find that 22% of Australia\'s non-rocky coastline has retreated or grown significantly since 1988, with 16% changing at greater than 0.5 m per year. Although trends of retreat and growth were closely balanced across the Australian continent, our results highlight significant regional variability and extreme local hotspots of coastal change. Our findings provide new insights into patterns and trends of coastal change across Australia, and highlight advantages and limitations of tide modelling and composite-based methods for extracting consistent shoreline data and long-term coastal trends from earth observation data at continental scale.

Our results show that mitigating the effect of ionospheric artifacts on long wavelengths, such as the L-band, InSAR data is critical to studying some strong earthquakes. It is therefore advisable at least as a precaution to check the level of significance of the ionospheric artifacts when studying strong earthquakes with InSAR, and when the artifacts are found to be significant, corrections for the artifacts should be applied.

Most recently, the availability of daily PlanetScope imagery has created new opportunities for monitoring the land surface phenology (LSP) of terrestrial ecosystems at high spatial resolution. However, the quality and value of LSP information from PlanetScope imagery have not been systematically examined. In this paper, we evaluate the character and quality of LSP information derived from PlanetScope by comparing time series of vegetation indices and LSP metrics from PlanetScope to corresponding time series and LSP metrics derived from Harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) imagery and PhenoCams at six sites that span a diverse range of land cover types and climate. Results show that vegetation index time series from all three data sources show high temporal correlation, and LSP metrics derived from HLS, PlanetScope, and PhenoCam show high agreement with negligible bias. Semi-variograms for phenometrics estimated from PlanetScope imagery indicate that the majority of spatial variance captured in PlanetScope phenometrics occurs well below the spatial resolution HLS imagery. At the same time, LSP metrics from HLS are most strongly correlated with the 50-75% quantiles of 3 m LSP metrics from PlanetScope. This indicates that HLS captures the average phenology at sub-pixel scale captured in PlanetScope imagery. Our results represent the first comprehensive comparison of LSP metrics estimated from PlanetScope and publicly available moderate spatial resolution imagery, and provide insights regarding: (1) the quality and character of LSP metrics derived from HLS and PlanetScope; and (2) the relative merits and trade-offs associated with the use of each data source for LSP studies.', '[Moon, Minkyu; Friedl, Mark A.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA.

The forward simulation is accurate with 1.7, 1.8, and 2.3 dB rmse for grass, wheat (including oat and forage), and soybean respectively assessed over 38 fields and during the full growth period for soybean. Dominant scattering mechanisms revealed by the model are found consistent across the incidence angle range: surface (VV) and double bounce (HH) for grass, double bounce for both polarization of wheat, and surface (young plant) and volume (mature plant) for both polarization of soy-bean. The model fidelity is robust across incidence angles between 30 and 50 degrees, benefiting from rigorously simulating the three scattering mechanisms and successfully simulating the effect of vegetation and roughness.   The soil moisture estimates are accurate to unbiased rmse of 0.041, 0.059 and 0.060 m(3)/m(3) and correlation of 0.71, 0.83, and 0.69 for grass, wheat, and soybean fields, respectively over the soil moisture dynamic range up to 0.5 m(3)/m(3), and soybean\'s full growth cycle. Vegetation water content and surface roughness are retrieved simultaneously to the soil moisture solutions, thus constraining the inversion of soil moisture. The retrieval performance is fairly uniform across the incidence angle, partly because of the reliable forward modeling across the incidence angle and also thanks to the reliable retrieval strategy. The robustness against the incidence angle supports frequent global mapping.   The use of both HH and VV offers superior soil moisture retrievals than single-channel VV or HH input per-foms, by 0.034 m(3)/m(3) unbiased rmse for grass and by 0.01 m(3)/m(3) for wheat and soybean. The VV-based retrieval performed better than HH for grass and soybean, where surface scattering was important, but either choice resulted in similar retrieval accuracy for double-bounce dominanted wheat.

This is because of the unique reflectance spectral shapes of the BSC image slicks, where a sharp and monotonic increase in reflectance is found at wavelengths >550 nm and two inflection points are found around similar to 550 nm and similar to 650 nm. Such spectral characteristics differentiate BSC slicks from other floating matters. Based on this principle, a deep learning model is developed to extract BSC features from MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, 2002-2012) and OLCI (Ocean and Land Color Instrument, 2016 - present) satellite images to quantify BSC abundance, spatial distribution patterns, and their temporal changes in the Great Salt Lake (GSL), the world\'s largest contributor of BSC commercial products. A clear seasonality is found in BSC abundance, with the primary peak in April - May and secondary peak in October - November. The two peaks may be explained by food availability to brine shrimp. The inter-annual variability and the recent increasing trend in BSC abundance, on the other hand, are difficult to explain by fluctuations in wind, temperature, or salinity, while recent increase in commercial harvest does not appear to be associated with the variability in BSC abundance estimated by satellites. Because many salt lakes around the world, for example the Aral Sea, Lake Urmia, and the Dead Sea, also show BSC slicks in satellite imagery, this study suggests that it is possible to perform a systematic evaluation of BSC abundance and possibly brine shrimp populations in all major salt lakes, especially under a changing climate and increased human activities.', '[Qi, Lin; Yao, Yao; English, David E.; Hu, Chuanmin] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.

Fitting a model of the diurnal or annual LST cycle (DTC and ATC, respectively) to satellite data yields several parameters that summarize the thermal dynamics of each pixel. These parameters are distinct for each place and reveal how the ATC and DTC differ between pixels. Currently, due to the lack of LST with high spatial and temporal resolution, it is impossible to characterize both cycles at kilometer or sub-kilometer scale. This work addresses this problem and presents a method for simultaneously quantifying the annual and diurnal LST dynamics at kilometer scale. The proposed method is based on Annual Cycle Parameters (ACP) retrieved from geostationary satellite data for every 30 min between 00:00 and 23:30 local time and uses statistical downscaling to enhance their coarse spatial resolution. We apply our method to continental Europe for the period 2009-2013 and validate it using independent ACP retrieved from satellite and in-situ LST. Our results reveal how the climate and surface conditions influence the shape of the ACP diurnal profiles over Europe and illustrate for the first time the excellent agreement between satellite-derived ACP and ACP derived from in-situ LST.

For this reason, many global or regional land cover products are regularly released to the scientific community. Yet, the remote sensing community has not fully addressed the challenge to extract useful information from vast volumes of satellite data. Especially, major limitations concern the use of inadequate classification schemes and \"black box\" methods that may not match with end-users conceptualization of geographic features. In this paper, we introduce a knowledge-driven methodological approach to automatically process Sentinel-2 time series in order to produce pre-classifications that can be adapted by end-users to match their requirements. The approach relies on a conceptual framework inspired from ontologies of scientific observation and geographic information to describe the representation of geographic entities in remote sensing images. The implementation consists in a three-stage classification system including an initial stage, a dichotomous stage and a modular stage. At each stage, the system firstly relies on natural language semantic descriptions of time series of spectral signatures before assigning labels of land cover classes. The implementation was tested on 75 time series of Sentinel-2 images (i.e. 2069 images) in the Southern Brazilian Amazon to map natural vegetation and water bodies as required by a local end-user, i.e. a non-governmental organization. The results confirmed the potential of the method to accurately detect water bodies (F-score = 0.874 for bodies larger than 10 m) and map natural vegetation (max F-score = 0.875), yet emphasizing the spatial heterogeneity of accuracy results. In addition, it proved to be efficient to provide rapid estimates of degraded riparian forests at watershed level (R2 = 0.871). Finally, we discuss potential improvements both in the system\'s implementation, e.g. considering additional characteristics, and in the conceptual framework, e.g. moving from pixel- to object-based image analysis and evolving towards a hybrid system combining data- and knowledge-driven approaches.', '[Arvor, Damien; Daher, Felipe R.

The difference with respect to reported values for the US sites ranges from 1.4% to 26.7%, with a mean of 15.1%, although the estimated emission sum for all US sites is within 0.8% of the reported value, suggesting the errors are largely random.

The derived IOPs include the total (a(lambda)), phytoplankton (aphy(lambda)), and colored detrital matter (acdm(lambda)), absorption coefficients, and the total (bb(lambda)) and particulate (bbp(lambda)) backscattering coefficients. The first step uses an improved neural network approach to estimate the diffuse attenuation coefficient of downwelling irradiance from Rrs. a(lambda) and bbp(lambda) are then estimated using the LS2 model (Loisel et al., 2018), which does not require spectral assumptions on IOPs and hence can assess a (lambda) and bb(lambda) at any wavelength at which Rrs(lambda) is measured. Then, an inverse optimization algorithm is combined with an optical water class (OWC) approach to assess aphy(lambda) and acdm(lambda) from anw(lambda).The proposed model is evaluated using an in situ dataset collected in open oceanic, coastal, and inland waters. Comparisons with other standard semi-analytical algorithms (QAA and GSM), as well as match-up exercises, have also been performed. The applicability of the algorithm on OLCI observations was assessed through the analysis of global IOPs spatial patterns derived from 3SAA and GSM. The good performance of 3SAA is manifested by median absolute percentage differences (MAPD) of 13%, 23%, 34% and 34% for bbp(443), anw(443), aphy(443) and acdm(443), respectively for oceanic waters. Due to the absence of spectral constraints on IOPs in the inversion of total IOPs, and the adoption of an OWC-based approach, the performance of 3SAA is only slightly degraded in bio-optical complex inland waters.', '[Jorge, Daniel S.

Accurate mapping and monitoring of subtle change are crucial for an early warning of long-term gradual change that may eventually result in land cover conversion. Freely accessible moderate-resolution datasets such as the Landsat archive have great potential to characterize subtle change by capturing low-magnitude spectral changes in long-term observations. However, past studies have reported limited success in accurately extracting subtle changes from satellite-based time series analysis. In this study, we introduce a supervised framework named \'PIDS\' to detect subtle forest disturbance from a comprehensive Landsat data archive by leveraging disturbance-based calibration sites. PIDS consists of four components: (1) Parameter optimization; (2) Index selection; (3) Dynamic stratified monitoring; and (4) Spatial consideration. PIDS was applied to map the early stage of bark beetle infestations (i.e., a lower per-pixel fraction of trees cover that show visual signs of infestation), which are a typical example of subtle change in conifer forests. Landsat Analysis Ready Data were used as the time series inputs for mapping mountain pine beetle and spruce beetle disturbance between 2001 and 2019 in Colorado, USA. PIDS-detection map assessment showed that the overall performance of PIDS (namely \'F1 score\') was 0.86 for mountain pine beetle and 0.73 for spruce beetle, making a substantial improvement (> 0.3) compared to other approaches/products including COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance, LandTrendr, and the National Land Cover Database forest disturbance product. A sub-pixel analysis of tree canopy mortality percentage was performed by linking classified high-resolution (0.3- and 1-m) aerial imagery and 30-m PIDSdetection maps. Results show that PIDS typically detects mountain pine beetle infestation when >56% of a Landsat pixel is occupied by red-stage canopy mortality (one year after initial infestation), and spruce beetle infestation when >55% is occupied by gray-stage mortality (two years after initial infestation). This study addresses an important methodological goal pertinent to the utility of event-based reference samples for detecting subtle forest change, which could be potentially applied to other types of subtle land change.', '[Ye, Su; Rogan, John; Kulakowski, Dominik] Clark Univ, Grad Sch Geog, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.

Cost-effective means of locating both anthropogenic and natural sources of methane and other gases are needed in order to improve understanding of greenhouse gas budgets and facilitate mitigation. One approach uses imaging spectrometers operating on remote sensing platforms, such as aircraft or satellites, to locate specific types of plumes. This paper develops spectral algorithms for the detection of any absorptive gas, for example, methane in the shortwave infrared region. The presence of a target gas is inferred from its known absorptivity spectrum along with local background statistics gathered by the sensor. The problem of distinguishing the target signal from clutter is usually solved by modeling the spectral background with some member of the class of elliptical distributions, most commonly a multivariate Gaussian. That class of models is replaced here by the lognormal distribution. A logarithmic transformation then recasts the associated hypothesis test into a standard form, allowing derivation of a uniformly most powerful solution. It is theoretically optimal simultaneously for all gas concentrations. This leads further to new algorithms for the detection and quantification of gas mixtures.', '[Schaum, Alan] US Naval Res Lab, Washington, DC 20375 USA.', 'United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Research   LaboratoryRP Schaum, A (通讯作者)，US Naval Res Lab, Washington, DC 20375 USA.', 'schaum@nrl.navy.mil', NULL, 'US Office of Naval Research', 'This work was supported by the US Office of Naval Research.', 57, 6, 7, 3, 18, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Most spectroscopy studies rely on extensive field campaigns to assess classification accuracies against ground-truth samples. Their findings are correlative and not based on first principles and by design they often do not provide for an end-to-end traceability of error budgets. In this study, we present a simulation approach for modeling canopy-level reflectance using three-dimensional plant models arranged on a synthetic landscape. This type of simulation offers an important avenue for understanding the interplay between instrument parameters and landscape characteristics for different ecosystems. The simulation approach was applied using species-level leaf reflectance data from the biodiversity hotspot in the Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) of South Africa. We simulated 140 random realizations, each of 20x20m in size, encompassing 10 to 70 species to understand how changing the diversity and image resolution (pixel size) affected spectral mixing and the ability to discern species within the plot. Overall, across all resolutions and species mixtures, the mean classification accuracy was 0.690?0.184 (mean F1-score?standard deviation across realizations), however, this varied widely from 0.812?0.057 at a pixel size of 60 cm for landscapes with 30 species to 0.196?0.106 for landscapes with 70 species and a pixel size of 240 cm. As expected, classification accuracy decreased with increasing spatial grain from 0.763?0.064 at 15 cm resolution to only 0.414?0.214 at 240 cm. Classification accuracies across different levels of species richness remained fairly constant except in the coarsest grain size (240 cm). This suggests an increasing challenge in species identification as grain sizes become coarser than the constituent organisms. In summary, this approach can facilitate detailed simulation of reflectance while exploring various ecological scenarios such as changing species composition or the impacts of environmental variability such as drought.', '[van Leeuwen, Martin; Wilson, Adam Michael] Univ Buffalo, Dept Geog, 120 Wilkeson Quadrangle, Buffalo, NY 14261 USA.

This paper presents a spatio-temporal Cokriging (ST-Cokriging) method for assimilating remote sensing data sets acquired by multiple remote sensing systems with different temporal sampling frequencies and different spatial resolutions. By extending the traditional Cokriging technique from a sole spatial domain to a spatio-temporal domain, we derived and implemented ST-Cokriging algorithm that explicitly takes the spatial covariance, temporal covariance and spatio-temporal covariance structures within and between different data sets into account. Compared with previous downscaling methods, such as, STARFM and FSDAF, our ST-Cokriging method produces more accurate and reliable assimilation results for the heterogeneous region, with associated uncertainty estimates. This method has been implemented into a software package using Python language within ArcGIS environment. The advantages and effectiveness of our ST-Cokriging method have been demonstrated through an application example, in which MODIS images (daily, 250 m and 500 m spatial resolution) and Landsat TM/ETM+ images (16 days revisit cycle, 30 m) are assimilated to generate daily spectral bands and NDVI images at 30 m spatial resolution. Our validation and accuracy assessments indicate that our ST-Cokriging method can effectively fill in data gaps due to clouds and generate reliable assimilation results and uncertainty estimates at both high spatial resolution and high temporal frequency', '[Yang, Bo; Beck, Richard A.; Hinkel, Kenneth M.] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Geog & Geog Informat Sci, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA.

The 3D deformation field reveals that foremost is the role of the vertical velocity V-U, with peaks of -38.7 cm/year in Nezahualcoyotl, -32.0 cm/year in Gustavo A. Madero and Venustiano Carranza, and -39.1 cm/year in Iztapalapa. Settlement at the metropolitan Cathedral in Cuauhte \' moc is ongoing at up to -8.8 cm/year, consistently with the last six decades. Volcanic edifices mark ground stability \"islets\" inside the main subsidence bowls. East-west rates are limited, except for some horizontal strain (up to +/- 5 cm/year) within the subsidence bowls. Comparison with surface geology and geotechnical zoning confirms that aquitard compaction is the predominant process. The power relationship between V-U [cm/year] and the thickness of lacustrine clay deposits H-C [m] is: V-U = 1/76*H-C(1.8). The 2019-2020 deformation scenario shows that subsidence still involves most of Nezahualcoyotl, with -3.0 cm/month VU. A well-defined long-term deformation behaviour comes out from 2014-2019 InSAR time series and comparison with 2008-2020 GPS data. RMSE of 0.9 cm is found at MMX1 station deployed within the lacustrine unit, and 0.6 cm at TNGF station onto hard volcanic rocks.

Faults and cracks develop where beta > 1/3000, i.e. 0.03%, in 2017-2019. The observed width of the influence zone (i.e. damage band), where beta is still significant to induce damage, is 250 m. Differential settlement and surface faulting could compromise the serviceability of housing and utility infrastructure. It is estimated that over 457,000 properties and 1.5 million inhabitants of the Valley of Mexico Metropolitan Area (ZMVM) are in zones at high to very high surface faulting risk, mainly in Iztapalapa, Tlahuac, Chimalhuacan and Chalco.

Pre-monsoon enhancement (March - -May) in aerosol loading over the Indian region is significantly contributed (similar to 56%) by the transported mineral dust at free tropospheric altitudes. Though, shortwave radiative effect due to dust in the atmosphere increases about three times from winter to pre-monsoon, at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) it causes cooling. Dust induced cooling reverses the positive radiative effect induced by non-dust aerosols at TOA over Indo-Gangetic Plains. Though the natural dust dominates the aerosol loading during pre-monsoon, anthropogenic dust contributes significantly (similar to 65%) to the total dust loading during winter. Over Indo-Gangetic Plains, high aerosol warming (up to similar to 2 Kday(-1)) observed within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) is mainly caused by carbonaceous aerosols (85%).

In this study the method is applied to daily altimetric fields of absolute dynamic topography and geostrophic velocities. LACCE compares favourably with previous algorithms used to track the position of the Agulhas Current. The ability of the LACCE to correctly identify the core and edges of the Agulhas Current is also established through comparisons with along-track altimetry datasets and in situ observations of current speed and direction across both the Agulhas Current and the Agulhas Return Current. Our results show that LACCE can successfully be applied to a merged altimetry dataset to monitor changes in the Agulhas Current\'s position caused by mesoscale processes such as early retroflection events or transient features like Natal Pulses. To demonstrate the use of the LACCE, the Agulhas Current position outputs from the algorithm computed over a 26-year period (1993 to 2018) are then used to describe the spatial and temporal variability of the Retroflection. Our results show that the Agulhas Retroflection generally occurs in the region from 15.01-20.03 degrees E and 40.47-38.44 degrees S. The retroflection exhibits a trimodal distribution, indicating three preferential longitudes (15, 18 and 19.5 degrees E). Despite not being statistically significant, the results suggest some seasonal variation in the modal position of the Retroflection, with it frequenting western longitudes more during the austral summer, in agreement with previous studies. Early retroflections were found to occur more often during the austral spring and summer, with few taking place in winter and almost none in autumn.

Finally, we use synthesis of the UAV datasets with ground-based LiDAR surveys and lab characterization of soils to estimate that the burned rangeland potentially lost 1474 kg/ha of C and 113 kg/ha of N owing to soil erosion processes during the first year after a prescribed fire. However, during the second-year post-fire, grass and plant-interspace SFMT functioned as net sinks for sediment and nutrients and gained approximately 175 kg/ha C and 14 kg/ha N, combined. These results provide important site-specific insight that is relevant to the 423 Mha of grasslands and shrublands that are burned globally each year. While fire, and specifically post-fire erosion, can degrade some rangelands, post-fire plant-soil-nutrient dynamics might provide a competitive advantage to grasses in rangelands degraded by shrub encroachment. These novel UAV and ground-based LiDAR remote sensing approaches thus provide important details towards more accurate accounting of the carbon and nutrients in the soil surface of rangelands.', '[Sankey, Joel B.; Caster, Joshua; Kasprak, Alan] US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, Grand Canyon Monitoring & Res Ctr, Flagstaff, AZ 86004 USA.

The algorithm has been implemented in a prototype processor for European Space Agency\'s (ESA\'s) 7th Earth Explorer Mission BIOMASS, scheduled for launch in 2023. CASINO employs an interferometric ground cancellation technique to estimate canopy backscatter (CB) intensity. A power law model (PLM) is then used to model the dependence of CB on AGB for a large number of systematically distributed SAR data samples and a small number of calibration areas with a known AGB. The PLM parameters and AGB for the samples are estimated simultaneously within pre-defined intervals using nonlinear minimisation of a cost function. The performance of CASINO is assessed over six tropical forest sites on two continents: two in French Guiana, South America and four in Gabon, Africa, using SAR data acquired during airborne ESA campaigns and processed to simulate BIOMASS acquisitions. Multiple tests with only two randomly selected calibration areas with AGB > 100 t/ha are conducted to assess AGB estimation performance given limited reference data. At 2.25 ha scale and using a single flight heading, the root-mean-square difference (RMSD) is <= 27% for at least 50% of all tests in each test site and using as reference AGB maps derived from airborne laser scanning data. An improvement is observed when two flight headings are used in combination. The most consistent AGB estimation (lowest RMSD variation across different calibration sets) is observed for test sites with a large AGB interval and average AGB around 200-250 t/ha. The most challenging conditions are in areas with AGB < 200 t/ha and large topographic variations. A comparison with 142 1 ha plots distributed across all six test sites and with AGB estimated from in situ measurements gives an RMSD of 20% (66 t/ha).', '[Soja, Maciej J.] MJ Soja Consulting, Hobart, Tas, Australia.

These methods, however, have been challenging to apply in highly heterogeneous areas, especially in complex agricultural landscapes where there are rapid changes at small scales, while features at larger scales change more slowly. In this study, we developed a novel method to reconstruct daily 30 m Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Landsat and Landsat-like platforms, and the Cropland Data Layer (CDL). This method utilizes a crop reference curve (CRC) approach, in which a set of NDVI time series are extracted from pure MODIS pixels (250 m resolution) identified using the CDL, and then used to fit Landsat-like observations (30 m). The CRC based method was applied over a complex agricultural landscape in the Choptank River watershed on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Landsat data from 2013 and 2014 and Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data from 2018 were used to reconstruct 30 m daily NDVI maps for major crop types. Results show that the relative error (RE) in reconstructed NDVI is around 6-8% during periods of rapid crop growth, and 3-5% during peak periods when growth is slow. The accuracy of the CRC method outperforms a standard image pair-based data fusion algorithm (Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model; STARFM), which yields RE of 4-9% in slow-growth periods and 10-16% in fast-growth periods when clear Landsat images are scarce. The CRC method was also compared with time-series data fusion methods, including a harmonic fitting model and the SaTellite dAta IntegRation (STAIR) model. The results show that CRC gives similar results when the Landsat-like image availability is high (around 27 images per year), but outperforms other methods when availability is limited (less than 15 images per year). The reconstructed NDVI time series for corn, soybean, winter wheat/soybean and forest at 30-m resolution show clear phenological patterns at the sub-field scale. The resulting 30-m NDVI timeseries data provide useful information for mapping crop phenology and monitoring crop condition in complex agricultural landscapes, especially for complex double-cropping areas. However, the input requirement of an accurate 30-m crop classification map constrains its application to areas and periods where classifications are available.', '[Sun, Liang; Chen, Ruiqing; Chen, Zhongxin] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Key Lab Agr Remote Sensing, Minist Agr, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.

We used 281,962 Landsat scenes for producing median cloud-free composites at each time-step. We established a pseudo ground truth dataset and used a PCA-based outlier detection method to reduce its uncertainty. A random forest model was trained at each time-step for classifying raw data into six land-cover classes: Cropland, Forest, Grassland, Built-up, Water, and Other areas, using 49 predictor datasets and nearly 20,000 training points. We further constructed uncertainty maps at each time-step as a proxy of per-pixel confidence. The average overall accuracy of the seven 30 m-resolution land-cover maps was-93%. Built-up and Water areas displayed the highest user and producer accuracies (>93%), with Grasslands and Other areas slightly lower (similar to 82-88%). Classification uncertainty was lower in more homogeneous landscapes (i.e., large expanses of a single land-cover class).

Because thinning is not a land use transition, and the disturbance signal is relatively subtle compared to a clear cut, there is a dearth of studies that attempt to detect thinning over large areas. Our goal was to detect pine thins as an indicator of active forest management using Landsat data. Areas which undergo thinning are indicative of active forest management in the region.   Our approach uses a machine learning method which combines first-order harmonics and metrics from 3-year Fourier regression of Landsat time series stacks, layers from the Global Forest Change product, and other vetted national products into a random forests model to classify forest thins in the southeastern US. Forest Harvest Inspection Records for Virginia were used for training and validation. Models were successful separating thins from clear cuts and non-harvested pines (overall accuracy 86%, clear cut accuracy 90%, thin accuracy 83% for a simplified 10-predictor variable model).   Examination of variable importance illustrates the physical meaning behind the models. The curve fit statistics (R-2 or RMSE) of the NDVI, Pan, and SWIR1 harmonic curve fits, which are an indication of a departure from typical vegetation phenology caused by thinning or other disturbances, were consistently among the top predictors. The harmonic regression constant, sine and cosine from the Landsat 8 panchromatic band were also important. These describe the visible reflectance (500-680 nm) phenology over the time period at a high spatial resolution (15 m). The Loss Year from the Global Forest Change product, which is an indication of stand replacing disturbance, was also consistently among the most important variables in the classifiers.   High performance computing, such as Google Earth Engine, and analysis-ready data are important for this approach. This work has importance for quantification of actively managed forests in a region of the world where production forestry is the dominant land disturbance signal and a significant economic engine.', '[Thomas, V.

This text describes the development, performance and limitations of an automated procedure to map breaking river ice by means of C-band, HH-polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. An original two-step supervised classification model (IceBC), which uses backscatter intensities, lies at the core of the procedure. First, IceBC identifies three primary classes: water, sheet ice and rubble ice. Next, each primary ice class is divided in three secondary classes that denote top surface roughness scale differences. Input images must have incidence angles from similar to 27 degrees to similar to 60 degrees. Below similar to 36 degrees, IceBC may assign a class labelled \"unclassified\" to water or sheet ice pixels. The primary classification model yields overall accuracies of similar to 86% and similar to 93% for independent test pixels with incidence angles <= similar to 49 degrees and >= similar to 29 degrees or >= similar to 36 degrees, respectively. The associated class accuracies for water, sheet ice and rubble ice are similar to 97% & 96%, similar to 69% & 85% and similar to 97% & 99%. Given its connection to ice jam flood events, the classification accuracy achieved for rubble ice is particularly important. Maps produced by means of IceBC comprise detailed spatial information regarding ice cover conditions and the development of the breakup process. Their quality may be affected by: freezing conditions, wet snow cover, meltwater pools, infrastructure, rapids or high winds. Monitoring is the key to managing the impacts of most of these challenges. An IceBC prototype has been used operationally since 2015.', '[van der Sanden, J.

The remote sensing of vegetation is now undergoing a paradigm shift from monitoring structural parameters to monitoring functional traits. In particular, recent advances in hyperspectral techniques of remote sensing provide an opportunity to map vegetation traits and functions over a range of scales. In this editorial, we first present the background of the recent advances in the remote sensing of vegetation traits and functions and solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) of chlorophyll. We then summarize eight of the papers in this special issue that focus on new remote-sensing techniques and algorithms developed for retrieving plant functional traits, such as pigment and nitrogen contents and functional parameters. These contributions cover two major scientific themes: (1) estimating and monitoring plant traits and functions and (2) interpreting and understanding remotely sensed SIF signals.

In order to properly interpret the fluorescence signal in relation to photosynthetic activity, essential vegetation variables need to be retrieved concomitantly. FLEX will fly in tandem with Sentinel-3 (S3), which conveys the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) that is designed to characterize the atmosphere and the terrestrial vegetation at a spatial resolution of 300 m. In this work we present the retrieval models of four essential biophysical variables: (1) Leaf Area Index (LAI), (2) leaf chlorophyll content (Cab), (3) fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), and (4) fractional vegetation cover (FCover). These variables can be operationally inferred by hybrid retrieval approaches, which combine the generalization capabilities offered by radiative transfer models (RTMs) with the flexibility and computational efficiency of machine learning methods. The RTM SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes) was used to generate a database of reflectance spectra corresponding to a large variety of canopy realizations, which served subsequently as input to train a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) algorithm for each targeted variable. Three sets of GPR models were developed, based on different spectral band settings: (1) OLCI (21 bands between 400 and 1040 nm), (2) FLORIS (281 bands between 500 and 780 nm), and (3) their synergy. Their respective performances were assessed based on simulated reflectance scenes. Regarding the retrieval of Cab, the OLCI model gave good model performances (R-2: 0.91; RMSE: 7.6 mu g. cm(-2)), yet superior accuracies were achieved as a result of FLORIS\' higher spectral resolution (R-2: 0.96; RMSE: 4.8 mu g. cm(-2)). The synergy of both datasets did not further enhance the variable retrieval. Regarding LAI, the improvement of the model performances by using only FLORIS spectra (R-2: 0.87; RMSE: 1.05 m(2).m(-2)) rather than only OLCI spectra (R-2: 0.86; RMSE: 1.12 m(2).m(-2)) was less evident but merging both data sets was more beneficial (R-2: 0.88; RMSE: 1.01 m(2).m(-2)). Finally, the three data sources gave good model performances for the retrieval of fAPAR and Fcover, with the best performing model being the Synergy model (fAPAR: R-2: 0.99; RMSE: 0.02 and FCover: R-2: 0.98; RMSE: 0.04). The ability of the models to process real data was subsequently demonstrated by applying the OLCI models to S3 surface reflectance products acquired over Western Europe and Argentina. Obtained maps showed consistent patterns and variable ranges, and comparison against corresponding Sentinel-2 products (coarsened to a 300 m spatial resolution) led to reasonable matches (R-2: 0.5-0.7). Altogether, given the availability of the multiple data sources, the FLEX tandem mission will foster unique opportunities to quantify essential vegetation properties, and hence facilitate the interpretation of the measured fluorescence levels.', '[De Grave, Charlotte; Verrelst, Jochem; Morcillo-Pallares, Pablo; Pipia, Luca; Amin, Eatidal; Belda, Santiago; Moreno, Jose] Univ Valencia, Image Proc Lab IPL, Parc Cient, Valencia 46980, Spain.

The two main features of the method are (1) the use of a diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) model to describe component temperatures and (2) the application of a spatial weighting matrix to consider the spatial correlation of component temperatures. The proposed method was evaluated using an extensive simulated dataset with five component temperature types, three LST errors and 69 fractional vegetation cover (FVC) types, and field measurements with a high temporal frequency. Due to the time extendibility of DTC model, the possibility for retrieving component temperatures at any time was analyzed. Correspondingly, the schemes for selecting the best observations for four representative periods, i.e., 10:00-12:00, 09:00-18:00, 18:00-03:00 (on the next day) and 09:00-03:00, were determined. The validations showed satisfactory accuracies, and it was found that the errors were significantly influenced by the original LST retrieval error. In addition, the difference between the ideal temperature pattern from the DTC model and the actual temperature variation also affected the accuracy of the temporally extended component temperatures. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses indicated that the separation accuracy was independent of the uncertainty of the component emissivity but was influenced by FVC. Specifically, the retrieval accuracy was sensitive to the size and variation of FVC, and the latter had a more significant influence, but the result was less sensitive to the retrieval error and angular effect of FVC. Considering its accuracy, operability and robustness, the proposed method is effective for separating soil and vegetation component temperatures.', '[Liu, Xiangyang; Tang, Bo-Hui; Li, Zhao-Liang; Zhou, Chenghu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

Whilst existing reference datasets have proven a valuable resource, they incorporate little data with which products from recent EO instruments can be assessed. A reliance on individual field campaigns has also led to several inconsistencies, whilst limiting the extent to which temporal variations in EO product performance can be captured. Recently established environmental monitoring networks such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), which collect routine in situ measurements using standardised instruments and protocols, provide a promising opportunity in this respect. The Copernicus Ground Based Observations for Validation (GBOV) service was initiated in recognition of this fact. In the first component of the project, raw observations from existing networks have been collected and processed to provide reference data for a range of EO land products. In this study, we focus on leaf area index (LAI) and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR). Raw digital hemispherical photography (DHP) from twenty NEON sites was processed to derive in situ reference measurements, which were then upscaled to provide high spatial resolution reference maps. Using these data, we assess the recently released Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) 300 m Version 1 (V1) products derived from PROBA-V, in addition to existing products derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). When evaluated against reference data, the CGLS 300 m V1 product demonstrated the best agreement (RMSD = 0.57 for LAI and 0.08 for FAPAR), followed by the Collection 6 VNP15A2H and MOD15A2H products (RMSD = 0.81 to 0.89 for LAI and 0.12 for FAPAR). Differing assumptions of the products and in situ reference measurements, which cause them to be sensitive to slightly different quantities, are thought to explain apparent biases over sparse vegetation and forest environments. To ensure their continued utility, future work should focus on updating the GBOV in situ reference measurements, implementing additional corrections, and improving their geographical representativeness.', '[Brown, Luke A.; Morris, Harry; Pastor-Guzman, Julio; Dash, Jadunandan] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.

However, the spectral data of hundreds of bands brings about problems such as dimensional explosion, which poses a huge challenge for hyperspectral remote sensing classification based on classical parameters models. Deep learning methods have been used for remotely sensed images classification in recent years, but the popular HSI datasets including Kennedy Space Center, Indian Pines, Pavia University scene and Salinas scene, have low spatial resolution, significant differences between categories, and regular boundaries. When applied to the classification of forestry tree species, the accuracy often decreases because the spectral response of different plants of the same family and genus are very similar, especially under the fragmented species distribution, complex topography and the occluded canopy. So we collect new data sets, selected Gaofeng State Owned Forest Farm in Guangxi province in south China as the research area and adopted the airborne hyperspectral data obtained by the LiCHy system of the Chinese Academy of Forestry to explore an improved three-dimensional convolutional neural network(3D-CNN) model for tree species classification. The proposed model uses raw data as input without dimension reduction or feature screening, and simultaneously extracts spectral and spatial features. After the 3D convolutional layer, the captured high-level semantic concept is a joint spatial spectral feature representation, so we can turn it into a one-dimensional feature as a new input to learn a more abstract level of expression. The widely used earlystop method is also used to prevent overfitting. The proposed model is a lightweight, generalized, and fast convergence classification model, by which the short-time and large-area of multiple tree species classification with high-precision can be realized. The result shows that the 3D-1D CNN model can shorten the training time of the 3D CNN model by 60% and achieve a classification accuracy of 93.14% within 50 ha in 6.37 min, which provides a basis for the classification of tree species, the mapping of forest form and the inventory of forest resources.', '[Zhang, Bin; Zhao, Lin; Zhang, Xiaoli] Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Silviculture & Conservat, Minist Educ, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.

However, the adjacency effect is usually neglected in the thermal infrared (TIR) region. The conventional TIR radiative transfer equation (RTE) only takes into account radiance from target pixel and neglects radiance contribution from surrounding background pixels. In this study, two TIR RTEs taking into account the adjacency effect for uniform and non-uniform Lambertian surfaces were deduced based on the radiative transfer theory. In terms of the TIR RTEs, we analyze the dominating influence factors of the adjacency effect and quantify the magnitude of the adjacency effect in the TIR region using simulation and actual satellite data. Two different definitions of the adjacency effect are presented in this study: (1) the effect due to radiance from background pixels scattered into sensor\'s instantaneous field of view, and (2) the effect due to apparent thermal contrast between target and background pixels. The results show that atmospheric visibility, water vapor content, sensor spectral band, and background pixel land surface temperature (LST) have significant influence on the adjacency effect. For a specific simulation scene, the magnitude of the first definition of the adjacency effect is larger than 0.5 K when atmospheric visibility is lower than 23 km. This magnitude is as much as 2 K under haze weather conditions with atmospheric visibility of 5 km. The results indicate that the adjacency effect should be taken into account in the radiative transfer simulation. The magnitude of the second definition of the adjacency effect is less than 0.3 K, even at atmospheric visibility of 5 km. The results reveal that the accuracy of the TIR RTE for a uniform Lambertian surface is enough for the development of LST retrieval algorithm under relatively haze weather conditions. In situ LST measurements collected at the Hailar, Urad Front Banner, and Wuhai sites in China were used to validate the accuracies of the LST retrieved by the RTE-based single channel algorithm with/without adjacency effect correction. There are nearly no discrepancies between the LST retrieved with/without adjacency effect correction when aerosol optical depth (AOD) is low than 0.3. However, the RMSE of the differences between the retrieved LST and the in situ LST decreases from approximately 1.4 K for the LST retrieved without adjacency effect correction to approximately 0.6 K for the LST retrieved with adjacency effect correction when AOD is high than 0.3.', '[Duan, Si-Bo; Li, Zhao-Liang; Leng, Pei; Gao, Maofang] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Key Lab Agr Remote Sensing, Minist Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.

To fill this knowledge gap, we generated a 30 m resolution bathymetry dataset for 347 global reservoirs, representing a total volume of 3123 km(3) (50% of the global reservoir capacity). First, Area-Elevation (A-E) relationships for the identified reservoirs were derived by combining altimetry data from multiple satellites with Landsat imagery data. Next, the resulting A-E relationships were applied to the Surface Water Occurrence (SWO) data from the JRC Global Surface Water (GSW) dataset to obtain bathymetry values for the dynamic areas of the reservoirs. Lastly, an extrapolation method was adopted to help achieve the full bathymetry dataset. The remotely sensed bathymetry results were primarily validated against the following: (1) They were validated against Area-Elevation (A-E) and Elevation-Volume (E-V) relationships derived from the in situ elevations and volumes for 16 reservoirs, with root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of elevation from 0.06 m to 1.99 m, and normalized RMSE values of storage from 0.56% to 4.40%. (2) They were also validated against survey bathymetric maps for four reservoirs, with R-2 values from 0.82 to 0.99 and RMSE values from 0.13 m to 2.31 m. The projected portions have relatively large errors and uncertainties (compared to the remotely sensed portions) because the extrapolated elevations cannot fully capture the underwater topography. Overall, this approach performs better for reservoirs with a large dynamic area fractions. It can also be applied to small reservoirs (e.g., reservoirs with surface areas of a few square kilometers or less), where ICESat observations are available, and to large natural lakes. With the contribution of ICESat-2, this dataset has the potential to be expanded to thousands of reservoirs and lakes in the future.', '[Li, Yao; Gao, Huilin; Zhao, Gang] Texas A&M Univ, Zachry Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.

Megacities in particular are facing severe problems due to excessive population growth, urban area expansion, human activity, increased energy consumption, and increased anthropogenic heat. In this study, a physical modeling approach based on a triple-source surface energy balance (triple-SEB) model was developed to uncover the effect of AHF on land surface temperature (LST) and surface anthropogenic heat island (SAHI) intensity. For this purpose, satellite imagery along with climatic and meteorological data from 1985 to 2019 were studied for six selected megacities: Los Angeles, Atlanta, Athens, Istanbul, Tehran, and Beijing. First, LST and the fraction of different surface covers were calculated by using a single-channel algorithm and a normalized spectral mixture analysis model, respectively. In the second step, impervious surface cover (ISC) and the urban main boundary area (UMBA) of each city were extracted based on the biophysical composite index and city clustering algorithm, respectively. In the third step, anthropogenic LST (ALST) was modeled using a triple-SEB model. In the fourth step, the ALST and UMBA were used together to model SAHI intensity at different dates. Finally, the relationship between the estimated ALST and ISC, as well as between SAHI and ISC, was examined. Results show that the average value of estimated ALST for the megacities increased from 2.02, 0.55, 0.61, 0.64, 0.58, and 0.72 to 2.99, 1.73, 1.66, 1.19, 2.32, and 2.76 degrees C, respectively. The coefficient of determination between the mean value of ISC and the estimated ALST for all megacities yielded 0.8, which was higher than that between ISC and satellite-derived LST. Moreover, the SAHI intensity for these megacities was found to have increased to 0.73, 0.92, 0.95, 0.98, 0.95 and 1.32 degrees C, respectively, which can be predicted by ISC with a coefficient of determination of 0.78, 0.79, 0.79, 0.73, 0.71 and 0.52, respectively. This suggests that the triple-SEB model proposed by this study allowed for independent modeling of AHF\'s influence on SUHI and a better determination of the effect of ISC on LST and SUHI intensity. This approach facilitated comparative analysis of LST and SAHI for a city at different times as well as SAHIs in different cities with different geographic and climate settings.', '[Firozjaei, Mohammad Karimi; Kiavarz, Majid; Alavipanah, Seyed Kazem] Univ Tehran, Fac Geog, Dept Remote Sensing, Tehran, Iran.

The model is very accurate for the seasonal accumulated amounts (R similar to 0.95 and RMSE similar to 44 mm). However, lower agreements with observed irrigations are obtained at the daily scale. To assess the performance of the irrigation retrieval method over a range of time periods, the daily predicted and observed irrigations are cumulated from 1 to 90 days. Generally, acceptable errors (R = 0.52 and RMSE = 27 mm) are obtained for irrigations cumulated over 15 days and the performance gradually improves by increasing the accumulation period, depicting a strong link to the frequency of Landsat overpasses (16 days or 8 days by combining Landsat-7 and -8). Despite the uncertainties in retrieved irrigations at daily to weekly scales, the daily RZSM and evapotranspiration simulated from the retrieved daily irrigations are estimated accurately and are very close to those estimated from actual irrigations. This research demonstrates the utility of high spatial resolution optical and thermal data for estimating irrigation and consequently for better closing the water budget over agricultural areas. We also show that significant improvements can be expected at daily to weekly time scales by reducing the revisit time of high-spatial resolution thermal data, as included in the TRISHNA future mission requirements.', '[Olivera-Guerra, Luis; Merlin, Olivier] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Ctr Etud Spatiales Biosphere CESBIO, CNES,IRD,UPS, Toulouse, France.

We find evidences of TEC and f(o)F2 anomalies in the analysis of nearby IGS permanent stations within seismogenic zone on main shock day, when geomagnetic activities remain quiet. In addition, atmospheric composite indices manifest anomalies attributed to the EQ on the same day as TEC and f(o)F2 perturbations. Similarly, differential ionosphere and atmosphere values indicate that EQ abnormalities are significant on main shock day during UT = 10-12.

The conventional pulse-limited radar altimeters have a relatively large ground footprint, which limits their capability to retrieve surface elevation information over small and medium-sized water bodies. A new generation of satellite radar altimeter system, a dual-frequency SAR radar altimeter (SRAL) onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite, has produced densely sampled elevation measurements with a smaller footprint for the Earth\'s surfaces since June 2016, owing to the Delay-Doppler processing technique. Four standard SRAL SAR altimetry waveform retracking algorithms (known as retrackers) have been designed to retrieve elevation measurements for different types of surfaces: Ice-Sheet retracker for polar ice sheets, SAMOSA-3 retracker for open ocean and coastal zones, OCOG retracker for sea-ice margins, and Sea-Ice retracker for sea ice. In this research, we evaluated the performances of the Sentinel-3 SRAL SAR altimetry retrackers over lakes, particularly over seasonally ice-covered lakes in one hydrological cycle. For 15 lakes and reservoirs with different sizes and at varying latitudes in the northern hemisphere, we compared the lake water levels estimated by each of standard SRAL SAR retrackers against in-situ water level measurements for different seasons (a full hydrologic cycle) during 2016-2017. Our evaluation shows that Sea-Ice retracker was unable to provide continuous estimates of lake water levels, as a result of the high rate of missing data. Although the precision and relative accuracy of lake water level estimates from these three standard SRAL SAR retrackers are similar, the SAMOSA-3 retracker has the least bias in comparison with ground-based gauge measurements. When the lakes in the mid- and high-latitude regions were covered by ice in the winter season, these three standard SAR retrackers generated erroneous lake water level measurements, significantly lower than the true lake water levels recorded by in-situ gauge stations. The measurement errors of these three standard retrackers increase with the growth of the lake ice thickness. To address the negative effect of the seasonal ice cover, we developed a new bimodal correction algorithm. We demonstrate that our bimodal correction algorithm can retrieve the ice thickness and reliably estimate water levels for the ice-covered lakes in winter, hence enabling the generation of temporally consistent lake water level measurements throughout all seasons for lake hydrological analysis.', '[Shu, Song] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, Boone, NC 28608 USA.

However, limited attention has been devoted to distinguishing between actively cropped fields and fallowed fields within agricultural lands, and in particular so in grass fallow systems of semi-arid areas. In the Sahel, one of the largest dryland regions worldwide, crop-fallow rotation practices are widely used for soil fertility regeneration. Yet, little is known about the extent of fallow fields since fallow is not explicitly differentiated within the cropland class in any existing remote sensing-based land use/cover maps, regardless of the spatial scale. With a 10 m spatial resolution and a 5-day revisit frequency, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery made it possible to disentangle agricultural land into cropped and fallow fields, facilitated by Google Earth Engine (GEE) for big data handling. Here we produce the first Sahelian fallow field map at a 10 m resolution for the baseline year 2017, accomplished by designing a remote sensing driven protocol for generating reference data for mapping over large areas. Based on the 2015 Copernicus Dynamic Land Cover map at 100 m resolution, the extent of fallow fields in the cropland class is estimated to be 63% (403,617 km(2)) for the Sahel in 2017. Similar results are obtained for five contemporary cropland products, with fallow fields occupying 57-62% of the cropland area. Yet, it is noted that the total estimated area coverage depends on the quality of the different cropland products. The share of cropped fields within the Copernicus cropland area is found to be higher in the arid regions (200-300 mm rainfall) as compared to the semi-arid regions (300-600 mm rainfall). The woody cover fraction within cropped and fallow fields is found to have a reversed pattern between arid (higher woody cover in cropped fields) and semi-arid (higher woody cover in fallow fields) regions. The method developed, using cloud-based Earth Observation (EO) data and computation on the GEE platform, is expected to be reproducible for mapping the extent of fallow fields across global croplands. Future applications based on multi-year time series is expected to improve our understanding of crop-fallow rotation dynamics in grass fallow systems being key in teasing apart how cropland intensification and expansion affect environmental variables, such as soil fertility, crop yields and local livelihoods in low-income regions such as the Sahel.', '[Tong, Xiaoye; Brandt, Martin; Rasmussen, Laura Yang; Rasmussen, Kjeld; Tagesson, Torbern; Fensholt, Rasmus] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management IGN, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark.

Since the advent of Earth observation by satellites, various models have been developed to use thermal and shortwave remote sensing data for ET estimation. In this review, we provide a brief account of the key milestones in the history of remote sensing ET model development in two categories: temperature-based and conductance-based models. Temperature-based ET models utilize land surface temperature (LST) observed through thermal remote sensing to calculate the sensible heat flux from which ET is estimated as a residual of the surface energy balance or to estimate the evaporative fraction from which ET is derived from the available energy. Models of various complexities have been developed to estimate ET from surfaces of different vegetation fractions. One-source models combine soil and vegetation into a composite surface for ET estimation, while two-source models estimate ET of soil and vegetation components separately. Image contexture-based triangular and trapezoid models are simple and effective temperature-based ET models based on spatial and/or temporal variation patterns of LST. Several effective temporal scaling schemes are available for extending instantaneous temperature-based ET estimation to daily or longer time periods. Conductance-based ET models usually use the Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation to estimate ET with shortwave remote sensing data. A key put to these models is canopy conductance to water vapor, which depends on canopy structure and leaf stomatal conductance. Shortwave remote sensing data are used to determine canopy structural parameters, and stomatal conductance can be estimated in different ways. Based on the principle of the coupling between carbon and water cycles, stomatal conductance can be reliably derived from the plant photosynthesis rate. Three types of photosynthesis models are available for deriving stomata] or canopy conductance: (1) big-leaf models for the total canopy conductance, (2) two-big-leaf models for canopy conductances for sunlit and shaded leaf groups, and (3) two-leaf models for stomatal conductances for the average sunlit and shaded leaves separately. Correspondingly, there are also big-leaf, two-big-leaf and two-leaf ET models based on these conductances. The main difference among them is the level of aggregation of conductances before the P-M equation is used for ET estimation, with big-leaf models having the highest aggregation. Since the relationship between ET and conductance is nonlinear, this aggregation causes negative bias errors, with the big-leaf models having the largest bias. It is apparent from the existing literature that two-leaf conductance-based ET models have the least bias in comparison with flux measurements. Based on this review, we make the following recommendations for future work: (1) improving key remote sensing products needed for ET mapping purposes, including soil moisture, foliage clumping index, and leaf carboxylation rate, (2) combining temperature-based and conductance-based models for regional ET estimation, (3) refining methodologies for tight coupling between carbon and water cycles, (4) fully utilizing vegetation structural and biochemical parameters that can now be reliably retrieved from shortwave remote sensing, and (5) to improve regional and global ET monitoring capacity.', '[Chen, Jing M.; Liu, Jane] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'University of TorontoRP Chen, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Geog, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'chenj@geog.utoronto.ca; janejj.liu@utoronto.caRI Chen, Jing/AAD-4768-2020; Liu, Jane/AAU-7260-2020', 'Chen, Jing/0000-0002-8682-1293; Liu, Jane/0000-0001-7760-2788', 'Natural Science and Engineering Council of Canada; Canadian Space Agency', 'This work is supported by a discovery grant from the Natural Science and   Engineering Council of Canada and two research grants from Canadian   Space Agency.

However, accurate detection of inundated areas can be hindered by the extremely complicated electromagnetic interaction phenomena between microwave pulses, and horizontal and vertical targets. This manuscript focuses on the problem of inundation mapping in areas with emerging vegetation, where spatial and seasonal heterogeneity makes the systematic distinction between dry and flooded backscatter response even more difficult. In this context, image interpretation algorithms have mostly used detailed field data and reference image(s) to implement electromagnetic models or change detection techniques. However, field data are rare, and despite the increasing availability of SAR acquisitions, adequate reference image(s) might not be readily available, especially for fine resolution acquisitions. To by-pass this problem, this study presents an algorithm for automatic flood mapping in areas with emerging vegetation when only single SAR acquisitions and common ancillary data are available. First, probability binning is used for statistical analysis of the backscatter response of wet and dry vegetation for different land cover types. This analysis is then complemented with information on land use, morphology and context within a fuzzy logic approach. The algorithm was applied to three fine resolution images (one ALOS-PALSAR and two COSMO-SkyMed) acquired during the January 2011 flood in the Condamine-Balonne catchment (Australia). Flood extent layers derived from optical images were used as validation data, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm had an overall accuracy higher than 80% for all case studies.

The spatial distribution and impacts of RTSs on the Tibetan Plateau are poorly understood due to their remote location and the technical challenges of automatic mapping. In this study, we innovatively applied DeepLabv3 +, a cutting-edge deep learning algorithm for semantic segmentation, to Planet CubeSat images, which are satellite images with high spatial and temporal resolution. Our method allows us to automatically delineate 220 RTSs within an area of 5200 km(2) with an average precision of 0.541. The corresponding precision, recall, and F1 score are 0.863, 0.833, and 0.848 respectively, when the threshold of intersection over union is 0.5. Moreover, approximately 100 experiments on k-fold cross-validation (k = 3, 5, and 10) and data augmentation show that our method is robust. And a test in a different geographic area shows that the generalization of the trained model is very good. We find that (1) most of the RTSs are small (areas < eight ha and perimeters < 2000 m) and (2) RTSs preferentially develop at locations with gentle slopes (four to eight degrees), and in areas lower than the surroundings (the mean topographic position index is - 0.17) and receiving less solar radiation (i.e., north-facing slopes). The results show that the method can map RTSs automatically from Planet CubeSat images and can potentially be applied to larger areas.', '[Huang, Lingcao; Liu, Lin] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Fac Sci, Earth Syst Sci Programme, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

Yet the limited spatiotemporal sampling capacities of current satellites result in considerable uncertainties in fire observation and emissions estimation. The mitigation of these uncertainties mainly relies on new remote-sensing technology. The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R (GOES-R) Series observes fires across North and South Americas at an unprecedentedly spatiotemporal resolution of nominal 2 km every 5-15 min. This study evaluated the GOES-16 (the first GOES-R satellite) ABI active fire product using active fire data derived from the 30-m Landsat-8 and the 375-m and 750-m Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and ground-based burning data across the southeastern Conterminous United States (CONUS) during the 2018 peak fire season. Specifically, we characterized the overall fire detection performance of the ABI active fire detections, estimated omission and commission errors, and evaluated ABI fire radiative power (FRP). The results showed that the ABI fire detection probability and its omission and commission errors were highly related to fire size and temporal period. ABI detection probability was higher than 95% for the fire pixel that contained over 114 Landsat-8 (30 m) fire detections or 11 VIIRS (375 m) detections. During a period of +/- 8 h, ABI detected 19% and 29% more fires observed by Landsat-8 and 375-m VIIRS, respectively. Correspondingly, the omission error could reduce by up to 33%. Further, ABI was able to detect 6-22% and 31-42% more ground-recorded fires than VIIRS in Georgia and Florida States, respectively, but ABI still missed many very small fires because ABI was hard to detect fires smaller than similar to 34.5 MW. Additionally, compared with 750-m VIIRS FRP, ABI FRP was similar to 30-50% larger in individual fire events but was overall similar at a regional scale.', '[Li, Fangjun; Zhang, Xiaoyang] South Dakota State Univ, Dept Geog, Geospatial Sci Ctr Excellence, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.

We compared the noise of Sentinel-3A SLAs averaged across three posting rates (i.e. 1 Hz, 2 Hz and 4 Hz) with the 1 Hz noise of MBP-derived Jason-3 SLAs. At distances >10 km from the coast, the noise level of 1 Hz Sentinel-3A SLAs (similar to 1.2 cm) is lower than that of the MBP-retracked Jason-3 SLAs (similar to 1.7 cm). Moreover, the noise level of 2 Hz Sentinel-3A SLAs is comparable to that of the 1 Hz MBP-derived Jason-3 dataset, indicating that Sentinel-3A can provide precise SLAs at finer spatial scales. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of differences between the tide gauge SLA time series and the equivalent SLA time series at each along-track altimeter point was used to assess pointwise data quality. For both Sentinel-3A and MBP-retracked Jason-3, the along-track RMSEs of 20 Hz SLAs vary between 0.05 m and 0.2 m. The mean and standard deviation (STD) of 1 Hz SLA differences at crossover points were computed for each individual altimetry mission to assess overall data quality.

However, satellite identification of algal blooms and species in turbid coastal waters has been challenging. There is an urgent need for simple and effective methods to identify locations, areas, durations, and species present in algal blooms through satellite observation, to aid in the operational and emergency monitoring of the marine environment. In this study, based on a three-band blended model, we propose an indicator (Red tide Detection Index, RDI) that is suitable for the purpose of detecting algal blooms in turbid coastal waters using multi-source ocean color data. MERIS, MODIS, and GOCI data used for the detection of algal blooms demonstrate consistent results using the RDI indicator, and these results correlate with in situ investigations. Furthermore, based on a green-red spectral slope, we propose a method that uses MERIS data to identify dominant species of diatoms and dinoflagellates in algal blooms in the East China Sea (ECS). The 10-year time series MERIS data collected between 2003 and 2012 indicates that algal bloom occurrences are mainly distributed in the nearshore areas of the ECS, and possess a distinct climatological cycle. The 10-year time series MERIS data help discriminate diatom and dinoflagellate blooms in the ECS, and show the dissimilarity in the seasonal timing of their life cycles. We find that these two dominant species in algal blooms are usually distributed in different spatial locations in the ECS. Additionally, by defining a divergence index (DI), the limitations of spectral resolutions of satellite data used for algal bloom species differentiation are quantitatively assessed.', '[Shen, Fang; Tang, Rugang; Sun, Xuerong; Liu, Dongyan] East China Normal Univ, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, 500 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.

Space based observations have the unique advantage of providing reliable estimates of SW and PAR globally with sufficient accuracy for constructing Earth\'s radiation budget and estimating land-surface fluxes that control these processes. However, most existing space-based SW and PAR estimations from sensors onboard polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites have inherently low temporal resolution and/or limited spatial coverage of the entire Earth surface. The unique location/orbit of Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) onboard the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) provides an unprecedented opportunity to obtain global estimates of SW and PAR accurately at a high temporal resolution of about 1-2 h. In this study, we developed and used a model (random forest, RF) to estimate global hourly SW and PAR at 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees (about 10 km at equator) spatial resolution based on EPIC measurements. We used a combination of EPIC Level-2 products, including solar zenith angle, aerosol optical depth, cloud optical thickness, cloud fraction, total column ozone and surface pressure with their associated quality flags to drive the RF model for estimating SW and PAR. We evaluated the model results against in situ observations from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) and Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD). We found the EPIC SW and PAR estimates at both hourly and daily time scales to be highly correlated and consistent with these independently obtained in situ measurements. The RMSEs for estimated daily diffuse SW, direct SW, total SW, and total PAR were 19.10, 38.47, 33.52, and 14.09 W/m(2), respectively, and the biases for these estimates were 1.71, -0.77, 1.04 and 4.11 W/m(2), respectively. We further compared the estimated SW and PAR with the Clouds and the Earth\'s Radiant Energy System Synoptic 1 degrees x 1 degrees (CERES SYN1deg) products and found a good correlation and consistency in their accuracy, spatial patterns and latitudinal gradient. The EPIC SW and PAR estimates provide a unique dataset (i.e. observations from single instrument from pole-to-pole for the entire sunlit portion of Earth) for characterizing their diurnal cycles and their potential impact on photosynthesis and evapotranspiration processes.', '[Hao, Dalei; Wen, Jianguang; Xiao, Qing] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

Over the past half century, the Landsat user community has grown exponentially, encompassing more diverse and evolving scientific research and operational uses. Understanding current and future user needs is crucial to informing the design of Landsat missions beyond Landsat 9. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) initiated a user needs collection process to document needs from U.S. Federal civil subject matter experts who rely on moderate-resolution land imaging data across a diverse range of scientific research and application domains. In total, 379 moderate-resolution land imaging user needs were collected through structured interviews. The findings indicate that, at present, users need continuity in Landsat capabilities with free and open data access. Improvements to future Landsat systems should include 10 m spatial resolution and at least weekly cloud-free observation frequency. Spectral enhancements should include the addition of red edge bands, and multiple, narrower visible, near infrared, shortwave infrared, and thermal infrared bands. Ideally, a variety of applications need continuous, full-spectrum coverage in 10 nm-wide bands spanning the visible to shortwave infrared (VSWIR) region (400-2500 nm) and 5 to 8 multispectral thermal infrared bands. Non-Federal (state, local, commercial, academic, and international) sources found similar results, but a more comprehensive comparison across these communities through a broader survey may provide additional insights.

Global mean Delta T, averaged over the full study period, is -0.13 K, with most values falling between -0.1 and -0.2 K. The dominant role of wind speed on the Delta T is shown, with weaker winds usually corresponding to a cooler skin. The effect of air-sea temperature difference is also significant: warm skin (Delta T > 0 K) can be observed under large positive air-sea temperature differences. Other geophysical variables, such as the total column water vapor, in situ SST, and net heat flux, also affect Delta T, but to a lesser degree. Significant increase of Delta T size with SSTinsitu is observed when SSTinsitu is > 28 degrees C. Tropical waters, such as the tropical Indian Ocean and the tropical warm pool (western Pacific and eastern Indian Ocean), are more frequently covered with a cool skin, largely due to the calm winds, very warm waters (especially for SSTinsitu > 28 degrees C), and other environmental conditions supporting the development of large cool skin events. The Delta T seasonal pattern in the southern hemisphere is more regular, compared to the northern hemisphere. In both hemispheres, larger cool skin signals are seen during the local summer, mainly due to weaker winds. According to several previous cool skin models, higher winds tend to result in thinner cool skin layer depths, and hence in smaller Delta T amplitudes, regardless of stronger evaporation and heat loss. Given that wind is closely coupled with waves and turbulent mixing with wave breaking, the dependencies of Delta T on a few wave parameters are also investigated. A strong (moderate) dependency of Delta T on wave height (wave steepness) is identified, while the dependency of Delta T on wave breaking probability is less discernible.', '[Zhang, Haifeng; Babanin, Alexander V.; Liu, Qingxiang] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Engn, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.

To address this issue, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) appear to be a potential new platform for forest phenology monitoring. This article assesses the potential of UAV data to track the temporal dynamics of spring phenology, from the individual tree to woodland scale, and cross-compare UAV results against ground and satellite observations, in order to better understand characteristics of UAV data and assess potential for use in validation of satellite-derived phenology. A time series of UAV data (5 cm spatial resolution, similar to 7 day temporal resolution) were acquired in tandem with an intensive ground campaign during the spring season of 2015 across a 15 ha mixed woodland. Phenophase transition dates were estimated at an individual tree-level using UAV time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) and validated against visual observations of tree phenology. UAV-derived start of season dates could be predicted with an accuracy of < 1 week. The analysis was scaled to a plot level, where ground (visual assessment and understorey development), UAV and Landsat metrics were compared, indicating UAV data is effective for tracking canopy phenology, as opposed to ecosystem dynamics detected by satellites. The UAV data were used to automatically map phonological events for individual trees across the whole woodland, demonstrating that contrasting canopy phenological events can occur within the extent of a single Landsat pixel. This, and a large temporal gap in the Landsat series, accounted for the poor relationships found between UAV- and Landsat-derived phenometrics (R-2 < 0.50) in this study.

This study uses remotely sensed data to quantify thermal variability within fruit and nut orchards during an intense drought period in California\'s Central Valley (2013-2015). First, fractions of green vegetation (GV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and soil were derived for a variety of crop species using visible-shortwave infrared (VSWIR) spectra imaged by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). Fractional estimates were then used to select thermal endmembers for each class using simultaneously collected MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER) thermal imagery and a crop species map. Expected pixel temperatures of non-stressed crop fields were then modeled, and the per-pixel difference between measured and expected temperatures was calculated as a temperature residual. Crop residuals serve to capture variability in temperature that may be attributable to differences in crop health and/or management practices. We found multiple distinct thermal classes to exist across the study site. Furthermore, crop temperatures correlated to expected crop ET rates, and temperature residuals showed correlations to changes in crop yields during the study period. Further assessment of findings revealed an increase in temperature residuals during the study period that is consistent with increasing stress, likely linked to the progression of drought.

Within mountain environments, surface soil moisture is highly heterogeneous and challenging to measure. Point measurements are often poorly representative of larger areas, while satellite pixels are generally too coarse in these topographically varied landscapes. In the Cordillera Blanca, Peru, rapid glacier recession is impacting downstream water supply in timing, quantity and quality. Recent research has shown that these proglacial valleys provide vital ecosystem services and store considerable amounts of water within the groundwater systems. However, the spatial and temporal variability of soil water storage is poorly understood. In this tropical Andean setting, we use an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with multispectral (visible, near infrared, thermal infrared) sensors to map sections of two proglacial valleys in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru at sub-metre resolution. We use the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) (Sandholt et al., 2002), and apply it for the first time to UAV borne imagery to estimate absolute surface soil moisture through calibration with in-scene field measurements. Resulting surface soil moisture maps have 50 cm spatial resolution with an R-2 value of 0.55 and 0.76 for the two study sites, Pachacoto and Llanganuco respectively. We analyse the multispectral orthomosaics and soil moisture maps to improve our understanding of the controls on spatial variability in surface soil moisture within the proglacial valleys of the Cordillera Blanca. The maps permit us to identify both important groundwater spring sources and areas where domestic grazing impacts observed soil moisture estimates. The high resolution observations provided by the UAV facilitate a greater understanding of fine scale heterogeneity within these environments.', '[Wigmore, Oliver; Mark, Bryan] Ohio State Univ, Dept Geog, Byrd Polar & Climate Res Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.

Global drought events and their duration, frequency and severity are assessed on a grid basis with soil moisture anomaly percentage index (SMAPI). The results show that the ESA CCI SM and the GLDAS-Noah based SMAPI values are significantly (p < 0.05) correlated over most (83%) of the study region, of seasonally dependent. Both datasets show similar global patterns in drought duration, drought frequency and drought severity. The droughts present generally longer duration, higher frequency and more severity in arid and semi-arid regions than humid and sub-humid regions. The ESA CCI SM droughts are relatively higher in frequency and more intense in severity than the GLDAS-Noah SM droughts in many regions of the globe, while the two datasets show considerable differences in drought duration over arid, semi-arid and highly vegetated regions. For long-term trend detection, both datasets show high consistency in spatial pattern of SMAPI, with major significant drying trends in arid and semi-arid regions. Part (similar to 20%) trends are confirmed by the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) precipitation dataset using the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI). The two SM datasets exhibit large disparity in trending drought duration, drought frequency and drought severity. Despite that, both show major significant increasing trends in arid and semi-arid regions. Both soil moisture datasets are capable of identifying extreme drought events reported in southern China, North America, Europe and southern Africa. The ESA CCI SM dataset is more effective in determining the severity and spatial pattern of drought excluding densely vegetated regions, while the GLDAS-Noah dataset is more powerful in detecting drought occurrence, even over densely vegetated regions.

In this global study, we examine how quickly several satellite-based indicators, assumed to have relationships with water availability, respond, on timescales of days to weeks, in comparison with variations in root-zone soil moisture (RZM) that extends to about 1 m depth. The satellite indicators considered are the normalized difference vegetation and infrared indices (NDVI and NDII, respectively) derived from reflectances obtained with moderately wide (20-40 nm) spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) and evapotranspiration (ET) estimated from thermal infrared observations and normalized by a reference ET. NDVI is primarily sensitive to chlorophyll contributions and vegetation structure while NDII may contain additional information on water content in leaves and canopy. ET includes both the loss of root zone soil water through transpiration (modulated by stomatal conductance) as well as evaporation from bare soil. We find that variations of these satellite-based drought indicators on time scales of days to weeks have significant correlations with those of RZM in the same water-limited geographical locations that are dominated by grasslands, shrublands, and savannas whose root systems are generally contained within the 1 m RZM layer. Normalized ET interannual variations show generally a faster response to water deficits and enhancements as compared with those of NDVI and NDII, particularly in sparsely vegetated regions.', '[Joiner, Joanna; Holmes, Thomas; Reichle, Rolf; Koster, Randal; Middleton, Elizabeth] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.

The quality of these products should be assessed according to internationally promoted requirements e.g., by the Committee on Earth Observation Systems-Working Group on Calibration and Validation (CEOS-WGCV) and updated accuracy should be provided with new releases (Stage-4 validation). Providing updated accuracies for the yearly maps would require considerable effort for collecting validation datasets. To save time and effort on data collection, validation datasets should be designed to suit multiple map assessments and should be easily adjustable for a timely validation of new releases of land cover products. This study introduces a validation dataset aimed to facilitate multi-purpose assessments and its applicability is demonstrated in three different assessments focusing on validating discrete and fractional land cover maps, map comparison and user-oriented map assessments. The validation dataset is generated primarily to validate the newly released 100 m spatial resolution land cover product from the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS-LC100). The validation dataset includes 3617 sample sites in Africa based on stratified sampling. Each site corresponds to an area of 100 m x 100 m. Within site, reference land cover information was collected at 100 subpixels of 10 m x 10 m allowing the land cover information to be suitable for different resolution and legends. Firstly, using this dataset, we validated both the discrete and fractional land cover layers of the CGLS-LC100 product. The CGLS-LC100 discrete map was found to have an overall accuracy of 74.6 +/- 2.1% (at 95% confidence level) for the African continent. Fraction cover products were found to have mean absolute errors of 9.3, 8.8, 16.2, and 6.5% for trees, shrubs, herbaceous vegetation and bare ground, respectively. Secondly, for user-oriented map assessment, we assessed the accuracy of the CGLS-LC100 map from four user groups\' perspectives (forest monitoring, crop monitoring, biodiversity and climate modelling). Overall accuracies for these perspectives vary between 73.7% +/- 2.1% and 93.5% +/- 0.9%, depending on the land cover classes of interest. Thirdly, for map comparison, we assessed the accuracy of the Globeland30-2010 map at 30 m spatial resolution. Using the subpixel level validation data, we derived 15,252 sample pixels at 30 m spatial resolution. Based on these sample pixels, the overall accuracy of the Globeland30-2010 map was found to be 66.6 +/- 2.4% for Africa. The three assessments exemplify the applicability of multi-purpose validation datasets which are recommended to increase map validation efficiency and consistency.

Sentinel-2 provides high spatial resolution satellite data distributed with associated cloud masks. In this paper, we evaluate the ability of Sentinel-2 Level-1C cloud mask products to discriminate clouds over a variety of biogeographic scenarios and in different cloudiness conditions. Reference cloud masks for the identification of misdetection were generated by applying a local thresholding method that analyses Sentinel-2 Band 2 (0.490 mu m) and Band 10 (1.375 mu m) separately; histogram-based thresholds were locally tuned by checking the single bands and the natural color composite (B4B3B2); in doubtful cases, NDVI and DEM were also analyzed to refine the masks; the B2B11B12 composite was used to separate snow.   The analysis of the cloud classification errors obtained for our test sites allowed us to get important inferences of general value. The L1C cloud mask generally underestimated the presence of clouds (average Omission Error, OE, 37.4%); this error increased (OE > 50%) for imagery containing opaque clouds with a large transitional zone (between the cloud core and clear areas) and cirrus clouds, fragmentation emerged as a major source of omission errors (R-2 0.73). Overestimation was prevalently found in the presence of holes inside the main cloud bodies. Two extreme environments were particularly critical for the L1C cloud mask product. Detection over Amazonian rainforests was highly inefficient (OE > 70%) due to the presence of complex cloudiness and high water vapor content. On the other hand, Alpine orography under dry atmosphere created false cirrus clouds. Altogether, cirrus detection was the most inefficient.

Production efficiency models (PEMs) estimate Gross Primary Production (GPP) as a function of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy, which is derived from Earth observation. GPP can be summed over the growing season and adjusted by a crop-specific harvest index to estimate yield. Although PEMs have many advantages over other crop yield models, they are not widely used, because performance is relatively poor. Here, a new PEM is presented that addresses deficiencies for macro-scale application: Production Efficiency Model Optimized for Crops (PEMOC). It was developed by optimizing functions from the literature with GPP estimated by eddy covariance flux towers in the United States. The model was evaluated using newly developed Earth observation products and county-level yield statistics for major crops. PEMOC generally performed better at the field and county level than another commonly used PEM, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer GPP (MOD17). PEMOC and MOD17 estimates of GPP had an R-2 and root mean squared error (RMSE) over the growing season of 0.71-0.89 (9.87-17.47 g CO2 d(-1)) and 0.59-0.83 (6.86-22.20 g CO2 d(-1)) with flux tower GPP. PEMOC produced R(2)s and RMSE of 0.70 (0.52), 0.60 (0.61), and 0.62 (0.59), while MOD17 produced R(2)s and RMSE of 0.65 (0.57), 0.53 (0.66), and 0.65 (0.57) with corn, soybean, and winter wheat crop yield anomalies. The sample size of rice was small, so yields were compared directly. PEMOC and MOD17 produced R(2)s and RMSE of 0.53 (3.42 t h(-1)) and 0.40 (4.89 t ha(-1)). The most sizeable model improvements were seen for C-3 and C-4 crops during emergence/senescence and peak season, respectively. These improvements were attributed to C-3 and C-4 partitioning, optimized temperature and moisture constraints, and an evapotranspiration-based soil moisture index.', '[Marshall, Michael] World Agroforestry Ctr, Climate Res Unit, United Nations Ave,POB 30677-00100, Nairobi, Kenya.

Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) can register lower vertical strata, such as understory vegetation, without issues of canopy occlusion, however is limited in its acquisition over large areas. In this study we examine the ability of ALS(FW) to characterize understory vegetation (i.e. maximum and mean height, cover, and volume), verified using TLS point clouds in a Mediterranean forest in Eastern Spain. We developed nine full-waveform metrics to characterize understory vegetation attributes at two different scales (3.75 m square subplots and circular plots with a radius of 15 m); with, and without, application of a height filter to the data. Four understory vegetation attributes were estimated at plot level with high R-2 values (mean height: R-2 = 0.957, maximum height: R-2 = 0.771, cover: R-2 = 0.871, and volume: R-2 = 0.951).

Two critical parameters of the model are the vegetation index values of fully-vegetated and bare soil pixels (denoted V-x and V-n hereafter). These are commonly empirically set according to spatial and/or temporal statistics. The uncertainty and difficulty of accurately determining V-x and V-n in many ecosystems limits the accuracy of resultant FVC estimates and hence reduces the utility of VI-based mixture model for FVC estimation. Here, an improved method called MultiVI is developed to quantitatively estimate V-x and V-n from angular VI acquired at two viewing angles. The directional VI is calculated from the MODIS Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)/Albedo product (MCD43A1) data. The results of simulated evaluation with 10% added noise show that the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of FVC is approximately 0.1 (the valid FVC range is [0, 1]). Direct evaluation against 34 globally-distributed FVC measurements from VAlidation of Land European Remote sensing Instruments (VALERI) sites during 2000 to 2014 demonstrated that the accuracy of MultiVI FVC (R-2 = 0.866, RMSD = 0.092) exceeds than from SPOT/VEGETATION bioGEOphysical product version 1 (GEOV1) FVC (R-2 = 0.795, RMSD = 0.159). MultiVI FVC also exhibits higher correlation to the VALERI reference FVC than does the MODIS fraction of photosynthetically active radiation product (MCD15A2H; R-2 is 0.696). A key advantage of the MultiVI method is obvious in areas where fully-vegetated and/or bare soil pixels do not exist in moderate-coarse spatial resolution imagery when compared to the conventional VI-based mixture modelling. The MultiVI method can be flexibly implemented over regional or global scales to monitor FVC, with maps of V-x and V-n generated as two important byproducts.', '[Mu, Xihan; Song, Wanjuan; Gao, Zhan; Yan, Guangjian] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.

However, our knowledge of snow cover in Arctic regions is very limited due to the sparseness of in situ measurements. This study presents a new method to derive snow accumulation information for Arctic regions through tracking the surface elevation changes of numerous frozen arctic lakes measured by Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation satellite (ICESat) repeat altimetry observations. The original ICESat elevation product for continental surface was generated by tracking the centroids of the emitted and the returned laser waveforms. This product contains many biased measurements over frozen arctic lake surfaces due to the scattering effects induced by thin clouds and blowing snow. This study derives an operational approach that produces more reliable altimetry observations by converting the elevation measurements from the centroid scheme to the max-amplitude-peak scheme. Time-variable biases exist between the repeat elevation measurements acquired in different ICESat campaigns. The correction of these inter-campaign biases in this study significantly improves the quantification of the surface elevation change, thus enabling more consistent subsequent snow accumulation estimates. Besides snow fall, lake ice growth also contributes to the surface elevation change. We developed a method to measure and remove this contribution from the total lake surface elevation change, which leads to more accurate estimates of snow accumulation on frozen surfaces of 277 lakes in Arctic regions of northern Alaska. The results were validated using in situ snow depth observations from terrestrial stations on the Arctic coastal plain of Alaska. After the correction of the ICESat inter-campaign biases and the removal of contribution by lake surface phase transformation, the snow accumulation derived from the repeat ICESat elevation measurements are highly correlated with in situ snow depth observations with a Pearson\'s correlation coefficient r of 0.88. In comparison with ground-based measurements, the root mean square error (RMSE) of our snow accumulation estimates is approximately 5 cm. Our method makes it possible to provide much denser snow accumulation information as compared to the existing in situ observations for the Circum-Arctic coastal regions and also the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau where seasonal frozen lakes are abundant.', '[Shu, Song; Liu, Hongxing; Wang, Shujie; Hinkel, Kenneth M.; Beck, Richard A.] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Geog & Geog Informat Sci, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA.

Moreover, the growing number of SAR satellites has increased the likelihood of observing a flood event from space through at least a single SAR image, but generalized methods for flood classification independent of sensor characteristics need to be developed, to fully utilize these images for disaster management. Consequently, a neuro-fuzzy flood mapping technique is proposed for texture-enhanced single SAR images. Accordingly, any SAR image is first processed to generate second-order statistical textures, which are subsequently optimized using a dimensionality reduction technique. The flood and non-flood classes are then modelled within a fuzzy inference system using Gaussian curves. Parameterization is achieved by training a neural network on the image through user-defined polygons. The results of the optimized texture-based neuro-fuzzy classification were compared against the performance of the SAR image alone and that of SAR enhanced with randomly selected texture features. This approach was tested for a COSMO-SkyMed SAR image at two validation sites, for which high resolution aerial photographs were available. An overall accuracy assessment using reliability diagrams demonstrated a reduction of 54.2% in the Weighted Root Mean Squared Error (WRMSE) values compared to the stand-alone use of SAR. WRMSE values estimated for the proposed method varied from 0.027 to 0.196. A fuzzy validation exercise was also proposed to account for the uncertainty in manual flood identification from aerial photography, resulting in fuzzy spatial similarity values ranging from 0.67 to 0.92, with higher values representing better performance. Results suggest that the proposed approach has demonstrated potential to improve operational SAR-based flood mapping.', '[Dasgupta, Antara] IITB Monash Res Acad, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India.

Compared with time- and labor-intensive field surveys, remote sensing provides the only realistic approach to mapping canopy defoliation by herbivorous insects over large spatial and temporal scales. However, the spectral and structural signatures of defoliation by insects at the individual tree level have not been well studied. Additionally, the predictive power of spectral and structural metrics for mapping canopy defoliation has seldom been compared. These critical knowledge gaps prevent us from consistently detecting and mapping canopy defoliation by herbivorous insects across multiple scales. During the peak of a gypsy moth outbreak in Long Island, New York in summer 2016, we leveraged bi-temporal airborne imaging spectroscopy (IS, i.e., hyperspectral imaging) and LiDAR measurements at 1 m spatial resolution to explore the spectral and structural signatures of canopy defoliation in a mixed oak-pine forest. We determined that red edge and near-infrared spectral regions within the IS data were most sensitive to crown-scale defoliation severity. LiDAR measurements including B70 (i.e., 70th bincentile height), intensity skewness, and kurtosis were effectively able to detect structural changes caused by herbivorous insects. In addition to canopy leaf loss, increased exposure of understory and non-photosynthetic materials contributed to the detected spectral and structural signatures. Comparing the ability of individual sensors to map canopy defoliation, the LiDAR-only Ordinary Least-Square (OLS) model performed better than the IS-only model (Adj. R-squared = 0.77, RMSE = 15.37% vs. Adj. Rsquared = 0.63, RMSE = 19.11%). The IS + LiDAR model improved on performance of the individual sensors (Adj. R-squared = 0.81, RMSE = 14.46%). Our study improves our understanding of spectral and structural signatures of defoliation by herbivorous insects and presents a novel approach for mapping insect defoliation at the individual tree level. Additionally, with the current and next generation of spaceborne sensors (e.g., WorldView-3, Landsat, Sentinel-2, HyspIRI, and GEDI), higher accuracy and frequent monitoring of insect defoliation may become more feasible across a range of spatial scales, which are critical for ecological research and management of forest resources including the economic consequences of forest insect infestations (e.g., reduced growth and increased mortality), as well as for informing and testing of carbon cycle models.', '[Meng, Ran; Rickert, Amanda; Serbin, Shawn P.] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Environm & Climate Sci Dept, Upton, NY 11973 USA.

This introduces complexity for ocean colour applications such as Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) monitoring. As low and high biomass algorithmic approaches for ocean colour differ, no single algorithm can optimally retrieve accurate Chl a over such a wide range of biomass. We propose a novel technique to apply and blend two different Chl a algorithms - an empirical blue-green algorithm for low to moderate biomass and a red-NIR band-ratio algorithm for moderate to high biomass. The blending method is based on the 708 and 665 nm reflectance wavelength ratio, where the blue-green algorithm is applied when the rho(w)(708)/rho(w)(665) ratio is < 0.75, the red-NIR algorithm is applied > 1.15, whilst the two are blended using a weighted approach in between these values. When applied to in situ and satellite match-up data this method provides a median absolute relative difference (MARD) of 37.9 and 45.7%, respectively, and a RMSD of 0.27 and 0.35 respectively, over Chl a concentrations spanning three orders of magnitude. Application is demonstrated for both MERIS and OLCI sensors, providing a smooth transition between different biomass levels and algorithm Chl a returns.', '[Smith, M.

These satellites aim to provide global soil moisture maps for the top similar to 5 cm layer of soil with an accuracy better than 0.04 m(3)/m(3). However, with a passive microwave observing resolution of similar to 40 km, non-soil targets such as surface rock may possibly confound the brightness temperature observations and degrade the accuracy of retrievals for many SMOS and SMAP pixels across the world. Since the microwave contribution of rock is not well accounted for in current soil moisture retrieval algorithms, simply ignoring its existence may be detrimental to the performance of resultant soil moisture products. Using a combination of model simulations and airborne field campaign data from central Australia, this study has determined that a rock cover fraction threshold of up to 0.4 can be tolerated before the 0.04 m(3)/m(3) soil moisture target accuracy is potentially exceeded under extreme dry or wet conditions. However, this threshold reduces to 0.2 when assessed in terms of a brightness temperature impact > 4 K. These rock fraction thresholds have subsequently been applied to the Ecoclimap rock cover map, identifying the SMOS and SMAP pixels globally that are likely to be adversely affected if rock is unaccounted for. The results show that approximately similar to 3.3% of all SMOS and SMAP pixels may have brightness temperature impacts exceeding 4 K from surface rock, with Asia being the most affected, having similar to 6.0% affected pixels. These values reduce to similar to 1.5% of SMOS and SMAP pixels globally, and similar to 3.1% for Asia, when assessed in terms of soil moisture errors expected to possibly exceed 0.04 m(3)/m(3) when not accounting for surface rock.', '[Ye, N.; Walker, J.

However, there is a lack of methods for obtaining the nocturnal MLH. In this study, a novel instrument named the charge-coupled device-laser aerosol detection system (CCD-LADS) was developed to study the nocturnal MLH and boundary layer structure from the surface. The system mainly includes a continuous laser and a charge-coupled device camera with a fisheye lens. Structures of atmospheric layers characterized by the CCD-LADS were compared with those measured by a ceilometer. The heights of two atmospheric layers quantified by measurements with the CCD-LADS and the ceilometer show good agreement, with a relative difference of 5%. The results of this comparison demonstrated that the CCD-LADS is capable of distinctly identifying the nocturnal vertical structure of the atmosphere. The advantage of the CCD-LADS in retrieving the nocturnal MLH is that the CCD-LADS can provide the boundary layer structures under 100 m, while the ceilometer and other lidar measurements cannot retrieve the atmospheric structures below that altitude. CCD-LADS was deployed in a comprehensive field campaign measuring air pollution in the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, located at the border between the North China Plain and Yanshan Mountain, during January 2016.

We filled this knowledge gap by quantifying vegetation dynamics, defined here as greening and browning due to changing chlorophyll content and leaf area index, in response to flooding and rainfall across the floodplains of the entire MDB. We quantified vegetation and flooding dynamics using the same data source, namely 26 years of high resolution, wall-to-wall satellite data, in a top down statistical modeling approach, where we controlled for rainfall. Our time series (1986-2011) covered a period of extreme hydroclimatic variability, including the South East Australian Millennium Drought, thus providing a research opportunity to investigate how the relationship between vegetation and flooding changed during wet and dry periods. Our results showed that besides rainfall, flooding plays a key role in driving floodplain vegetation dynamics, yet the role of flooding varied across the MDB floodplains. We quantified a change in the relationship of how vegetation responds to rainfall and flooding with an unprecedented level of spatial detail. The change in the relationships coincided primarily with the onset of the Millennium Drought, yet local and regional differences in the timing of the change did occur, suggesting that the beginning of the Millennium Drought did not impact all floodplain areas at the same time.

Then, based on the full validation of the proposed DSAM, how multiple factors affect the SPM accuracy is analyzed using the multispectral remote sensing (MRS) images. Finally, by analyzing the maximum variations in the ranges of the overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient under different multiple factors, the order of factors influencing SPM accuracy is determined as follows: reconstruction scale > image spatial resolution > pixel spatial relationships.

At regional scales (3-10 km pixel resolution), the ESI has demonstrated the capacity to capture developing crop stress and impacts on regional yield variability in water-limited agricultural regions. However, its performance in some regions where the vegetation cycle is intensively managed appears to be degraded due to spatial and temporal limitations in the standard ESI products. In this study, we investigated potential improvements to ESI by generating maps of ET, f(RET), and f(RET) anomalies at high spatiotemporal resolution (30-m pixels, daily time steps) using a multi-sensor data fusion method, enabling separation of landcover types with different phenologies and resilience to drought. The study was conducted for the period 2010-2014 covering a region around Mead, Nebraska that includes both rainfed and irrigated crops. Correlations between ESI and measurements of maize yield were investigated at both the field and county level to assess the potential of ESI as a yield forecasting tool. To examine the role of crop phenology in yield-ESI correlations, annual input f(RET) time series were aligned by both calendar day and by biophysically relevant dates (e.g. days since planting or emergence). At the resolution of the operational U.S. ESI product (4 km), adjusting f(RET) alignment to a regionally reported emergence date prior to anomaly computation improves r(2) correlations with county-level yield estimates from 0.28 to 0.80. At 30-m resolution, where pure maize pixels can be isolated from other crops and landcover types, county-level yield correlations improved from 0.47 to 0.93 when aligning f(RET) by emergence date rather than calendar date. Peak correlations occurred 68 days after emergence, corresponding to the silking stage for maize when grain development is particularly sensitive to soil moisture deficiencies.

Monitoring the geographical distribution and spatio-temporal dynamics of this invasive species is essentially critical to conduct the systematic restoration of affected riparian ecosystems. Previous studies indicated that the leaf senescence stage is the optimal time window to remotely monitor saltcedar distributions. Yet due to climate variability and anthropogenic forcing, the timing of saltcedar leaf senescence varies over space and time. Given that the saltcedar leaf senescence stage only lasts for a short temporal window (i.e., three or four weeks), pinpointing the appropriate Landsat image across years and locations without the expert knowledge is challenging. Remotely sensed phenological time series analysis provides a practical means to locate the leaf senescence date on a per-pixel basis. However, affected by temporal revisit rates and cloud contamination, Landsat time series can only capture very limited temporal segments of vegetation phenology. The lack of Landsat imagery throughout the year makes the conventional time series analysis difficult. In this study, we developed a multiyear spectral angle clustering (MSAC) model to monitor the inter-annual leaf senescence of saltcedar with limited Landsat imagery on a per-pixel basis. The MSAC model leverages the Landsat images across years to temporally predict the fall phenology of plant species in a single year, and constructs the synthesized time series of spectral signatures to estimate critical phenological transition dates. Results indicated that the MSAC model could guide the construction of the composite Landsat surface reflectance image to accommodate spatial and inter-annual variation in the timing of plant leaf senescence. The phenology-guided composite image from the MSAC model achieved a greater saltcedar mapping accuracy than any single Landsat image in 2004. The proposed MSAC model provides new insights in estimating phenological transition dates of plant species with limited Landsat imagery. It opens up unique opportunities to guide the selection of representative remotely sensed imagery on a per-pixel basis for repetitive saltcedar mapping over wide geographical regions.', '[Diao, Chunyuan] Univ Illinois, Dept Geog & Geog Informat Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.

For this purpose, twenty MODIS - Landsat 8 image pairs acquired between April 2013 and December 2016 over European Alps are used. Fifteen of the image pairs are employed during model training and five images are reserved as an independent test dataset. MARS models are trained by using MODIS top-of-atmosphere reflectance values of bands 1-7, normalized difference snow index, normalized difference vegetation index and land cover class as predictor variables. Reference FSC maps are generated from higher spatial resolution Landsat 8 binary snow cover maps. Multilayer feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) models are also trained by using the same input data. During the training and the testing, the effects of the training data size and the sampling type on the predictive performance of ANN and MARS models are investigated. An additional search is also conducted to reveal whether the choice of the transfer function used in the output layer of ANN has a significant contribution to the network\'s FSC mapping performance. The final ANN and MARS FSC products are at 500 m spatial resolution. The results on the independent test scenes indicate that the developed ANN models with linear and hyperbolic tangent transfer functions in the output layer and the MARS models are in good agreement with reference FSC data with the same average values of R = 0.93. In contrast, the standard MODIS snow fraction product, namely, MOD10 FSC, exhibits slightly poorer performance with average R = 0.88.

Previous studies have shown the potential of using both the geometrical information (proportions, shape of the crown profile, etc.) and return intensities of airborne laser scanning (ALS) point clouds to identify trees. So far, single wavelength (1064 nm or 1550 nm) ALS systems have been the most common. Teledyne Optech Inc. (Vaughan, Canada) introduced the Titan multispectral airborne lidar, the first three-wavelength system, equipped with 1550 nm, 1064 nm and 532 nm lasers. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of this discrete return multispectral lidar (MSL) for identifying the species of single trees, compared to standard discrete single wavelength lidar. Two distinct datasets were acquired in the Toronto region, Canada. The point clouds of single trees were extracted and 3D and intensity classification features were computed. New intensity features were developed for this purpose, such as lidar NDVIs (normalized difference vegetation index). The species of each tree were identified with a random forest classifier using features calculated from 1) each channel separately and 2) all channels. A stringent selection strategy was employed to reduce the number of features down to 5-9, from 99-142. Trees were classified either as broadleaved (BL) or needleleaf (NL), by genus (4-7 classes), or by species (10 classes). When using all channels, the classification accuracy surpassed what was achieved with single channels, but this advantage was only significant when the number of classes was high, i.e. in the case of seven genera, or ten species. Using MSL data, the out-of-bag error was 3-5% for the BL-NL classification, 13% and 20% for respectively four and seven genera, and 24% for ten species. In the latter case, the best single-channel classification (based on 1550 nm data) resulted in an error of 35%. In the MSL classification, the most useful features were the NDVIs (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, based on the intensity of infrared and green channels) and the 1550 nm intensities.

Remote acquisition of fluorescence allows the diagnosis of large field extensions, even from satellite measurements. Nevertheless, fluorescence emerging from chloroplasts, the one directly connected to plant physiology, undergoes re-absorption processes both within the leaf and the canopy. Therefore, corrections of the observed canopy fluorescence, taking into account these two re-absorption processes may help to draw accurate inferences about plant health. Here, we show the theoretical development and experimental validation of a model that allows to retrieve the spectral distribution of the leaf fluorescence spectrum from that on top of canopy(TOC) using a correction factor which is a function of both canopy and soil reflectance, and canopy transmittance. Canopy fluorescence spectra corrected by our theoretical approach and normalized shows 95% correlation with the normalized fluorescence spectrum at leaf-level, thus validating the model. Therefore, our results provide a physical explanation and quantification for fluorescence re-absorption within the canopy, a phenomenon which has only been mentioned but never measured up to the date. From a more general perspective, this new analytical tool together with the one previously developed by Ramos and Lagorio (2004) allows to obtain the spectral distribution of chloroplast fluorescence spectrum from that on top of canopy (TOC).', '[Romero, Juan M.; Lagorio, M.

To respond to this need, in 2012 the European Space Agency (ESA) released the first multi-decadal, global satellite-observed soil moisture (SM) dataset as part of its Climate Change Initiative (CO) program. This product, named ESA CCI SM, combines various single-sensor active and passive microwave soil moisture products into three harmonised products: a merged ACTIVE, a merged PASSIVE, and a COMBINED active + passive microwave product. Compared to the first product release, the latest version of ESA CCI SM includes a large number of enhancements, incorporates various new satellite sensors, and extends its temporal coverage to the period 1978-2015. In this study, we first provide a comprehensive overview of the characteristics, evolution, and performance of the ESA CCI SM products. Based on original research and a review of existing literature we show that the product quality has steadily increased with each successive release and that the merged products generally outperform the single-sensor input products. Although ESA CCI SM generally agrees well with the spatial and temporal patterns estimated by land surface models and observed in-situ, we identify surface conditions (e.g., dense vegetation, organic soils) for which it still has large uncertainties. Second, capitalising on the results of >100 research studies that made use of the ESA CCI SM data we provide a synopsis of how it has contributed to improved process understanding in the following Earth system domains: climate variability and change, land-atmosphere interactions, global biogeochemical cycles and ecology, hydrological and land surface modelling, drought applications, and meteorology. While in some disciplines the use of ESA CCI SM is already widespread (e.g. in the evaluation of model soil moisture states) in others (e.g. in numerical weather prediction or flood forecasting) it is still in its infancy. The latter is partly related to current shortcomings of the product, e.g., the lack of near-real-time availability and data gaps in time and space. This study discloses the discrepancies between current ESA CCI SM product characteristics and the preferred characteristics of long-term satellite soil moisture products as outlined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), and provides important directions for future ESA CCI SM product improvements to bridge these gaps.

To meet this goal the Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool), a community diagnostics and performance metrics tool for the systematic evaluation of Earth system models (ESMs) in CMIP, has been developed and a first version (1.0) released as open source software in 2015. Here, an enhanced version of the ESMValTool is presented that exploits a subset of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) from the European Space Agency\'s Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) Phase 2 and this version is used to demonstrate the value of the data for model evaluation. This subset includes consistent, long-term time series of ECVs obtained from harmonized, reprocessed products from different satellite instruments for sea surface temperature, sea ice, cloud, soil moisture, land cover, aerosol, ozone, and greenhouse gases. The ESA CCI data allow \'extending the calculation of performance metrics as summary statistics for some variables and add an important alternative data set in other cases where observations are already available. The provision of uncertainty estimates on a per grid basis for the ESA CCI data sets is used in a new extended version of the Taylor diagram and provides important additional information for a more objective evaluation of the models. In our analysis we place a specific focus on the comparability of model and satellite data both in time and space. The ESA CCI data are well suited for an evaluation of results from global climate models across ESM compartments as well as an analysis of long-term trends, variability and change in the context of a changing climate. The enhanced version of the ESMValTool is released as open source software and ready to support routine model evaluation in CMIP6 and at individual modeling centers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, before the launch of SENTINEL-2A, only few decametric products are produced and most of them remain limited by the small number of available observations, mostly due to a moderate revisit frequency combined with cloud occurrence. Conversely, kilometric and hectometric biophysical products are now widely available with almost complete and continuous coverage, but the associated spatial resolution limits the application over heterogeneous landscapes. The objective of this study is to combine unfrequent decametric spatial resolution products with frequent hectometric spatial resolution products to improve the temporal frequency and completeness of decametric observations. The study focuses on the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the green vegetation (FAPAR) because of its important role in canopy models and small dependency to scaling issues.   An algorithm is developed to provide near real time estimates of FAPAR called DHF (for Decametric Hectometric Fusion) at a decametric resolution and dekadal time step. It is assumed that the FAPAR time course is described by a second-degree polynomial function over a limited 60-days temporal window for each decametric pixel. To reduce the dimensionality of the problem, landcover classes are considered instead of each individual pixel. For each class, the coefficients of the polynomial function are adjusted using the temporal course of the available decametric FAPAR products, under the constraint of providing a good match with the time course of the hectometric dekadal FAPAR products. The point spread function associated to the hectometric FAPAR products and the possible biases between the decametric and hectometric FAPAR products are explicitly accounted for.   The algorithm was evaluated over a time series of decametric Landsat-8 FAPAR images (30 m) and hectometric (330 m) dekadal GEOV3 FAPAR derived from PROBA-V images acquired in 2014 over a site in the South-West of France.   Results show that the estimated DHF FAPAR products capture well the expected seasonal variation and spatial distribution while improving the temporal frequency and spatial and temporal completeness of the original Landsat-8 products. A leave one out exercise shows that the DHF values are in very good agreement with the Landsat-8 FAPAR (RMSE = 0.05-0.14) that were not used when computing the DHF. This demonstrates the robustness of the algorithm and interest under cloudy regions. Additional comparison with ground measurements collected over 14 sunflower fields along the growth season confirms the good performances of the DHF FAPAR products (RMSE = 0.11).', '[Li, Wenjuan; Baret, Frederic; Weiss, Marie; Buis, Samuel] INRA, EMMAH, UMR 1114, 228 Route Aerodrome CS 40509, F-84914 Avignon 9, France.

Both empirical and physically-based approaches linking pulse penetration to LAI through gap probability theory have been widely used. We contrasted these approaches using field measurements of LAI (n = 135) acquired in stands of pure Pious radian D. Don in New Zealand. For the empirical approach, we addressed several methodological questions: (1) Identification of important covariates from an extensive list of lidar metrics with empirical or theoretical links to LAI. (2) Evaluation of the impact of lidar plot radius on metric importance and model accuracy by trialling fixed radii and radii based on mean top height (MTH). (3) For ratio metrics, which require selection of a height threshold (HT), identification of the optimum fixed HT and to evaluate a novel variable HT set as a percentage of canopy height. Custom lidar software evaluated all combinations of metric, radius, and HT. For model development, we tested elastic net linear regression for regularisation and variable selection, as well as random forests to explore potential nonlinear relationships and to provide insight into variable importance using conditional importance scores accounting for intercorrelation. For the physically based model, a proxy for vertical canopy gap fraction was sought from ALS metrics measuring pulse penetration for use in a nonlinear model based on the Beer-Lambert law. Empirical models were strongly impacted by calibration and larger plot radii and higher HTs generally reduced RMSE and highlighted a common set of ratio metrics characterising pulse penetration. Elastic net models performed best with the lowest RMSE = 0.57 LAI at radius = 100% of MTH and HT = 20% of canopy height. Models with low RMSE often had radii in the range of canopy height - supporting theoretical links to instrument view distance. The best fixed-radius model (RMSE = 0.64) had radius = 20 m and HT = 20% of canopy height. Random forests results were similar, with little evidence of nonlinear relationships (lowest RMSE = 0.64). Physically-based models produced results close to the best calibrated empirical models (RMSE = 0.72) using a single metric. This approach offered the potential to estimate forest type coefficients that could allow ALS-LAI mapping without the need for calibration and with greater potential for transferability between ALS campaigns. These results support the use of physically-based models for discrete ALS-LAI mapping.', '[Pearse, Grant D.; Morgenroth, Justin] Univ Canterbury, New Zealand Sch Forestry, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.

Alternatively, models including land surface phenology (LSP) metrics derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery capture continuous time-series data describing plant growth and senescence. LSP metrics may better discriminate the vegetation conditions influencing species habitat and distribution. Additionally, applications modeling animal density often use clusters (i.e., groups of individuals) but omit differences in cluster sizes. Ignoring how cluster size varies with landscape characteristics risks misrepresenting the spatial distribution of an animals\' density. Using lesser prairie-chickens (LEPC; Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) as an example, we integrated the spatial distributions of cluster density and cluster size with LSP metrics to better predict its density in Texas, USA. We modeled LEPC cluster density using hierarchical distance sampling and cluster size with zero-truncated generalized linear modeling. Variables included landcover categories, LSP metrics, human infrastructure and topography. Models incorporating LSP metrics received most support and identified conservation areas that landcover models missed. Cluster density associated with LSP metrics, road density, oil and gas well density, topography, and grassland to shrubland ratio. Cluster size associated with topography and LSP metrics. Omitting the spatial distribution of cluster size underestimated LEPC density. Our approach generates geospatial predictions for prioritizing LEPC protection, habitat restoration, and evaluating impacts from development or phenological change. This study demonstrates the utility of integrating LSP metrics, cluster density and cluster size for predicting species density across large and heterogeneous landscapes.

Although previous studies have examined the post-fire vegetation recovery at landscape and regional levels, the lack of continent-wide analysis limits our understanding of fire effect on vegetation recovery across ecoregions and climate zones. With advanced technology in satellite observations as well as large-scale database development, it is possible for us to explore the large-scale effect of concurrent and lagged responses of terrestrial ecosystems to fire disturbances. In this study, we investigated the recovery of vegetation greenness in the early post-fire period in North America by integrating two national-level fire perimeter datasets and multiple Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. We developed a new algorithm to estimate fire effect on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) by comparing fire pixels with their surrounding unburned pixels. Our results showed the fire effect on needleleaf trees was stronger than on other vegetation types, and the high-latitude ecoregions had larger NDVI reduction and longer recovery time than the mid-latitude ecoregions. We also found the variations in vegetation composition and fire severity can explain a large fraction of post-fire vegetation greenness recovery. Our satellite-based analysis showed a longer NDVI recovery time than the existing estimates, which indicates a stronger fire effect on ecosystems than previously thought. Findings in this study indicate that more sophisticated parameterization schemes of fire severity and post-fire vegetation recovery are needed for the vegetation-fire models to better simulate the terrestrial carbon cycling and climate-ecosystem feedbacks.', '[Yang, Jia; Pan, Shufen; Dangal, Shree; Zhang, Bowen; Wang, Siyuan; Tian, Hanqin] Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Int Ctr Climate & Global Change Res, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.

Results show good correspondence between the modeled snow thickness and remotely sensed dates of melt onset and pond onset. The mean snowmelt duration for 20 study sites is 24.6 +/- 1.2 days, and the estimated mean snow thickness is 14.7 +/- 3.0 cm. The overall performance of the model reveals a RMSE of 4.0 cm and a mean bias of 0.3 cm.

Conversely to concurrent methods, the temperature emissivity separation (TES) method simply requires single overpass without any ancillary information. This is possible since TES makes use of an empirical relationship that estimates the minimum emissivity epsilon-min from the emissivity spectral contrast captured over several channels, so-called maximum-minimum difference (MMD). In previous studies, the epsilon-min-MMD empirical relationship of TES was calibrated and validated for various sensor spectral configurations, where the proposed calibrations involved single or linearly mixed spectra of emissivity at the leaf or soil level. However, cavity effect should be taken into account at the vegetation canopy level, to avoid an underestimation of emissivity, especially for intermediate vegetation conditions between bare soil and full vegetation cover.   The current study aimed to evaluate the performances of the TES method when applied to vegetation canopies with cavity effect. We used the SAIL-Thermique model to simulate a library of emissivity spectra for a wide range of soil and plant conditions, and we addressed the spectral configurations of recent and forthcoming sensors. We obtained good results for calibration and validation over the simulated library, except for full cover canopies because of the TES gray body problem. Consistent with previous studies, the calibration/validation results were better with more channels that capture emissivity spectral contrast more efficiently. Our TES calibrations provided larger epsilon-min values as compared to former studies, especially for intermediate vegetation cover. We explained this trend by the simulated spectral library that involved numerous vegetation canopies with cavity effect, thereby shifting up the epsilon-min-MMD empirical relationship. Consequently, our TES calibration provided larger (respectively lower) estimates of emissivity (respectively radiometric temperature) that were likely to be more realistic as compared to previous calibrations. Finally, SAIL-Thermique simulations permitted to show that increasing Leaf Area Index induced a displacement of the (epsilon-min, MMD) pairs along the empirical relationship. This was consistent with the TES underlying assumption, where any change in epsilon-min induces changes in MMD since epsilon-max is bounded on [0.98-1]. Further investigations should focus on validating the outcomes of the current study against ground-based measurements, and on assessing TES performances when accounting for instrumental and atmospheric perturbations.

This effort demonstrates for the first time a successful retrieval of both water color (i.e., R-rs) and Chl in a nearshore environment from UAV hyperspectral measurements, which advocates the use of UAVs for rapid assessment of water quality, especially for nearshore or difficult-to-reach waters, due to its flexibility, low cost, high spatial resolution, and sound accuracy.

This is in part due to the coarse spatial and temporal resolution of the data on which these models are based, but also because the processes and mechanisms of aeolian dust emission are not well understood. Satellite imagery has been used extensively in the study of dust from the late 1990s with important contributions being made in terms of sources, transport pathways and deposition areas. Using MODIS imagery, the Namib Desert has been identified as one of the largest sources of dust in southem Africa. The opening of the Landsat archive presents the opportunity to investigate these events at a higher spatial resolution (up to 15 x 15 m) than previously possible. Despite the low temporal resolution, we used Landsat imagery to identify 40 major dust episodes over the last 25 years that originated primarily from the ephemeral river valleys and pan complexes, providing new insight into the spatial and temporal evolution of the dust sources from dryland surfaces. Examination of the imagery enabled the identification of local-scale landform source points to direct ground based testing of the surfaces responsible for dust emission. Emissivity tests were undertaken using a PI-SWERL portable wind tunnel in three of the major dust producing river systems along the Namib coast, namely the Kuiseb, Omaruru and Huab Rivers. Preliminary observations suggest that human impact on the hydrological systems in two of the river basins, to cater for the increasing demand of water, have dramatically altered the emission patterns of dust. The source areas of greatest dust emission are found to be located on recently deposited fluvial surfaces which are not active in the contemporary environment.

Such pixel selection is typically done manually, which makes it labor intensive to apply SEBAL or METRIC over large spatial areas or long time series. In this paper, we introduce a new automated approach that uses an exhaustive search algorithm (ESA) to identify endmember pixels for use in these models. The fully automated models were applied on 134 near cloud-free Landsat images with each image covering one of four flux measurement sites covering a distinct land cover type in humid Florida or relatively drier Oklahoma. Observed land surface temperatures (T-s) at automatically identified hot and cold pixels were within 0.25% of manually identified pixels (both coefficient of determination, R-2, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE, >= 0.98, and root mean squared error, RMSE, <= 1.31 K). The new fully automated model performed better and demonstrated better consistency than an existing semi-automated method that used a statistical approach to subset coldest and hottest pixels within an image. Daily ET estimates derived from the automated SEBAL and METRIC models were in good agreement with their manual counterparts (e.g., NSE >= 0.94 and RMSE <= 0.35 mm day(-1)). Automated and manual pixel selection resulted in similar estimates of observed ET across all sites. The proposed automated pixel selection approach greatly reduces time demands (e.g. approximately one image per hour vs. hundreds of image per hour) for applying SEBAL and METRIC and allows for their more widespread and frequent use. This automation can also reduce potential bias introduced by an inexperienced operator and extends the domain of the models to new users. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Different from traditional method the approach presented here can perform simultaneous retrieval from each individual AATSR swath rather than multiple days. A theoretical sensitivity study proves the proposed method is insensitive to the distortion of initial BRDF. The presented algorithm is tested on AATSR data around four different Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites representing various types of land surface. Compared with the four selected AERONET sites\' AOD and BRDF-derived albedo from AERONET-based Surface Reflectance Validation Network (ASRVN) data in corresponding four AERONET sites, the presented algorithm proves considerable accuracy for various type of land surface with correlation of AOD ranging from 0.647 to 0.911 and correlation of BRDF-derived albedo ranging from 0.483 to 0.944. The intersensor comparison with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 3 km AOD dark target product reveals high coverage rate of the presented method especially in bright surface or nonvegetation area and the correlation between the two sensors reaches up to 0.967. The improved estimation of BRDF from AATSR retrieval in AERONET Beijing site is compared with MODIS MCD43B1 product.

Yet, most research on EA drought focuses on meteorological aspects with little attention paid on agricultural drought impacts. The inadequacy of in-situ rainfall data across EA has also hampered detailed agricultural drought impact analysis. Recently, however, there has been increased data availability from remote sensing (rainfall, vegetation condition index - VCI, terrestrial water storage - TWS), reanalysis (soil moisture and TWS), and land surface models (soil moisture). Here, these products were employed to characterise EA droughts between 1983 and 2013 in terms of severity, duration, and spatial extent. Furthermore, the capability of these products to capture agricultural drought impacts was assessed using maize and wheat production data. Our results show that while all products were similar in drought characterisation in dry areas, the similarity of CHIRPS and GPCC extended over the whole EA. CHIRPS and GPCC also identified the highest proportion of areas under drought followed closely by soil moisture products whereas VCI had the least coverage. Drought onset was marked first by a decline/lack of rainfall, followed by VCl/soil moisture, and then TWS. VCI indicated drought lag at 0-4 months following rainfall while soil moisture and TWS products had variable lags vis-a-vis rainfall. GLDAS mischaracterized the 2005-2006 drought vis-a-vis other soil moisture products. Based on the annual crop production variabilities explained, we identified CHIRPS, GPCC, FLDAS, and VCI as suitable for agricultural drought monitoring/characterization in the region for the study period. Finally, GLDAS explained the lowest percentages of the Kenyan and Ugandan annual crop production variances. These findings are important for the gauge data deficient EA region as they provide alternatives for monitoring agricultural drought. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Agutu, N.

In 2011, leaf-off dedicated airborne LiDAR data were collected in a 20,000 ha inland patchy area which was representative of soil land use in the Apennines mountains of southern Italy. By combining field and LiDAR data in 5574 ha of forests with coexisting evergreen and deciduous species, we modelled common forest stand variables (height, diameter, volume and biomass) with high accuracy (0.60 <= Adj.R-2 <= 0.89). Moreover, a moderate correlation (0.425 <= tau <= 0.462) between field- and LiDAR-derived diversity indices was found. About 3393 ha of forests are enclosed in protected areas of the Natura 2000 network, which in turn possesses 77% (similar to 576,286 Mg) of total aboveground dry biomass. Overall, eight forest types were identified, one of which, the European beech, is only found in the Natura 2000 sites, while other forest types are also found elsewhere. This is the first study to undertake a LiDAR analysis of Mediterranean forests in the Campania Region and might help better evaluate trade-off, especially in protected areas, in order to enhance multiple benefits and support sustainable management of forests.

One key focus area for the application of ALS data is the assessment of riparian ecosystems, due to their critical role for providing, regulating and supporting important ecosystem services. ALS data provide detailed and accurate digital terrain models (DTMs) under forest canopy, which in turn enable the characterization of detailed stream networks, stream properties, and associated vegetation characteristics in adjacent riparian ecotones. In a complex Pacific Northwest coastal forest, we demonstrate how ALS point clouds can be used to map a stream network and characterize stream properties including stream order, width, gradient, sinuosity, and solar shading. Of relevance to regulatory and sustainability related elements of forest management, we demonstrate the use of these data to identify stream classes and related riparian zones, as well as the fish-bearing potential of the stream. The total length of identified streams was 6421.8 km, of which 55% were of the lowest order streams. The median stream gradient was 16.4% with median stream width varying between 0.58 and 19.67 m for the smallest to largest streams respectively. Stream class and fish bearing potential were evaluated using independent data, with overall accuracies of 61.0% for stream class and 82.9% for fish-bearing potential. The median of stand height, canopy cover, and stand vertical variability within riparian management areas was 19.8 m, 88.6%, and 68%, respectively, and in general did not vary across stream orders. The majority of streams (74.4%) were not accessible for anadromous fish. For fish-bearing streams, we found that only 0.2% had a mean stand height <2 m, while 2.4% had canopy cover of <20%, and only 7.3% received <10 h of shade. The ALS data thus enabled a holistic characterization of riparian ecotones, providing useful information on both stream and vegetation properties that can support sustainable forest management, inform on erosion risk, and become a foundation for the quantification of ecosystem goods and services.

The classification methods presented are k-nearest neighbours, multinomial regression, and support vector machine based approaches. Three mainly single-species forest plots of Silver birch, Scots pine and Norway spruce, and two mixed-species forest plots located in Finland and a total number of trees over 1200 were used for demonstration. The results show that by using single species forest plots for training and testing, it is possible to find a feature combination between 5 and 15 features, that results in an average classification accuracy above 93% for all the methods. For the preliminary mixed-species forest plot testing, accuracy was lower but the classification approach presented potential to generalize to more diverse cases. Moreover, the results show that the post-processing of terrestrial laser scanning data of multi-hectare forest, from tree extraction and modelling to species classification, can be done automatically.

However, when the true deformation vector differs from the satellite line-of-sight (LOS), the sensitivity decreases and interpretation of InSAR deformation measurements becomes challenging. By combining displacement data from extensive ascending and descending TerraSAR-X datasets collected during the summer seasons of 2009-2014, we estimate two-dimensional (2D) InSAR surface displacement. Displacement data are decomposed into vertical and west/east deformation, dip and combined deformation vector, and validated using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data. We use the decomposed dataset to visualize variations in surface velocity and direction on unstable slopes in a periglacial environment with sporadic permafrost in northern Norway. By identifying areas with uplift and subsidence, and detecting velocity changes (down slope acceleration/deceleration) and related areas of extension and compression, we are able to explain driving and controlling mechanisms and geomorphology in two rockslides and one area with solifluction landforms.

However, due to the inherent constraints of in situ sampling and the short time period covered by modem space borne sensors, few long-term records exist. Historical data from sensors such as Landsat offer strong potential for creating new records of past blooms. Here, we use a novel evaluation procedure based on multiple metrics to assess algorithm suitability and robustness for generating long-term bloom records using Landsat 5 imagery. Evaluation metrics are based on bloom presence, spatial distribution, magnitude and timing, using both in situ Microcystis biovolume and remotely-sensed Cyanobacterial Index (CI) data from MERIS for 2002-2011. Applying this procedure for a test case focusing on Lake Erie\'s western basin, an algorithm based on a near infrared threshold with simple atmospheric correction through subtraction of the shortwave infrared band, combined with an additional \"greenness\" filter based on a hue threshold, performs best. Implementing this algorithm for 1984-2001 reveals the long-term trends in peak bloom magnitude prior to the start of the MERIS and MODIS record (2002-2015), and more than doubles the period of record that can be used to understand bloom occurrence and growth for this system. More broadly, we demonstrate that Landsat observations can be used to identify macro-scale features of blooms. For Lake Erie, the performance of the final Landsat algorithm is comparable to that of the MERIS CI algorithm, despite Landsat\'s broad spectral bands and long revisit time. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Here, per-pixel accuracy prediction methods are proposed based on interpolating accuracy values from a test sample in which the reference class of each sampled pixel has been determined. Different accuracy prediction methods were developed based on four factors: predictive domain (spatial versus spectral), interpolation function (constant, linear, Gaussian, and logistic), incorporation of class information (interpolating each class separately versus grouping them together), and sample size. Developing accuracy maps using the spectral domain is a new approach in contrast to previous efforts based on the spatial domain. Performance of the prediction methods was evaluated using 26 test blocks, with 10 km x 10 km dimensions, dispersed throughout the United States. Each block had complete coverage reference data manually extracted by interpreters and a land-cover map produced from Landsat imagery using a decision tree classification. The full scene maps were then compared to the corresponding reference maps to produce complete coverage accuracy information for each block. The predicted accuracy maps were produced from a sample of the reference data (i.e., the test dataset). The performance of the sample-based accuracy predictions was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic. Relative to existing accuracy prediction methods, our proposed methods resulted in improvements of AUC of 0.15 or greater. Evaluation of the four factors comprising the accuracy prediction methods demonstrated that: i) interpolations should be done separately for each class instead of grouping all classes together; ii) if an all-classes approach is used, the spectral domain will result in substantially greater AUC than the spatial domain; iii) for the smaller sample size and per-class predictions, the spectral and spatial domain yielded similar AUC; iv) for the larger sample size (i.e., very dense spatial sample) and per-class predictions, the spatial domain yielded larger AUC; v) increasing the sample size improved accuracy predictions with a greater benefit accruing to the spatial domain; and vi) the function used for interpolation had the smallest effect on AUC. To conclude, the ability to produce per-pixel accuracy predictions yielding simple to understand accuracy maps opens up new possibilities for error propagation of remotely sensed products in a variety of disciplines.

However, a comprehensive understanding of the structure and function of oceanic ecosystems requires the characterization of the spatio-temporal variability of various phytoplankton functional types (PFTs), which have differing biogeochemical roles. Thus, recent bio-optical algorithm developments have focused on retrieval of various PFTs. It is important to validate and inter-compare the existing PFT algorithms; however direct comparison of retrieved variables is non-trivial because in those algorithms PFTs are defined differently. Thus, it is more plausible and potentially more informative to focus on emergent properties of PFTs, such as phonology. Furthermore, ocean color satellite PFT data sets can play a pivotal role in informing and/or validating the biogeochemical routines of Earth System Models. Here, the phenological characteristics of 10 PFT satellite algorithms and 7 latest-generation climate models from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIPS) are inter compared as part of the International Satellite PFT Algorithm Inter-comparison Project. The comparison is based on monthly satellite data (mostly SeaWiFS) for the 2003-2007 period. The phonological analysis is based on the fraction of microplankton or a similar variable for the satellite algorithms and on the carbon biomass due to diatoms for the climate models. The seasonal cycle is estimated on a per-pixel basis as a sum of sinusoidal harmonics, derived from the Discrete Fourier Transform of the variable time series. Peak analysis is then applied to the estimated seasonal signal and the following phenological parameters are quantified for each satellite algorithm and climate model: seasonal amplitude, percent seasonal variance, month of maximum, and bloom duration. Secondary/double blooms occur in many areas and are also quantified. The algorithms and the models are quantitatively compared based on these emergent phenological parameters. Results indicate that while algorithms agree to a first order on a global scale, large differences among them exist; differences are analyzed in detail for two Longhurst regions in the North Atlantic: North Atlantic Drift Region (NADR) and North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre West (NASW). Seasonal cycles explain the most variance in zonal bands in the seasonally-stratified subtropics at about 30 latitude in the satellite PFT data. The CMIP5 models do not reproduce this pattern, exhibiting higher seasonality in mid and high-latitudes and generally much more spatially homogeneous patterns in phenological indices compared to satellite data. Satellite data indicate a complex structure of double blooms in the Equatorial region and mid-latitudes, and single blooms on the poleward edges of the subtropical gyres. In contrast, the CMIP5 models show single annual blooms over most of the ocean except for the Equatorial band and Arabian Sea. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Settlements of this order of magnitude are sufficient to pose a potential threat to the integrity of any large concrete structure such as arch dams located above the tunnel and an accurate survey of surface deformation before, during and after construction is of high importance. We present the spatial and temporal evolution of surface subsidence measured with satellite SAR interferometry associated with the construction of the 57 km long Gotthard Base Tunnel in Switzerland. Significant deformations of 1 to 12 mm/year were detected between 2003 and 2010 with ENVISATASAR data above the tunnel on villages and sparsely vegetated alpine slopes where no displacement was recorded between 1992 and 2000 with ERS-1/2 SAR data. Our results, available also for sectors where there is no information from any other surveying technique, are important not only to assess the hazard posed on any large concrete structure but also for the development and calibration of numerical models - to be employed to simulate the expected surface deformation before and during the construction works - and to study the effect of groundwater drainage on the dynamic of large deep-seated landslides.

This study generalizes such results for vegetation canopies composed of one or more types of phytoelements and with a reflective background surface also composed of one or more materials, all of which are treated as endmembers of a nonlinear spectral mixture. The conservative radiation field of a canopy is represented by a finite state Markov chain, such that for a vegetation-surface medium composed of m endmembers, the model is thereby parameterized in terms of an m-length vector of endmember interceptances and an mth-order square matrix containing probabilities of photon recollision amongst the endmembers. Comparisons of some instances of the model with radiative transfer based approximations showed how the latter may overestimate canopy reflectance and transmittance. The two-endmembers model was also compared with Monte Carlo simulations for spherically-oriented leaf canopies with reflective soil. Results indicated that the analytical model accurately describes the radiation field for a wide range of soil reflectance and LAI values. Simulations also showed that while the zenith angle of the illumination source has a small influence on the recollision probabilities, the LAI value mainly determines these through distinct functional relationships. The application of the model to estimate the canopy radiation field of two coniferous species located on the Mexico City Conservation Land is also demonstrated using airborne hyperspectral measurements.

It is as yet unclear if instrumental improvements in AMSR2 over AMSR-E have led to better soil moisture (SM) estimates, especially since there is no overlapping period of data between the sensors. This study focuses on comparing the results of AMSR2 and AMSR-E SM over Australia, distinguishing four Koppen climate zones to determine if AMSR2 is better than AMSR-E. This is achieved by selecting two year-long comparative time periods from the operating periods of AMSR-E and AMSR2, based on their statistical similarities in modeled SM as a proxy, using Modem Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications-Land (MERRAL). The AMSR2 and AMSR-E C- and X-band SM derived from the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) was evaluated. Both AMSR2 C- and X-band SM products were found to show similar temporal patterns and spatial agreement with AMSR-E C- and X-band SM, supported by unbiased root mean square difference (ubRMSD) and R-values with MERRA-L SM, respectively. Using lag-based instrumental variable analysis to estimate the random error component of SM retrievals, the noise-to-signal ratios in AMSR2 X-band SM were found to be slightly higher than their AMSR-E counterparts. The improvements in AMSR2, such as the superior radiometric sensitivity and spatial resolution, have therefore not led to statistically significant differences in performance for LPRM retrievals at 1/2 degrees x 1/2 degrees grid resolution, when compared with AMSR-E. However, similarities in the metrics for AMSR2 and AMSR-E SM suggest that AMSR2 provides a valuable continuation to AMSR-E. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A PS standard deviation of 0.91 cm/year was achieved in the vertical direction, according to calculation from two independent PS results.

For this objective, daily images of satellite chlorophyll were obtained from 2002 to 2013. Monthly means were calculated for each pixel and then the pixels were grouped by means of the statistical technique of non-hierarchical clustering analysis according to the features of their annual cycle. The outcome of the clustering analysis was validated by comparing the pixel grouping patterns with the spatial distribution of in situ chlorophyll a and nutrients as determined from the available data (about 2900 registers obtained in the 20 m upper seawater layer in 70 sampling stations). Six grouping areas were identified which reproduced the expected zonation according to the distribution of the main mesoscale hydrological structures that modulate the productivity in the study area (oligotrophic gyres and coastal upwelling). The grouping areas presented contrasting chlorophyll a concentrations as well as annual minimum and maximum occurring at different seasonal cycle timing. Seasonal means of in situ chlorophyll a and nitrate and phosphate concentrations calculated for the six grouping areas were significantly correlated, supporting that dissolved inorganic nutrients were the main factor controlling the productivity in the Alboran Sea. Consequently, the grouping of pixels based on satellite data reflected reasonably the underlying mechanisms that control the phytoplankton biomass in the study area. The utility of this technique to define spatial units for eutrophication management is discussed. These units can be used for spatial aggregation of eutrophication indicator data collected from in situ samplings as well as for calculating robust reference values and time trends. Furthermore, the pixel grouping is useful for optimizing the existing monitoring programs as it facilitates the selection and location of sampling stations in order to avoid collection of redundant and/or pointless information.

Water use estimates in the Colorado River Basin (CRB), which has diverse ecosystems and complex hydro-climatic regions, will be helpful to water planners and managers. Availability of Landsat 8 images, starting in 2013, provides the opportunity to map ET in the CRB to assess spatial distribution and patterns of water use. The Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model was used with 528 Landsat 8 images to create seamless monthly and annual ET estimates at the inherent 100 m thermal band resolution. Annual ET values were summarized by land use/land cover classes. Croplands were the largest consumer of \"blue\" water while shrublands consumed the most \"green\" water. Validation using eddy covariance (EC) flux towers and water balance approaches showed good accuracy levels with R-2 ranging from 0.74 to 0.95 and the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient ranging from 0.66 to 0.91. The root mean square error (and percent bias) ranged from 0.48 mm (13%) to 0.60 mm (22%) for daily (days of satellite overpass) ET and from 7.75 mm (2%) to 13.04 mm (35%) for monthly ET. The spatial and temporal distribution of ET indicates the utility of Landsat 8 for providing important information about ET dynamics across the landscape. Annual crop water use was estimated for five selected irrigation districts in the Lower CRB where annual ET per district ranged between 681 mm to 772 mm. Annual ET by crop type over the Maricopa Stanfield irrigation district ranged from a low of 384 mm for durum wheat to a high of 990 mm for alfalfa fields. A rainfall analysis over the five districts suggested that, on average, 69% of the annual ET was met by irrigation. Although the enhanced cloud-masking capability of Landsat 8 based on the cirrus band and utilization of the Fmask algorithm improved the removal of contaminated pixels, the ability to reliably estimate ET over clouded areas remains an important challenge. Overall, the performance of Landsat 8 based ET compared to available EC datasets and water balance estimates for a complex basin such as the CRB demonstrates the potential of using Landsat 8 for annual water use estimation at a national scale. Future efforts will focus on (a) use of consistent methodology across years, (b) integration of multiple sensors to maximize images used, and (c) employing cloud-computing platforms for large scale processing capabilities.

However, the increasing frequency of fires in most European Mediterranean countries is challenging the natural regrowth capability of these ecosystems. In this context, monitoring post-fire vegetation recovery is a priority for forest management and soil erosion control. In this work, a 13-year series (1999-2011) of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM)/Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM +) data was used to model post-fire vegetation recovery as a function of burn severity and to quantify post-fire resilience as a measure of vegetation cover regrowth. We evaluated a large forest fire located in Spain that burned approximately 30 km(2) of Pinus pinaster Ait. in August 1998.88 field plots of four burn severity levels (unburned, low, moderate and high) were measured in the field a year after the fire. As a variable representative of vegetation, we chose the shade normalized green vegetation fraction image (SGV) obtained by applying Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) to the original Landsat TM/ETM + images. The SGV values were extracted for the 88 field plots and, after performing a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), a Fisher\'s Least Significant Difference (LSD) test allowed us to estimate resilience of vegetation cover as the number of post-fire years exhibiting a statistically significant difference between burned and unburned areas. Next, SGV values were referenced to unburned control plots values and the vegetation recovery index (VRI) was defined. The evolution in time curve of VRI for low, moderate and highly fire affected vegetation was fit using trend models (specifically, an exponential trend for VRI in high and moderate burn severity levels; a linear trend for low burn severity level, Root Mean Square Error, RMSE = 0.18, 0.13, and 0.09, respectively). We observed that vegetation cover affected by low severity fire recovered to its original state after 7 years, and vegetation cover affected by moderate severity recovered after 13 years. Vegetation affected by high severity fire was estimated to recover after 20 years. We conclude that VRI time series based on multi-temporal MESMA fractions from Landsat data can be considered a valuable indicator of the post-fire vegetation cover recovery. Its temporal evolution represented post-fire vegetation cover regrowth adequately and facilitated the estimate of vegetation cover resilience in Mediterranean forests. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, due to their scattered distribution, quantifying and monitoring woody cover over space and time is challenging. We develop a phenology driven model and train/validate MODIS (MCD43A4, 500 m) derived metrics with 178 ground observations from Niger, Senegal and Mali to estimate woody cover trends from 2000 to 2014 over the entire Sahel. The annual woody cover estimation at 500 m scale is fairly accurate with an RMSE of 4.3 (woody cover %) and r(2) = 0.74. Over the 15 year period we observed an average increase of 1.7 (+/- 5.0) woody cover (%) with large spatial differences: No clear change can be observed in densely populated areas (0.2 +/- 4.2), whereas a positive change is seen in sparsely populated areas (2.1 +/- 5.2). Woody cover is generally stable in cropland areas (0.9 +/- 4.6), reflecting the protective management of parkland trees by the farmers. Positive changes are observed in savannas (2.5 +/- 5.4) and woodland areas (3.9 +/- 7.3). The major pattern of woody cover change reveals strong increases in the sparsely populated Sahel zones of eastern Senegal, western Mali and central Chad, but a decreasing trend is observed in the densely populated western parts of Senegal, northern Nigeria, Sudan and southwestern Niger. This decrease is often local and limited to woodlands, being an indication of ongoing expansion of cultivated areas and selective logging. We show that an overall positive trend is found in areas of low anthropogenic pressure demonstrating the potential of these ecosystems to provide services such as carbon storage, if not over-utilized. Taken together, our results provide an unprecedented synthesis of woody cover dynamics in the Sahel, and point to land use and human population density as important drivers, however only partially and locally offsetting a general post-drought increase.

The relationship between surface PM2.5 and column integrated AOD is found associated with vertical and size distribution of aerosols. In this study, a non-linear regression model combining AOD and near surface backscatter for estimation of PM2.5 is developed and tested based on 6 years ground measurements from HUBC (Howard University Beltsville Campus) facility. Overall, the non-linear model explains similar to 60% of the variability in hourly PM2.5. The RMSE (root-mean-square error) is similar to 5.83 mu g/m(3) with a corresponding average PM2.5 of 15.43 mu g/m(3). That is a big improvement to the linear model using AOD alone (similar to 40% of the variability, RMSE is similar to 7.14 mu g/m(3)). The ceilometer measured near surface backscatter is found to improve the estimation of PM2.5-AOD relationship the most compared to other factors, such as aerosol size indicator, surface temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and pressure especially when AOD is large (AOD >= 0.3). As aerosol size indicator, two Angstrom exponents are calculated by AOD at three wavelengths of 415, 500, 860 nm and are found also important to the PM2.5-AOD relationship. In addition to the HUBC site, the model is tested based on the 4 years (2012 to 2015) measurements from ARM SGP site and the nearest EPA site. The results also show the significant role of the ceilometer measured near surface backscatter on improving estimation of PM2.5. This study illustrated the potential of ceilometer on investigation of air pollution. With broad ceilometer network, ground-level particle concentrations can be better determined.

SLW clouds are common over the Southern Ocean, and climate-induced changes in their occurrence is thought to constitute a strong cloud feedback on global climate. The two recent NASA field campaigns POlarimeter Definition EXperiment (PODEX, based in Palmdale, California, January-February 2013) and Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS, based in Houston, Texas in August September 2013) provided a unique opportunity to observe SLW clouds from the high-altitude airborne platform of NASA\'s ER-2 aircraft. We present an analysis of measurements made by the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) during these experiments accompanied by correlative retrievals from other sensors. The RSP measures both polarized and total reflectance in 9 spectral channels with wavelengths ranging from 410 to 2250 nm. It is a scanning sensor taking samples at 0.8 degrees intervals within 60 degrees from nadir in both forward and backward directions. This unique angular resolution allows for characterization of liquid water droplet size using the rainbow structure observed in the polarized reflectances in the scattering angle range between 135 degrees and 165 degrees. Simple parametric fitting algorithms applied to the polarized reflectance provide retrievals of the droplet effective radius and variance assuming a prescribed size distribution shape (gamma distribution). In addition to this, we use a non-parametric method, Rainbow Fourier Transform (RFT), which allows retrieval of the droplet size distribution without assuming a size distribution shape. We present an overview of the RSP campaign datasets available from the NASA GISS website, as well as two detailed examples of the retrievals. In these case studies we focus on cloud fields with spatial features varying between glaciated and liquid phases at altitudes as high as 10 km, which correspond to temperatures close to the homogeneous freezing temperature of pure water drops (about-35 degrees C or colder). The multimodal droplet size distributions retrieved from RSP data in these cases are consistent with the multi-layer cloud structure observed by correlative Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL) measurements.

DINEOF allows reconstructing missing data using a truncated EOF basis, while reducing the amount of noise and errors in geophysical datasets. This work represents a first application of DINEOF to SMOS SSS. Results show that a reduction of the error and the amount of noise is obtained in the DINEOF SSS data compared to the initial SMOS SSS data. Errors associated to the edge of the swath are detected in 2 EOFs and effectively removed from the final data, avoiding removing the data at the edges of the swath in the initial dataset. The final dataset presents a centered root mean square error of 0.2 in open waters when comparing with thermosalinograph data at their original spatial and temporal resolution. Constant biases present near land masses, large scale biases and latitudinal biases cannot be corrected with DINEOF because persistent signals are retained in high order EOFs, and therefore these need to be corrected separately. The signature of the Douro and Gironde rivers is detected in the DINEOF SSS. The minimum SSS observed in the Gironde plume corresponds to a flood event in June 2013, and the shape and size of the Douro river shows a good agreement with chlorophyll-a satellite data. These examples show the capacity of DINEOF to remove noise and provide a full SSS dataset at a high temporal and spatial resolution with reduced error, and the possibility to retrieve physical signals in zones with high initial errors.

The main goal of this paper is to quantify the contribution of systematic errors close to and away from land by examining the statistics of SMOS minus interpolated fields of in situ SSS before and after removal of climatological mean fields. Using interpolated fields of in situ SSS as reference, we find that the precision of monthly SMOS SSS anomalies, SSSANO, relative to a SMOS SSS monthly climatology computed over four years between 45 degrees N and 45 degrees S is 30% better than the one of SSS when considering pixels further than 1000 km from the coast. This improvement reaches 40% when all pixels are included. At 1600 km from the coast, the standard deviation of the difference between SMOS SSS and in situ interpolated fields is 0.15. These very encouraging results show that it is possible to correct part of the systematic errors in SMOS SSS from the SMOS SSS themselves, pending improvements in SMOS reconstructed brightness temperatures resulting from improved calibration and image reconstruction processes. The largest SSS anomalies are observed in the tropical Indian Ocean as related to Indian Ocean Dipole and in the tropical Pacific Ocean where latitudinal migration of the SSS minimum in the South Pacific Convergence Zone is related to El Nino Southern Oscillation phases and where strong SSS anomalies are observed in the Intertropical Convergence Zone during positive phases of ENSO in early 2010 and in late 2014, early 2015.

The methodology is based on earlier empirical and theoretical studies of L-band emission properties of freezing and thawing soils. We expand a method originally developed for soil freeze thaw (F/T) state detection from L-band tower based observations to satellite scale, applying observations from the European Space Agency\'s Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. The developed algorithm is based on first establishing spatially variable thresholds for L-band brightness temperatures representing frozen and thawed states of soil, and comparing these to current values of different indicators of soil freezing, calculated based on observed brightness temperature at different polarizations and incidence angles. An exponential relation between the freezing indicators and the depth of soil frost is developed based on a large amount of manual soil frost tube observations across Finland. An additional processing filter based on observed physical temperature and snow cover information is used to flag obvious F/T detection errors. The estimated soil F/F-states provided in this study are limited to the autumn freezing period, as melting snow in spring effectively prevents acquisition of information from the soil surface using microwaves for large areas in Northern latitudes. The F/T estimate is produced as daily information and provided in the equal-area scalable Earth (EASE) grid. Soil F/T-state is categorized into three discrete levels: \'frozen\', \'partially frozen\', and \'thawed\', and accompanied with a quality data matrix estimating the data reliability for each freezing season separately. Comparisons to in situ data were conducted at 10 different locations in Finland, Northern America and Siberia. These comparison results indicate that the onset of autumn soil freezing can be estimated from SMOS observations to within 1 to 14 days, depending on the freezing indicator applied and the in situ data used in comparison. Although the initial results are encouraging, more comprehensive assessment of SMOS based soil F/T estimates still requires further comparison to other reference sites, particularly to sites with measurements available for all locally representative land cover types, as well as other satellite-based soil freezing products.

Four current (EO-1 ALI and Hyperion, Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI) and three forthcoming (EnMAP, PRISMA and HyspIRI) satellite imagers were compared. To this aim, two soil spectra datasets that simulated each imager were obtained: (i) resampled spectra according to the specific spectral response and resolution of each satellite imager and (ii) resampled spectra with declared or actual noise (radiometric and atmospheric) added. Compared with those using full spectral resolution data, the accuracy of Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) predictive models generally decreased when using resampled spectra. In the absence of noise, the performances of hyperspectral imagers, in terms of Ratio of Performance to Interquartile Range (RPIQ), were generally significantly better than those of multispectral imagers. For instance the best RPIQ for sand estimation was obtained using EnMAP simulated data (2.56), whereas the outcomes gained using multispectral imagers varied from 1.56 and 2.28. The addition of noise to the simulated spectra brought about a decrease of statistical accuracy in all estimation models, especially for Hyperion data. Although the addition of noise reduced the performance differences between multispectral and hyperspectral imagers, the forthcoming hyperspectral imagers nonetheless provided the best RPIQ values for clay (2.16-233), sand (2.10-2.17), silt (2.77-2.85) and organic carbon (2.48-2.51) estimation. To better understand the impact of spectral resolution and signal to noise ratio (SNR) on the estimation of soil var iables, PLSR models were applied to resampled and simulated spectra, iteratively increasing the bandwidth to: 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 nm. Results showed that, for a bandwidth of 40 nm, i.e., a spectral resolution lower than that of current and forthcoming imagers, the estimation accuracy was very similar to that obtained with a higher spectral resolution.   Forthcoming hyperspectral imagers will therefore improve the accuracy of soil variables estimation from bare soil imagery with respect to the results achievable by current hyperspectral and multispectral imagers, however this improvement is still too limited, to allow an accurate quantitative estimation of soil texture and SOC. This work provides useful indications about what could be expected, for the estimation of the most important soil variables, from the next generation of hyperspectral satellite imagers.

Extending an established procedure for deriving annual, fractional estimates of impervious surface cover (ISC) from per-pixel Landsat composites, here we propose a new post classification methodology that characterizes ISC change as a continuous field in space and time. The method statistically derives the magnitude, timing and duration of ISC change at a per-pixel basis. We applied the method to a series of ISC maps of the Washington DC-Baltimore metropolitan region at an annual resolution from 1984 to 2010 to analyze the spatial, temporal and thematic patterns of urban/suburban land development. Our method was highly reliable for detecting and characterizing change, with producer\'s accuracy of the change-year classes (timing layer) varying between 59.4% and 97.4% and user\'s accuracy varying between 54.7% and 91.7%, based on a sample of independent validation points. Most misclassifications were found between neighboring years; relaxing the estimated change-year to +/- 1 year increased both producer\'s and user\'s accuracy to >80%. The derived change products showed that newly developed pixels on average had a 46% increase in ISC, with the majority (80%) reaching their ISC saturation level in <= 3 years. Across the study region, annual growth in impervious surface area accelerated from similar to 6 km(2)/year (0.7% of urban area in 1984) in the mid-1980s to similar to 12 km(2)/year in the late-2010s, with a large inter-annual variability among municipalities and over successive years. Of these emerged urban pixels, 89% were converted from non-urban to low- and medium-density urban features, mostly suburban residential land use. However, the relative proportions of low-, medium- and high density urban development changed dramatically over the study period, indicating that urban sprawl of the metropolis experienced major transitions in terms of land use intensity in the past three decades. Although primarily designed for change detection, our method can also be used as a temporal smoothing technique to remove noise in time-series of land cover datasets. Our results highlight the value of mapping and monitoring urban land expansion as continuous fields along the spatial-temporal-thematic dimensions for understanding the dynamics of urban land-change.

Remote sensing can inform these analyses, providing valuable spatiotemporal information about yield-limiting moisture conditions and crop response under current climate conditions. In this paper we study correlations for the period 2003-2013 between yield estimates for major crops grown in Brazil and the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) - an indicator of agricultural drought that describes anomalies in the actual/reference evapotranspiration (ET) ratio, retrieved using remotely sensed inputs of land surface temperature (LST) and leaf area index (LAI). The strength and timing of peak ESI-yield correlations are compared with results using remotely sensed anomalies in water supply (rainfall from the Tropical Rainfall Mapping Mission; TRMM) and biomass accumulation (LAI from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer; MODIS). Correlation patterns were generally similar between all indices, both spatially and temporally, with the strongest correlations found in the south and northeast where severe flash droughts have occurred over the past decade, and where yield variability was the highest. Peak correlations tended to occur during sensitive crop growth stages. At the state scale, the ESI provided higher yield correlations for most crops and regions in comparison with TRMM and LAI anomalies. Using finer scale yield estimates reported at the municipality level, ESI correlations with soybean yields peaked higher and earlier by 10 to 25 days in comparison to TRMM and LAI, respectively. In most states, TRMM peak correlations were marginally higher on average with municipality-level annual corn yield estimates, although these estimates do not distinguish between primary and late season harvests. A notable exception occurred in the northeastern state of Bahia, where the ESI better captured effects of rapid cycling of moisture conditions on corn yields during a series of flash drought events. The results demonstrate that for monitoring agricultural drought in Brazil, value is added by combining LAI with LST indicators within a physically based model of crop water use.

This is not always the case for remote rivers in developing countries. However, the accuracy of DEMs produced for modelling studies on such rivers should be enhanced in the near future by the high resolution TanDEM-X WorldDEM.   In a parallel development, increasing use is now being made of flood extents derived from high resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images for calibrating, validating and assimilating observations into flood inundation models in order to improve these. This paper discusses an additional use of SAR flood extents, namely to improve the accuracy of the TanDEM-X DEM in the floodplain covered by the flood extents, thereby permanently improving this DEM for future flood modelling and other studies.   The method is based on the fact that for larger rivers the water elevation generally changes only slowly along a reach, so that the boundary of the flood extent (the waterline) can be regarded locally as a quasi-contour. As a result, heights of adjacent pixels along a small section of waterline can be regarded as samples with a common population mean. The height of the central pixel in the section can be replaced with the average of these heights, leading to a more accurate estimate. While this will result in a reduction in the height errors along a waterline, the waterline is a linear feature in a two-dimensional space. However, improvements to the DEM heights between adjacent pairs of waterlines can also be made, because DEM heights enclosed by the higher waterline of a pair must be at least no higher than the corrected heights along the higher waterline, whereas DEM heights not enclosed by the lower waterline must in general be no lower than the corrected heights along the lower waterline. In addition, DEM heights between the higher and lower waterlines can also be assigned smaller errors because of the reduced errors on the corrected waterline heights.   The method was tested on a section of the TanDEM-X Intermediate DEM (IDEM) covering an 11 km reach of the Warwickshire Avon, England. Flood extents from four COSMO-SKyMed images were available at various stages of a flood in November 2012, and a LiDAR DEM was available for validation. In the area covered by the flood extents, the original IDEM heights had a mean difference from the corresponding LiDAR heights of 0.5 m with a standard deviation of 2.0 m, while the corrected heights had a mean difference of 03 m with standard deviation 1.2 m. These figures show that significant reductions in IDEM height bias and error can be made using the method, with the corrected error being only 60% of the original. Even if only a single SAR image obtained near the peak of the flood was used, the corrected error was only 66% of the original. The method should also be capable of improving the final TanDEM-X DEM and other DEMs, and may also be of use with data from the SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) satellite.

Widely used statistical models for remote sensing, such as randomForest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and generalized linear regression (GLM), are problematic for this purpose as they often fail to properly predict the absence of a target species, especially in areas of high vegetation diversity, due to the relative abundance of absence observations (or zero values) in the reference data used to train predictive models. Experience has shown that RF, SVM, and GLM models trained on such reference data produce biased values of PCC, for example, in forested areas absent the target species, PCC is overestimated, while in forested areas where a target species PCC is abundant, PCC tends to be underestimated. We used zero-inflated regression modeling to reduce such bias and better predict PCC-by-species within each pixel in mixed conifer forests. Zero-inflated regression models use a two-step process to first predict the presence or absence of the target species, and then to predict continuous levels of PCC only where the target species is present. We compared the results of three widely used methods (RF, SVM, and GLM) to nine zero-inflated models for their ability to predict continuous PCC for each of five different conifer species in heterogeneous forests of northwestern Montana using Landsat TM and OLI imagery. Our best zero-inflated models resulted in a mean difference of -3.84% to 2.26%, 95% confidence interval of 6.22% to 13.09%, and RMSE of 11.26% to 22.98%, depending on the species. The success of the zero-inflated model was robust across methods tested. Both the zero-inflated and traditional methods were successful in estimating continuous canopy cover, however, the traditional models showed a substantial bias by never correctly predicting the absence of the target species, while the zero-inflated models correctly predicted species absence 57% to 84% of the time, depending on the species. Visual inspection of the predicted maps compared to high-resolution imagery demonstrated that the zero-inflated models also more closely matched the landscape, as traditional models more often incorrectly predicted canopy cover in non-forested areas. Using the zero-inflated process dramatically reduced the bias of the results, allowing end users to make management decisions with increased confidence about where a target species is absent, something not possible with the traditional methods tested.

In extremely turbid waters (TSM > 100 mg L-1) however, these bands are less sensitive to increases in TSM. Here it is proposed to use Short Wave Infra Red (SWIR) spectral bands between 1000 and 1300 nm for these extreme cases. This SWIR spectral region is subdivided into two regions, SWIR-I (1000 nm to 1200 nm) and SWIR-II (1200 nm to 1300 nm) which correspond to local minima in the pure water absorption spectrum. For both spectral regions the water reflectance signal was measured in situ with an ASD spectrometer in three different extremely turbid estuarine sites: Scheldt (Belgium), Gironde (France), and Rio de la Plata (Argentina), along with the TSM concentration. A measurable water reflectance was observed for all sites in SWIR-I, while in the SWIR-II region the signal was not significant compared to the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of current Ocean Colour (OC) sensors. For the spectral band at 1020 nm (present in Ocean and Land Colour Instrument - OLCI, onboard Sentinel-3) and at 1071 nm, an empirical single band TSM algorithm is defined which is valid for both the Gironde and Scheldt estuarine sites. This means that a single algorithm can be applied for both sites without expensive recalibration. The relationship between TSM and SWIR reflectance at 1020 and 1071 nm is linear and did not show any saturation for the concentrations measured here (up to 1400 mg L-1), while saturation was observed for the NIR wavelengths, as expected. Hence, for extremely turbid waters it is advised to switch from NIR to SWIR4 wavelengths to estimate TSM concentration. This was demonstrated for an airborne hyperspectral dataset (Airborne Prism Experiment, APEX) from the Gironde estuary having several spectral bands in the SVVIR-I. The empirical single band SWIR TSM algorithm was applied to the atmospherically corrected scene providing a TSM concentration map of the Gironde from mouth to more upstream with concentrations expected in this region ranging from a few to several hundreds mg L-1. These results, i.e. the existence of a single relationship for the Scheldt and Gironde, not showing any decrease of sensitivity, highlights the importance of having SWIR bands in future ocean colour sensors for studying extremely turbid rivers, coastal areas and estuaries in the world. A further implication of these results is that there is a TSM limit for application of atmospheric correction algorithms which assume zero SWIR marine reflectance. That limit is defined here as function of wavelength and sensor noise level. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this basin, floods occur relatively frequently and initial catchment storage is known to be key to runoff generation. The land surface model is the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. The model is calibrated using the available streamflow records of 169 gauge stations across the Murray Darling Basin. The VIC soil moisture forecast is sequentially updated with observations from the SMOS Level 3 CATDS (Centre Aval de Traitement des Donnees SMOS) soil moisture product using the Ensemble Kalman filter. The assimilation algorithm accounts for the spatial mismatch between the model (0.125) and the SMOS observation (25 km) grids. Three widely-used methods for removing bias between model simulations and satellite observations of soil moisture are evaluated. These methods match the first, second and higher order moments of the soil moisture distributions, respectively. In this study, the first order bias correction, i.e. the rescaling of the long term mean, is the recommended method. Preserving the observational variability of the SMOS soil moisture data leads to improved soil moisture updates, particularly for dry and wet conditions, and enhances initial conditions for runoff generation. Second or higher order bias correction, which includes a rescaling of the variance, decreases the temporal variability of the assimilation results. In comparison with in situ measurements of OzNet the assimilation with mean bias correction reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) of the modeled soil moisture from 0.058 m(3)/m(3) to 0.046 m(3)/m(3) and increases the correlation from 0564 to 0.714. These improvements in antecedent wetness conditions further translate into improved predictions of associated water fluxes, particularly runoff peaks. In conclusion, the results of this study clearly demonstrate the merit of SMOS data assimilation for soil moisture and streamflow predictions at the large scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Other studies have found no long-term trends in water body extents, but large intra- and inter-annual changes driven by precipitation. These differences could be due to geographic variability in physical conditions (geology, climate, permafrost and hydrology) or in the data and methods used to extract water bodies. This study tested water extraction methods over the Tuktoyaktuk Coastal Plain, Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada, based on the Landsat 5 shortwave infrared (SWIR) channel and validated them using water extents obtained from 05 m resolution orthophoto imagery. Methods included applying thresholds to generate binary land/water classifications, as well as deriving 30 m water fractions from both linear unmixing and a new histogram breakpoint method. Results indicated that the histogram breakpoint method outperformed other methods, underestimating overall water fraction by 0.26% and overestimating the number of pure 30 m water pixels by 0.66% compared to water fractions calculated from orthophotos. The breakpoint method was then applied to a stack of 17 near peak-of-season Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 images acquired between July 4 and August 18 from 1985 to 2011 to create a water fraction time-series for examining both trends and inter-annual variation in water extent. Results showed an overall expansion of lake area along margins by 55 km(2) with isolated lakes experiencing rapid drainage totalling 15 km(2), leading to a net water area increase of 40 km(2) over the 26-year period.

Both standard and recently developed alternative algorithms are considered for match-up data analysis. The investigated standard products are those produced by the MERIS (algal 1 and algal 2) and MODIS (OC3M) algorithms. The alternative data products include those generated within the CoastColour Project and Ocean Color Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) funded by ESA, as well as a neural net model trained with field measurements collected in the Atlantic off Portugal (MLPATLP). Statistical analyses showed that satellite Chl estimates tend to be larger than in situ reference values. The study also revealed that a non-uniform Chl distribution in the water column can be a concurring factor to the documented overestimation tendency when considering larger optical depth match-up stations. Among standard remote sensing products, MODIS OC3M and MERIS algal 2 yield the best agreement with in situ data. The performance of MLPATLP highlights the capability of regional solutions to further improve Chl retrieval by accounting for environmental specificities. Results also demonstrate the relevance of oceanographic regions such as the Nazare area to evaluate how complex hydrodynamic conditions can influence the quality of Chl products.

High resolution airborne hyperspectral (HyMap) and LiDAR datasets acquired across independent collection sites can reduce uncertainty in predictive ecosystem modeling and provide a basis for regional upscaling to satellite observations of structural metrics such as cover and height. In the first part of our study, we combined ground reference and airborne data collected at three sagebrush-steppe locations and used the statistical data mining tool random forests to identify remote sensing variables most relevant to estimating shrub cover. In the second part of our study, we hypothesized that vegetation indices derived from hyperspectral satellite observations would not only reliably predict shrub cover but also be relatable to shrub height; thereby augmenting the collection of vertical structure estimates from future satellite platforms such as ICESAT-2. To test this hypothesis, we simulated HyspIRI observations to derive variables to relate to UDAR-based estimates of shrub cover and height. We generated the same hyperspectral variables as in the first part of this study but at coarser resolution (60 m) and we again used random forests to model shrub cover and height and identify predictors of greatest importance. Overall, combining LiDAR and HyMap datasets at the airborne scale improved shrub cover model results (r(2) = 0.58) compared to LiDAR alone (r(2) = 0.49). Primary shrub cover variables of importance were H-IQR (the interquartile range of height of all LiDAR vegetation returns), H-MAD (median absolute deviation from median height of all LiDAR vegetation returns), a narrowband index sensitive to anthocyanins, the ratio of LiDAR vegetation returns to total returns, and a red to green ratio. In addition, HyspIRI-simulated narrowband vegetation indices were relatable to LiDAR-derived shrub cover and height variables (r(2) ranging from 0.63 to 0.71) with relatively low root mean square error.

As dome-building volcanoes can change on meter scale within short time intervals in active phases, conventionally used repeat-pass SAR-interferometry (InSAR) often fails due to decorrelation effects, while other methods to measure topography like aerial photogrammetry or Lidar depend on the availability of the local infrastructure and on good weather conditions. Here, we show the potential of the spaceborne Earth observation mission TanDEM-X to monitor topographic changes at active dome-building volcanoes. In this innovative satellite mission, two nearly identical satellites fly in a close formation, taking radar images of the Earth\'s surface at the same time in bistatic mode. This opens the possibility to generate digital elevation models (DEMs) of volcanoes. Analyzing a series of repeated DEMs enables assessment of volume changes caused by lava dome activity. We apply this method to Merapi in Indonesia by analyzing the volume changes during the hazardous 2010 eruption. During this eruption, the old lava dome collapsed, and a new lava dome was extruded which collapsed again within twelve days. We show three DEMs derived from bistatic TanDEM-X InSAR in descending orbit taken before and after the eruption. We found a mean volume change of 19 x 10(6) m(3) in the summit area. The two estimates differ by 0.4 x 106 m3 which is 2% of the average dome volume change. The TanDEM-X based results are about 25% lower than reference data, which can be explained by the shadow masks that were introduced to exclude geometrically decorrelated areas, resulting in conservative volume change estimates.

On the Tibetan Plateau, the biomass of grasslands provides major ecosystem services with regard to the predominant transhumance economy. The pastures, however, are threatened by progressive degradation, resulting in a substantial reduction in plant coverage with currently unknown consequences for the hydrological/climate regulation function of the plateau and the major river systems of SE Asia that depend on it and provide water for the adjacent lowlands. Thus, monitoring of changes in plant coverage is of utmost importance, but no reliable tools have been available to date to monitor the changes on the entire plateau. Due to the wide extent and remoteness of the Tibetan Plateau, remote sensing is the only tool that can recurrently provide area-wide data for monitoring purposes. In this study, we develop and present a grassland-cover product based on multi-sensor satellite data that is applicable for monitoring at three spatial resolutions (WorldView type at 2-5 m, Landsat type at 30 m, MODIS at 500 m), where the data of the latter resolution cover the entire plateau. Four different retrieval techniques to derive plant coverage from satellite data in boreal summer (JJA) were tested. The underlying statistical models are derived with the help of field observations of the cover at 640 plots and 14 locations, considering the main grassland vegetation types of the Tibetan Plateau. To provide a product for the entire Tibetan Plateau, plant coverage estimates derived by means of the higher-resolution data were upscaled to MODIS composites acquired between 2011 and 2013. An accuracy assessment of the retrieval methods revealed best results for the retrieval using support vector machine regressions (RMSE: 9.97%, 7.13% and 5.51% from the WorldView to the MODIS scale).

Fronts are usually detected at 1 km resolution using the histogram-based, single image edge detection (SIED) algorithm developed by Cayula and Cornillon in 1992, with a standard preliminary smoothing using a median filter and a 3 x 3 pixel kernel. Here, detections are performed in three study regions (off Morocco, the Mozambique Channel and north-western Australia) and across the Indian Ocean basin using the combination of multiple windows (CMW) method developed by Nieto, Demarcq and McClatchie in 2012 which improves on the original Cayula and Cornillon algorithm. Detections at 4 km and 1 km resolution are compared.   Fronts are divided into two intensity classes (\"weak\" and \"strong\") according to their thermal gradient A preliminary smoothing is applied prior to the detection using different convolutions: three type of filters (median, average and Gaussian) combined with four kernel sizes (3 x 3, 5 x 5, 7 x 7, and 9 x 9 pixels) and three detection window sizes (16 x 16,24 x 24 and 32 x 32 pixels) to test the effect of these smoothing combinations on reducing the background noise of the data and therefore on improving the frontal detection. The performance of the combinations on 4 km data are evaluated using two criteria: detection efficiency and front length. We find that the optimal combination of preliminary smoothing parameters in enhancing detection efficiency and preserving front length includes a median filter, a 16 x 16 pixel window size, and a 5 x 5 pixel kernel for strong fronts and a 7 x 7 pixel kernel for weak fronts. Results show an improvement in detection performance (from largest to smallest window size) of 71% for strong fronts and 120% for weak fronts. Despite the small window used (16 x 16 pixels), the length of the fronts has been preserved relative to that found with 1 km data.   This optimal preliminary smoothing and the CMW detection algorithm on 4 km sea surface temperature data are then used to describe the spatial distribution of the monthly frequencies of occurrence for both strong and weak fronts across the Indian Ocean basin. In general, strong fronts are observed in coastal areas; whereas weak fronts, with some seasonal exceptions, are mainly located in the open ocean.   This study shows that adequate noise reduction achieved by a preliminary smoothing of the data considerably improves the frontal detection efficiency as well as the global quality of the results. Consequently, the use of 4 km data enables frontal detections similar to 1 km data (using a standard median 3 x 3 convolution) in terms of detectability, length and location. This method is easily applicable to large regions or at the global scale, with far less constraints of data manipulation and processing time using 4 km data relative to 1 km data.

Recent attention has focused on developing an underlying foundation consisting of diagnostic tools, inferential extensions, and techniques for optimization.   For a study area in Norway, forest inventory and airborne laser scanning data were used with the k-Nearest Neighbors technique to estimate mean aboveground biomass per unit area. Optimization entailed reduction of the dimension of feature space, deletion of influential outliers, and selection of optimal weights for the weighted Euclidean distance metric. These optimization steps increased the proportion of variability explained in the reference set by as much as 20%, reduced confidence interval widths by as much as 35%, and produced standard errors that were as small as 3% of the estimate of the mean.

In order to retrieve the climatic signature from surface velocity, large-scale study of temporal trends spanning multiple decades is required. Satellite image feature-tracking has been successfully used to derive mountain glacier surface velocities, but most studies rely on manually selected pairs of images, which is not adequate for large datasets. In this paper, we propose a processing strategy to exploit complete satellite archives in a semi-automated way in order to derive robust and spatially complete glacier velocities and their uncertainties on a large spatial scale. In this approach, all available pairs within a defined time span are analysed, preprocessed to improve image quality and features are tracked to produce a velocity stack; the final velocity is obtained by selecting measures from the stack with the statistically higher level of confidence. This approach allows to compute statistical uncertainty level associated with each measured image pixel. This strategy is applied to 1536 pairs of Landsat 5 and 7 images covering the 3000 km long Pamir-Karakoram-Himalaya range for the period of 1999-2001 to produce glacier annual velocity fields. We obtain a velocity estimate for 76,000 km(2) or 92% of the glacierized areas of this region. We then discuss the impact of coregistration errors and variability of glacier flow on the final velocity. The median 95% confidence interval ranges from 2.0 m/year on the average in stable areas and 4.4 m/year on the average over glaciers with variability related to data density, surface conditions and strain rate. These performances highlight the benefits of processing of a complete satellite archive to produce glacier velocity fields and to analyse glacier dynamics at regional scales. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

It recorded high-resolution spectra during day and night, from pole to pole and between 6 and 70 km altitude in the nominal measurement mode or up to 170 km in special measurement modes, producing daily more than 1000 vertical profiles of various trace gases. The operational Level-2 data are processed by ESA/DLR but there exist three other, independent research Level-2 processors that are hosted by ISAC-CNR/University of Bologna, Oxford University, and KIT IMK/IAA. All four Level-2 processors rely on the same Level-1b data provided by ESA but their retrieval schemes differ. As part of ESA\'s Ozone Climate Change Initiative project, an intercomparison of the four MIPAS processors took place, in which vertical ozone profiles retrieved by these four processors from MIPAS nominal mode measurements were compared for 2007 and 2008. We present the results of this comparison exercise, which consisted of five parts: an information content study of the vertical averaging kernels, an intercomparison of zonal seasonal means and spreads, a determination of biases through comparison to ozonesonde and lidar measurements, a comparison to other satellite records (bias estimation and precision assessment with respect to ACE-FTS and Aura-MLS data), and a geophysical validation of the provided error bars using MIPAS MIPAS collocations.   The four processors demonstrate similar performance. All processors use the same Level-1b data from ESA, apply global fits, and use microwindows instead of the full spectrum. The main differences in the processing schemes include the choice of microwindows, the regularization approach, the treatment of negative retrieved values, and the cloud detection threshold. The different regularization schemes lead to a different trade-off between noise and resolution, but without a clear average advantage for any particular data set. The vertical resolution is typically 3-5 km and the single profile precision is about 2-3%. In the middle and upper stratosphere, at 25-45 km, all four MIPAS processors clearly show a high bias of 2 to 5% relative to all reference instruments. The similarity of the structure and magnitude of the bias among the MIPAS data sets indicates that the bias is most likely linked to the use of microwindows of the MIPAS AB band. The satellite intercomparisons show furthermore that for the KIT dataset, the onset of the high bias starts at a somewhat higher altitude (only above 35 km) than for the other three datasets. This is likely due to the more restrictive use of the AB band by the KIT processor, which comes at the cost of a coarser vertical resolution near the ozone volume mixing ratio (vmr) peak. In the troposphere, the Level-2 algorithms that suppress negative ozone values in the iterative retrieval process produce a larger positive bias than the algorithm that does not follow such a strategy. Our main conclusion is that the four MIPAS processors are more similar to each other than to any other reference instrument. This indicates that the observed biases are very likely instrument-related. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Methods are needed to provide objective estimates of forest loss to support monitoring efforts at various scales, and with increasing public availability of remote sensing data, accurate deforestation measurements at high temporal resolution are becoming more realistic. While several time series based methods have recently been described in the literature, there are few studies focusing on tropical forest areas, where low data availability and complex change processes present challenges to forest disturbance monitoring. Here, we present a robust data-driven method to track tropical deforestation and degradation based on Landsat time series data. Based on the previously reported Breaks For Additive Season and Trend Monitor (BFAST Monitor) method (Verbesselt et al, 2012), we show that BFAST Monitor, when applied to Landsat NDVI rime series data using sequentially defined monitoring periods, can be used to track small-scale forest disturbances annually in an Afromontane forest system in southern Ethiopia. Using an ordinal logistic regression (OLR) approach, change magnitude, calculated based on differences between observed and expected values in a monitoring period, was found to be an essential predictor variable for disturbances. After applying a NDVI change magnitude threshold of -0.065, overall accuracy was estimated to be 78%, and both producer\'s and user\'s accuracy of the disturbance class were estimated to be 73%. The method and results presented here are relevant to tropical countries engaged in REDD + for whom data availability and complex forest change dynamics limit the ability to reliably track forest disturbances over time.

Terrestrial ecosystem models require robust phenology models to understand and simulate the relationship between ecosystems and a changing climate. While current phenology models are able to capture inter-annual variation in the timing of vegetation spring onset, their spatiotemporal performances are not well understood. Using green-up dates derived from MODIS, we test 9 phenological models that predict the timing of grassland spring onset via commonly available climatological variables. Model evaluation using satellite observations suggests that Modified Growing-Degree Day (MGDD) models and Accumulated Growing Season Index (AGSI) models achieve reasonable accuracy (RMSE < 20 days) after model calibration. Inclusion of a photoperiod trigger and varied critical forcing thresholds in the temperature-based phenology model improves model applicability at a regional scale. In addition, we observe that AGSI models outperform MGDD models by capturing inter-annual phenology variation in large semi-arid areas, likely due to the explicit consideration of water availability. Further validation based on flux tower sites shows good agreement between the modeled timing of spring onset and references derived from satellite observations and in-situ measurements. Our results confirm recent studies and indicate that there is a need to calibrate current phenology models to predict grassland spring onsets accurately across space and time. We demonstrate the feasibility of combining satellite observations and climatic datasets to develop and refine phenology models for characterizing the spatiotemporal patterns of grassland green-up variations.

In combination, [LAI and Chi(1), provide critical information on vegetation density, vitality and photosynthetic potentials. However, simultaneous retrieval of LAI and Chl(l) from space observations is extremely challenging. Regularization strategies are required to increase the robustness and accuracy of retrieved properties and enable more reliable separation of soil, leaf and canopy parameters. To address these challenges, the REGularized canopy reFLECtance model (REGFLEC) inversion system was refined to incorporate enhanced techniques for exploiting ancillary LAI and temporal information derived from multiple satellite scenes. In this current analysis, REGFLEC is applied to a time-series of Landsat data.   A novel aspect of the REGFLEC approach is the fact that no site-specific data are required to calibrate the model, which may be run in a largely automated fashion using information extracted entirely from image-based and other widely available datasets. Validation results, based upon in-situ LAI and Chl(l) observations collected over maize and soybean fields in central Nebraska for the period 2001-2005, demonstrate Chl(l) retrieval with a relative root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) on the order of 19% (RMSD = 8.42 pg cm(-2)). While Chli retrievals were clearly influenced by the version of the leaf optical properties model used (PROSPECT), the application of spatio-temporal regularization constraints was shown to be critical for estimating Chl(l) with sufficient accuracy. REGFLEC also reproduced the dynamics of in-situ measured LAI well (r(2) = 0.85), but estimates were biased low, particularly over maize (LAI was underestimated by -36 %). This disparity may be attributed to differences between effective and true LAI caused by significant foliage clumping not being properly accounted for in the canopy reflectance model (SAIL). Additional advances in the retrieval of canopy biophysical and leaf biochemical constituents will require innovative use of existing remote sensing data within physically realistic canopy reflectance models along with the ability to exploit the enhanced spectral and spatial capabilities of upcoming satellite systems.

The in situ data sets were derived from fixed mooring sites and ship data using a variety of field radiometers. An optical classification procedure was applied to the satellite reflectance from each matchup pair to derive its fuzzy membership to eight previously characterized, optical water types. The memberships were then used as weights to derive uncertainty measures for the optical water types. The resulting uncertainty measures are shown to vary by optical water type for both sensors. Overall, the root-mean-square difference (RMSD) for open ocean waters is low and diminishes with increasing wavelength. The RMSD increases with optical complexity and is the highest in coastal waters associated with highly absorbing or highly scattering conditions. Although it plays a small role in RMSD, a spectral bias with a distinct zigzag pattern was detected across all water types. The most sensitive measure associated with optical water types is the relative uncertainty, which is shown to be near the desired 5% threshold for much of the open ocean for both SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua, but exceeds 50% in waters where the reflectance signal is low. This approach provides an objective method for characterizing uncertainty in water environments with distinct optical properties, and the results can be used in the processing of future satellite data to derive their associated uncertainty fields.

Scale dependence is particularly important in low gradient coastal environments where small vertical errors can affect large areas and where representation of fine scale topographic features can influence how DEMs are used for modeling inundation. It is commonly observed that different types of DEMs represent larger, coarse-scale topographic features similarly but differ in how they represent smaller, finer-scale features. The spatial-scale dependence of DEM accuracy can be quantified in terms of the correlation scale (lambda(C)); the spatial wavelength above which models agree with spectral coherency >05 and below which they differ. We compare cross spectral analyses of the GDEM2 and SRTM global DEMs with 14,572 LiDAR-derived elevations along transects in diverse coastal environments of New York City. Both global DEMs have positive bias relative to LiDAR ground elevations, but bias (mu) and uncertainty (sigma) of GDEM2 (mu: 8.1 m; sigma: 7.6 m) are significantly greater than those of SRTM (mu: 1.9 m; sigma. 3.6 m). Cross-spectral coherency between GDEM2 and the LiDAR DEM begins to roll-off at scales of lambda < similar to 3 km, while coherency between SRTM and the LiDAR DEM begins to roll-off at scales of lambda < similar to 1 km. The correlation scale below which coherency with LiDAR attains a signal to noise ratio of I is similar to 1 km for GDEM2 and similar to 0.5 km for SRTM; closely matching the divergence scales where the surface roughness of the land cover exceeds the roughness of the underlying terrain.

Uniquely, remote sensing offers the capacity to acquire information in a systematic (spatially, temporally, and categorically) and synoptic fashion that is appealing from monitoring and reporting perspectives. The opening of the Landsat archive and new processing and analysis opportunities enable the characterization of large areas and the generation of dynamic, transparent, systematic, repeatable, and spatially exhaustive information products. Best Available Pixel (BAP) approaches enable the production of periodic image composites free of haze, clouds, or shadows over large areas. In this paper we demonstrate an integrated protocol to produce spatially exhaustive annual BAP image composites that are seasonally constrained and free of atmospheric perturbations. These annual BAP composites for the years inclusive of 1998 to 2010 provide for generation of a suite of change metrics for the period 2000 to 2010 using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) data. The study area is the >375,000 km(2) forested area of Saskatchewan, Canada. We evaluate the robustness of the protocol by comparing in-filled (or proxy) values with a true reference set for surface reflectance. An initial change detection pass is used to aid in the allocation of proxy values (for missing and anomalous values) and to allocate change events to the correct year, with a second pass to characterize key change points and related time series trends (e.g., change year, post-change slopes, among others). In so doing, a multi-temporal data cube (via a series of annual proxy composites) and a set of change metrics are generated. Approximately 35% of the pixels in our study area required proxy values, either as a result of missing data or our noise detection approach. Overall, our results indicate strong agreement between the assigned proxy values and the reference data (R = 0.71-0.91, RMSE = 0.008-0.025). Agreement was stronger for pixel series with no change events (R = 0.73-0.92, RMSE = 0.007-0.024), relative to pixel series with change events (R = 0.63-0.87, RMSE = 0.010-0.029). The generated change metrics, derived via temporal and spatial analysis of the annual BAP composites, were an important precursor to the generation of valid proxy values, and - importantly - provide valuable information for the further assessment and understanding of land cover and land cover change. Our results indicate that the demonstrated protocol provides a reliable approach to generate proxy image composites containing no data gaps, along with a suite of informative change metrics that provide a comprehensive characterization of land cover changes (including disturbance and recovery) allowing for an improved understanding of landscape dynamics. The protocol is efficient and may be applied over large areas to support regional and national mapping and monitoring activities.

Satellite remotely sensed LST has many merits, such as global coverage and consistent periodicity, which overcomes the weaknesses of ground observations related to the footprint, site distributions, and costs. For human related studies and urban climatology, air temperatures are equally important. This study explores the potential to estimate the near-surface air and dew-point temperatures from the MODIS 07 atmospheric profile product (MOD07_L2) to capture the UHI dynamics at 5 km resolution. Four mega-cities in North America: Phoenix, Houston, Chicago, and Toronto, are evaluated during 2003-2013 summers. The comparison between the MODIS near-surface temperature and the ground observations suggests an accuracy of 3-7 K RMSE for different cities and times of day. For air temperature, the Aqua overpass has better agreements, and nighttime has higher accuracy than daytime in most cases. In general, very dry (Phoenix) and very moist (Houston) climate conditions increase the variability of the MODIS temperature accuracy. This study also develops an urban heat island curve (UHIC) to represent UHI intensity by integrating the urban surface heterogeneity in a curve, showing the relationship between air temperature and urban fraction. UHIC provides a new way to quantify UHI city by city, which emphasizes the temperature gradients, consequently decreasing the impact of data biases. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The algorithms were locally-tuned and validated using in situ chl-a data (n = 289) spanning the five year processed image time series and from all four lake basins. In general, both band-difference algorithms tested (Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) and Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI)) performed well, whereas the neural network processors were generally found to much less accurately-retrieve in situ chl-a concentrations. The Level 1b FLH algorithm performed best overall in terms of chl-a retrieval (R-2 = 0.87; RMSE = 4.19 mg m(-3); relative RMSE = 30.75%) and particularly at chl-a concentrations of >= 10 mg m(-3) (R-2 = 0.85; RMSE = 4.81 mg m(-3); relative RMSE = 20.77%). However, under mesotrophic conditions (i.e., chl-a < 10 mg m(-3)) FLH was outperformed by the locally-tuned FUB/WeW processor (relative FLH RMSE < 10 mg m(-3) = 57.57% versus relative FUB/WeW RMSE < 10 mg m(-3) = 46.96%). An ensemble selection of in-water algorithms is demonstrated to improve chl-a retrievals. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.', '[Palmer, Stephanie C.

These changes in land use influence local biodiversity patterns and require annual monitoring of land cover. To accurately map land cover in such spatio-temporal complex landscapes, it is important to capture their phenological dynamics and fine spatial heterogeneity. Multi-seasonal analyses using optical sensors with a medium spatial resolution from 10 to 60 m (e.g. Landsat) have been used for this task, but data availability can be scarce due to cloud cover, sub-optimal acquisition schedules and data archive access restrictions. Combining coarse spatial resolution data from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat provides opportunities to close these gaps by simulating Landsat-like images at MODIS temporal resolution. In this study, we test whether and by what degree land cover maps of complex Mediterranean landscapes improve by integrating multi-seasonal Landsat imagery, as well as whether STARFM-simulated imagery can be used whenever original multi-seasonal Landsat observations are unavailable. Therefore, we develop different classification scenarios based on seasonally varying data availability and based on original and simulated Landsat data. Results show that multi-seasonal Landsat data from spring and early autumn are crucial for achieving satisfying mapping accuracies (overall accuracy 74.5%). Using synthetic Landsat imagery increases classification accuracy compared to using single-date Landsat data, but accuracies were never as good as a classification based on original data. We conclude that multi-seasonal data is essential for mapping complex Mediterranean landscapes and that STARFM can be used to compensate for missing Landsat observations. However, if Landsat data availability is sufficient to cover all phenologically important dates, we suggest relying solely on Landsat.

This is accomplished by applying airborne and mast-borne spectrometer data sets together with high-resolution information on forest canopy characteristics. In case of aerial spectrometer observations, tree characteristics determined from airborne LIDAR observations are applied to quantify the effect of forest canopy on scene reflectance. The results indicate that a simple RT model is feasible to describe extinction and reflectance properties of both homogeneous and heterogeneous forest scenes (corresponding to varying scales of satellite data footprints and varying structures of forest canopies). The obtained results also justify the application of apparent forest canopy transmissivity to describe the influence of forest to reflectance, as is done e.g. in the SCAmod method for the continental scale monitoring of fractional snow cover (FSC) from optical satellite data. Additionally, the feasibility of the zeroth order RT approach is compared with the use of linear mixing model of scene reflectance. Results suggest that the nonlinear RT approach describes the scene reflectance of a snow-covered boreal forest more realistically than the linear mixing model (in case when shadows on tree crowns and surface are not modeled separately, which is a relevant suggestion when considering the use of models for large scale snow mapping applications).

Comprising all three sensors on ALOS (PALSAR, PRISM, AVNIR-2), the plan was designed to serve all ALOS user categories and aimed at producing spatially and temporally consistent baseline coverages over the planet on a repetitive basis, to accommodate systematic global-scale, fine-resolution, monitoring of the environment. Unlike the common background missions defined for most fine-resolution Earth Observation satellites, the observation strategy was implemented as a top-level foreground mission with a priority second only to that of special observation requests and emergency observations and sensor calibration.   While the ALOS mission regrettably ended in April 2011, the global acquisition strategy nevertheless produced a comprehensive and homogeneous global archive in which consistent time-series of data are available for any arbitrary land area on Earth (excluding Antarctica >77.5 degrees South latitude, which could not be reached by the sensors). Clouds and haze inevitably constituted limitations for the optical sensors, while for the PALSAR instrument, two cloud-free and near-gap free (similar to 95%) global coverages were achieved annually during the 4.5 years in operations. Previously, such uniform data archives existed only for coarse-resolution sensors such as AVHRR, MERIS and MODIS. The ALOS BOS supported a variety applications from local to global scales, ranging from structural deformation, monitoring of wetlands regional inundation patterns and mapping of forest extent and changes over nations and continents at spatial resolutions as fine as 10 m.   The Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) was launched on May 24, 2014. Equipped with an enhanced L-band SAR sensor (PALSAR-2), ALOS-2 resumes the global wall-to-wall acquisitions to assure continuity and consistency with JAXA\'s global mission objectives and unique L-band SAR archive created by ALOS PALSAR.

Thus, algorithms developed for one case may not be applicable for others due to their different requirements on the model forms, wavebands, or model parameters. Here, using both in situ and satellite data collected from two estuaries in the United States, namely Tampa Bay and Chesapeake Bay, we attempted to address this technical challenge through water type classification and type-specific algorithm tuning. Based on an existing NTD675 (Normalized Trough Depth at 675 nm) water classification method that was originally devised for inland turbid waters, the estuarine waters were divided into three water types, and then used to develop type-specific empirical algorithms using different bands (2-band, 3-band, and 4-band algorithms). The 2-band model outperformed the other models, whose band selection varied with water types. Application of the type-specific models to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data showed uncertainties of 32.5% in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and 4.7 mg m(-3) in root mean square error (RMSE) for chlorophyll a concentration (Chla) ranging between 2 and 20 mg m(-3). As a comparison, a unified model tuned for all water types without classification showed inferior performance with a MAPE of 50.5% and a RMSE of 5.9 mg m(-3). By means of the in situ data, the type-specific models for the classified waters yielded a general improvement in MAPE by 8.4%, in comparison with the model for the non-classified water. Application to satellite imagery also showed reasonable spatial distribution patterns of Chla in Tampa Bay and Chesapeake Bay. These results suggest that the type-specific models coupled with the NTD675 water classification have the potential for improving Chla retrievals over optically complex waters, while general applicability of the approach to other estuaries still requires further research.

However, landslide detection based on field surveys and optical remote sensing and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) techniques remains difficult owing to the dense vegetation cover and mountain shadow. In the present study, an area of Zigui County in the Three Gorges region was selected to test the feasibility of detecting landslides by employing novel features extracted from a LiDAR-derived DTM. Additionally, two small sites Site 1 and Site 2 were selected for training and were used to classify each other. In addition to the aspect, DTM, and slope images, the following feature sets were proposed to improve the accuracy of landslide detection: (1) the mean aspect, DTM, and slope textures based on four texture directions; (2) aspect, DTM, and slope textures based on aspect; and (3) the moving average and standard deviation (stdev) filter of aspect, DTM, and slope. By combining a feature selection method and the RF algorithm, the classification accuracy was evaluated and landslide boundaries were determined. The results can be summarized as follows. (1) The feature selection method demonstrated that the proposed features provided information useful for effective landslide identification. (2) Feature selection achieved an improvement of about 0.44% in the overall classification accuracy, with the feature set reduced by 74%, from 39 to 10; this can speed up the training of the RF model. (3) When fifty randomly selected 20% oflandslide pixels (P-LS) and 20% of non-landslide pixels (P-NLS) (i.e., 20% of P-LS and P-NLS) were utilized in addition to the selected feature subsets for training, the test sets (i.e., the remaining 80% of P-LS and P-NLS) yielded an average overall classification accuracy of 78.24%. The cross training and classification for Site 1 and Site 2 provided overall classification accuracies of 62.65% and 64.50%, respectively. This shows that the random sampling design (which suffered some of the effects of spatial auto-correlation) and the proposed method in this present study contribute jointly to the classification accuracy. (4) Using the Canny operator to delineate landslide boundaries based on the classification results of Pis and Pms, we obtained results consistent with the referenced landslide inventory maps. Thus, the proposed procedure, which combines LiDAR data, a feature selection method, and the RF algorithm, can identify forested landslides effectively in the Three Gorges region.

Satellite data may provide useful information to detect and characterize upwelling events in regions of sparse in-situ observations. We analyze the coastal upwelling process on the western San Maths Gulf, on the northern continental shelf of Argentina, based on the analysis of remote sensing and in-situ data. Upwelling events are characterized by their frequency of occurrence and magnitude. During the austral summer we found roughly 6 upwelling-favorable wind events per year. Satellite derived sea surface temperature (SST) data provide evidence of upwelling in 85% of the cases between 2000 and 2008. Analysis of specific events provides clues on the wind forcing characteristics required to generate upwelling, and on characteristic space and time scales of the process. On February 2005 SST data reveal a narrow coastal band (similar to 10 km) of relative cold water extending similar to 100 km along the west coast of SMG. The SST in this band was 1.5 degrees C lower than further offshore. Near bottom temperature fluctuations from in-situ daily observations collected at two nearshore locations are significantly correlated with along-shore wind stress, suggesting that coastal upwelling is a dominant process controlling high-frequency temperature fluctuations near-shore. A simple quantitative estimate reveals a volume of upwelled water reaching the sea surface of about 10(10) m(3) during one relatively intense upwelling event.

Using MODIS data from 2003 to 2011, we quantified the diurnal and seasonal surface UHI intensity (SUHII, urban-suburban temperature difference) in China\'s 32 major cities, and analyzed their spatial variations and possible underlying mechanisms. Results show that the annual mean SUHII varied markedly from 0.01 to 1.87 degrees C in the day and 035 to 1.95 degrees C at night, with a great deal of spatial heterogeneities. Higher SUHIls for the day and night were observed in the southeastern and northern regions, respectively. Moreover, the SUHII differed greatly by season, characterized by a higher intensity in summer than in winter during the day, and the opposite during the night for most cities. Consequently, whether the daytime SUHII was higher or lower than the nighttime SUHII for a city depends strongly on the geographic location and research period. The SUHII\'s distribution in the day related closely to vegetation activity and anthropogenic heat releases in summer, and to climate (temperature and precipitation) in winter, while that at night linked tightly to albedo, anthropogenic heat releases, built-up intensity, and climate in both seasons. Overall, we found the overwhelming control of climate on the SUHII\'s spatial variability, yet the factors included in this study explained a much smaller fraction of the SUHII variations in the day compared to night and in summer relative to winter (day vs. night: 57% vs. 72% in summer, and 61% vs. 90% in winter, respectively), indicating more complicated mechanisms underlying the distribution of daytime SUHII, particularly in summer. Our results highlight the different diurnal (day and night) and seasonal (summer and winter) SUHII\'s spatial patterns and driving forces, suggesting various strategies are needed for an effective UHI effect mitigation.

Landsat\'s temporal and spatial coverage, moderate spatial resolution, and long history of earth observations provide a unique opportunity for characterizing vegetation changes across large areas and long time scales. However, like with other multi-spectral passive optical sensors, Landsat\'s relationship of single-date reflectance with forest biomass diminishes under high leaf area and complex canopy conditions. Because the condition of a forest stand at any point in time is largely determined by its disturbance and recovery history, we conceived a method that enhances Landsat\'s spectral relationships with biomass by including information on vegetation trends prior to the date for which estimates are desired. With recently developed algorithms that characterize trends in disturbance (e.g. year of onset, duration, and magnitude) and post-disturbance regrowth, it should now be possible to realize improved Landsat-based mapping of current biomass across large regions. Moreover, given that we now have 40 years of Landsat data, it should also be possible to use this approach to map historic biomass densities.   In this study, we developed regression tree models to predict current forest aboveground biomass (AGB) for a mixed-conifer region in eastern Oregon (USA) using Landsat-based disturbance and recovery (DR) metrics. We employed the trajectory-fitting algorithm LandTrendr to characterize DR trends from yearly Landsat time series between 1972 and 2010. The most important DR predictors of AGB were associated with magnitude of disturbance, post-disturbance condition and post-disturbance recovery, whereas time since disturbance and pre-disturbance trends showed only weak correlations with AGB. Including DR metrics substantially improved predictions of AGB (RMSE = 30.3 Mg ha(-1), 27%) compared to models based on only single-date reflectance (RMSE = 39.6 Mg ha(-1), 35%). To determine the number of years required to adequately capture the effect of DR on AGB, we explored the relationship between time-series length and model prediction accuracy. Prediction accuracy increased exponentially with increasing number of years across the entire observation period, suggesting that in this forest region the longer the historic record of disturbance and recovery metrics the more accurate the mapping of AGB. However, time series lengths of between 10 and 20 years were adequate to significantly improve model predictions, and lengths of as little as 5 years still had a meaningful impact To test the concept of historic biomass prediction, we applied our model to Landsat time series from 1972-1993 and estimated AGB biomass change between 1993 and 2007. Our estimates compared well with historic inventory data, demonstrating that long-term Landsat observations of DR processes can aid in monitoring AGB and AGB change. Instead of directly linking Landsat data with the limited amount of available field-based AGB data, in this study we used the field data to map AGB with airborne lidar and then sampled the lidar data for model training and error assessment By using lidar data to build and test our prediction model, this study illustrates that lidar data have great value for scaling between field measurements and Landsat data.

The urban heat island (UHI) maps were produced using data provided by the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board of both Terra and Aqua satellites. Two types of UHI were analyzed simultaneously: the canopy layer heat island (CLHI) and the surface urban heat island (SUHI). The aim of this work is the realization of the SUHI and CLHI maps to monitor the spatial and temporal evolution of surface and air heating; also, to highlight and quantify the different features (e.g. magnitude, spatial extent, orientation and UHI center location) a Gaussian surface was used to fit the spatially distributed heat island patterns.   The analysis during summer months points out that the SUHI effect is a noticeable phenomenon throughout the whole diurnal cycle: it has a stronger intensity in the daytime with peaks around 9-10 K while in the nighttime, in the absence of solar forcing, it decreases by a factor of 2. In contrast, the canopy layer heat island during the daytime is absent: the CLHI emerges after sunset with an average intensity around 3-4 K, showing features similar to the nighttime SUHI.   In addition, comparisons between UHI intensity and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were performed, confirming that green areas can contribute to the mitigation of this phenomenon.

Since temperature can vary greatly both spatially and temporally, Ta stations are often inadequate for studies on the health effects of extreme temperature and climate change. Satellites can provide us with daily physical surface temperature (Ts) measurements, enabling us to estimate daily Ta. In this study, we aimed to extend our previous work on predicting Ta from Ts in Massachusetts by predicting 24 h Ta means on a 1 km grid across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, extending both the temporal and spatial coverage, improving upon the methodology and validating our model in other geographical regions across the Northeastern part of the USA. We used mixed model regressions to first calibrate Ts and Ta measurements, regressing Ta measurements against day-specific random intercepts, and fixed and random Ts slopes. Then to capture the ability of neighboring cells to fill in the cells with missing Ts values, we regress the Ta predicted from the first mixed effects model against the mean of the Ta measurements on that day, separately for each grid cell. Out-of-sample tenfold cross-validation was used to quantify the accuracy of our predictions. Our model performance was excellent for both days with available Ts and days without Ts observations (mean out-of-sample R-2 = 0.95 and R-2 = 0.94 respectively). We demonstrate how Ts can be used reliably to predict daily Ta at high resolution in large geographical areas even in non-retrieval days while reducing exposure measurement error.

In particular, we refer to traditional and remotelysensed hydrometric data for: 1) evaluating if ERS-2 and ENVISAT data can be used for model calibration; 2) assessing whether remotely-sensed water elevation data can integrate traditional hydrometric data and improve the reliability of the hydraulic model. Satellite overpasses are generally characterized by low frequencies and the accuracy of remotely-sensed water surface levels is still limited. Nevertheless, the results of our analysis indicate that for medium-to-large rivers ERS-2 and ENVISAT satellite data can effectively enhance our knowledge of the average streamflow regime of a given reach: they can be directly used in calibration, and their integration with in-situ data may significantly enhance the representation of the hydraulic behaviour of the study river. Considering our study reach, if compared to the model implemented on the basis of in-situ data only the hydraulic model parameterized on the basis of satellite and in-situ hydrometric data provides a better reproduction of average flow conditions, and it also results in the most accurate representation of the maximum water profile observed during a major flood occurred in October 2000.

One of the lakes was also monitored frequently during its growth season to reveal the seasonal variation of absorption properties. Within the studied lakes, CDOM absorption a(CDOM)(442) varied from 0.4 to 15 m(-1). CDOM was clearly dominating the absorption signal at low wavelengths, but even at the red-end of the spectra its contribution to total absorption was notable, varying from 48 to 99% of total absorption (excl. water) at 442 nm and from 5 to 86% at 665 nm. Slope of the CDOM absorption spectra S-CDOM(400-700) varied from 12.9 to 193 mu m(-1). Higher slopes were obtained when the wavelength range was extended to the UV-range (350700 and 300-700 nm). Non-linear relationships were noted between a(CDOM) and S-CDOM calculated over various wavelength ranges. Despite the significant relationship between DOC concentration and a(CDOM), almost fivefold variation was noted in DOC-specific CDOM absorption at 442 nm. This variation was clearly associated with concurrent changes in S-CDOM. Non-algal particulate absorption varied from 0.037 to 1.8 m(-1) at 442 nm, contributing <1 to 34% of total absorption at 442 nm and <1 to 27% at 442 nm. Slope of the NAP absorption spectra S-NAP(380-700) varied from 7.6 to 12.8 mu m(-1). Despite of the apparent covariation between weight of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and a(NAP), six-fold variation was observed in SPM-specific NAP absorption at 442 nm, which was mostly associated with organic content of the particle pool. Contribution of phytoplankton pigments ranged from 1 to 28% of total absorption at 442 nm, and 13 to 86% at 665 nm, respectively. Chlorophyll a (Chla) specific absorption of phytoplankton pigments varied from 0.012 to 0.038 m(2) (mg Chlar)(-1) at blue peak, and from 0.008 to 0.020 m(2) (mg Chla)(-1) at red peak. Observed values cluster around the low-end of the previously reported range, indicating a high package effect of phytoplankton cells in lakes. Observed variation was modeled as function of Chla (ranging from 1.8 to 95 mg m(-3)). Parameters and relationships presented in this study provide useful information for remote sensing of lakes, as well as for various ecological and geochemical applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

It is shown that the sea surface infrared reflectivity is significant for large incidence and observation angles. The energy conservation criterion is then checked.

Deriving a SST correction from simulated brightness temperatures (BTs), obtained by applying a Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) to Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) atmospheric profiles and first guess SST, is one of the solutions to reduce regional biases. This solution is envisaged in the particular case of Metop-A Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) derived SST. Simulated BTs show errors, linked to RTM, atmospheric profiles or guess field errors. We investigated the conditions of adjusting simulated to observed BTs in the particular case of the Mediterranean Sea over almost one year. Our study led to define optimal spatio/temporal averaging parameters of the simulation observation differences, both during day and night, summer and colder season and for two simulation modes: operational (with reduced vertical resolution - 15 levels - NWP atmospheric profiles and two days old analysis used as first guess SST) and delayed (full vertical resolution - 91 levels - and concurrent analysis used as first guess SST). Each BT adjustment has been evaluated by comparing the corresponding corrected AVHRR SST to the AATSR SST that we adopted as validation reference. We obtained an optimized result across all defined conditions and modes for a spatial smoothing of 15 deg and a temporal averaging between 3 and 5 days. Specifically, analyses based on 10 day averages showed that a standard deviation based criterion favors spatial smoothing above 10 deg for all temporal averaging, while a bias based criterion favors shorter temporal averaging during daytime (<5 days) and higher spatial smoothing (>10 deg) for nighttime. This study has shown also the impact of diurnal warming both in deriving BT adjustment and in validation results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Those datasets were the (1) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as derived from the Terra satellite\'s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), (2) daytime and (3) nighttime land surface temperature (LST) as derived from Aqua satellite\'s MODIS, and (4) precipitation from the National Weather Service (NWS) Nexrad-based gridded data product. The originating MODIS data utilized were the globally produced 8-day, clear sky composited science products (MOD09Q1 and MYD11A2), while the US-wide NWS data were manipulated to mesh with the MODIS imagery both spatially and temporally by regridding and summing the otherwise daily measurements. The crop growing seasons of 2006-2011 were analyzed with each year bounded by 32 8-day periods from mid-February through late October. Land cover classifications known as the Cropland Data Layer as produced annually by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) were used to isolate the input dataset pixels as to corn and soybeans for each of the corresponding years. The relevant pixels were then averaged by crop and time period to produce a county-level estimate of NDVI, the LSTs, and precipitation. They in turn were related to official annual NASS county level yield statistics. For the Corn Belt region as a whole, both corn and soybean yields were found to be positively correlated with NDVI in the middle of the summer and negatively correlated to daytime LST at that same time. Nighttime LST and precipitation showed no correlations to yield, regardless of the time prior or during the growing season. There was also slight suggestion of low NDVI and high daytime LST in the spring being positively related to final yields, again for both crops. Taking only NDVI and daytime LST as inputs from the 2006-2011 dataset, regression tree-based models were built and county-level, within-sample coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.93 were found for both crops. Limiting the models by systematically removing late season data showed the model performance to remain strong even at mid-season and still viable even earlier. Finally, the derived models were used to predict out-of-sample for the 2012 season, which ended up having an anomalous drought Yet, the county-level results compared reasonably well against official statistics with R-2 = 0.77 for corn and 0.71 for soybeans.

Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data and statistical methods were combined with laboratory-based mineral characterization of field samples to create maps of the distributions of clay, mica and carbonate minerals and their abundances. The Material Identification and Characterization Algorithm (MICA) was used to identify the spectrally-dominant minerals in field samples; these results were combined with ASTER data using multinomial logistic regression to map mineral distributions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to quantify mineral composition in field samples. XRD results were combined with ASTER data using multiple linear regression to map mineral abundances. We tested whether smoothing of the ASTER data to match the scale of variability of the target sample would improve model correlations. Smoothing was done with Fixed Rank Kriging (FRK) to represent the medium and long-range spatial variability in the ASTER data. Stronger correlations resulted using the smoothed data compared to results obtained with the original data. Highest model accuracies came from using both medium and long-range scaled ASTER data as input to the statistical models. High correlation coefficients were obtained for the abundances of calcite and mica (R-2 = 0.71 and 0.70, respectively). Moderately-high correlation coefficients were found for smectite and kaolinite (R-2 = 0.57 and 0.45, respectively). Maps of mineral distributions, obtained by relating ASTER data to MICA analysis of field samples, were found to characterize major soil mineral variability (overall accuracies for mica, smectite and kaolinite were 76%, 89% and 86% respectively). The results of this study suggest that the distributions of minerals and their abundances derived using FRK-smoothed ASTER data more closely match the spatial variability of soil and environmental properties at regional scale.

To date, there is no approach that can produce effective, physically consistent, global and multi-decadal energy-water flux data over land. Net radiation (R-n) can be quantified regionally using satellite retrievals of surface reflectance and thermal emittance with errors <10%. However, consistent, useful retrieval of latent heat flux (lambda E) from remote sensing is not yet possible. In theory, lambda E could be inferred as a residual of R-n, ground heat (G) and sensible heat (H) fluxes (R-n-H-G). However, large uncertainties in remote sensing of both H and G result in low accuracies for lambda E. Where vegetation is the dominant surface cover, lambda E is largely driven by transpiration of intercellular water through leaf stomata during the photosynthetic uptake of carbon. In these areas, satellite retrievals of photosynthesis (GPP) could be used to quantify transpiration rates through stomatal conductance. Here, we demonstrate how remote sensing of GPP could be applied to obtain lambda E from passive optical measurements of vegetation leaf reflectance related to the photosynthetic rate independent of knowledge of H, R-n and G. We validate the algorithm using five structurally and physiologically diverse eddy flux sites in western and central Canada. Results show that transpiration and H were accurately predicted from optical data and highly significant relationships were found between the energy budget obtained from eddy flux measurements and remote sensing (0.64 <= r(2) <= 0.85). We conclude that spaceborne estimates of GPP could significantly improve not only estimates of the carbon balance but also the energy balance over land. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Although recent research has documented how their spatial arrangement within a river affects salmonid distribution and behaviour, no information is currently available concerning temporal variation in the abundance and types of thermal refuges. In this study, a FLIR SC660 thermal infrared imaging camera (640 x 480 pixels, NETD <30 mK, 7.5-13 mu m) mounted on a helicopter platform was used to acquire thermal imagery of an Atlantic salmon river in Quebec, Canada on six occasions between 2009 and 2011, with a view to characterising temporal variability in thermal refuges and broader scale water temperature complexity. Thermal refuges detected from TIR imagery were classified into a series of process-based categories, revealing notable inter-survey variability in the absolute counts of each refuge type. Downstream temperature complexity, quantified as the standard deviation of derivatives taken of temperature long profiles of each survey, was highly temporally variable, exposing the presence of several warm and cool reaches which varied in magnitude between surveys. Data from local meteorological and discharge logging stations was used to examine whether hydrometeorological conditions could account for observed temporal variability trends. Temporal variability in the absolute counts of lateral groundwater seeps, the most frequently observed thermal refuge class, was shown to correlate strongly with long duration hydrometeorological metrics such as seasonal mean discharge (R-2 = 0.94, p < 0.01). Conversely, thermal refuges resulting from cold water tributaries were more temporally stable and exhibited a weaker correlation with hydrometeorological metrics. Downstream temperature complexity was shown to correlate best with short duration metrics such as cumulative precipitation depth within a 5-day period prior to each survey (R-2 = 0.90, p < 0.01). This study is the first of its kind to link thermal refuge dynamics to hydrometeorological conditions and may offer valuable insights into how changing climatic regimes could influence these important cold water units in the future.

Those limitations are less relevant now, and there is renewed interest in developing reliable methods of automatically and consistently classifying time series of remotely sensed images. Our objective was to develop a method of automatically classifying temporally irregular time series (i.e., non-anniversary date images in consecutive years) of images with a minimum of parameterization and a priori information. In contrast to traditional signature extension methods, the automatic adaptive signature generalization procedure (AASG) adapts class spectral signatures to individual images and therefore requires no image correction procedure. Class signatures are derived from pixels with stable land cover through time. We tested the performance of AASG relative to traditional signature extension with various image corrections, and explored the sensitivity of AASG to a thresholding parameter (c) controlling stable site identification. AASG performed as well as signature extension with atmospheric correction (kappa = 0.68), and better than signature extension with relative (kappa = 0.65) and TOA reflectance (kappa = 0.56) image corrections for a summer summer image pair. Additionally, we demonstrated the unique ability of AASG to adapt class signatures to phenological differences by classifying a summer winter image pair with a modest reduction in overall accuracy (kappa = 0.66). Observed sensitivity to c supported the hypothesis of an optimum value yielding enough training sites to describe class spectral variability, but conservative enough to minimize contamination of signatures due to classification errors. AASG offers significant advantages over traditional signature extension, particularly for temporally irregular time series. Although we demonstrated a simple implementation, the AASG approach is flexible and we outline several refinements which stand to improve performance. This development represents significant progress towards realizing the potential of long-term data archives to gain long-term understandings of global land cover dynamics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The long term mean salt flux shows seasonal reversals that are more pronounced in the northern Indian Ocean than in the southern Indian Ocean. Mean zonal salt flux is of a higher magnitude than the mean meridional salt flux. Wyrtki jets influence zonal salt flux in the equatorial region. Meridional salt flux is northward along the northeast (NE) African coast and western Bay of Bengal (BOB) during the southwest monsoon season. The opposite holds during the NE monsoon season. Empirical orthogonal function analyses of salt flux show that the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) primarily controls interannual variability with flux being westward during positive dipole events and eastward during negative dipole events. The co-occurrence of IOD with the El Nino Southern Ocean results in enhanced salt flux especially along the equatorial region. Spatially, the most variable regions are the NE African coast, eastern Arabian Sea, BoB and equatorial regions. This study will help interpret salinity data for the Indian Ocean from the recently launched Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity and Aquarius satellite salinity missions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This study proposes a new multi-sensor microwave remote sensing drought index, the Microwave Integrated Drought Index (MIDI), for monitoring short-term drought, especially the meteorological drought over semi-arid regions, by integrating three variables: Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) derived precipitation, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) derived soil moisture, and AMSR-E derived land surface temperature. Each variable was linearly scaled from 0 to 1 for each pixel based on absolute minimum and maximum values over time to relatively monitor drought. Pearson correlation analyses were performed between remote sensing drought indices and scale-dependent Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) during the growing season (April to October) from 2003 to 2010 to assess the capability of remotely sensed drought indices over three bioclimate regions in northern China. The results showed that MIDI with proper weights of three components outperformed individual remote sensing drought indices and other combined microwave drought indices in monitoring drought. It nearly possessed the best correlations with different time scale SPI; meanwhile it showed the highest correlation with 1-month SPI, and then decreased as SPI time scale increased, suggesting that the MIDI was a very reliable index in monitoring meteorological drought. Furthermore, similar spatial patterns and temporal changes were found between MIDI and 1- or 3-month SPI in monitoring drought. Therefore, the MIDI was recommended to be the optimum drought index, in monitoring short-term drought, especially for meteorological drought over cropland and grassland across northern China or similar regions globally with the ability to work in all weather conditions.

Validation is performed using comparison with results from other algorithms in addition to operational ice charts. Three ice types are resolved: young, first-year and multiyear. Total ice concentration from ECICE under cold Arctic winter conditions is in agreement with estimates from previous algorithms such as the enhanced NASA Team. Distribution of multiyear ice concentration from ECICE is presented along with evolution of daily concentration of each ice type. Events of melt-refreeze, which are common during seasonal transition periods, cause misidentification of multiyear ice as first-year ice in the fall. The reverse is observed in the spring. This is a limitation on ice type identification. ECICE is an optimal approach that minimizes the error between observations and predicted concentrations. It provides a confidence measure associated with each ice concentration estimate. It is a generic algorithm, i.e. its applications are not limited to AMSR-E and QuikSCAT.

To address this challenge, we have developed a cost-effective mapping procedure based on 250-m MODIS imagery that produces annual land-use/land-cover (LULC) maps for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). This procedure uses annual spectral statistics, collection of references samples with a Web-based tool, and tree-based Random Forests classifiers stratified by biome map regions to produce wall-to-wall, annual LULC maps for 2001 to 2010 that cover all of LAC. Across 26 map regions, overall pixel-level accuracy averaged 80.2 +/- 8.1% for eight basic LULC classes, and 84.6 +/- 6.5% for a five-class scheme. Municipality-scale area change between 2001 and 2010 in the three dominant classes (woody vegetation, mixed woody/plantation, and agriculture/herbaceous vegetation) was then estimated using regression models fit to 10 years of data, thus minimizing the impact of inter-annual class variation on change statistics. Closed-canopy forest area and change between 2001 and 2009 were well correlated with high-resolution maps of the Brazilian Legal Amazon (PRODES project). Our LAC-wide analysis of significant change revealed the recent extent and magnitude of deforestation hotspots, such as in the Amazon moist forests and the dry forests of Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia. Our data also revealed biome-specific clusters of municipalities with increasing woody vegetation due to forest recovery, reforestation, or woody encroachment. Taken as a whole, our MODIS-based mapping and trend modeling methodology can provide reliable land change data, not just for the tropics or for forest cover, but for all biomes and municipalities in LAC and including multiple LULC classes. Because this information can be produced quickly on an annual time scale, with internally-consistent data sources, it is a very useful tool for resource managers, policy makers, scientists and conservationists interested in tracking recent land change across broad-scale, political and environmental gradients.

However, reductions in the intensity of agricultural land use are also common and can lead to agricultural land abandonment Agricultural land abandonment has strong environmental and socio-economic consequences, but fine-scale and spatially explicit data on agricultural land abandonment are sparse, particularly in developing countries and countries with transition economies, such as the post-Soviet countries of Eastern Europe. Remote sensing can potentially fill this gap, but the satellite-based detection of fallow fields and shrub encroachment is difficult and requires the collection of multiple images during the growing season. The availability of such multi-seasonal cloud-free image dates is often limited. The goal of our study was to determine how much \"missing\" Landsat TM/ETM + images at key times in the growing season affect the accuracy of agricultural land abandonment classification. We selected a study area in temperate Eastern Europe where post-socialist agricultural land abandonment had become widespread and analyzed six near-anniversary cloud-free Landsat images from \"Spring\", \"Summer\" and \"Fall\" agriculturally defined seasons for a pre-abandonment-time I (1989) and post-abandonment-time 11 (1999/2000). Using a factorial experiment, we tested how the classification accuracy and spatial patterns of classified abandonment changed over all possible 49 image-date combinations when mapping both \"abandoned arable land\" and \"abandoned managed grassland\". The conditional Kappa of our best overall classification with support vector machines (SVM) was 90% for \"abandoned arable land\" and 72% for \"abandoned managed grassland\" when all six images were used for the classification. Classifications with fewer image dates resulted in a substantial decrease of the conditional Kappa (from 93 to 54% for \"abandoned arable land\" and from to 75 to 50% for \"abandoned managed grassland\"). We also observed substantial decrease in accurate detection of land abandonment patterns when we compared our best overall classification with the other 48 image date combinations (the Fuzzy Kappa, a measure of spatial similarity, ranged from 25.8 to 76.3% for \"abandoned arable land\" and from 30.4 to 79.5% for \"abandoned managed grassland\"). While the accuracy of the different abandonment classes was most sensitive to the number of image dates used for the classification, the seasons captured also mattered, and the importance of specific seasonal image dates varied between the pre- and post-abandonment dates. For \"abandoned arable land\" it was important to have at least one \"Spring\" or \"Summer\" image for pre-abandonment and as many images as possible for post-abandonment with a \"Spring\" image again being most important For \"abandoned managed grassland\" no specific seasonal image dates yielded statistically significantly more accurate classifications. The factor that influenced the accurate detection of \"abandoned managed grassland\" was the number of multi-seasonal image dates (the more the better), rather than their exact dates. We also tested whether SVM performed better than the maximum likelihood classifier. SVM outperformed the maximum likelihood classifier only for \"abandoned arable land\" and only in image-date-rich cases. Our results showed that limited image-date availability in the Landsat record placed substantial limits on the accuracy of agricultural abandonment classifications and accurately detected agricultural land abandonment patterns.   Thus, we warn to use agricultural land abandonment maps produced with the suboptimal image dates with caution, especially when the accurate rates and the patterns of agricultural land abandonment are crucial (e.g.. for LULCC models). The abundance of agricultural abandonment in many parts of the world and its strong ecological and socio-economic consequences suggest that better monitoring of abandonment is necessary, and our results illustrated the image dates that were most important to accomplishing this task.

We use predictors extracted from the Canopy Height Model to compare models of varying complexity: single or multiple regressions and nested models that predict BA by independent estimates of stem density and quadratic mean diameter. Direct multiple regression was the most accurate, giving a 9.6% Root Mean Squared Error of Prediction (RMSEP). The magnitude of the various errors introduced during the data collection stage is evaluated and their contribution to MSEP is analyzed. It was found that these errors accounted for less than 10% of model MSEP, suggesting that there is considerable scope for model improvement. Although site-specific models showed lower MSEP than global models, stratification by site may not be the optimal solution. The key to future improvement would appear to lie in a stratification that captures variations in relations between LiDAR and forest structure. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

A fully automated algorithm, exploiting the synergy of SAR and optical remote sensing for the calibration of a semi-empirical model (Santoro et al., 2011; Cartus et al., 2011), was adopted to map forest aboveground biomass with L-band HH and HV intensity in the northeastern United States. In the retrieval algorithm, a semi-empirical model is calibrated and inverted for each HH and HV image to estimate biomass at the pixel level. Where possible, biomass estimates for single images in a multi-temporal stack were combined in a weighted manner. A comparison with the National Biomass and Carbon Dataset, NBCD 2000 (Kellndorfer et al., in preparation), at different spatial scales indicated the feasibility of the automated biomass retrieval approach and confirmed previous findings that the retrieval accuracy for HV intensity is consistently better than that for HH intensity and depends on the imaging conditions. The weighted combination of the biomass estimates from each intensity image in a multi-temporal stack significantly improved the retrieval performance. Because of regional differences in the multi-temporal coverage with ALOS PALSAR dual polarization data (1-5 images for 2007/08) and the pronounced dependence of the retrieval for single images on the imaging conditions, the possibility of producing maps with consistent accuracy at high resolution was found to be limited. Accurate biomass estimates were obtained when aggregating the ALOS biomass maps at county scale and comparing the estimates to Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) county statistics (RMSE = 12.9 t/ha, R-2 = 0.86).

Investigated oceanographic regions comprise the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, the northern Adriatic Sea, the Westem Black Sea and the Baltic Sea. The in situ measurements applied in the study were produced within the framework of the Coastal Atmosphere and Sea Time Series (COASTS) and Rio-Optical Mapping of Marine Properties (BiOMaP) programs contributing to a unique dataset that represents different water types including chlorophyll a, yellow substance and sediment dominated waters. Performance analysis of the proposed regional MLPs indicates that Chl-a can be quantified with the highest accuracy in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (with absolute percent difference of 14% with respect to in situ measurements). In the case of a(ys)(412), the most accurate determination is observed for the Baltic Sea waters (13%). Instead, TSM retrieval is the most accurate in the Black Sea (14%). The study demonstrated the limited generalization capability of regional algorithms.

Assimilation may be used to correct the model state and improve the estimates of the model parameters or external forcing. One common observation assimilated is the water level at various points along the modelled reach. Distributed water levels may be estimated indirectly along the flood extents in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images by intersecting the extents with the floodplain topography. It is necessary to select a subset of levels for assimilation because adjacent levels along the flood extent will be strongly correlated. A method for selecting such a subset automatically and in near real-time is described, which would allow the SAR water levels to be used in a forecasting model. The method first selects candidate waterline points in flooded rural areas having low slope. The waterline levels and positions are corrected for the effects of double reflections between the water surface and emergent vegetation at the flood edge. Waterline points are also selected in flooded urban areas away from radar shadow and layover caused by buildings, with levels similar to those in adjacent rural areas. The resulting points are thinned to reduce spatial autocorrelation using a top-down clustering approach. The method was developed using a TerraSAR-X image from a particular case study involving urban and rural flooding. The waterline points extracted proved to be spatially uncorrelated, with levels reasonably similar to those determined manually from aerial photographs, and in good agreement with those of nearby gauges.

The objective of this study was to evaluate a parameterization of the forest emissivity, for dense needleleaf forests at four Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) frequencies (37, 19, 10.7, and 6.9 GHz). The tau-omega radiative transfer model was used, but considering transmissivity (gamma) at an incidence angle of 55 degrees for the optical thickness (tau). The approch was as follows: 1) high resolution airborne data at 19 and 37 GHz were used to derive the equivalent or effective forest parameters (gamma-omega) knowing the contribution of the snow-soil emission from non-forested pixels, 2) these gamma-omega values were verified using winter radiometric in situ measurements from different forest sites where the brightness temperature (Tb) values above and under the canopy were considered, 3) these gamma-omega values were applied and the frequency was extended on a large AMSR-E summer dataset for dense boreal forest sites. The airborne-derived values were consistent with in situ measurements as well as with satellite-based observations. We found that at AMSR-E frequencies, transmissivity values spectrally decreased from 0.67 to 0.41 for frequencies from 6.9 to 37 GHz. The single scattering albedo (omega) can be considered frequency independent at omega approximate to 0.064 +/- 0.005. A soil parameterization (QH model) at different frequencies was also proposed for boreal forests. We discuss these new gamma-omega values and the soil parameterization within the context of the relevant literature. The results are of particular interest for various remote sensing applications based on passive microwave sensor observations over boreal forests, such as the retrieval of soil moisture and the monitoring of snow characteristics under the canopy.

The PEST parameter estimation algorithm was implemented to adjust the leaf area growth parameters of the CSM by minimizing error between measured and simulated NDVI or canopy spectral reflectance. A genetic algorithm was implemented to identify the optimum combination of remote sensing observations required to optimize simulations of LAI through model inversion. The relative root mean squared error (RRMSE) between measured and simulated LAI was 24.1% for the CSM-PROSAIL model, whereas the stand-alone PROSAIL and CSM models simulated LAI with RRMSEs of 40.7% and 27.8%, respectively. Wheat yield was simulated with RRMSEs of 12.8% and 10.0% for the lone CSM model and the CSM-PROSAIL model, respectively. Optimized leaf area growth parameters for CSM-PROSAIL were different among cultivars (p<0.05), while those for CSM-Choudhury were not. Only two observations, one at mid-vegetative growth and one at maximum vegetative growth, were required to optimize LAI simulations for CSM-PROSAIL, whereas CSM-Choudhury required four observations. Inverting CSM-PROSAIL using hyperspectral data offered several advantages as compared to the CSM-Choudhury inversion using a simple vegetation index, including better estimates of crop biophysical properties, different leaf area growth parameter estimates among cultivars (p<0.05), and fewer required remote sensing observations for optimum LAI simulation.

While many ground-based reports of declining vegetation productivity have been published over the last decades, a number of recent publications have shown a nuanced and, for some regions, positive picture. With this background, the paper provides an analysis of trends in vegetation greenness of semi-arid areas using AVHRR GIMMS from 1981 to 2007. The vegetation index dataset is used as a proxy for vegetation productivity and trends are analyzed for characterization of changes in semi-arid vegetation greenness. Calculated vegetation trends are analyzed with gridded data on potential climatic constraints to plant growth to explore possible causes of the observed changes. An analysis of changes in the seasonal variation of vegetation greenness and climatic drivers is conducted for selected regions to further understand the causes of observed inter-annual vegetation changes in semi-arid areas across the globe. It is concluded that semi-arid areas, across the globe, on average experience an increase in greenness (0.015 NDVI units over the period of analysis). Further it is observed that increases in greenness are found both in semi-arid areas where precipitation is the dominating limiting factor for plant production (0.019 NDVI units) and in semi-arid areas where air temperature is the primarily growth constraint (0.013 NDVI units). Finally, in the analysis of changes in the intra-annual variation of greenness it is found that seemingly similar increases in greenness over the study period may have widely different explanations. This implies that current generalizations, claiming that land degradation is ongoing in semi-arid areas worldwide, are not supported by the satellite based analysis of vegetation greenness.

The instrument was deployed on the NASA Langley 13200 aircraft together with the High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL), which provides information on the distribution of the aerosol layers beneath the aircraft, including an accurate estimate of aerosol optical depth.   This work illustrates the merits of polarization measurements in detecting variations of ocean surface properties linked to the presence of an oil slick. In particular, we make use of the degree of linear polarization in the glint region, which is severely affected by variations in the refractive index but insensitive to the waviness of the water surface. Alterations in the surface optical properties are therefore expected to directly affect the polarization response of the RSP channel at 2264 nm, where both molecular and aerosol scattering are negligible and virtually all of the observed signal is generated via Fresnel reflection at the surface. The glint profile at this wavelength is fitted with a model which can optimally estimate refractive index, wind speed and direction, together with aircraft attitude variations affecting the viewing geometry. The retrieved refractive index markedly increases over oil-contaminated waters, while the apparent wind speed is significantly lower than in adjacent uncontaminated areas, suggesting that the slick dampens high-frequency components of the ocean wave spectrum.   The constraint on surface reflectance provided by the short-wave infrared channels is a cornerstone of established procedures to retrieve atmospheric aerosol microphysical parameters based on the inversion of the RSP multispectral measurements. This retrieval, which benefits from the ancillary information provided by the HSRL, was in this specific case hampered by prohibitive variability in atmospheric conditions (very inhomogeneous aerosol distribution and cloud cover). Although the results presented for the surface are essentially unaffected, we discuss the results obtained by typing algorithms in sorting the complex mix of aerosol types, and show evidence of oriented ice in cirrus clouds present in the area. In this context, polarization measurements at 1880 nm were used to infer ice habit and cirrus optical depth, which was found in the subvisual/threshold-visible regime, confirming the utility of the aforementioned RSP channel for the remote sensing of even thin cold clouds.

We developed a method for estimating soil thermal inertia using two daily measurements of surface temperature, to capture the diurnal range, and diurnal time series of net radiation and specific humidity. The method solves for soil thermal inertia assuming homogeneous 1-D diffusion of heat near the land surface. The solution uses a boundary condition taken as the maximum likelihood estimate of ground heat flux made by a probabilistic uncertainty model of the partitioning of net radiation based on the theory of maximum entropy production (MEP model). We showed that by coupling the 1-D diffusion and MEP models of energy transfer at the land surface, the number of free parameters in the MEP model can be reduced from two (P soil thermal inertia and I thermal inertia of convective heat transfer to the atmosphere) to one (P is defined by I). A sensitivity analysis suggested that, for the purpose of estimating thermal inertia, the coupled model should be parameterized by the ratio P/I. The coupled model was demonstrated at two semi-arid sites in the southwest United States to estimate thermal inertia and these thermal inertia values were used to estimate soil moisture. We found 1) parameterizing the MEP model with a constant annual P/I value resulted in surface flux estimates which were similar to those made when daily P and I parameters were derived directly from measurements of ground heat flux (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency>0.95): 2) estimates of P made using the coupled model were superior to those made using the diffusion model with a common linear approximation of the ground heat flux boundary condition: and 3) thermal inertia was a better predictor of soil moisture in moderately wet conditions than in dry conditions due to a lack of sensitivity of thermal inertia to changes in soil moisture at low moisture contents.

In spite of an enormous number of previous studies in urban remote sensing applications, only a few studies have been conducted on the techniques in the quantification, qualification, and visualization of the changes in time-series urban land cover fractions (LCFs) derived through spectral unmixing. To examine the urbanization process in four major cities around the Poyang Lake area in Jiangxi Province, China - Nanchang, Jingdezhen, Yingtan, and Poyang - using a time-series Landsat-5 TM dataset in 1987, 1993, 1999, 2004, and 2009, we investigated: (1) the approach to the derivation of LCFs in urban areas using multi-temporal remotely-sensed data set; and (2) the approach to the summarization and cartographic manipulation of the changes in time-series LCFs. To account for the complex spectral confusion among different land cover materials in built-up areas, the Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) was used for unmixing the pixels. The Land Cover Change Intensity (LCCI) was proposed to derive the average daily change rate in terms of the area within a pixel for the land cover classes of green vegetation, nonphotosynthetic vegetation and soil, and built-up areas between two consecutive TM observation dates. The dominant LCCI (DLCCI) was proposed to determine in which period the urban areas were developed most rapidly and how intense the urbanization process was in each pixel of the time-series LCCI maps. Our results showed that MESMA could accurately model the pixels in urban areas with complex spectral confusion of different land cover materials. The comparison of derived land cover fractions with socioeconomic statistics disclosed the strong positive correlation between built-up fractions and urban population as well as gross GDP and GDPs in secondary and tertiary industries. LCCI and DLCCI revealed two mechanisms of urbanization, which are new land developments and redevelopments of built-up areas. Consequently, we found that the four cities around the Poyang Lake were urbanized through different mechanisms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In order to better understand how wetland type and area differ over a range of spatial and thematic scales, this paper introduces a multi-scale geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) approach that incorporates new object-based texture measures (geotex) and a decision-tree classifier (See5), to assess wetland differences through five common spatial resolutions (5, 10, 15. 20 and 30 m) and two different thematic classification schemes. Themes are based on (i) a Ducks Unlimited (DU: 15 class) regional classification system for wetlands in the Boreal Plain Ecosystem and (ii) the Canadian Wetland Inventory (CWI: 5 classes). Results reveal that the highest overall accuracies (67.9% and 82.2%) were achieved at the 10 m spatial resolution for both the DU and CWI classification schemes respectively. It was also found that the DU wetland types experienced greater area differences through scale with the largest differences for both classification schemes occurring in classes with a large treed component. Results further show that the inclusion of geotex channels (generated from dynamically sized and shaped window that measures the spatial variability of the wetland components composing a scene, rather than of individual pixels within a fixed sized window) improved wetland classification.

Lac des Allemands, a freshwater lake of 49 km(2) southwest of New Orleans, Louisiana on the upper end of the Barataria Estuary, provides a natural laboratory for remote characterization of cyanobacterial blooms because of their seasonal occurrence. The Oceansat-1 satellite Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) provides measurements similar to SeaWiFS but with higher spatial resolution, and this work is the first attempt to use OCM measurements to quantify cyanobacterial pigments. The satellite signal was first vicariously calibrated using SeaWiFS as a reference, and then corrected to remove the atmospheric effects using a customized atmospheric correction procedure. Then, empirical inversion algorithms were developed to convert the OCM remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) at bands 4 and 5 (centered at 510.6 and 556.4 nm, respectively) to concentrations of phycocyanin (PC), the primary cyanobacterial pigment. A holistic approach was used to minimize the influence of other optically active constituents on the PC algorithm. Similarly, empirical algorithms to estimate chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations were developed using OCM bands 5 and 6 (centered at 556.4 and 669 nm, respectively). The best PC algorithm (R-2 = 0.7450, p < 0.0001, n = 72) yielded a root mean square error (RMSE) of 36.92 mu g/L with a relative RMSE of 10.27% (PC from 2.75 to 363.50 mu g/L, n = 48). The best algorithm for Chl a (R-2 = 0.7510, p < 0.0001, n = 72) produced an RMSE of 31.19 mu g/L with a relative RMSE of 16.56% (Chl a from 9.46 to 212.76 mu g/L, n = 48). While more field data are required to further validate the long-term performance of these algorithms, currently they represent the best protocol for establishing a long time-series of cyanobacterial blooms in the Lac des Allemands using OCM data.

Microwave remote sensing offers the possibility of quantifying surface soil moisture conditions over large spatial extents. Capturing soil moisture anomalies normally requires a long temporal record of data, which most operating satellites do not have. This research examines the use of surface soil moisture from the AMSR-E passive microwave satellite to derive surface soil moisture anomalies by exploiting spatial resolution to compensate for the shorter temporal record of the satellite sensor. Four methods were used to spatially aggregate information to develop a surface soil moisture anomaly (SMA). Two of these methods used soil survey and climatological zones to define regions of homogeneity, based on the Soil Landscapes of Canada (SLC) and the EcoDistrict nested hierarchy. The second two methods (ObShp3 and ObShp5) used zones defined by a data driven segmentation of the satellite soil moisture data. The level of sensitivity of the calculated SMA decreased as the number of pixels used in the spatial aggregation increased, with the average error reducing to less than 5% when more than 15 pixels are used. All methods of spatial aggregation showed somewhat weak but consistent relationship to in situ soil moisture anomalies and meteorological drought indices. The size of the regions used for aggregation was more important than the method used to create the regions. Based on the error and the relationship to the in situ and ancillary data sets, the EcoDistrict or ObShp3 scale appears to provide the lowest error in calculating the SMA baseline. This research demonstrates that the use of spatial aggregation can provide useful information on soil moisture anomalies where satellite records of data are temporally short.

However, compared to satellite data of similar spatial resolution and extent, the small footprint airborne lidar data required to produce such models remain expensive. In an effort to reduce these costs, the primary objective of this paper is to develop an airborne lidar sampling strategy to model full-scene forest canopy height from optical imagery, lidar transects and Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA). To achieve this goal, this research focuses on (i) determining appropriate lidar transect features (i.e., location, direction and extent) from an optical scene, (ii) developing a mechanism to model forest canopy height for the full-scene based on a minimum number of lidar transects, and (iii) defining an optimal mean object size (MOS) to accurately model the canopy composition and height distribution. Results show that (i) the transect locations derived from our optimal lidar transect selection algorithm accurately capture the canopy height variability of the entire study area; (ii) our canopy height estimation models have similar performance in two lidar transect directions (i.e., north-south and west-east); (iii) a small lidar extent (17.6% of total size) can achieve similar canopy height estimation accuracies as those modeled from the full lidar scene; and (iv) different MOS can lead to distinctly different canopy height results. By comparing the best canopy height estimate with the full lidar canopy height data, we obtained average estimation errors of 6.0 m and 6.8 m for conifer and deciduous forests at the individual tree crown/small tree cluster level, and an area weighted combined error of 6.2 m, which is lower than the provincial forest inventory height class interval (i.e., approximate to 9.0 m).

A normal approach is to use spectral information alone and ignore spatial information and a group of pixels that need to be considered together as an object We used QuickBird image data over a central region in the city of Phoenix, Arizona to examine if an object-based classifier can accurately identify urban classes. To demonstrate if spectral information alone is practical in urban classification, we used spectra of the selected classes from randomly selected points to examine if they can be effectively discriminated. The overall accuracy based on spectral information alone reached only about 63.33%. We employed five different classification procedures with the object-based paradigm that separates spatially and spectrally similar pixels at different scales. The classifiers to assign land covers to segmented objects used in the study include membership functions and the nearest neighbor classifier. The object-based classifier achieved a high overall accuracy (90.40%), whereas the most commonly used decision rule, namely maximum likelihood classifier, produced a lower overall accuracy (67.60%). This study demonstrates that the object-based classifier is a significantly better approach than the classical per-pixel classifiers. Further, this study reviews application of different parameters for segmentation and classification, combined use of composite and original bands, selection of different scale levels, and choice of classifiers. Strengths and weaknesses of the object-based prototype are presented and we provide suggestions to avoid or minimize uncertainties and limitations associated with the approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We analyzed 10 years (7/99-10/09) of SeaWinds active microwave Ku-band backscatter data collected over the Amazon Basin, developing monthly means and anomalies from those means in an effort to detect landscape responses to this drought. We compared these to seasonal accumulating water deficit anomalies generated using Tropical Rainfall Monitoring Mission (TRMM) precipitation data (1999-2009) and 100 mm mo(-1) evapotranspiration demand as a water deficit threshold. There was significant interannual variability in dry-season monthly mean backscatter only for morning (c. 06:00 LST) overpass data, and little interannual variability in dry-season monthly mean backscatter for afternoon (c. 18:00 LST) overpass data. Strong negative anomalies in both morning-overpass backscatter and accumulating water deficit developed during July-October 2005, centered on the southwestern Amazon Basin, with a strong spatial correlation between morning-overpass backscatter anomalies and water deficit anomalies in September. This is the first reporting of tropical forest seasonal drought detection by active microwave scatterometry. Based on the differences between early-morning and late-afternoon backscatter variability, we hypothesize that as the drought persisted over several months, the forest canopy was increasingly unable to recover full leaf moisture content over night, resulting in anomalously low early-morning overpass backscatter.

However, detecting how much of this capacity is actually realized is a more challenging goal. Is it possible to remotely assess actual carbon fluxes? Can this be done at leaf, canopy and ecosystem scales and at different temporal scales? Different approaches can be used to answer these questions. Among them, the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) derived from narrow-band spectroradiometers is a spectral index increasingly being used as an indicator of photosynthetic efficiency. We examined and synthesized the scientific literature on the relationships between PRI and several ecophysiological variables across a range of plant functional types and ecosystems at the leaf, canopy and ecosystem levels and at the daily and seasonal time scales. Our analysis shows that although the strength of these relationships varied across vegetation types, levels of organization and temporal scales, in most reviewed articles PRI was a good predictor of photosynthetic efficiency or related variables with performances at least as good as the widely used NDVI as indicator of green biomass. There are possible confounding factors related to the intensity of the physiological processes linked to the PRI signals, to the structure of the canopies and to the illumination and viewing angles that warrant further studies, and it is expected that the utility of PRI will vary with the ecosystem in question due to contrasting environmental constraints, evolutionary strategies, and radiation use efficiency (RUE; the ratio between carbon uptake and light absorbed by vegetation) variability. Clearly, more research comparing ecosystem responses is warranted. Additionally, like any 2-band index that is affected by multiple factors, the interpretation of PRI can be readily confounded by multiple environmental variables, and further work is needed to understand and constrain these effects. Despite these limitations, this review shows an emerging consistency of the RUE-PRI relationship that suggests a surprising degree of functional convergence of biochemical, physiological and structural components affecting leaf, canopy and ecosystem carbon uptake efficiencies. PRI accounted for 42%, 59% and 62% of the variability of RUE at the leaf, canopy and ecosystem respective levels in unique exponential relationships for all the vegetation types studied. It seems thus that by complementing the estimations of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the vegetation (FPAR), estimated with NDVI-like indices, PRI enables improved assessment of carbon fluxes in leaves, canopies and many of the ecosystems of the world from ground, airborne and satellite sensors.

The success of this technique is dependent upon efficient cloud removal during the compositing process. Example wintertime maximum (-374,000 km(2)) and summertime minimum (similar to 112,000 km(2)) fast-ice maps for the entire East Antarctic coast are presented. The summertime minimum map provides the first high-resolution indication of multi-year fast-ice extent, which may be used to help assess changes in Antarctic sea-ice volume. The 2 sigma errors in fast-ice extent are estimated to be +/- 2.98% when >= 90% of the fast-ice pixels in a 20-day period are classified using the MODIS composite, or +/-8.76 otherwise (when augmenting AMSR-E or the previous/next MODIS composite image is used to classify >10% of the fast ice). Imperfect composite image quality, caused by persistent cloud, inaccurate cloud masking or a highly dynamic fast-ice edge, was the biggest impediment to automating the fast-ice detection procedure.

The Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) onboard the Metop satellite (VV polarization, C-band at 5.255 GHz), based on a large extent on the heritage of the ERS scatterometer, provides a soil moisture product available at a coarse spatial resolution (25 km and 50 km) and at a nearly daily time step. This study evaluates the accuracy of the new 25 km ASCAT derived saturation degree product by using in situ observations and the outcomes of a soil water balance model for three sites located in an inland region of central Italy. The comparison is carried out for a 2-year period (2007-2008) and three products derived from ASCAT: the surface saturation degree, m(s), the exponentially filtered soil wetness index. SWI, and its linear transformation, SWI*, matching the range of variability of ground data. Overall, the performance of the three products is found to be quite good with correlation coefficients higher than 0.92 and 0.80 when the SWI is compared with in situ and simulated saturation degree, respectively. Considering SWI*, the root mean square error is less than 0.035 m(3)/m(3) and 0.042 m(3)/m(3) for in situ and simulated saturation degree, respectively. More notably, when the ms product is compared with modeled data at 3 cm depth, this index is found able to accurately reproduce the temporal pattern of the simulated saturation degree in terms of both timing and entity of its variations also at fine temporal scale. The daily temporal resolution and the reliability obtained with the ASCAT derived saturation degree products represent the preliminary step for its effective use in operational rainfall-runoff modeling.

Multiple studies have used high spatial resolution satellite data to map areas of beetle kill; these studies have largely focused on mapping red canopy cover associated with recent tree mortality and have not examined mapping gray canopy cover that occurs after red needles have dropped. The work presented here examines the use of newly available GeoEye-1 data for mapping both red and gray canopy area in southeastern Wyoming lodgepole pine forest. A 0.5 m spatial resolution, pan-sharpened GeoEye-1 image was used to classify areas of green, red, and gray canopy cover. Reference data were collected at twelve 500 m(2) field plots. Shadow-normalized green, red, and gray canopy area from classified GeoEye-1 data closely agreed with field-estimated green, red, and gray canopy area. Mean absolute error in canopy cover for the twelve sample plots was 8.3% for the green class, 5.4% for the red class, and 7.2% for the gray class. When all twelve plots were aggregated, remotely sensed estimates of green, red, and gray cover were within 1.7% of the field-estimated cover. Our results demonstrate that high spatial resolution spaceborne multispectral data are a promising tool for mapping canopy mortality caused by mountain pine beetle outbreaks. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The algorithm first uses a \"dynamic lower envelope\" approach to sample the MODIS dark-pixel reflectance data in low AOT conditions, to derive the local surface visible (0.65 mu m)/near infrared (NIR, 2.1 mu m) reflectance ratio. Joint retrievals of AOT at 0.65 mu m and surface reflectance at 2.1 mu m are then performed, based on the time, location, and spectral-dependent single scattering properties of the dusty atmosphere as simulated by the GEOS-Chem. A linearized vector radiative transfer model (VLIDORT) that simultaneously computes the top-of-atmosphere reflectance and its Jacobian with respect to AOT, is used in the forward component of the inversion of MODIS reflectance to AOT. Comparison of retrieved AOT results in April and May of 2008 with AERONET observations shows a strong correlation (R = 0.83), with small bias (0.01), and small RMSE (0.17); the figures are a substantial improvement over corresponding values obtained with the MODIS Collection 5 AOT algorithm for the same study region and time period. The small bias is partially due to the consideration of dust effect at 2.1 mu m channel, without which the bias is -0.05. The surface PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 mu m) concentrations derived using this improved AOT retrieval show better agreement with ground observations than those derived from GEOS-Chem simulations alone, or those inferred from the MODIS Collection 5 AOT. This study underscores the value of using satellite reflectance to improve the air quality modeling and monitoring. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Earlier generation remote sensing data, such as Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) do not generally lead to robust representations of impervious surface area due to poor spectral differentiation between impervious and non-impervious surfaces lacking vegetation. In the 1970s, however, the USGS completed a comprehensive mapping of land cover based on aerial photography called the Geographic Information Retrieval and Analysis System (GIRAS). In this paper we describe a methodology for retrieving ISA estimates through the fusion of GIRAS land cover with historic and contemporary remote sensing data, resulting in a data set that is temporally comparable to more modern data sets (e.g. the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) ISA product). We calculate correlation coefficients between our data set and digitized aerial photography at 4 spatial resolutions, exhibiting a maximum correlation of 0.65 at 120-m and 240-rn pixel sizes. Our highest resolution product (30-m) exhibited 94% accuracy and a kappa coefficient of 36% in rural areas, and 90.7% accuracy and a kappa coefficient of 59.6% in suburban areas. Further, we show that trends in urban area through time derived from these data exhibit accelerating rates of development throughout the Potomac River basin 1975-2001, including increased development in riparian buffer zones and on steeper topography. These results are applicable wherever low-resolution vector-based data sets of urban area are available or could be generated for the pre-Landsat TM era. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We compiled numerous indicators of these resources into a geographic information system along with concurrent investigative results. This effort required acquisition and analysis of spaceborne multispectral and airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data for early-stage geothermal exploration. We identified minerals such as alunite, kaolinite, and montmorillonite through analysis of hyperspectral data indicating regions of hydrothermally altered rock associated with areas of geothermal potential. Tertiary volcanic and granitic rocks also contain these indicator minerals. Quaternary environments displayed gypsum-bearing evaporite crusts that we postulate were deposited by sulfate-rich thermal waters. Throughout the PLPTL, tufa towers and tufa shoreline deposits are extensively distributed as remnants of paleo-lake Lahontan. Based on measured spectra of calcium carbonate, we mapped tufa towers elucidating the strike direction of associated faults. Additionally, we correlated remotely-derived maps of shoreline tufa deposits with climate-related changes in lake level. Our mapping results helped guide detailed exploration efforts to areas with the most geothermal potential. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated the relationship between SRTM X-band InSAR height and above-ground biomass in a study area in southern Norway. We generated biomass reference data for each SRTM pixel from a field inventory in combination with airborne laser scanning (ALS). One set of forest inventory plots served for calibrating ALS based biomass models, and another set of field plots was used to validate these models. The biomass values obtained in this way ranged up to 250 t/ha at the stand level. The relationship between biomass and InSAR height was linear, no apparent saturation effect was present, and the accuracy was high (RMSE = 19%). The relationship differed between Norway spruce and Scots pine, where an increase in InSAR height of 1 m corresponded to an increase in biomass of 9.9 and 7.0 t/ha. respectively. Using a high-quality terrain model from ALS enabled biomass to be estimated with a higher accuracy as compared to using a terrain model from topographic maps. Interferometric X-band SAR appears to be a promising method for forest biomass monitoring. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We address these shortfalls with a new model which estimates aerodynamic roughness length (z(0)) using angular reflectance of a rough surface. The new model is proportional to the frontal area index, directional, and represents the geometric anisotropy of z(0). The model explained most of the variation in two sets of wind tunnel measurements of aerodynamic roughness lengths (z(0)). Field estimates of z(0) for varying wind directions were similar to predictions made by the new model. The model was used to estimate the erodible area exposed to abrasion by saltating particles. Vertically integrated horizontal flux (F(h)) was calculated using the area not covered by non-erodible hemispheres; the approach embodied in dust emission models. Under the same model conditions, F(h) estimated using the new model was up to 85% smaller than that using the conventional area not covered. These F(h) simulations imply that wind erosion and dust emission models without geometric anisotropic sheltering of the surface, may considerably over-estimate F(h) and hence the amount of dust emission. The new model provides a straightforward method to estimate aerodynamic resistance with the potential to improve the accuracy of wind erosion and dust emission models, a measure that can be retrieved using bi-directional reflectance models from angular satellite sensors, and an alternative to notoriously unreliable field estimates of z(0) and their extrapolations across landform scales.

The Rhone Delta (Camargue) in southern France encloses 9200 ha of fragmented reed marshes actively managed for reed harvesting, waterfowl hunting or cattle grazing, and holding significant numbers of vulnerable European birds. We used multi-season SPOT-5 data in conjunction with ground survey to assess the predictive power of satellite imagery in modelling indicators of reed structure (height, diameter, density and cover of green/dry stems) relevant to ecosystem management and bird ecology. All indicators could be predicted accurately with a combination of bands (SWIR, NIR) and indices (SAVI, OSAVI, NDWI, DVI, DVW, MSI) issued from scenes of March, June, July, September or December and subtraction between these. All models were robust when validated with an independent set of satellite and field data. The high spatial resolution of SPOT-5 scenes (pixel of 10 x 10 m) permits the monitoring of detailed attributes characterizing the reed ecosystem across a large spatial extent, providing a scientifically-based, replicable tool for managers, stakeholders and decision-makers to follow wetland conditions in the short and long-term. Combined with models on the ecological requirements of vulnerable bird species, these tools can provide maps of potential species ranges at spatial extents that are relevant to ecosystem functioning and bird populations.

This algorithm is based on the spectral-temporal properties of land cover and forest change processes, and requires little or no fine tuning for most forests with closed or near close canopy cover. It was found very efficient, taking 2-3 h on average to analyze an LTSS consisting of 12 or more Landsat images using an average desktop PC. This LTSS-VCT approach has been used to examine disturbance patterns with a biennial temporal interval from 1984 to 2006 for many locations across the conterminous U.S. Accuracy assessment over 6 validation sites revealed that overall accuracies of around 80% were achieved for disturbances mapped at individual year level. Average user\'s and producer\'s accuracies of the disturbance classes were around 70% and 60% in 5 of the 6 sites, respectively, suggesting that although forest disturbances were typically rare as compared with nochange classes, on average the VCT detected more than half of those disturbances with relatively low levels of false alarms. Field assessment revealed that VCT was able to detect most stand clearing disturbance events, including harvest, fire, and urban development, while some non-stand clearing events such as thinning and selective logging were also mapped in western U.S. The applicability of the LTSS-VCT approach depends on the availability of a temporally adequate supply of Landsat imagery. To ensure that forest disturbance records can be developed continuously in the future, it is necessary to plan and develop observational capabilities today that will allow continuous acquisition of frequent Landsat or Landsat-like observations.

Using a joint inversion of ascending and descending interferograms. we evaluated the geometry and time-dependent progression of a horizontally extended pressurized source beneath the Lazufre volcanic system. Our results hence indicate that an extended magma body at a depth between 10 and 15 kin would account for most of the ground uplift The maximum inflation reached up to -40 cm during 2003-2008.

These series, which are non-stationary and present short-term, seasonal and long-term variations, can be decomposed using this MRA as a sum of series associated with different temporal scales. The main focus of the paper is to check the potential of this MRA to capture and describe both intra- and inter-annual changes in the data, i.e., to discuss the ability of the proposed procedure to monitor vegetation dynamics at regional scale. Our approach concentrates on what wavelet analysis can tell us about a NDVI time series. On the one hand, the intro-annual series, linked to the seasonality, has been used to estimate different key features related to the vegetation phenology, which depend on the vegetation cover type. On the other hand, the inter-annual series has been used to identify the trend, which is related to land-cover changes, and a Mann-Kendall test has been applied to confirm the significance of the observed trends. NDVI images from the MEDOKADS (Mediterranean Extended Daily One-km AVHRR Data Set) imagery series over Spain are processed according to a per-pixel strategy for this study. Results show that the wavelet analysis provides relevant information about vegetation dynamics at regional scale, such as the mean and minimum NDVI value, the amplitude of the phenological cycle, the timing of the maximum NDVI and the magnitude of the land-cover change. The latter, in combination with precipitation data, has been used to interpret the observed land-cover changes and identify those subtle changes associated to land degradation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In this light, the present study investigates the potential of Hyperspectral Mixture Analysis. Specific focus lies on a thorough study of non-linear mixing effects caused by multiple photon scattering. In a series of experiments the importance of multiple scattering is demonstrated while a novel conceptual Nonlinear Spectral Mixture Analysis approach is presented and successfully tested on in situ measured mixed pixels in Citrus sinensis L. orchards. The rationale behind the approach is the redistribution of nonlinear fractions (i.e., virtual fractions) among the actual physical ground cover entities (e.g., tree, soil). These \'virtual\' fractions, which account for the extent and nature of multiple photon scattering only have a physical meaning at the spectral level but cannot be interpreted as an actual physical part of the ground cover. Results illustrate that the effect of multiple scattering on Spectral Mixture Analysis is significant as the linear approach provides a mean relative root mean square error (RMSE) for tree cover fraction estimates of 27%. While traditional nonlinear approaches only slightly reduce this error (RMSE=23%), important improvements are obtained for the novel Nonlinear Spectral Mixture Analysis approach (RMSE=12%).

Accurate estimation of fractional cover is especially important for monitoring and modeling savanna systems, subject to highly seasonal rainfall and drought, grazing by domestic and native animals, and frequent burning. This paper describes a method for resolving f(PV), f(NPV) and f(BS) across the -2 million km(2) Australian tropical savanna zone with hyperspectral and multispectral imagery. A spectral library compiled from field campaigns in 2005 and 2006, together with three EO-1 Hyperion scenes acquired during the 2005 growing season were used to explore the spectral response space for f(PV,) f(NPV),f(NPV) and f(BS). A linear unmixing approach was developed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI). Transladon of this approach to MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) scale was assessed by comparing multiple linear regression models of NDVI and CAI with a range of indices based on the seven MODIS bands in the visible and shortwave infrared region (SWIR) using synthesized MODIS surface reflectance data on the same dates as the Hyperion acquisitions. The best resulting model, which used NDVI and the simple ratio of MODIS bands 7 and 6 (SWIR3/SWIR2), was used to generate a time series of fractional cover from 16 day MODIS nadir bidirectional reflectance distribution function-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) data from 2000-2006. The results obtained with MODIS NBAR were validated against grass curing measurement at ten sites with good agreement at six sites, but some underestimation of f(NPV) proportions at four other sites due to substantial sub-pixel heterogeneity. The model was also compared with remote sensing measurements of fire scars and showed a good matching in the spatio-temporal patterns of grass senescence and posterior burning. The fractional cover profiles for major grassland cover types showed significant differences in relative proportions of f(PV), f(NPV) and f(BS), as well as large intra-annual seasonal variation in response to monsoonal rainfall gradients and soil type. The methodology proposed here can be applied to other mixed tree-grass ecosystems across the world. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc.

To realize this potential, researchers must first gain confidence in image-derived river information, as well as an appreciation of its inherent limitations. This paper describes a forward image model (FIM) for examining the capabilities and constraints associated with passive optical remote sensing of liver bathymetry. Image data are simulated \"from the streambed up\" by first using information on depth and bottom reflectance to parameterize models of radiative transfer within the water column and atmosphere and then incorporating sensor technical specifications. This physics-based framework provides a means of assessing the potential for spectrally-based depth retrieval from a particular river of interest, given a sensor configuration. Forward image modeling of both a hypothetical meander bend and an actual gravel-bed river indicated that bathymetric accuracy and precision vary spatially as a function of channel morphology, with less reliable depth estimates in pools. A simpler, more computationally efficient analytical model highlighted additional controls on bathymetric uncertainty: optical depth and the ratio of the smallest detectable change in radiance to the bottom-reflected radiance. Application of the FIM to a complex, natural channel illustrated how the model can be used to quantify the effects of various sensor characteristics. Bathymetric accuracy was determined primarily by spatial resolution. due to mixed pixels along the banks and sub-pixel scale variations in depth, whereas depth retrieval precision depended oil the sensor\'s ability to resolve subtle changes in radiance. This flexible forward modeling approach thus allows the utility of image-derived river information to be evaluated in the context of specific investigations, leading to more efficient, more informed use of remote sensing methods across a range of fluvial environments.

Finding that the remote-sensing reflectance clearly exhibited a peak shift from blue-to-green wavelengths with increasing POC concentration, we developed a Maximum Normalized Difference Carbon Index (MNDCI) algorithm which uses the maximum band ratio of all available blue-to-green wavelengths, and provides a very robust estimate over a wide range of POC and PM concentrations (R-2=0.99, N=58). The algorithm can be extrapolated throughout the region of shipboard sampling for more detailed coverage and analysis. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The study area, which extends for 13,600 km(2), is characterized by intense urbanization, active volcanoes (Phlegraean Fields, Vesuvius and Ischia), seismogenic structures, landslides, hydrogeological instability. PS-InSAR technique allows us to identify a set of radar benchmarks (PS) where accurate displacement measurements can be carried out. About 1.7.10(6) PS are identified by processing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired in ascending and descending orbits from 1992 to 2001 by the European Remote Sensing satellites (ERS). The PS-InSAR application at regional scale detected ground deformations ranging from +28 to -39 mm/yr. The calculated velocity values are consistent with the available GPS and levelling data from selected areas. We identify volcanic areas in which the deformation is mainly related to the depressurization of the local hydrothermal systems, and recognize deformations along seismogenic and aseismic NNW-SSE and NW-SE faults. The deformations localized along the Southern Apennines chain are mainly related to landslides while those occurring in the plains are due to subsidence processes induced by intensive drainage from wells, i.e. anthropic activity. The review of 9 years of SAR data shows that tectonic, volcanic/hydrothermal, gravity, and anthropic processes are responsible for the ground deformation of Campania. The proposed joint interpretation of deformation fields related to natural and anthopogenic factors provides a comprehensive view of the dynamics of the Earth\'s surface. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Effective management of Lepidium requires detailed, accurate maps of its distribution, as may be provided by remote sensing, to contain existing infestations and eradicate incipient populations. We mapped Lepidium with 3 m spatial resolution, 128-band HyMap image data in three sites of California\'s San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary (Rush Ranch in Suisun Marsh and the Greater Jepson Prairie Ecosystem and the Cosumnes River Preserve in the Delta). These sites are markedly different in terms of hydrology, salinity, species composition, and structural and landscape diversity. Aggregated classification and regression tree models (CART), incorporating the results of mixture tuned matched filter (MTMF) analyses and spectral physiological indexes, were used to map Lepidium at the three sites. This approach was sufficiently flexible and robust to detect Lepidium with similar accuracies (similar to 90%) at both Rush Ranch and Jepson Prairie, but was unsuccessful at Cosumnes River Preserve. Comparisons of the behavior of the MTMFs and the CARTs between sites reveal the importance of environmental context in species mapping. Rush Ranch presents the simplest conditions for mapping Lepidium: it is the wettest and least diverse site and Lepidium is spectrally distinct from co-occurring species. At Jepson Prairie, several co-occurring species closely resemble Lepidium spectrally. Nevertheless, hyperspectral data provide sufficient spectral detail to resolve Lepidium even at this challenging site, which is facilitated by phenological separation from the matrix of annual grasses. At Cosumnes River Preserve, however, Lepidium is neither spectrally nor phenologically distinct, and consequently could not be mapped successfully. Evidence suggests that the success of a remote sensing analysis declines as site complexity increases (species, structural, and landscape diversity; spectral variability; etc.), although this relationship is complex, indirect, and may be phenology-dependent.

Differenced Normalised Burn Ratio (Delta NBR) is among the most widely used spectral indices for the mapping of burn severity but is difficult to interpret in terms of fire-related changes in key biophysical attributes and processes. We propose to quantify burn severity as a change in the leaf area index (Delta LAI) of a stand. LAI is a key biophysical attribute of forests. and is central to understanding their water and carbon cycles. Previous studies have suggested that changes in canopy LAI may be a major contributor to Delta NBR and to the composite burn index (CBI) that is frequently used in combination with the NBR to assess burn severity on the ground. We applied remotely-sensed Delta LAI to map burn severity in jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest in south-western Australia burnt during the January 2005 Perth Hills wildfires. Ground-based digital photography was used to measure LAI in typical stands representing the full range of canopy densities present in the study area as well as variation in the time since the last fire. Regression models for the prediction of LAI were developed using NBR, the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or the Simple Ratio (SR) as the independent variable. All three LAI models had equally high coefficients of determination (R-2: 0.87) and small root mean squared errors (RIVISE: 0.27-0.28). Delta LAI was calculated as the difference between pre- and post-fire LAI. predicted using imagery from January 2004 and February 2005, respectively. The area affected by the January 2005 fire and the burn severity patterns within that area were mapped using Delta LAI and Delta NBR. Landscape patterns of burn severity obtained from differencing pre- and post-fire LAI were similar to those mapped by Delta NBR. We conclude that fire-affected areas and burn severity patterns in the northern jarrah forest can be objectively mapped using remotely-sensed changes in LAI, while offering the important advantage over NBR of being readily interpretable in the wider context of ecological forest management.

The work described herein is diverse, ranging across spatial and temporal scales, and making use of optical, radar and lidar technologies. The need for this applied research has become more crucial by the day, as resource managers are faced with issues ranging from non-point source pollution to wetland destruction, invasive species, climate change and more. Routine monitoring and mapping of the changes taking place in these ecosystems enable managers to focus their efforts in time and space, and to prioritize their responses to the most pressing issues. The most compelling aspect of much of the research reported within these pages is that the best advances emerge from the combined use of technologies across the spectrum (literally) and across a range of spatial and temporal scales. No single issue threatening the health of these ecosystems can be addressed using a single approach or with a single image acquired at a given point in time. Despite the additional resources and expense required to make use of multi-sensor, multi-temporal and multi-scale image data, the utility of such data becomes evident across a diverse range of ecosystems and a wide range of conditions. As such, we view this compilation as useful not only for applied resource management, but also as a compelling contribution to the advancement of both basic and applied research in this subject area.

Backscatter from natural areas is often reflection symmetric; i.e., characterized by near zero values for covariance matrix off-diagonal terms of the form < SHVSHH*>, < SHVSVV*> and their conjugates. A new approach is proposed to detect scattering from non-reflection symmetric structures using circular-pol, RR-LL, correlation coefficients, vertical bar rho vertical bar. This method creates a normalization term, vertical bar rho(0)vertical bar, and then forms a ratio, vertical bar rho vertical bar/vertical bar rho(0)vertical bar. The normalization term, vertical bar rho(0)vertical bar, contains the same diagonal terms of the covariance matrix. The (SHVSHH*) and (SHVSVV*) off-diagonal terms and their conjugates are purposely set to zero. The ratio, vertical bar rho vertical bar/rho(0)vertical bar, is rewritten as a product of separable helicity (tau) and orientation angle (theta) dependencies. The mathematical form of the tau dependence is a resonant singularity, or pole, term. This pole significantly enhances returns from man-made, high helicity, non-reflection symmetric structures. These structures have values of tau near the resonance value at tau = +/- 1. Natural scatterers possess very strong RR/LL symmetry (tau approximate to 0) and the pole response for them is correspondingly weak. The dependence of vertical bar p vertical bar/vertical bar p(0)vertical bar on the orientation angle (theta) is known from previous studies to be useful for measuring urban building alignments (relative to the azimuth direction) and measuring surface topography. The ratio vertical bar p vertical bar/vertical bar p(0)vertical bar reduces much of the un-needed image detail of backscatter variations from natural areas of different surface roughness. This image simplification further facilitates detection of localized man-made targets. Published by Elsevier Inc.', '[Ainsworth, T. L.; Schuler, D.

The MODIS aerosol optical depth standard product (AOD at 550 nm) and its respective ratio attributed to fine-mode particles (FM) are employed to evaluate the inter-annual and seasonal variability of the aerosol properties over Athens. Based on AOD(550) and FM values three specific aerosol types are discriminated corresponding to different aerosol load and optical properties. The aerosol types considered correspond to urban/industrial aerosols, coarse-mode particles and clean maritime conditions. This study focuses on the seasonal and year-to-year fluctuation of the number of occurrences as well as the AOD(550) and FM values of each aerosol type. The coarse-mode particles are observed mainly in the summer, while spring is the most favorable season for the occurrence of urban/industrial aerosols. On the other hand, clean maritime conditions occur mainly in the winter. The AOD(550) values for the coarse-mode particles are higher in spring, while the urban/industrial and clean maritime aerosols exhibit slightly higher values in the summer. The seasonal distribution of the aerosol properties is related to anthropogenic and dust emissions in the spring/summer period, but is modified by atmospheric dispersion and precipitation in late autumn/winter. The main conclusion of the study is that the coarse-mode particles exhibit much stronger inter-annual and seasonal variability compared to the urban/industrial aerosols. Finally, three cases corresponding to each aerosol type are analyzed with the aid of synoptic weather maps, air mass trajectories and MODIS data. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The number of trees per hectare bigger than 20cm in diameter at breast height was taken as variable of interest. Simple and multiple ordinary least square regressions and artificial neural networks (ANN) were tested to understand the relationships between the various sources of remotely sensed data and the output variable. An experimental design technique, followed by a classification of the input variables and a factor analysis were implemented in order to understand the structure, reduce the dimensionality of the data and avoid the overfitting of the neural network. The results show that there is a significant amount of independent information in the angular dimension, and this information is highly relevant to the estimation of tree densities in the study area. The MISR NDAI indexes improved the performance of the MISR BRF. The non-linear ANN outperformed the linear regressions. The best results were obtained with the ANN after selecting the input variables according to the results of the experimental design, the classification and the factor analysis, with a 0.71 correlation coefficient against the 0.58 of the best linear regression model.

This approach is particularly useful when the image under study corresponds to a scalar variable submitted to a turbulent flow because, in that case, the arrangement of singularity manifolds corresponds to the multifractal hierarchy from the underlying turbulent flow. In this paper we will show how this intimate connection between Image Processing and Physics, when applied to Microwave Sea Surface Temperature images, allows to uncover global circulation patterns in the ocean at a daily basis with the resolution of 1/4 of degree. Using this technique, details not evidenced in the non-processed image are revealed. The emerging patterns provide a description of the global oceanic currents much richer than the usual global circulation scheme; in particular, instabilities, eddy generation and filamentation are distinctly identified. A pattern extraction of this kind is useful in order to measure and track mesoscale oceanic phenomena, opening the way to many operational and reanalysis applications. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

However, the quality of such classification products, as well as the performance of the classification protocol employed, are difficult to quantify. This paper had the objectives of 1) reviewing the existing alternatives, while identifying major drawbacks and desirable properties, for sub-pixel accuracy assessment based on cross-comparison matrices, and 2) developing theoretical grounds, for a more general accuracy assessment of soft classifications, that account for the sub-pixel class distribution uncertainty. It was found that, for a sub-pixel confusion matrix to exhibit a diagonalization characteristic that allows identifying a perfect matching case, the agreement measure must be constrained at pixel level, whereas a disagreement measure can take into account the sub-pixel distribution uncertainty, leading to an underspecified problem termed the sub-pixel area allocation problem. It was demonstrated that the sub-pixel area allocation problem admits a unique solution if, and only if, no more than one class is either over- or underestimated at each pixel. In this case, the sub-pixel confusion can be uniquely determined. When no unique solution exists, the space of feasible solutions can be represented by confusion intervals. A new cross-comparison matrix that reports the confusion intervals in the form of a center value plus-minus maximum error was proposed to account for the sub-pixel distribution uncertainty. The new matrix is referred to as sub-pixel confusion-uneertainty matrix (SCM). Sub-pixel accuracy measures were also derived from this matrix. The practical use of the SCM and derived indices was demonstrated in assessing an invasive species detection method and a fuzzy classification of urban land use/land cover through remote sensing procedures.

In general, IEM quantifies the magnitude of backscattering as a function of moisture content and surface roughness, which are unknown, and the known radar configurations. Estimating surface roughness or soil moisture by solving the IEM with two unknowns is a classic example of underdetermination and is at the core of the problems associated with the use of radar imagery coupled with IEM-like models. This study offers a solution strategy to this problem by the use of multi-angle radar images, and thus provides estimates of roughness and soil moisture without the use of ancillary field data. Results showed that radar images can provide estimates of surface soil moisture at the watershed scale with good accuracy. Results at the field scale were less accurate, likely due to the influence of image speckle. Results also showed that subsurface roughness caused by rock fragments in the study sites caused error in conventional applications of IEM based on field measurements, but was minimized by using the multi-angle approach.

Model simulations using both modifications are performed and compared with airborne observations of surface temperature made over a Light Industrial area and a downtown area of Vancouver, BC. The results are generally good, although there is a general tendency to underestimate the overall thermal anisotropy. Use of mean facet temperatures in the validation limits validation statistics for one study area; improvements are made when facet temperatures are updated from individual flight lines. Performing a sensitivity analyses on the contributions to the thermal anisotropy suggests that surface structure and microscale temperature variability both make substantial contributions to the total anisotropy. This finding underscores the importance of including microscale temperature variability in assessments of urban thermal anisotropy. Full hemispheric plots of directional temperature and statistics for each study area are presented as an application of the model and show smooth variations in directional temperature when averaged over the study area.

As a complementary approach, this paper presents a new index, termed the Height-Scaled Crown Openness Index (HSCOI), which provides a quantitative measure of the relative penetration of LiDAR pulses into the canopy. The HSCOI was developed from small footprint discrete return LiDAR data acquired over mixed species woodlands and open forests near Injune, Queensland, Australia, and allowed individual trees to be located (including those in the sub-canopy) and attributed with height using relationships (r(2) = 0.81, RMSE = 1.85 m, n = 115; 4 outliers removed) established with field data. A threshold contour of the HSCOI surface that encompassed similar to 90% of LiDAR vegetation returns also facilitated mapping of forest areas, delineation of tree crowns and clusters, and estimation of canopy cover. At a stand level, tree density compared well with field measurements (r(2) = 0.82, RMSE = 133 stems ha(-1), n = 30), with the most consistent results observed for stem densities <= 700 stems ha(-1). By combining information extracted from both the HSCOI and the canopy height model, predominant stem height (r(2) = 0.91, RMSE = 0.77 m, n = 30), crown cover (r(2) = 0.78, RMSE = 9.25%, n = 30), and Foliage & Branch Projective Cover (FBPC; r(2) = 0.89, RMSE = 5.49%, n = 30) were estimated to levels sufficient for inventory of woodland and open forest structural types. When the approach was applied to forests in north cast Victoria, stem density and crown cover were reliably estimated for forests with a structure similar to those observed in Queensland, but less so for forests of greater height and canopy closure.

These statistics are obtained using validated, high quality Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface albedo (MOD43B3) data flagged as snow in the associated Quality Assurance (QA) fields. Near Real-Time Ice and Snow Extent (NISE) data are used as an additional discriminator of snow extent. Statistics are provided for the first seven MODIS bands, ranging from 0.47 to 2.1 mu m, and for three broadbands, 0.3-0.7, 0.3-5.0 and 0.7-5.0 mu m.   The statistics demonstrate that each ecosystem classification has a discernible spectral albedo signature when accompanied by snow on the ground. This indicates that winter canopy and the underlying surface radiative properties are impacted by the presence of snow overlying these surfaces. For example, the 0.47 mu m albedo of winter snow-free evergreen needleleaf forests increases from 0.03 to 0.36 in the presence of snow, compared to an increase of 0.04 to 0.76 for croplands. In general, the albedo of snow-covered ecosystems with some winter canopy has lower albedos than ecosystems with little to no winter canopy; for example the 0.47 mu m albedo of snow-covered mixed forests is 0.39 compared to 0.87 for barren/deserts and 0.95 for permanent snow.   These statistics can be used within land surface models in a stand-alone mode, to prescribe albedo values in atmospheric General Circulation Models (GCMs), or be incorporated into research and operational projects. They are intended to provide researchers with representative spectral albedo values of IGBP ecosystems in the presence of snow that are derived from validated satellite data. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

On the one hand, emphasis is put on the characterization of Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) at a spatial scale compatible with the derivation of the backscattering coefficients, and a transfer function is developed for up-scaling local measurements to the 1 km scale. On the other hand, three different approaches are used to normalize the angular variation of the observed backscattering coefficients. The results show a strong linear relationship between the HH normalized backscattering coefficients and SSM. The best result is obtained when restricting the ASAR data to low incidence angles and by taking into account vegetation effects using multi-angular radar data. For this case, the rms error of the SSM retrieval is 2.8%. These results highlight the capabilities of the ASAR instrument to monitor SSM in a semiarid environment. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In situ herbaceous FMC data were used to assess the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Vegetation Dryness Index (VDI), Improved VDI (IVDI), and Accumulated Relative NDVI Decrement (ARND) during the dry season. The effect of increasing amounts of dead vegetation on the monitoring capacity of derived indices was studied by sampling mixed live and dead FMC. The IVDI was proposed as an improvement of the VDI to monitor herbaceous FMC during the dry season. The IVDI is derived by replacing NDVI with the integrated Relative Vegetation Index (iRVI), as an approximation of yearly herbaceous biomass, when analyzing the 2-dimensional space with NDWI. It was shown that the iRVI offered more information than the NDVI in combination with NDWI to monitor FMC. The VDI and IVDI exhibited a significant relation to FMC with R 2 of 0.25 and 0.73, respectively. The NDWI, however, correlated best with FMC (R-2 = 0.75), while the correlation of ARND and FMC was weaker (R-2 = 0.60) than that found for NDVI, NDWI, and IVDI.

The LIDAR data were recorded at 400 Hz over three intensive areas of 1 km(2) where transects were spaced at 200 m, and along 64 transects spaced 1 km apart (total of ca. 2500 km(2)). LIDAR and field measurements of canopy height were similar in the three intensive study areas, with the 80th percentile of LIDAR returns explaining the greatest amount of variability (79%). Correlations between LIDAR data and aboveground tree biomass measured in the field were highly significant when all three 1 km(2) areas were analyzed collectively, with the 80th percentile again explaining the greatest amount of variability (74%). However, when intensive areas were analyzed separately, correlations were poor for Oak/Pine and Pine/Scrub Oak stands. Similar results were obtained using FIA data; at the landscape scale, mean canopy height was positively correlated with aboveground tree biomass, but when forest types were analyzed separately, correlations were significant only for some wetland forest (Pitch Pine lowlands and mixed hardwoods; r(2)=0.74 and 0.59, respectively), and correlations were poor for upland forests (Oak/Pine, Pine/Oak and Pine/Scrub Oak, r(2)=0.33, 0.11 and 0.21, respectively). When LIDAR data were binned into 1-m height classes, more LIDAR pulses were recorded from the lowest height classes in stands with greater shrub biomass, and significant differences were detected between stands where recent prescribed fire treatments had been conducted and unburned areas. Our research indicates that single-beam LIDAR can be used for regional-scale (forest biomass) estimates, but that relationships between height and biomass can be poorer at finer scales within individual forest types. Binned data are useful for estimating the presence of ladder fuels (vertical continuity of leaves and branches) and horizontal fuel continuity below the canopy.

Validation of the MOD10_L2 snow product, MOD35 cloud mask and the MOD10_L2 Liberal Cloud Mask was performed using field observations from K-12 student GLOBE (Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment) and SATELLITES (Students And Teachers Evaluating Local Landscapes to Interpret The Earth from Space) programs. Student data consisted of field observations of snow depth, snow water equivalency, cloud type, and total cloud cover. In addition, observations from the National Weather Service (NWS) Cooperative Observing Stations were used. Student observations were taken during field campaigns in the winter of 2001-2002, a winter with very little snow in the Great Lakes region, and the winters of 2000-2001 and 2002-2003, which had significant snow cover. Validation of the MOD10_L2 version 4 snow product with student observations produced an accuracy of 92% while comparison with the NWS stations produced an accuracy of 86%. The higher NWS error appears to come from forested areas. Twenty-five and fifty percent of the errors observed by the students and NWS stations, respectively, occurred when there was only a trace of snow. In addition, 82% of the MODIS cloud masked pixels were identified as either overcast or broken by the student observers while 74% of the pixels the MODIS cloud mask identified as cloudless were identified as clear, isolated or scattered cloud cover by the student observers. The experimental Liberal Cloud Mask eliminated some common errors associated with the MOD35 cloud mask, however, it was found to omit significant cloud cover. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The resultant time series of daily MODIS data of a temperate deciduous broadleaf forest (the Bartlett Experimental Forest) in 2004 show strong seasonal dynamics of surface reflectance of green, near infrared and shortwave infrared bands, and clearly delineate leaf phenology and length of plant growing season. We also estimate the fractions of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorbed by vegetation canopy (FAPAR(canopy)), leaf (FAPAR(leaf)), and chlorophyll (FAPAR(chl)), respectively, using a coupled leaf-canopy radiative transfer model (PROSAIL-2) and daily MODIS data. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method (the Metropolis algorithm) is used for model inversion, which provides probability distributions of the retrieved variables. A two-step procedure is used to estimate the fractions of absorbed PAR: (1) to retrieve biophysical and biochemical variables from MODIS images using the PROSAIL-2 model; and (2) to calculate the fractions with the estimated model variables from the first step. Inversion and forward simulations of the PROSAIL-2 model are carried out for the temperate deciduous broadleaf forest during day of year (DOY) 184 to 201 in 2005. The reproduced reflectance values from the PROSAIL-2 model agree well with the observed MODIS reflectance for the five spectral bands (green, red, NIR1, NIR2, and SWIR1]). The estimated leaf area index, leaf dry matter, leaf chlorophyll content and FAPAR(canopy) values are close to field measurements at the site. The results also showed significant differences between FAPAR(canopy) and FAPAR(chl) at the site. Our results show that MODIS imagery provides important information on biophysical and biochemical variables at both leaf and canopy levels. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

To quantitatively determine urban land use extents and development densities, sub-pixel impervious surface areas were mapped for both areas. The urban-rural boundaries and urban development densities were defined by selecting certain imperviousness threshold values and Landsat thermal bands were used to investigate urban surface thermal patterns. Analysis results suggest that urban surface thermal characteristics and patterns can be identified through qualitatively based urban land use and development density data. Results show the urban area of the Tampa Bay watershed has a daytime heating effect (heat-source), whereas the urban surface in Las Vegas has a daytime cooling effect (heat-sink). These thermal effects strongly correlated with urban development densities where higher percent imperviousness is usually associated with higher surface temperature. Using vegetation canopy coverage information, the spatial and temporal distributions of urban impervious surface and associated thermal characteristics are demonstrated to be very useful sources in quantifying urban land use, development intensity, and urban thermal patterns.

The surrounding country rocks are a variable mixture of unaltered volcanic rocks, fluvial deposits, and eolian quartz sand. Analysis of 15-band Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data of the study area, aided by laboratory spectral reflectance and spectral emittance measurements of field samples, shows that phyllically altered rocks are laterally extensive, and contain localized areas of argillically altered rocks.   In the visible through shortwave-infrared (VNIR+SWIR) phyllically altered rocks are characterized by Al-OH absorption in ASTER band 6 because of molecular vibrations in muscovite, whereas argillically altered rocks have an absorption feature in band 5 resulting from alunite. Propylitically altered rocks form a peripheral zone and are present in scattered exposures within the main altered area. Chlorite and muscovite cause distinctive absorption features at 2.33 and 2.20 mu m, respectively, although less intense 2.33 mu m absorption is also present in image spectra of country rocks.   Important complementary lithologic information was derived by analysis of the spectral emittance data in the 5 thermal-infrared (TIR) bands. Silicified rocks were not distinguished in the 9 VNIR+SWIR bands because of the lack of diagnostic spectral absorption features in quartz in this wavelength region. Quartz-bearing surficial deposits, as well as hydrothermally silicified rocks, were mapped in the TIR bands by using a band 13/band 12 ratio image, which is sensitive to the intensity of the quartz reststrahlen feature. Improved distinction between the quartzose surficial deposits and silicified bedrock was achieved by using matched-filter processing with TIR image spectra for reference. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The strong relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and light absorbed by green vegetation make models based on LUE attractive in the remote sensing context. However, estimation of LUE has proven problematic since it varies with vegetation type and environmental conditions. Here we propose that LUE may in fact be correlated with vegetation greenness (measured either as NDVI at constant solar elevation angle, or a red edge chlorophyll index), making separate estimates of LUE unnecessary, at least for some vegetation types. To test this, we installed an automated tram system for measurement of spectral reflectance in the footprint of an eddy covariance flux system in the Southern California chaparral. This allowed us to match the spatial and temporal scales of the reflectance and flux measurements and thus to make direct comparisons over time scales ranging from minutes to years. The 3-year period of this study included both \"normal\" precipitation years and an extreme drought in 2002. In this sparse chaparral vegetation, diurnal and seasonal changes in solar angle resulted in large variation in NDVI independent of the actual quantity of green vegetation. In fact, one would come to entirely different conclusions about seasonal changes in vegetation greenness depending on whether NDVI at noon or NDVI at constant solar elevation angle were used. Although chaparral vegetation is generally considered \"evergreen\", we found that the majority of the shrubs were actually semi-deciduous, leading to large seasonal changes in NDVI at constant solar elevation angle. LUE was correlated with both greenness indices at the seasonal timescale across all years. In contrast, the relationship between LUE and PRI was inconsistent. PRI was well correlated with LUE during the \"normal\" years but this relationship changed dramatically during the extreme drought. Contrary to expectations, none of the spectral reflectance indices showed consistent relationships with CO2 flux or LUE over the diurnal time-course, possibly because of confounding effects of sun angle and stand structure on reflectance. These results suggest that greenness indices can be used to directly estimate CO2 exchange at weekly timescales in this chaparral ecosystem, even in the face of changes in LUE. Greenness indices are unlikely to be as good predictors of CO2 exchange in dense evergreen vegetation as they were in the sparse, semi-deciduous chaparral. However, since relatively few ecosystems are entirely evergreen at large spatial scales or over long time spans due to disturbance, these relationships need to be examined across a wider range of vegetation types.

The TSMSM was run using fields of near-surface soil moisture from microwave imagery collected by aircraft on six days during the experiment, yielding a root mean square difference (RMSD) between model estimates and tower measurements of net radiation (Rn) and soil heat flux (G) of approximately 20 W to m(-2), and 45 W m(-2) for sensible (H) and latent heating (LE). Similar results for H and LE were obtained at landscape/regional scales when comparing model output with transect-average aircraft flux measurements. Flux predictions from the TSMSM and TSMTH models were compared for two days when both airborne microwave-derived soil moisture and radiometric surface temperature (T-R) data from Landsat were available. These two days represented contrasting conditions of moderate crop cover/dry soil surface and dense crop cover/moist soil surface. Surface temperature diagnosed by the TSMSM was also compared directly to the remotely sensed T-R fields as an additional means of model validation. The TSMSM performed well under moderate crop cover/dry soil surface conditions, but yielded larger discrepancies with observed heat fluxes and T-R under the high crop cover/moist soil surface conditions. Flux predictions from the thermal-based two-source model typically showed biases of opposite sign, suggesting that an average of the flux output from both modeling schemes may improve overall accuracy in flux predictions, in effect incorporating multiple remote-sensing constraints on canopy and soil fluxes.

Hence, the detection of soil moisture content (SMC) is very valuable in the social, economic, humanitarian (food security) and environmental segments of society. A method to estimate SMC from optical and thermal spectral information of METEOSAT imagery based on thermal inertia (TI) is presented. Minimum and maximum TI values from time series are combined in the Soil Moisture Saturation Index (SMSI). To convert surface to soil profile values, a Markov type filter is used, based on a simple two layer water balance equation (the surface layer and the reservoir below) and an autocorrelation function. Ten-daily SMC values are compared with up-scaled (using AVHRR/NDVI) observations on 10 EUROFLUX sites in Europe for the 1997 growing season (March-October). Moreover, the thermal inertia approach is compared for 1997, with ERS Scatterometer data for eight EUROFLUX sites. METEOSAT pixels are up-scaled to accommodate the ERS Scatterometer spatial resolution. The regression coefficients (slope, intercept and R-2) of the thermal inertia approach versus the up-scaled soil moisture observations from EUROFLUX sites vary between 0.811-1.148, -0.0029-0.66 and 0.544-0.877, respectively, with a RRMSE range of 3.9% to 35.7%.

A simple error propagation model applied for the thermal inertia approach reveals that the absolute and relative errors of the obtained soil moisture content is at least 0.010 m(3) m(-3) or 2.0% with a SMC of 0.203 m(3) m(-3).

In this model, the crust temperature T-c, the temperature of the cracks T-h, and the fractional area of the hottest component f(h) represent the three unknowns to work out.

This hyperspectral imaging spectrometer offers 72 bands in the SWIR range and 10 bands in thermal infrared (TIR) region of the spectrum, which can be used to solve the dual-band system without any assumptions. Therefore, we can combine three spectral MIVIS bands to obtain simultaneous solutions for the three unknowns. Here, the procedure for solving such a system is presented. It is then demonstrated that a TIR channel is required to better pinpoint solutions to the 2-components model.   Finally, the spatial and statistical characteristic of the resultant MIVIS-derived temperature and flux distributions are introduced and statistics for each hot spot investigated.

These data are used for the inversion of a numerical model of a vegetation canopy in which the latter is described as composed of randomly distributed disks (leaves). The model was developed using the POV-ray ray tracer. Model inversion is carried out using the look-up-table approach.

The methodology involves conversion of satellite sensor data into reflectance values, computation of NDSI, determination of the boundary between dry/wet snows from spectral response data, and threshold slicing of the image data. The areas of dry snow cover and wet snow cover for different dates of satellite overpasses have been computed. The dry snow area has been compared with non-melting area obtained from the temperature lapse rate method, and the two are found to be in close mutual correspondence (< 15%). It is observed that there occur four water-bearing zones in the glacierized basin: dry snow zone, wet snow zone, exposed glacial ice and moraine-covered glacial ice, each of which possesses unique hydrological characteristics and can be distinguished and mapped from satellite sensor data. It is suggested that input of data on the position and extent of specifically wet snow and exposed glacial ice, which can be directly derived from remote sensing, should improve hydrological simulation of such basins.

In recent years, KBSs utilizing the Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence (D-S ToE) have been found most successful in a wide range of remote sensing applications, partly because of their ability to combine diverse information sources. An important feature of the D-S ToE is that it provides a measure for the evidential support (belief) accumulated for each object class at each pixel. Despite the importance of cumulative belief values (CBVs) in representing the weighting of supportive versus conflicting evidence for each class, their analysis has received little attention in the literature. The objective of the present study was to assess the performance (represented by the kappa coefficient) of a KBS based on D-S ToE and of an unsupervised classification (ISODATA), with relation to the CBV distribution determined for each class. This was done for the task of crop recognition in a wide heterogeneous region in Israel. It was found that while KBS performs very well in cases of conflicts and moderate support, the US classification performed well only in cases of homogeneity and uniqueness. Crop recognition by means of KBS was applied to almost one-third of the country\'s agricultural areas, and it provided a high level of differentiation among seven crop types, orchards and natural vegetation types.

The CSDM described the temporal evolution of the LAI as function of the accumulated daily air temperature as measured from classical ground meteorological stations.   The retrieval performances were evaluated for two different data sets: first, a data set simulated by the RTM but taking into account realistic measurement conditions and uncertainties resulting from different error sources; second, an experimental data set acquired over maize crops the Blue Earth City area (USA) in 1998. Results showed that the proposed approach improved significantly the retrieval performances for LAI mainly by smoothing the residual errors associated to each individual observation. In addition it provides a way to describe in a continuous manner the LAI time course from a limited number of observations during the growth cycle. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The high plot and stand level estimation errors of these applications have, however, restricted their use in forest management planning. One reason suggested for the high estimation errors has been the coarse spatial resolution of the imagery employed. Therefore, very high spatial resolution (VHR) imagery sources provide interesting data for stand-level inventory applications. However, digital interpretation of VHR imagery, such as aerial photographs, is more complicated than the use of traditional satellite imagery. Pixel-by-pixel analysis is not applicable to VHR imagery because a single pixel is small in relation to the object of interest, i.e. a forest stand, and therefore it does not adequately represent the spectral properties of a stand. Additionally in aerial photographs, the spectral properties of the objects are dependent on their location in the image. Therefore, MSF1 applications based on aerial imagery must employ features that are less sensitive to their location in the image and that have been derived using the spatial neighborhood of each pixel, e.g. a square-shaped window of pixels. In this experiment several spectral and textural features were extracted from color-infrared aerial photographs and employed in estimation of forest attributes. The features were extracted from original, normalized difference vegetation index and channel ratio images. The correlations between the extracted image features and forest attributes measured from sample plots were examined. Additionally, the spectral and textural features were used for estimating the forest attributes of sample plots, applying the k nearest neighbor estimation method. The results show that several spectral and textural image features that are moderately or well correlated with the forest attributes. Furthermore, the accuracy of forest attribute estimation can be significantly improved by a careful selection of image features. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In order to detect potential vegetation stress caused by the accident, two AVIRIS data sets of the oil spill area, before and after the oil release, are analyzed and the reliability of several techniques in the detection of vegetation stress is examined.   The polynomial fitting and Lagrangian interpolation, and spectral mixture analysis (SMA) are applied to the AVIRIS data sets. The first two methods are applied for the detection of the \"red-edge\" shift in vegetation reflectance spectra, and the last for the detection of change in vegetation fraction. The results indicate that the polynomial fitting and Lagrangian interpolation both are able to detect a red-shift of the vegetation \"red-edge\", but the latter\'s performance depends on the band combination used and is sensitive to data noise. The polynomial fitting results are inconsistent in detection of \"the red-edge\" shift, while Lagrangian interpolation is not. Within the oil spill area, the fraction estimates of vegetation resulting from SMA demonstrate a decrease (10-30%) of the vegetation fraction after the accident, indicating stressed vegetation and cover change. The result also indicates that areas of extremely large decrease (>40%) in plant cover outside of the oil spill area is due to the response of grasses due to the water stress in 2000, and that the integration of some auxiliary data on ecological and climatological data with the analysis of remotely sensed data is thus very important to the interpretation of the detection results. A sensitivity analysis indicates that the detected vegetation cover change is insensitive to the noise introduced by the radiometric normalization. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Most observations of ice break-up are recorded as point data taken from selected ground-based stations. It is unknown whether these point observations are fully representative of breakup patterns elsewhere along the course of a river. Here, daily time series of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) satellite images are used to remotely sense spatial and temporal patterns in ice breakup along 1600-3300 km lengths of the Lena, Ob\', Yenisey, and Mackenzie Rivers. The first day of predominantly ice-free water is visually identified and mapped for ten years (1992-1993, 1995-1998, and 2000-2003), with a mean precision of +/-1.75 days. The derived breakup dates show high correlation with ground-based observations, although a slight trend towards earlier satellite-derived dates can be traced to differences in the way ice breakup date is defined. Large ice jams are often observed, particularly at confluences, although smaller ice jams may not be visible due to the limited spatial resolution of the imagery used. At the watershed scale, spatial patterns in breakup seem to be primarily governed by latitude, timing of the spring flood wave, and location of confluences with major tributaries. Interestingly, channel-scale factors such as slope, width, and radius of curvature, which are known to influence ice breakup at the reach scale, do not appear to be major factors at the scale observed here. The degree of similarity between interannual trends in breakup date at distant points along a river is generally high, which supports the use of point-scale data to infer regional climate variations. This similarity does not hold true for the Mackenzie River, where substantial spatial differences in breakup trends are observed. A new variable, spatially integrated breakup date (d(i)), uses weighted spatial averaging to provide a more encompassing measure of breakup timing. The Ob\' and Yenisey Rivers show similar trends in spatially integrated break-up date from year to year. In contrast, the Mackenzie and Lena show a remarkably consistent negative correlation, here attributed to sea surface temperature anomalies associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation Index.

This leads to unstable and often inaccurate inversion results. In order to regularize the model inversion, a novel approach has been developed and tested on synthetic Landsat TM reflectance data. The method takes into account the neighbouring radiometric information of the pixel of interest, named object signature. The neighbourhood data can either be extracted from gliding windows, already segmented images, or using digitized field boundaries. The extracted radiometric data of the neighbourhood pixels are used to calculate 42 descriptive statistical properties that comprehensively characterize the spectral (co)variance of the image object (e.g. mean and standard deviation of the distributions, intercorrelations between spectral bands, etc.). Together with the habitual spectral signature of the pixel being inverted (6 variables), this object signature (42 variables) is used as input in an artificial neural net to estimate simultaneously three important biophysical variables (i.e. leaf area index, leaf chlorophyll, and leaf water content). The use of neural nets for the model inversion avoids time-consuming iterative optimizations and provides a computational effective way to consider simultaneously pixel and object signatures.   In order to \"learn\'\' the relation between spectral signatures and biophysical variables, the neural nets were previously trained on large synthetic data sets. The data sets consist of pixel signatures and the corresponding signatures of image objects representing various agricultural fields. The signatures were simulated with the SAILH+PROSPECT canopy reflectance model, assuming largely varying intra-and interfield distributions of the model input parameters.   To demonstrate the benefits of the object-based inversion, neural nets were also trained on the pixel signatures alone. For this purpose, the object signatures were simply replaced by randomly generated white noise-all other conditions being the same. The intercomparison based on 30,000 independent validation patterns showed that the proposed method significantly enhances the estimation accuracies: for example, the leaf area index (LAI) is estimated with a percental root mean square error (PRMSE) of 18.3% (object-based) compared to 25. 1 % (pixel based); the corresponding numbers for the leaf chlorophyll content are 12.6% compared to 15.9%; for the equivalent leaf water thickness, 10.6% and 13.9%, respectively.   The benefit of the object signature was strongest for the LAI. Concerning this important biophysical variable, the novel concept accounted for almost one-half of the remaining unexplained variance of the traditional pixel-based approach. Increased accuracies were attributed to the fact that intrafield variations of biophysical canopy variables lead to object signatures that are modulated by the actual average leaf angle (ALA) of the canopy. Since ALA can be considered constant insight given an agricultural field, the concurrent use of pixel and object signatures significantly reduces confounding effects between LAI and ALA typical for traditional inversion approaches. Compared to competing approaches, the algorithm can also be applied to monotemporal imagery and does not require a priori information or the identification of crop type. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The technique is applied to airborne measurements taken by the Passive and Active L and S band (PALS) sensor in Iowa during Soil Moisture Experiments in 2002 (SMEX02). Agricultural fields in the study area were predominantly soybeans and corn. The brightness temperatures of corn and soybeans were observed to be significantly different because of large differences in vegetation biomass. PALS observations have significant over-sampling; observations were made about 100 in apart and the sensor footprint extends to about 400 in. Conventionally, observations of this type are averaged to produce smooth spatial data fields of brightness temperatures. However, the conventional approach is in contrast to reality in which the brightness temperatures are in fact strongly dependent on land cover, which is characterized by sharp boundaries. In this study, we mathematically deconvolve the observations into brightness temperature at the field scale (500-800 in) using the sensor antenna response function. The result is more accurate spatial representation of field-scale brightness temperatures, which may in turn lead to more accurate soil moisture retrieval. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Comprehensive sensitivity and error analyses have been undertaken to evaluate the performance of the proposed LST algorithm and its dependence on surface properties, the ranges of atmospheric conditions and surface temperatures, and on the noise-equivalent temperature difference. The results show that the algorithm is capable of producing LST with a standard deviation lower than 1.5 K for viewing zenith angles lower than 50degrees.

Several global thematic products have been derived from large datasets of low-resolution remotely sensed data, the latter providing the best trade-off between spatial resolution, temporal resolution and cost. However, a standard procedure for the validation of such products has not been developed yet. This paper proposes a methodology, based on statistical indices derived from the widely used Error Matrix, to deal with the specific issue of the influence of the low spatial resolution of the dataset on the accuracy of the end-product, obtained with hard classification approaches. In order to analyse quantitatively the trade-off between omission and commission errors, we suggest the use of the \'Pareto Boundary\', a method rooted in economics theory applied to decisions with multiple conflicting objectives. Starting from a high-resolution reference dataset, it is possible to determine the maximum user and producer\'s accuracy values (i.e. minimum omission and commission errors) that could be attained jointly by a low-resolution map. The method has been developed for the specific case of diebotomic classifications and it has been adopted in the evaluation of burned area maps derived from SPOT-VGT with Landsat ETM+ reference data. The use of the Pareto Boundary can help to understand whether the limited accuracy of a low spatial resolution map is given by poor performance of the classification algorithm or by the low resolution of the remotely sensed data, which had been classified.

Therefore, there is a greater need for accurate and detailed information about their biophysical characteristics (e.g., Leaf area index-LAI) along different stages of ecological succession. Remote sensing offers the possibility of providing relatively accurate estimations of such biophysical characteristics at a reasonable cost for most regional projects. The objectives of this study are to (1) document the variability of LAI in different stages of secondary growth in a tropical moist forest, (2) estimate LAI from spectral vegetation indices (SVIs), and (3) link LAI to the estimation of other canopy physiognomic characteristics. We found that segregation of LAI measurements by successional stage (early, intermediate, late) contributed to a better definition of the relationship between LAI and the SVIs. In addition, we conclude that the propagation of errors of precision through the SVI formulas must be taken into consideration along with intra-site and radiometric variability when uncertainty terms are calculated. From a linear regression analysis, we found that there is only a minimal difference between the nonparametric Theil-Sen and classical least-squares regressions. We also found that not only does the Lorentzian cumulative transition function describe the relationship between LAI and the SVIs, it also provides an estimate of the range of LAI values to which each index is sensitive.

A new method is proposed by applying case-based reasoning (CBR) techniques to the classification of SAR images. Stratified sampling is carried out to collect the cases so that the variations of backscatters within a class can be appropriately captured. The use of discrete cases can conveniently represent the internal changes of a class under complicated situations, such as spatial changes in soil conditions and terrain features. These spatial variations are difficult to represent by using rules or mathematical equations. The proposed method has better classification performance than supervised classification methods in the study area. The case library is reusable for time-independent classification when the SAR images are acquired at the same time of the crop growth cycles for different years. The proposed method has been tested in the Pearl River Delta in South China. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', 'Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.

However, their presence in a tree crown may be a source of confusion in remotely sensed data collected for inventories or assessment of vegetation health. The structural growth form of lianas contrasts with trees in that their proportion of leafy biomass to woody biomass is much higher. In effect, they use trees for structural support and typically form a monolayer of leaves above the crown of the supporting tree. Here, we investigated possible differences between hyperspectral signatures of lianas and trees at the leaf level using pattern recognition techniques. Our method involves principal components analysis followed by training and classification using a selection of supervised parametric and nonparametric classifiers. At a tropical dry forest site (Parque Natural Metropolitano), lianas and trees are distinguishable as groups based on their leaf spectral reflectance characteristics in dry season conditions. Classification was improved using ancillary data on leaf chlorophyll content. Their distinction at this site may be related to drought stress and/or phenological differences between the two groups. At a tropical wet forest site (Fort Sherman), discrimination between the two groups was not as clear. Additional research is required to determine the physiological basis of possible differences as well as to determine if these differences are observable at the canopy level. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The data set includes coincident measurements of radiometric quantities, chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a), and absorption coefficient of CDOM, which were taken on 25 cruises between 1993 and 2001. The data cover a wide range of variability with Chl a in surface waters from about 0.3 to 100 mg m(-3). All the MODIS pigment algorithms examined as well as the SeaWiFS OC4v4 algorithm showed a systematic and large overestimation in chlorophyll retrievals. The mean systematic and random errors based on our entire data set exceeded 150% or even 200% in some cases, making these standard algorithms inadequate for pigment determinations in the Baltic. Although new parameterization of the standard pigment algorithms based on our field measurements in the Baltic resulted in a significant reduction of errors, the overall performance of such regionally tuned algorithms remained unsatisfactory. For example, the mean normalized bias (MNB) for the regionally tuned MODIS chlor_a_2 algorithm was reduced to 26% (from over 200% for the standard algorithm), but the root mean square (RMS) error was still large (>100%). The MODIS K_490 algorithm for estimating the diffuse attenuation coefficient of downwelling irradiance showed the best performance among all the algorithms examined. With the new coefficients based on our field data, the regional version of this algorithm showed an acceptable level of errors, MNB = 4% and RMS = 30%. In addition to the apparent problems of the standard in-water bio-optical algorithms, we found that the atmospheric correction currently in use for MODIS and SeaWiFS imagery usually fails to retrieve upwelling radiances emerging from the Baltic Sea. The match-up comparisons of the coincident in situ and satellite determinations of normalized water-leaving radiances showed generally poor agreement, especially in the blue spectral region. It appears that new approaches for ocean color algorithms are required in the Baltic Sea. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', 'Polish Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, PL-81712 Sopot, Poland.

Field observations indicate that much of the visible altered rock consists of talus material derived from fractured rock zones within and adjacent to dacitic domes and nearby lava flows. Digital elevation data were utilized to distinguish steeply sloping altered bedrock from more gently sloping talus materials. Volume modeling based on the imagery and digital elevation data indicate that Mount Shasta drainage systems contain moderate volumes of altered rock, a result that is consistent with Mount Shasta\'s Holocene record of mostly small to moderate debris flows. Similar modeling for selected areas at Mount Rainier and Mount Adams, Washington, indicates larger altered rock volumes consistent with the occurrence of much larger Holocene debris flows at those volcanoes.

The mechanism for generating Doppler velocities is the correlation between wave phase and radar cross section. The contributions analyzed include those of linear gravity waves, second-order wave-wave interactions, Bragg-wave scatterers and breaking waves. For gravity waves, we consider both wave tilt and hydrodynamic modulation transfer functions (MTFs). We find that for nominal sea conditions, the Doppler velocity is significant, on the order of 1 m/s, and exhibits large variation as a function of incidence angle and look with respect to the sea direction. The most important contributors are gravity waves and the Bragg scatterers, followed by sea spikes. Effects produced by second-order wave solutions are argued to be inconsequential.

Whilst it is well known that fire is widespread in the boreal environment, there is a lack of good quality quantitative data on the extent of fire activity in Russian forests and on its interannual variation. This study provides one of the first comprehensive monthly satellite-based studies of fires occurring across the entire Russian Federation using a single, standardised methodology designed to map burned areas down to a size of 2 km(2). Using data from SPOT VEGETATION (VGT), we detect newly burned pixels via a series of multi-temporal spectral reflectance differencing criteria. For the year 2001, the method is applied to 21 VGT 10-day syntheses (S10) scenes covering the Russian fire season. We map 2764 fires with a total area of 41,782 km(2), and our methodology successfully detects all fires present in a comparison Landsat ETM+ data set, although it underestimates their size by on average of 18%. Using frequency-size relations, we estimate that 3790 fires of 1-2-km(2) area are likely to have remained unobserved by our method across the entire Russian region. Taking these corrections into account, we calculate the total burned area for the Russian Federation in 2001 as 51,546 km 2, with 38,512 km(2) occurring in forest and 13,034 km 2 in other land use classes. Fire activity is strongest in August in Eastern Siberia and the northern part of the Russian Far East, and in May and October in the southern part of the Russian Far East. Using these data, we estimate direct carbon emissions from these Russian forest fires to be 39.3-55.4 Mt, five to eight times that from the 2001 North American boreal forest fires and around 11-17% of that year\'s Russian industrial carbon emissions. This methodology will, in the future, be applied to the full VGT archive to quantify burned area and direct carbon emissions over a 5-year period in order to better assess the interannual variation in burned area and emissions and the relation to local climate.

These detections provide confirmation that microwave subsurface remote sensing is a genuine phenomenon. At Ashalim, a scatterometer operating in the P-band (441 MHz, 68 cm) was mounted on a cherry picker truck at a height of 8 m and used to detect two triangular aluminum mesh reflectors (forming a 1-m square area reflector) buried down to a depth of 8 cm in dry sand. At Tseelim, the same scatterometer was mounted on an airplane flying at an altitude of 70 m and used to detect 1-m square aluminum reflectors (each one submerged at a different location along the airplane flight path) buried down to a depth of 20 cm. The experimental results compare favorably with a theoretical model that incorporates radar absorption effects arising in the sandy subsurface layer and radar interference effects arising from phase differences between reflections from the surface and buried reflector. The theoretical modeling also predicts the detection of a subsurface reflector down to a depth of about 4.4 m. This experiment and the associated modeling approach is the first of a series of planned experiments, which we outline for the detection and the theoretical evaluation of buried reflectors using remote microwave and VHF radar.

This information maybe accessed by inverting a BRDF model against sets of observations, which encompass important variations in viewing and illumination angles. This paper shows that structural canopy attributes can be derived through inversion of the Simple Geometric Model (SGM) of the BRDF developed in this paper. It is difficult to sample BRDF features from the ground because of the discontinuous nature of the canopies and long intrinsic length scales in remotely sensed spectral measures (>10 m). A multispectral digital camera was therefore used to derive spatial multiangular reflectance data sets from the air and the SGM was validated against and inverted with these. It was also validated using 3-D radiosity simulations driven with maps of field-measured plant dimensions. The interpretation of the retrieved parameter maps (shrub density, shrub width and canopy height) reveals variations in canopy structure within desert grassland and grassland-shrubland transition communities, which are clearly related to structural and optical features in high resolution panchromatic and vegetation index images. To our knowledge, this paper reports on the first attempts to acquire structural canopy attributes of desert landscapes using multiple view angle data at scales less than 1 km. The results point to further opportunities to exploit multiangular data from spacebome sensors such as the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and the Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) on the NASA Terra and European Space Agency\'s PROBA satellites, respectively.

Synthetic aperture radars (SARs), with their sensitivity to forest biomass, offer mapping capabilities that could provide valuable up-to-date information, for example about fire damage or logging activity. The European Commission SIBERIA project had the aim of mapping an area of approximately 1 million km(2) in Siberia using SAR data from two satellite sources: the tandem mission of the European Remote Sensing Satellites ERS-1/2 and the Japanese Earth Resource Satellite JERS-1. Mosaics of ERS tandem interferometric coherence and JERS backscattering coefficient show the wealth of information contained in these data but they also show large differences in radar response between neighbouring images. To create one homogeneous forest map, adaptive methods which are able to account for brightness changes due to environmental effects were required. In this paper an adaptive empirical model to determine growing stock volume classes using the ERS tandem coherence and the JERS backscatter data is described. For growing stock volume classes up to 80 m(3)/ha, accuracies of over 80% are achieved for over a hundred ERS frames at a spatial resolution of 50 m. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

We examine two main causes of uncertainty affecting the predicted reflectance values. They are a contribution of the random noise term in the measurements and the model residual after adjustment. For this purpose, we formulate notions of both the experimental design for angular sampling and the kernel response function for an arbitrary set of angular measurements. The Fisher informative matrix is considered to circumscribe the optimal design problem to search for the best angular sampling. Two approaches are presented and discussed: one relates to the random noise term of the BRDF model and is independent on the land cover type (LCT); the other is impacted by the residual term of the BRDF model and is determined by the reflectance peculiarities of the different LCTs. Additionally, we explore the residual terms as a function of the LCT and we analyze the sensitivity of the reflectance predicted by the various BRDF models to the kernel response function. This is achieved by segregating regions of the angular domain that are most responsive to the measurement noise. We further determined the optimal angular sampling distribution for ground-based multi-angular data sets over different LCT and known residual terms. Then, we extend it to the more general case, ignoring the residual term. It is shown that the functions that are associated with the chosen criteria saturate after the selection of five or six observing geometries. These inversion experiments in BRDF modeling confirm the efficiency of certain angular data sets as a solution to the optimal design problem in relation to the negative influence of the redundancy effect of observations. This effect arises from having an excessive number of angular measurements in relation to the number of retrieved parameters. Another manner to prove the optimal design validity is by statistical diagnosis. We carried out a diagnosis study based on the residual standard deviation, the Fisher and R-square statistics. A fast convergence rate is observed with angular measurements determined by the optimal design. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The samples investigated consist of crustose and foliose lichen species collected from exposures of the Gog quartzite formation in Alberta, Canada. Lichen transmittance was estimated to be <3% throughout the 350-2500-mn spectral region, using spectra measured from the foliose lichen, Umbilicaria torrefacta, as a representative sample of a broader class of lichens. These findings suggest that lichen prevents the transmission of light to the underlying rock substrate. Therefore, the subpixel influence of lichen and rock within a scene can be considered linearly weighted. Discrimination of lichen species is made possible using ratios of reflectance at 400/685 and 773/685 nm. An index using the band ratios 2132/2198 and 2232/ 2198 nm shows the similarity of lichen spectra in the infrared and a distinguishing feature between rocks with OH bearing minerals and lichen. Thus, spectral unmixing of rock and crustose/foliose lichens may be successfully accomplished using a single lichen end-member for this spectral range. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

In previous studies, ground reference data or pseudo-invariant features (PIFs) were used in the radiometric rectification of multitemporal images. Ground reference data are costly and difficult to acquire for most satellite remotely sensed images and the selection of PIFs is generally subjective. In addition, previous research has been focused on radiometric normalization of two images acquired on different dates. The problem of conservation of radiometric resolution in the case of radiometric normalization between more than two images has not been addressed. This article reports on a new procedure for radiometric normalization between multitemporal images of the same area. The selection of PIFs is done statistically. With quality control, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to find linear relationships between multitemporal images of the same area. The satellite images are normalized radiometrically to a common scale tied to the reference radiometric levels, The procedure ensures the conservation of radiometric resolution for the multitemporal images involved. The new procedure is applied to three Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images from three different years (August 1986, 1987, and 199 1) and of the same area. Quality control measures show that the error in radiometric consistency between the multitemporal images is reduced effectively. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is calculated using the radiometrically normalized multitemporal imagery and assessed in the context of land cover change analysis.

Hyperspectral in situ reflectance was measured at both the top and bottom of the water column to examine the effects of the intervening water layer. A radiative transfer model was used to predict the top-of-the-water column reflectance from a large number of close-range measured bottom spectra. The measured and modeled hyperspectral reflectance spectra were examined separately to compare the degree to which different substrate types can be discriminated once the water column is \"added\" to the spectra.

Concurrent in situ surface water quality measurements, optical (Landsat TM) data and microwave (ERS-2 SAR) data were obtained in selected locations in August 1997. The TM and ERS-2 SAR data from locations of water samples were extracted and digital data were examined in numerous transformations. Although significant correlations were observed between digital data and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), suspended sediment concentration (SSC), turbidity (Turb), and Secchi disk depth (SDD), application of neural networks appears to yield a superior performance in modeling transfer functions in this study area. Here, an empirical neural network algorithm is applied to estimate the transfer functions between the major characteristics of surface waters and the satellite optical and microwave data. The results show that the estimation accuracy for major characteristics of surface waters using the neural network is much better than those from regression analysis. The results also indicate that microwave data can assist to improve the estimation of these characteristics. Therefore, it may be possible to develop surface water quality algorithms in which microwave data are used as supplementary data to optical observations. However, this improvement of optical data retrieval algorithm is limited in this case study. The technique still needs to be refined in detail in order to detect differences within the typical range of these water quality parameters found in the area under study.

Inaccuracies in both the USGS and SIR-C DEMs were apparent in the drainage network, as well as in spatial images of elevation, slope, and contributing area.

Most arid land remote sensing efforts have focused on detecting vegetation change using spectral: indices, such as the normalized vegetation index, with limited success. Less attention has focused on using the continuous shortwave spectrum (0.4 mu m to 2.5 mu m) for studying vegetation in arid environments. Using field measurements and a photon transport model, we quantified the absolute and relative importance of tissue, canopy, and landscape factors that drive pixel-level shortwave reflectance variation along a land-cover gradient in the Chihuahuan Desert, New Mexico. Green foliage, wood standing litter, and bare soil had distinctive spectral properties, often via specific, narrow absorption features and through overall differences in the shape of their shortwave spect ra. While the amount of each plant material varied significantly along the land-cover gradient, foliar optical properties remained relatively stable, supporting the hypothesis that resource variation (e.g., water and nutrients) is more strongly resolved at the scale of whole plant canopies (e.g., via allocation and production) than at the leaf level. Significant variation in vegetation type and condition along the gradient resulted in only subtle changes in pixel-level reflectance variability, which could be determined in, high spectral resolution Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer data. Most important, the relative impact of tissue, canopy and landscape factors on pixel-level reflectance shifted with plant composition and phenology. Mie compared the ability to resolve these vegetation and soil factors using Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer; Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, and Landsat Thematic Mapper optical channels and found that feu; factors could be accounted for unless most of the spectral range was adequately sampled.

This paper reports an investigation on the information content oft he interferometric coherence over a hilly terrain supporting various land use types and large pine plantations. The approach includes the rise of a Geographic Information System and multitemporal data to analyze the coherence behavior as a function of forest-type forest parameters and environmental factors such as meteorological and topographic effects. Coherence appears to be efficient to discriminate between forest types. However, topography and environmental conditions strongly affect the coherence and its estimation, pointing out the need for rejection of strong slopes areas (>15 degrees) and the sensitivity to local meteorological/seasonal effects. Based on these observations, forest classification results are presented. Forest/nonforest discrimination is very efficient (accuracy >90%) using one-clay interval acquisition. More detailed classification with discrimination between forest themes gives also good results. Then, we investigate the indirect link between coherence and forest parameters. The coherence is sensitive to the forest growth stage, making forest parameter retrieval possible using a simple straight-line model. Finally, the importance of wind upon temporal decorrelation is addressed and a semiempirical correction is proposed.

However, this assessment can be erroneous if the 3-D spatial distribution of the vegetation is neglected. Sophisticated radiative transfer models are often required to account for the 3-D canopy architecture. Due to long computation times, however, these models are not well adapted to sensitivity analyses and numerical inversions that require hundred of calls of the merit function. This paper presents a methodology developed to stimulate vegetation reflectance spectra quickly and accurately (i.e., without neglecting the 3-D canopy architecture). Canopy reflectance spectra are calculated by linearly interpolating spectra pre-computed with a coupled model: a 3-D canopy model (DART) and a leaf optical properties model (PROSPECT). This approach was successfully tested by studying the influence of forest architecture on the determination of leaf chlorophyll concentration was characterized by the position of the inflection point of the red edge (lambda(1)). Apart from Chl(f), we considered four other influential factors on lambda(1): the LAI (leaf area index), the viewing direction, the understory reflectance, and the canopy architecture (i.e., a theoretical turbid medium, a pole stand, and a mature stand). Results demonstrated the strong influence of canopy architecture. For example, the lambda(1) has larger values for mature stands for pole stands (delta lambda(1)>10 nm), whatever the LAI and the viewing directions. Thus, errors on Chl(f) can be larger than 23 mu g/cm(2) if canopy architecture is neglected.

This methodology generated a wide variation in pigment concentrations (per unit leaf area and per unit ground area) and leaf area index, as may be expected at the plant canopy scale, and provided independent variation between the chlorophylls and carotenoids and leaf area index. Spectral reflectance was measured for each leaf increment of each stack using a spectroradiometer and these data were used to evaluate the nature and strength of relationships between a number of existing and novel spectral transformations and the concentrations of pigments (per unit ground area) within the leaf stacks. Reflectance in narrow wavebands within the visible region was moderately related to chlorophyll concentrations, while ratio indices, employing wavebands in the near-infrared and visible, particularly the green, were more successful. While the wavelength position of the red edge was related to chlorophyll concentration, characteristics of the amplitude of the first and second derivatives of reflectance and pseudo absorbance were more strongly correlated with chlorophyll. No transformation of spectral reflectance that was tested was strongly related to the concentration of carotenoids but two ratio indices were highly correlated with the ratio of carotenoids to chlorophyll a. Interestingly, leaf area index (LAI) was unrelated to all spectral ratio indices including the broad-band normalized-difference and the simple ratio vegetation indices. This indicates that spectral indices may have limited applicability for estimating the LAI of vegetation canopies when the leaves that comprise these canopies have differing chlorophyll concentrations (per unit leaf area).

Young yellowish-green leaves of the aurea mutant tobacco showed a much higher blue-green fluorescence emission and lower chlorophyll fluorescence as compared to the green wild type tobacco. As a consequence, the fluorescence intensity ratios blue/green (F440/F520), blue/red (F440/F690), blue/far-red (F440/F740), green/far-red (F520/F690) and green/far-red (F520/F740), as determined from the measured fluorescence emission spectra of he adaxial and abaxial leaf sides, were quite different for both leaf types and were functions of the content of chlorophylls and carotenoids. As chlorophyll levels decreased in senescing leaves of the aurea tobacco plant, the Chl db ratio remained high at 3.3 to 4.0, while the ratio of chlorophylls to carotenoids declined slightly. In cont-ast, the Chl fluorescence ratios (R-fd 690-values, F-v/F-m and F-v/F-0) as physiological indicators continuously declined indicating a successive loss of photosynthetic activity. Values of the chlorophyll fluorescence ratio F690/F740 for adaxial and abaxial leaf-sides increased with yellowing, whereas F440/F520 tended to decrease with the senescence-induced decline in Chi content. F440/F690 and F520/F690 were found to increase after an initial decrease, with leaf age and senescence The same trend was found for F440/F740 and F520/F740, which exhibited maximum sensitivity with respect to Chl breakdown. Whereas the F690/F740 ratio for ab-axial versus adaxial leaf surfaces correlated linearly, with the abaxial leaf-side values always being higher than the adaxial leaf-side, values for both sides corresponded in a curvilinear fashion with leaf Chl content. Changes during early stages of leaf development were seen not only in the most commonly used red/far-red ratio, F690/F740, but to some extent also in F440/F520. The results indicate that changes in photosynthetic activity due to senescence and Chl breakdown can easily be detected and qualified via fluorescence ratios that are based on the UV-A excited fluorescence bands F440, F520, F690 anf F740. These ratios provide a solid basis for the laser-induced remote sensing of the state of health and chi content of vegetation The fluorescence ratios green/red and green/far-red were found to be very suitable complementary indicators of early stress events in plants.

Various relative calibration methods are first compared and their effects on the results of interpreting the \"change image\" are then studied. As it is sometimes impossible to locate unchanged areas for calibration, the use of both unchanged and changed training areas for calibration purposes is tested here. The change detection method is fixed to parametric supervised change image classification. The longest time difference between image pairs was 19 years and R-2 with a time span of this order was around 40%. R-2 for the models increased about 10% when time span was reduced from 11 years to 3 years. Smoothing methods can predict band-by-band regression very well, and R-2 values are 10-15% higher than with the robust regression technique used. RMSE was slightly larger when multiple band models were used than with smoothing methods. When general calibration models were applied to unchanged data, the differences between the calibration errors were not statistically significant. Thus it was satisfactory to use an entire target area for image calibration and include changed areas in the training data for calibration models. Models created from multiple occasions did not perform well in classification. A fair agreement with estimates and the ground truth was possible using four images. The best result was obtained when using three image pairs and multiple band robust regression calibration. Classification with calibration was only slightly better than without calibration, the difference not being statistically significant.

Their estimaition leads to reflectance simulation errors. These errors are analyzed in this article for the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum using the SAIL model for sugar beets. Two ways for estimating SAIL parameters were compared: One does not require any knowledge of magnitude and variability. The other one is based on rules developed from parameter distribution analysis and extra knowledge on soils and climate. The reflectance estimation error was very high for LAI<2.0 when no previous knowledge was assumed. Defining parameter values from soil, climate, and crop development knowledge considerably reduced errors and would be useful for application of reflectance models at the regional scale. The use of vegetation indices reduced the effects of parameter value uncertainty, but still benefited from improved parameter estimation. It was found that simple classification of crop and notably soil parameter values would be useful for application of reflectance models at the regional scale. Future work will deal with quantifying consequences when reflectance models are coupled to crop growth models for regional yield estimation.

In this study, the relationships between soil color and simulated reflectance values for the Landsat TM and SPOT HRV satellites are examined from a laboratory standpoint. Visible reflectance spectra were acquired for 124 soil samples originated from an arid environment, and selected radiometric indices were worked out for both sensors. All the earlier studies relative to soil color and remote sensing have considered the widely known Munsell method as a reference for soil color quantification. Some characteristics of this system based on a visual comparison of a soil sample with painted color chips may complicate the establishment of simple relationships be between reflectance data and soil color. We have applied the CIE 1931 standard method of color measurement which consists in computing color parameters directly from reflectance spectra using colorimetric equations. Color data are expressed according to two polar coordinates called Helmholtz coordinates (dominant wavelength and purity of excitation) and a luminance variable having a similar meaning to the Munsell hue, chroma, and value, respec tively. The Munsell system is also employed to estimate soil color. Linens regression analysis between soil color and radiometric indices show a systematic improvement of correlations (r) from about 0.7 to more than 0.9 using Munsell data and Helmoltz data, respectively. Simple radiometric indices (band combinations) calculated from broad blue, green, and red bands are found to be good predictors of each of the soil color components. The increasing availability of spectroradiometers, including in the field, should stimulate the use of Helmholtz coordinates, as a beneficial alternative to the Munsell chart to obtain a precise and reproducible color quantification which may be useful for remote sensing applications. The radiometric indices utilized in this study are potentially helpful to contribute to soil resource and soil degradation cartography using visible satellite data in vast arid regions where soil data are not readily available.

Far-range correction was necessary to compensate weakening of radar signal with aircraft distance. Significant retrodiffusion values are for horizontal surfaces, projected shadows, surfaces whose normal is subperpendicular to radar beam, steep radiometric gradients. Elements of the topographic profiles have been correlated with the elementary signals of radar image, permitting a codification for syntactic analysis. The radar image has been transformed into an image of elementary topographic symbols, from which crests and thalwegs can be directly extracted. Recognition of structural escarpments and landslides involves search for typical sequences of symbols in different profile orientations, and determination of a specific grammar (syntax). Assessment of the results was made by comparison with similar syntactic methods of pattern recognition applied to a digital elevation model of the same area, and field knowledge. The radar image classifications have produced results close to reality. Imperfections are mainly due to the filtering process, radar distance correction, and difficulty in measuring significant retrodiffusion values, for example, retrodiffusion of horizontal surfaces.

Applying these four variables, 16 land-cover categories were identified, and relationships between SWE and brightness temperature were derived for each category.

A simple backscatter model was fitted to this response and validated using image and field data acquired independently at Manaus, 500 km to the west of Tapajos. The sources of variability in biomass density and SAR back-scatter were investigated so as to determine confidence limits for the subsequent retrieval of biomass density using the model. This analysis suggested that only three broad classes of regenerating forest biomass density may be positively distinguished. While the backscatter appears to saturate at around 60 tonnes per hectare, the biomass limit for retrieval purposes which is tolerant to both speckle and image texture is only 31 tonnes per hectare. The spatial distribution of biomass density in central Amazonia was estimated by applying the model to a mosaic of 90 JERS-1 images. A favorable comparison of this distribution to a map of regeneration derived from NOAA AVHRR imagery suggested that L-band SAR will provide a useful method of monitoring tropical forests on a regional scale.

We else close-range measurements made over 22 experimental plots at the Konza Prairie Research Natural Area (KPRNA) to evaluate seasonal trajectories in NDVI as a function of C-3/C-4 ratio. The NDVI data were collected from each plot at approximately 10-day intervals throughout the 1995 growing season. Metrics for summarizing the temporal behavior of NDVI trajectories were derived from two transformations of the data: 1) a conventional approach plotting NDVI against day of year and 2) an alternative approach plotting normalized cumulative integrated NDVI against growing degree clay. Discriminant function mixture models derived from each set of metrics were used together with species composition data from the experimental plots to derive relative C-3/C-4 abundances. Results show that both methods can classify the majority of cases into their correct C-3/C-4 abundance category; however, the transformation using normalized integrated NDVI against growing degree day was a significantly better discriminator (p=0.0102).

The land cover in this region varies from boreal forest in the south to tundra in the north. The thermal parameters are estimated from two variants of a new model that combines the radiances of the short wave infrared (SWIR) spectral band [advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) channel 3: 3.55-3.93 mu m] and the thermal bands (AVHRR channel 4: 10.5-11.5 mu m; and AVHRR channel 5: 11.5-12.5 mu m). The study, carried out for images acquired on different dates, reveals that, in most situations, the two approaches allow the separation of emissivities and surface temperatures. Analysis of the variations of the estimated emissivities in relation to surface patterns shows that they are slightly variable in spectral bands 4, and 5, with values generally greater than 0.95. Variations are more important in the SWIR channel, where values less than 0.90 appear, especially in urban areas. In general, surface emissivities increase with the density of the vegetation cover. Moreover, for densely vegetated areas, SWIR surface reflectivities, which can be derived from emissivities, appear to be well correlated with the reflectivities of the AVHRR visible channel. As with emissivities, variations of the estimated land surface temperatures (LST) in relation to vegetation density, characterized by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), were considered. The relations between the two parameters (LST and NDVI) show essentially two opposite directions of linear variations (positive and negative correlations). In the light of the main results obtained the synergistic use of the different spectral regions (visible, near mid-, and thermal infrareds) could be very useful in the parameterization of boreal ecosystems.

We examine differences in spatial distortion of features near the summit of Nyiragongo volcano, finding that opposite look direction data are helpful in interpreting volcanic features, such as the shape of small craters, in areas of high relief The relative brightness of lava flows and vegetation change (and actually reverse) for different wavelengths and polarizations. Although L-band data are best for mapping the outline of the flows, C- and X-band cross-polarization data show differences in backscatter intensity between and within flows. In addition, our ability to discriminate lava flows and vents from surrounding vegetation is strongly influenced by pulse bandwidth (resolution) and angle of incidence. Pulse bandwidth is the most important parameter in mapping small topographic features such as volcanic cones and a set of particularly thick flows on the flanks of Karisimbi volcano. These examples illustrate important considerations of the tradeoffs and priorities in acquisition parameters for future missions such as ENVISAT, as well ns potential pitfalls for interpretation of existing data.

Preoutbreak Landsat TM data were acquired on 8 August 1985. Spectral values were converted to approximate reflectances using PCI atmospheric correction routines and related to the field measurements. Logistic regression techniques were used to develop models for predicting forest susceptibility (probability of attack) and vulnerability (response to attack) and to assess the accuracy of the susceptibility and vulnerability forecasts. In general, susceptible stands were younger and had lower basal area and tree density, but higher leaf area index than stands that were not attacked. Vulnerable stands were older, had lower vigor and growth efficiency indices (stemwood growth per unit of leaf area), and also displayed the highest near infrared spectral values. The best predictions combined selected spectral measurements with provincial forest inventory data. These models produced classifications with accuracies of 81%, 67%, and 78% for predicting susceptibility and pre- and postoutbreak vulnerability, respectively.

The site of an area whose reflection properties are to be modeled can be freely chosen; the task is limited, however, by its allocated CPU time. The surface structure of such an area is taken from a digital terrain model. The known anisotropic reflection properties of various flat surface types, for example, coniferous forest, hardwood forest, grassland, and agricultural cover types, are taken into account. The effects of multiple reflection in the subscale orographic structure of an area are calculated up to the second order of reflection. For the test sites, a typical difference of 25% in the reflection factors of a vertically structured surface and a corresponding flat surface was found, with the higher values for a flat surface. The model is validated by comparing simulated radiances with measured radiances in the solar channels of the AVHRR onboard NOAA-11 and NOAA-12 for several test sites in the German alpine region. The simulated radiances are calculated with an angular-dependent radiative transfer model with the modeled reflection functions as the lower boundary layer of the coupled Earth-atmosphere system. The results show good agreement between measured and simulated satellite data, especially in Channel 2, if the vertical structure of the surface is considered. A statistically significant influence of the orographic structure was found in the simulated radiances as compared with radiances calculated for a corresponding flat surface with the same cover types. It is concluded that the developed reflection model is able to simulate correctly the anisotropic reflection properties of vertically structured natural landscape as it can be found in mountainous terrain terrain.

In the present work, Lee have used the concept of differential attenuation of the radar signal due to rain at two widely separated frequencies to estimate rainfall. Simultaneously available passive microwave radiometric measurements from TOPEX/Poseidon itself have also been used to delineate and quantify rain over oceanic regions surrounding India. Based on a reasonably good correlation between rainfall inferred from radiometric measurements and the difference delta sigma degrees between radar backscatter coefficients at 5 GHz and 13 GHz, significant rain events are isolated during the course of the 1993 South-West (SW) monsoon season over the Indian region. Monthly maps of these rain events from altimeter based analysis clearly bring out the nature of rainfall activity associated with SUI monsoon. The results from delta sigma degrees also compare very well with the operational quantitative precipitation estimates available from INSAT-VHRR analyses. The advantages and limitations of radar altimeter data are discussed in terms of those of the other current and future rain measurement systems.

However, these estimates fail to consider the negative impact of ozone (O-3) air pollution on crop production. Increases in tropospheric concentrations of both gases, CO2 and O-3, have been observed over the past century, and both are predicted to continue to increase at even higher rates in the near future to levels when they may have a significant impact on agricultural production. Field studies with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in 1991 and 1992, and corn (Zea mays L.) in 1991 were conducted using open-top chambers to mimic atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (similar to 500 mu L(-1) CO2) and O-3 (similar to 40 nL L(-1) O-3 above ambient air [O-3] during 7h day(-1) 5 days week(-1)) that are predicted to occur at the Earth surface during the first half of the 21st century. Wheat and corn (C-3 vs. C-4) produced clearly different responses to CO2 enrichment, but similar responses to O-3 exposure. In wheat, O-3 exposure led to reduced grain yield, biomass, and radiation use efficiency (RUE, phytomass production per unit of energy received); in both years; but reduction in accumulated absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (AAPAR) was observed only in 1991. Conversely, CO2 enrichment produced greater grain yield, dry biomass, and RUE. With CO2 enrichment, the O-3-induced stress to wheat plants was apparently ameliorated since responses were equivalent to the control group (low O-3 and ambient CO2) for all variables. In contrast, corn demonstrated no benefit to CO2 enrichment for measured variables, and corn grain yield was the only parameter negatively influenced by O-3 exposure that is attributed to O-3-induced damage during the flowering process. Additionally, no treatment differences were observed for leaf area index (LAI) as determined nondestructively using the LICOR LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer. Also, treatment differences for normalized difference vegetation index (ND) were only observed for wheat plants from the high-O-3 and ambient-CO2 treatment, at some growing stages. Otherwise, ND were not helpful for identifying damage due to O-3 fumigation or benefits due to CO2 enrichment.

The GOES Adapted LDTNLR Ocean Cloud Mask (GALOCM) algorithm for cloud detection in GOES scenes over the oceans provides a computationally efficient, scene-specific way to circumvent these difficulties. The algorithm consists of four steps: 1) generate a cloud mask using the Local Dynamic Threshold Non-Linear Rayleigh (LDTNLR) algorithm of Simpson and Humphrey (1990); 2) generate a second cloud mask using an adaptive threshold: 3) divide the pixels in the scene into three groups (both methods agree that pixel is ocean, pixel is cloud, or the pixel is in contention); and 4) iteratively apply an adaptive threshold to the contested pixels. Convergence occurs when pixels are no longer in contention based on statistical criteria. Results show that the GALOCM method produces accurate cloud masks over the oceans which are neither regionally dependent nor temporally specific. GOES scenes containing ocean, cloud, and land are best cloud screened using a combination of the GOES Split-and-Merge Clustering (Simpson and Gobat, 1995) and the GALOCM algorithms.RP SIMPSON, JJ (通讯作者)，UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO,SCRIPPS INST OCEANOG,SCRIPPS SATELLITE OCEANOG CTR,DIGITAL IMAGE ANAL LAB,LA JOLLA,CA 92093, USA.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 29, 20, 24, 0, 3, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE PUBL CO INC', 'NEW YORK', '655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010', '0034-4257', NULL, 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

Relative cover changes along distance from water point axes are derived to standardize and reveal gradients of cover change and cover resistance to drought.  By testing cover changes against neutral predictions, insights are gained into the association between grazing processes, geomorphology, and climatic conditions.  Four MSS images of two sheep-grazed paddocks from wooded rangelands in eastern Australia are used to demonstrate that increasing and decreasing linear cover change gradients, and contrasting forage resistances to drought, can be found and assessed.

These exchanges affect local, regional, and global climates, which feedback to affect the biogeography and physiology of the vegetation. Consequently, there is interest in developing a comprehensive land surface scheme that integrates biophysical, biogeochemical, and ecosystem dynamical processes. Land surface process models of energy and moisture exchanges, ecosystem biogeochemistry models, and ecosystem dynamics models share many features. However, these models have been developed independently by groups interested in their respective field not in the integration across fields. Thus, there are important discrepancies among models that will have to be reconciled if an integrative land-atmosphere interaction package is to be developed. In particular, the temporal resolution and biophysical rigor of land surface process models and the links among energy, water, and CO2 exchange make these models the logical model to calculate land-atmosphere CO2 exchange at diurnal to annual time scales. Longer-term exchanges can be simulated by including plant demography and nutrient cycling. Models that combine the biophysical and biogeochemical controls of CO2 exchange help define remote sensing applications important to modeling the seasonal and annual carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems. Sensitivity analyses with such a model show that the annual production of biomass and the seasonal cycle of CO2 exchange in boreal forests are well approximated merely by knowing the beginning and end of the growing season, absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, foliage nitrogen concentration, and vegetation type.RP BONAN, GB (通讯作者)，NATL CTR ATMOSPHER RES, POB 3000, BOULDER, CO 80307 USA.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 108, 116, 155, 0, 33, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

It depends on the geometric dimension and spatial organization of vegetation elements, and therefore has a potential for diagnosing canopy geometric structure. In the context of this study, we first reconcile different notations used by previous workers. This leads to geometrically quantifying the cross-correlation function, which is essential for the hotspot modeling. A comprehensive formulation for the hotspot effect at both leaf and canopy levels is then developed, by generally parameterizing some basic parameters such as mean area of shadows and overlap between shadows cast by scatterers. A rectangle model is proposed to account for the influence of noncircular shape of scatterers on the hotspot effect, and explicit expressions for both the cross-correlation function and the hotspot width are obtained. It is shown that for a leaflike object, the angular hotspot width progressively broadens with an increase of m, the ratio of mean leaf width to the length. For the whole canopy, the relative distribution of the hotspot intensity mainly depends on this ratio. That is, the cross-correlation function decreases more rapidly for smaller m as the viewing direction diverges from the illumination direction. As a result, canopy reflectance increases with m, particularly in the region around the hotspot point where the reflectance distribution strongly relies on the ratio m. For m = pi/4, the rectangle model produces nearly same result as the disk model. This indicates this rectangle model is more realistic and flexible than those based on circle-shaped scatterers (leaves) or their shadows, which is the common assumption underlying in most existing hotspot models.', 'CHINESE ACAD SCI, INST GEOG, BEIJING 100012, PEOPLES R CHINA.', 'Chinese Academy of Sciences', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 22, 34, 36, 0, 12, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', '360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

However, the influence of substrate on vegetation communities is generally rather limited, and therefore classifications that are based on geobotanical associations can be improved greatly by including geomorphological and community spatial relationships, particularly those derived from digital elevation data. In a remote sensing study of Quetico Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada, digital topographic data was used to divide the landscape into four microclimate and drainage classes. The Landsat Thematic Mapper data were transformed into the nPDF Deciduous Forest Index, which is an estimate of the deciduous-coniferous mixture in each pixel. This was supplemented by digital aeromagnetic data and geological field mapping. Associations of the vegetation communities with geology, microclimate, and drainage classes were identified from these data, and then used in a rule-based geobotanical classification called TOPOVEG. TOPOVEG achieved an 85% accuracy in a classification of the 10 km x 13 km primary test site. A standard maximum likelihood classification of the same area had an accuracy of only 71%, and produces an output that has a distinctive noisy texture compared to the large, homogeneous classes of TOPOVEG. In a neighboring test site to the north, TOPOVEG accuracy was similarly high (86%). A neighboring southern test site, however, showed changing vegetation associations and consequently a lower accuracy. This suggests that the classification can be extended to neighboring unknown areas, except to the south where the classification rules should be modified to take into account the changing vegetation associations.

The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the application of Landsat MT imagery to the survey and monitoring of water quality in coastal regions affected by land drainage from peat swamp catchments, which are common in southeast Asia, thus where dissolved organic matter (yellow substance) dominates the volume reflectance of coastal water. The Thematic mapper 0.45-0.52 mum waveband was found to be capable of differentiating water with high concentration of yellow substance from nonplume water, but the addition of the 0.63-0.69 mum waveband was required for differentiating lower concentrations of yellow substance. The higher temperature of yellow substance dominated river plumes observed on the 10.5-12.5 mum waveband confirmed field observations.

Once the emissivities in Channels 4 and 5 are known, the surface temperature can be determined using the local split-window method proposed in our previous work. In order to test the applicability of the method when atmospheric radiosoundings are not available, we discuss the effects of the errors generated by an approximate knowledge of the atmosphere on the retrieval of both emissivity and surface temperature. It is shown that if a radiosounding or a satellite sounding (from TOVS for instance) of the atmosphere is not available, the use of a climatic atmosphere leads to satisfactory results because the retrieval of emissivity is less sensitive to atmospheric uncertainties than the temperature itself, The method is applied to one AVHRR image over La Crau and results fit with in situ measurements.

The NDVI response from the grassland canopy was strongly anisotropic about nadir view angles while the SAVI response was symmetric about nadir. This occurred for all sun angles, soil moisture condition, and grass densities. This enabled variations in SAVI-view angle response to be minimized with a cosine function. It is expected that this study will aid in improving the characterization of vegetation temporal activity from Landsat TM, SPOT, AVHRR, and the Earth Observing System MODIS sensor.RP HUETE, AR (通讯作者)，UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT SOIL & WATER SCI, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA.RI van Leeuwen, Willem/A-6547-2008; chehbouni, abdelghani/K-2096-2016; van   Leeuwen, Willem/ABB-6711-2020; Huete, Alfredo/C-1294-2008', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'chehbouni, abdelghani/0000-0002-0270-1690; van Leeuwen,   Willem/0000-0002-3188-7172; Huete, Alfredo/0000-0003-2809-2376', NULL, NULL, 32, 116, 126, 0, 24, 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC', 'NEW YORK', 'STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA', '0034-4257', '1879-0704', 'REMOTE SENS ENVIRON', 'Remote Sens.

This procedure offers numerous advantages, but it has considerable shortcomings in the presence of strongly irregular spectral distributions, mainly related to bias in area estimates. Since these cases are quite common, some methods have already been proposed to correct biased area estimates from maximum likelihood classifications, but they are often not generally applicable or statistically stable. In this article a method is put forward to correct maximum likelihood assignment probabilities by means of a transition matrix; this matrix is derived through a simple mathematical algorithm from a contingency table of a previous classification compared to reference pixels. The purpose is clearly to attain a diagonalization of the final error sources to better estimate area extents and, above all, to achieve higher global discrimination accuracy. As different environmental situations may cause wide variability in the results of such a procedure, this was tested in three case studies using TM data acquired over areas with different landscapes.

The goal of this study was to show that remote sensing from light aircraft can complement and extend measurements made from traditional platforms and provide data of improved temporal and spatial resolution, leading to a better understanding of phytoplankton dynamics in the estuary. We followed the developments of the winter-spring diatom bloom in the polyhaline to mesohaline regions of the estuary and of the late-spring and summer dinoflagellate blooms in oligohaline and mesohaline regions. The instrument we used is an aircraft-borne, visible band radiometer system, NASA\'s Ocean Data Acquisition System (ODAS). The ODAS instrument package has three radiometers in the blue to blue-green part of the visible spectrum (460 nm, 490 nm, and 520 nm), an infrared temperature sensor, a broad-band (400-700 nm) downwelling irradiance sensor, Loran-C navigation, and a PC for data acquisition. During 1989, 14 flights were conducted in a 19-week period. Two additional missions were flown in conjunction with local shipboard operations for obtaining concurrent radiance measurements and in situ chlorophyll data. The main sources of in situ data used in algorithm development were semi-monthly to monthly cruises conducted by the Mainstem Water Quality Monitoring Program of the states of Maryland and Virginia as part of the Chesapeake Bay Program\'s (CBP) activities. Data for algorithm development were also obtained from shipboard measurements made in an experiment with ODAS and NASA\'s Airborne Oceanographic Lidar (AOL) to study the suitability of various waveband combinations for recovering chlorophyll concentrations. This article presents the local chlorophyll algorithm we developed using ODAS data and in situ chlorophyll data, interpolated maps of chlorophyll concentration generated by applying the algorithm to aircraft radiance data, ancillary in situ data on nutrients, turbidity, streamflow, and light availability, and an interpretation of phytoplankton dynamics in terms of the chlorophyll distribution in the Chesapeake Bay during 1989.', 'JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV,DEPT GEOG & ENVIRONM ENGN,BALTIMORE,MD 21218.

The model may be defined at two levels: whole-canopy and individual-leaf. At the whole-canopy level, the forest scene is treated as a collection of discrete canopy envelopes with simple geometric shapes that are arranged on a contrasting background. The scene includes four components: sunlit canopy, shadowed canopy, sunlit background, and shadowed background. The radiance or reflectance of the scene as a whole is modeled as the sum of the radiances or reflectances of the individual components as weighted by their areal proportions. The areal proportions of the components are determined by 1) principles of geometric optics as applied to the shapes of the canopy envelopes and 2) Boolean models for random set overlap. These yield the expected proportions of the components as a function of angles of irradiance and exitance. At the leaf level, the canopy envelope can be treated as containing an assemblage of leaves, and thus the radiance or reflectance is a function of the areal proportions of sunlit leaf, shadowed leaf, sunlit background, and shadowed background. Because the proportions of scene components are dependent upon the directions of irradiance and exitance, the model accounts for the \"hotspot\" that is well known in leaf and tree canopies. Because both whole-canopy and individual-leaf models are driven by the same principles of geometric optics and Boolean modeling, they may easily be combined together in a single, two-stage model. Moreover, through further application of the mathematics of random sets, the averaging and variance that occurs when a scene is imaged by a sensor with a finite field of view may be accommodated. In addition, the models are capable of inversion, yielding estimates of size, shape, and spacing of crowns and/or leaves from directional and spatial statistics of remotely sensed radiances.', 'BOSTON UNIV, DEPT GEOG, BOSTON, MA 02215 USA.

Several studies have explored the temporal variation of backscatter intensity in this context, but none considered that scattering directionality of canopies may vary. Said directionality is related to target-sensor geometry (incidence angle), forest height, and optical depth, associated with leaf dynamics. This study explicitly models backscatter dependance on incidence angle by fitting a regression model for each Sentinel-1 image and forest type. Residuals are accumulated across the time series and used to classify pixels into the most likely forest type using the smallest accumulated residual. This modelling and classification strategy has been applied over a North-South transect across the Carpathian Mountains, including forests with different physiognomies, from deciduous broadleaf forest, to mixed broadleaf-needleleaf and pure perennial needleleaf forests. These forests were classified with increasing detail, assessing the results against in-situ forest stand data and satellite-based land cover classification products (Copernicus Forest type layer). The accuracy of our classification was K > 0.8, OA > 90% when separating broadleaf from needleleaf forest types. The accuracy decreased (K > 0.6, OA > 79%) when also separating mixed forest types. Our results suggest that incorporating directional effects into classification models can improve SAR-based forest classification of temperate forest over mountainous terrain. Furthermore, models fitted between backscatter and incidence angle provide an estimate of n, a parameter related to optical depth that has been shown to vary with leaf dynamics. n could be used to improve image normalization in studies aiming at the estimation of biomass, or to aid the estimation of fast-changing parameters such as leaf area index or leaf moisture content.', '[Borlaf-Mena, Ignacio; Garcia-Duro, Juan; Badea, Ovidiu; Tanase, Mihai Andrei] Romanian Natl Inst Res & Dev Forestry, Dept Forest Monitoring, INCDS Marin Dracea, Blvd Eroilor 128, Voluntari 077190, Romania.

Overall, the study shows that USTFIP reduces the root mean square error by 2-to-13% relative to the state-of-the-art Fit-FC fusion method, due to an efficient use of the available information.

To solve this problem, this study developed a method for estimating the pan-Arctic ice draft (depth of sea ice below sea surface level) using spaceborne passive microwavemeasured brightness temperatures (TBs). This study found that the time series of TBs is highly correlated with the corresponding time series of ice draft (D)s measured by three upward-looking sonar (ULS) sites over the Beaufort Sea during the ice melting season. Based on this finding, a D estimation equation was derived by relating satellite-measured TBs at microwave frequencies to Ds. Pan-Arctic D distributions from June to August obtained from this study describe well the general thinning process of Arctic sea ice during the summer of 2021. The validation of estimated Ds with other ULS measurements, which were not used for training data, showed good agreement between them suggesting the robustness of the developed estimation method over the Arctic basin. In addition, validation was made against ice mass balance buoy-measured sea ice thickness, and result shows a good agreement between buoy-measured ice thickness and estimated ice thickness converted from the D. Meanwhile, relatively high uncertainty in D estimation above 2 m shown in the result and validation suggests the potential for future improvement of D estimation in the early melting period. As the proposed method can provide summer pan-Arctic D distributions on a daily basis, the D from this study can be applied for generating the initial field for the sea ice and global climate models through data assimilation.', '[Kim, Jong -Min; Kim, Sang -Woo; Sohn, Byung-Ju; Lee, Sang-Moo; Shi, Hoyeon] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul, South Korea.

Where these variations are not accounted for, urban LST products are inconsistent through time, limiting their use in urban weather and climate model evaluations and process studies (e.g. urban heat island, building energy bal-ance, human thermal comfort). Obstacle-resolving numerical models (ORM) of urban form and radiation ex-changes are being used to: (a) understand relations between EO view angle, the 3-dimensional urban surface, and the surface temperatures from urban land surface models, and (b) evaluate parameterisations (parametric models) that aim to account for LST angular effects for the next operational satellite products. Most ORM are limited to simplified buildings (e.g. cuboids) and surface temperatures by lack of datasets. Novelly, we use both a realistic urban form model and observed surface temperatures to assess the impact of simplifying the urban form and temperature on the modelled LST anisotropy. We test various sets of assumptions in central London by combining ground-based thermal camera observations and the state-of-the-art Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model.

These data are used to simulate brightness temperatures of EO pixels to quantify LST view angle variations.During daytime, a change of view angle of 47<degrees> off-nadir corresponds to a difference in LST of up to 5.1 K for the realistic building model. The intermediate-complexity landscape (easily obtainable building geometry/ footprints and more idealised surface temperature distributions driven only by shadow patterns) gives the best agreement in simulated LST to the realistic landscape. The directional variations are still captured in total (daytime mean absolute error 0.44 K) when using an idealised ORM representation of the same landscape (cuboid buildings, simplified surface temperature) except for roofs which are near-isotropic. Results suggest that geometry assumptions used in current ORM are suited for evaluation of parametric models used to develop and verify operational LST sensor view angle corrections.

It is essential to clarify environmental effects on detecting forest spatial structures using stereoscopic images in addition to data processing algorithms. The seasonal effects in mountainous deciduous forests is systematically explored in this study from mid-summer to late winter using 8 dates of ZY-3 stereoscopic images. This study reveals that the acquisition season is an important factor affecting the detection of forest spatial structures. In the leaf-on season, for closed forest stands, the forest canopy tops are easily to be detected; for open forest stands, the ground surface can be detected through between-canopy gaps in mid-summer, but be missed in late summer or early fall. In the leaf-off season, the stereoscopic imagery acquired in late winter or early spring was preferred for the detection of ground surfaces, while the mountain shadows limit those acquired in early and middle winter. The ratio of sunlit ground visible in stereoscopic images as the season change is the factor controlling these findings. The images with the smaller ratio are preferred for the detection of forest canopy tops, while the opposite is proper for the detection of ground surfaces. The combination of ZY-3 stereoscopic imagery acquired in mid-summer and late winter gave the best estimation accuracy of forest AGB among possible combinations.', '[Ni, Wenjian; Yu, Tianyu; Zhang, Zhiyu] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.

Methods that consider the spatial structure of biomass model residuals are needed to comprehensively estimate, as well as to effectively reduce, the uncertainty in biomass predictions, for pursuing higher levels of precision for measurement, reporting and verification of forest carbon stocks. The objectives of the study were threefold: (1) to demonstrate a spatial data assimilation (DA) procedure that harnesses small-footprint airborne LiDAR, the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) and the spatial structure of biomass model residuals to reduce prediction variances of individual tree biomass and plot-level biomass density; (2) to derive a variance estimator that de-composes the variance into components associated with corresponding error sources; and (3) to compare pre-diction variances for three methods used to calibrate a height-based allometric model for tree biomass: ordinary least squares (OLS), generalized least squares (GLS), and spatial DA using the BLUP. Five major conclusions are drawn. First, for individual tree biomass predictions, spatial DA decreased prediction variance by 40% and 20% relative to OLS and GLS. Because the decrease in residual variability accounted for 98% of the decrease in prediction variance in total, the assimilation effect was the largest for reducing residual variability. Second, for biomass density predictions, DA decreased prediction variance by 3% and 49% relative to OLS and GLS, with the largest decrease in residual covariance. Accumulated gain in precision for individual tree predictions in the DA procedure was offset by precision loss caused by residual covariance and the variance associated with omission and commission errors while predicting individual tree biomass from the LiDAR data. Third, OLS, which assumed no spatial structure, underestimated prediction variance for LiDAR-predicted biomass density by 48%. Fourth, from the perspective of prediction accuracy, DA reduced the RMSE for individual tree biomass predictions by 11% and 14% and reduced the RMSE for biomass density predictions by 28% and 33% relative to OLS and GLS. Fifth, the omission/commission difference model was effective for correcting the systematic prediction error in the LiDAR-predicted biomass density. Overall, the proposed spatial DA procedure demonstrated great potential for reducing the uncertainty in forest biomass predictions, thereby facilitating more efficient biomass inventories. The procedure can be generalized to other dependent variables of interest given their correlations with new information from LiDAR.', '[Xu, Qing] Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm, Beijing Bamboo & Rattan Sci & Technol, Int Ctr Bamboo & Rattan, Key Lab, Beijing 100102, Peoples R China.

However, there are still large uncertainties in model simulations of tropical convective clouds and precipitation. In this study, CloudSat/CALIPSO and MODIS measurements are combined to provide vertical convective cloud structures under horizontal storm context and structures of convective cores. Convective cells are identified with MODIS brightness temperature at 11 mu m (BT11) and convective centers are determined for each cell by finding the minimum BT11 (BT11min). The difference between BT11 and BT11min is calculated to provide the distance to the convective center as in brightness temperature. Therefore, detailed convective cloud structures from centers to the stratiform regions could be shown as in the contoured frequency by temperature diagram (CFTD) of radar reflectivity factor (Ze). A group of strongly attenuated Ze profiles is identified near the convective center in Africa during daytime, and the occurrence of this group of profiles is much smaller in the west Pacific during daytime. The out-of-phase day/night variations of convective system structures over ocean and over land are also analyzed. It is shown that over ocean regions, rather than land regions, nighttime convective clouds have larger Ze than daytime ones between 210 K to 260 K, but they have smaller Ze at temperatures colder than 210 K near the cloud top. The convective cores are analyzed by separating and classifying those strongly attenuated Ze profiles as group one convective cores representing the developing stage, and the rest regular profiles as group two convective cores representing the later stage. As BT11min decreases for group one, the cores grow stronger with the maximum Ze shifts into lower temperature; and as BT11min decreases for group two, the CFTD for the cores gradually shifts to larger Ze for temperatures colder than 273.15 K and smaller Ze for temperatures warmer than 273.15 K.

This is traditionally done through surveys and by predictive modelling. However, surveying on a large scale is expensive and hard to repeat. Recent research has shown that deep learning models trained on remote sensing images may be used to predict liveability. In this paper we study how well a model can predict liveability from aerial images by first predicting a set of intermediate domain scores. Our results suggest that our semantic bottleneck model performs equally well to a model that is trained only to predict liveability. Secondly, our model extrapolates well to unseen regions (R-2 between 0.45 and 0.75, Kendall\'s tau between 0.39 and 0.57), even to regions with an urban developmental context that is different from areas seen during training. Our results also suggest that domains which are directly visible within the aerial image patches (physical environment, buildings) are easier to generalize than domains which can only be predicted through proxies (population, safety, amenities). We also test our model\'s perception of different neighbourhood typologies, from which we conclude that our model is able to predict the liveability of neighbourhood typologies though with a varying accuracy. Overall, our results suggest that remote sensing can be used to extrapolate liveability surveys and their related domains to new and unseen regions within the same cultural and policy context.', '[Levering, Alex] Wageningen Univ & Res, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, Wageningen, Netherlands.

Accurate delineation of coastal aquaculture extent and changes is thus significant for improving coastal zone management toward sustainability. Here, by means of Sentinel-2 images, we propose an effective and rapid approach that combines simple non-iterative clustering (SNIC) with hierarchical decision trees (HDT), so-called SNIC-HDT, to generate fine-resolution coastal aquaculture pond data at the national scale of China. The SNIC-HDT fully considers the spatial heterogeneity of coastal aquaculture ponds and performs accurate segmentation by determining the optimal segmentation scale for coastal aquaculture ponds with different sizes and shapes. In addition, the SNIC-HDT incorporates temporal features into the establishment of HDT and thus effectively distinguishes coastal aquaculture ponds from other water bodies. In support of the Google Earth Engine platform, we employed 85,501 scenes of Sentinel-2 images and generated the first annual 10-m spatial resolution national coastal aquaculture pond dataset of China between 2016 and 2021 (China_CAP), with an overall classification accuracy of more than 90%. This dataset reveals that total area of China\'s coastal aquaculture ponds experienced a substantial loss of 13.21% from 9769 km2 in 2016 to 8629 km2 in 2021. The most remarkable areal reduction occurred in Zhejiang Province, with a decrease rate of 38.24%, followed by Guangdong (27.93%), and these reductions were mostly related to the policy of retuning aquaculture ponds to natural wetlands. Coastal aquaculture ponds in Fujian and Tianjin provinces experienced slight areal gains (7.24% and 2.13%).

Many lidar models have been based on metrics derived from summarizations of individual lidar returns over sample plot areas, but more recently, metrics based on summarization by volumetric pixel (voxel) have shown promise to better characterize forest structure and distinguish between diverse forest types. Voxel-based metrics may improve characterization of leaf area distribution and horizontal forest structure, which could help create general models of forest attributes applicable in complex landscapes composed of many distinct forest types. We modeled wood volume in longleaf pine woodlands and associated forests to compare how area- and voxel- based lidar metrics predicted wood volume in forest type specific and general predictive models. We created four area-based and six voxel-based metrics to fit models of wood volume using a multiplicative power function. We selected models and compared metric importance using AIC and evaluated model performance using cross-validated mean prediction error. We found that one area-based metric and four voxel-based metrics consistently improved model predictions We suggest that area-based metrics alone may have limitations for characterizing complex forest structure. Area-based summarizes of lidar returns are more heavily influenced by upper canopy returns because lidar returns attenuate below the canopy. By contrast, summarizing lidar returns into a single value per voxel prior to summarization over plots homogenizes point density, giving added weight to sub-canopy returns. Thus voxel-based metrics may be more sensitive to structural variation that may not be adequately captured by area-based metrics alone. This study highlights the potential of voxel-based metrics for characterizing complex forest structure and model generalization capable of accurate forest attribute prediction across diverse forest types.', '[Whelan, Andrew W.; Cannon, Jeffery B.; Bigelow, Seth W.; Rutledge, Brandon T.] Jones Ctr Ichauway, Newton, GA 39870 USA.

Notably, they are of great importance to fishery production and salt lake ecosystem health. Recently, Artemia resources have been threatened by habitat deterioration and overfishing, which mandate adequate monitoring; however, advanced methods for detecting Artemia from remote sensing images have rarely been discussed. Accordingly, this study explored the possibility of detecting the adult Artemia (Artemia) slicks using multispectral optical sensors by analyzing their unique aggregation patterns and consistent optical properties. After measuring Artemia spectra in the field, reflectance troughs were observed at-431 nm and -560 nm, which were deemed likely related to the absorption of beta-carotene and heme, respectively, resulting in their reddish color. These characteristics could also be used to differentiate Artemia from other confounding features, including clean water and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a)-or suspended par-ticulate matter (SPM)-dominated water. Based on these spectral signatures, a brine shrimp index (BSI) was developed using the difference between the reflectance at NIR band and a linear baseline between green and SWIR1 bands of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. Further, a BSI-based Artemia slick pixel extraction method was proposed. Using observation geometry information in conjunction with the BSI value of entire lakes, the BSI thresholds for the Artemia-containing pixels were automatically determined, and > 80% overall accuracy was achieved. The index performance was affected by the presence of residual cloud shadows, high water turbidity, and mixed pixels with low Artemia density. Moreover, BSI values were found to be rela-tively insensitive to atmospheric signals. It was shown here that the BSI detection limit was >0.53% Artemia subpixel coverage under clean water conditions; whereas a higher coverage was required to separate Artemia from Chl-a-or SPM-dominated water. The mean absolute percentage difference of BSI values calculated from Rayleigh-corrected and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance was <4% compared with surface reflectance derived BSI, and the relative difference in coverage area was < +/- 10%. Lastly, time series analyses of Lake Aibi in northwest China and the Great Salt Lake in North America revealed that the annual areal coverage estimation of Artemia slicks based on BSI was a positive indicator of Artemia harvesting, which can facilitate the Artemia resource management.', '[Tian, Liqiao; Tian, Jingyi; Wang, Jianru; Wang, Xin] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & Re, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

Seagrass beds provide important ecological services and support high levels of biodiversity, thus monitoring the spatial and temporal variability of water clarity in the Big Bend region, particularly during the seagrass growth season (April to October), is of vital importance. Satellite remote sensing of coastal water clarity is often challenging due to the optical complexity and heterogeneity of coastal regions as well as frequent clouds and sun glint in the satellite imagery. As such, we developed machine learning (ML) approaches to derive the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm [Kd(490)] from satellite data with partial atmospheric correction. Traditionally, such algorithms would be developed to capture the full range and variation of the parameter of interest. Here, we demonstrate deficiencies in this method, and instead advocate for an alternate approach which leverages seagrass light re-quirements to improve the algorithm design. Specifically, we developed and implemented a 2-stage ML approach, which first classifies the coastal water into two types, then retrieves Kd(490) for the water type within which measurable changes in water clarity may impact seagrass health. We developed and compared the traditional ML approach and the proposed 2-stage ML approach based on data from MODIS/Aqua, OLCI/ Sentinel-3A, and VIIRS/SNPP. Given the outperformance of the 2-stage ML approach, we applied it to the MODIS/Aqua data archive (2003-2020) to generate time-series Kd(490) maps and analyzed how often different areas across the Northern Big Bend region are suitable for seagrass growth each year. The derived information is important toward understanding how the spatial and temporal variation in light availability impacts seagrass growth and distribution in the study region, while the 2-stage ML approach appears applicable to other coastal regions with similar optical complexity.', '[Xu, Min; Barnes, Brian B.; Hu, Chuanmin] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.

Mapping the structure of broad heterogeneous forests is chal-lenging, but the integration of extensive field inventory plots with wall-to-wall metrics derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing offers a potential solution. Our goal was to map forest structure attributes (diameter at breast height, basal area, mean height, dominant height, wood volume and canopy cover) at 30-m resolution across the diverse 463,000 km2 of native forests of Argentina based on SAR Sentinel-1, vegetation metrics from Sentinel-2 and geographic coordinates. We modelled the forest structure attributes based on the latest national forest inventory, generated uncertainty maps, quantified the contribution of the predictors, and compared our height predictions with those from GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investiga-tion) and GFCH (Global Forest Canopy Height). We analyzed 3788 forest inventory plots (1000 m2 each) from Argentina\'s Second Native Forest Inventory (2015-2020) to develop predictive random forest regression models. From Sentinel-1, we included both VV (vertical transmitted and received) and VH (vertical transmitted and horizontal received) polarizations and calculated 1st and 2nd order textures within 3 x 3 pixels to match the size of the inventory plots. For Sentinel-2, we derived EVI (enhanced vegetation index), calculated DHIs (dynamic habitat indices (annual cumulative, minimum and variation) and the EVI median, then generated 1st and 2nd order textures within 3 x 3 pixels of these variables. Our models including metrics from Sentinel-1 and 2, plus latitude and longitude predicted forest structure attributes well with root mean square errors (RMSE) ranging from 23.8% to 70.3%. Mean and dominant height models had notably good performance presenting relatively low RMSE (24.5% and 23.8%, respectively). Metrics from VH polarization and longitude were overall the most important predictors, but optimal predictors differed among the different forest structure attributes. Height predictions (r = 0.89 and 0.85) outperformed those from GEDI (r = 0.81) and the GFCH (r = 0.66), suggesting that SAR Sentinel-1, DHIs from Sentinel-2 plus geographic coordinates provide great opportunities to map multiple forest structure attributes for large areas. Based on our models, we generated spatially-explicit maps of multiple forest structure attributes as well as uncertainty maps at 30-m spatial resolution for all Argentina\'s native forest areas in support of forest management and conservation planning across the country.', '[Silveira, Eduarda M.

Accurate detection of RB occurrence with a universal metric is crucial to facilitate early disease prevention and curtailing the disease expansion but has not been addressed to date. This study aimed to design a rice blast index (RIBI) for quantifying the disease index (DI) and tracking the smallholder rice blast dispersal over multiple spatial scales. To achieve this goal, a large dataset including leaf-and canopy-scale reflectance spectra and satellite imagery was acquired within the framework of seven independent campaigns over four years (2018-2021). Specifically, an extensive collection of Magnaporthe oryzae infected samples were analyzed to examine the specific spectral response to pathogen infection in paddy rice from leaf to near-ground canopy scales. Two variants of the RIBI were devel-oped, which were RIBInir = (R753-R1102)/(R665 + R1102) and RIBIred= (R753-R1102)/(R665 + R1102) based on the single-band separability and exhaustive search of band combinations. They were subsequently evaluated for quantifying the RB occurrence from ground to space. Spatial cluster analysis was then integrated with the su-perior RIBI adjusted for Sentinel-2 imagery to explore the spatio-temporal dynamics of pathogen infection, and to reveal the within-field hotspots of potential rice blast dispersal in smallholder farms.The results demonstrated that both RIBInir and RIBIredexhibited high overall accuracies for the classification of infected and healthy samples at the leaf scale under greenhouse in 2018 (RIBInir: 81.41%; RIBIred: 84.62%) and 2019 (RIBInir: 81.30%; RIBIred: 90.37%) and field conditions in 2020 (RIBInir: 86.36%; RIBIred: 89.39%). Compared with traditional VIs (Near-ground: R2 < 0.47, satellite: R2 < 0.54), the RIBInir yielded improved R2 in quantifying the DI from in situ spectra to satellite imagery (Near-ground: R2 = 0.73, satellite: R2 = 0.78). The strongest DI-RIBInir relationship was attributed to the use of two near-infrared (NIR) bands that helped enhance the unique spectral responses in the NIR region induced by pathogen infection, in contrast to the extensively studied visible region. Multi-temporal analysis of Sentinel-2A derived RIBInir successfully captured the temporal dynamics of RB infection and recovery and yielded compelling maps showing the spatial propagation and attenuation of disease over time.

The total set of traits and their variation over time is specific for each individual and can reveal information about the genetic composition of forest communities. Measuring trait variation among individuals of one species continuously across space and time is a key component in monitoring genetic diversity but difficult to achieve with ground-based methods. Remote sensing approaches using imaging spectroscopy can provide high spectral, spatial, and temporal coverage to advance the monitoring of genetic diversity, if sufficient relation between spectral and genetic information can be established.   We assessed reflectance spectra from individual Fagus sylvatica L. (European beech) trees acquired across eleven years from 69 flights of the Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) above the same temperate forest in Switzerland. We derived reflectance spectra of 68 canopy trees and correlated differences in these spectra with genetic differences derived from microsatellite markers among the 68 individuals. We calculated these correlations for different points in time, wavelength regions and relative differences between wavelength regions. High correlations indicate high spectral-genetic similarities. We then tested the influence of environmental variables obtained at temporal scales from days to years on spectral-genetic similarities. We performed an uncertainty propagation of radiance measurements to provide a quality indicator for these correlations.   We observed that genetically similar individuals had more similar reflectance spectra, but this varied between wavelength regions and across environmental variables. The short-wave infrared regions of the spectrum, influenced by water absorption, seemed to provide information on the population genetic structure at high temperatures, whereas the visible part of the spectrum, and the near-infrared region affected by scattering properties of tree canopies, showed more consistent patterns with genetic structure across longer time scales. Correlations of genetic similarity with reflectance spectra similarity were easier to detect when investigating relative differences between spectral bands (maximum correlation: 0.40) than reflectance data (maximum correlation: 0.33). Incorporating uncertainties of spectral measurements yielded improvements of spectral-genetic similarities of 36% and 20% for analyses based on single spectral bands, and relative differences between spectral bands, respectively.   This study highlights the potential of dense multi-temporal airborne imaging spectroscopy data to detect the genetic structure of forest communities. We suggest that the observed temporal trajectories of reflectance spectra indicate physiological and possibly genetic constraints on plant responses to environmental change.', '[Czyz, Ewa A.; Schmid, Bernhard; Hueni, Andreas; Schuman, Meredith C.; Guillen-Escriba, Carla; Schaepman, Michael E.] Univ Zurich, Remote Sensing Labs, Dept Geog, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.

Information about the proximity of the reconstructed SIF (SIFr) datasets to GPP across land cover types and climatic conditions provides important support for a better application of these products for modelling applications. We conducted a multiscale analysis of four different long-term (12 years, 2007-2018) high-resolution global SIFr datasets (0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees), namely - CSIF (Contiguous SIF), GOSIF (Global OCO-2 SIF), LUE-SIF (Light Use Efficiency SIF), and HSIF (Harmonized SIF) -at 4-day, 8-day, and monthly time scales and found that for the majority of sites, the SIFr is linearly related to ground-based GPP measurements with the eddy covariance method. While the relationship between SIFr and GPP (i.e., the slope -GPP/SIFr) varied significantly across the SIFr datasets, sites, and land cover types, all four SIFr datasets were unequivocally a better predictor of GPP compared to remotely sensed vegetation indices - NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and EVI (enhanced vegetation index), sensed by the MODIS satellite. Furthermore, we also analyzed SIF-GPP relation-ships during drought vs non-drought conditions and found that for about 30% of the sites, comprising mostly non-forests site, the SIF-GPP relationship became weaker (decreased R2) with a lower slope during drought conditions compared to non-drought conditions. Among the four different products, the CSIF (at 4-day timescale) and GOSIF (at 8-day timescale) predicted GPP better compared to LUE-SIF and HSIF across all land cover types. Owing to their long-term availability (since 2000 for CSIF and GOSIF), these SIFr datasets combined with proxies of ecosystem properties can be used to appropriately capture vegetation dynamics and the interannual vari-abilities across a wide range of climatic conditions.', '[Shekhar, Ankit; Buchmann, Nina; Gharun, Mana] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.

These observations are needed to better understand the transient surface energy balance, influenced by near-surface air temperatures and water fluxes ranging from evapotranspiration to snowmelt. From geostationary orbit, the GOES Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) instrument views the Earth from a fixed longitude above the equator. ABI images therefore have increasingly off-nadir view angles and increasingly larger pixel dimensions the further a point on the Earth\'s surface is from the sub-satellite point. In thermal infrared imagery from ABI, these 2+ km pixels blur together the different surface temperatures of heterogeneous mountain landscapes. We compared GOES-16 ABI band 14 (11.2 mu m) brightness temperatures to 90 m spatial resolution ASTER band 14 (11.3 mu m) and 1 km spatial resolution MODIS band 31 (11.03 mu m) brightness temperatures and investigated how differences change over space and time for a study region in the central Sierra Nevada of California for the 2017-2020 snow seasons. We demonstrated the necessity of orthorectifying ABI imagery of mountain terrain to correct for the parallax effect in off-nadir imagery. This reduced the mean difference between ABI and ASTER similar to 11 mu m brightness temperatures from 1.6 degrees C to 1.0 degrees C and increased the r-squared value between ABI and ASTER thermal infrared brightness temperatures from 0.43 to 0.93. The ABI brightness temperatures were found to more closely match those of forest canopy temperatures than snow surface (with RMS differences of 1.2 degrees C and 3.0 degrees C respectively), and those of sunlit slopes as opposed to slopes facing away from the sun (with RMS differences of 1.6 degrees C and 3.4 degrees C respectively), in coincident ASTER imagery.

Timely and high-resolution information on the location and extent of transition forest (the ecotone between upland forest and marsh where tree mortality due to seawater intrusion begins) is fundamental to understanding the processes and patterns of SLR-driven landscape reorganization. Despite its significance, accurate characterization of salt-impacted transition forest remains challenging due to the complexity of coastal environments, scarcity of ground-truth data, and the lack of effective mapping algorithms. Here we use the full archive of Landsat images between 1984 and 2021 to investigate the spectral, temporal, and phenological characteristics of transition forest, and develop a robust framework for monitoring coastal vegetation shifts in the mid-Atlantic U.S., a global SLR hotspot. We found that transition forest exhibits strong negative NDVI trends and a deviation of land surface phenology from marsh and upland forest that distinguishes itself from surrounding vegetation. By integrating temporal trends and land surface phenology, our results demonstrate superior discrimination between marsh and coastal forests to existing map products (e.g. NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program, National Land Cover Database) that allows a reliable identification of the coastal treeline. We applied the approach to map regional land cover in 1985, 2000 and 2020 (overall classification accuracy > 92%) and found that the area of coastal forest decreased by 22.0% from 1985 to 2020, the majority of which transitioned to marshland (92.3%, 5.3 x 10(3) ha). Based upon fine-scale patterns of coastal transgression, we created a practical workflow for spatially explicit quantification of forest retreat rates. Concurrent with rising sea level, coastal forests migrated upslope from 0.63 (+/- 0.27) m above sea level in 1985 to 0.78 (+/- 0.32) m above sea level in 2020, and horizontal forest retreat rates accelerated from 3.1 (range of 0-36) m yr(-1) during 1985-2000 to 4.7 (0-55) m yr(-1) during 2001-2020.

However, there is a lack of accurate data on the spatial distribution and change of BSCs. Here, two indices were developed to enhance BSC mapping, including the sandy land ratio crust index (SRCI) for sandy land with moss-dominated BSCs and the desert ratio crust index (DRCI) for desert with lichen-dominated BSCs. The SRCI combines the near infrared band in which moss-dominated BSCs and other surface components have significant spectral differences, and red edge bands in which such differences can be enhanced. Another index, the DRCI, highlights different spectral characteristics of lichen-dominated BSCs, gravel and sand in the shortwave infrared and red-edge bands. A random forest (RF) machine learning framework was developed to map the large-scale BSC distribution with 10 m resolution using Sentinel 2 satellite data. The results show that the BSC area in the Mu Us Sandy Land and Gurbantunggut Desert of China covers 10,647 km2 and 14,036 km2, accounting for 5.7% and 29.4% of the total area, respectively, indicating that BSC is one of the dominant land cover types in the Gurbantunggut Desert. Validations and comparisons demonstrate that the overall accuracy of BSC detection is 90% and 94% with kappa coefficients of 0.80 and 0.86 in sandy land and desert, respectively, and the proposed SRCI and DRCI increase the overall mapping accuracy by 6% for sandy land and desert compared to the non-index scheme.

Knowing where and when the changes have occurred, and the nature of those changes, is important for coastal communities and natural resource management. Large-scale mapping of coastal tidal wetland changes is extremely difficult due to their inherent dynamic nature. To bridge this gap, we developed an automated algorithm for DEtection and Characterization of cOastal tiDal wEtlands change (DECODE) using dense Landsat time series. DECODE consists of three elements, including spectral break detection, land cover classification and change characterization. DECODE assembles all available Landsat observations and introduces a water level regressor for each pixel to flag the spectral breaks and estimate harmonic time-series models for the divided temporal segments. Each temporal segment is classified (e.g., vegetated wetlands, open water, and others - including unvegetated areas and uplands) based on the phenological characteristics and the synthetic surface reflectance values calculated from the harmonic model coefficients, as well as a generic rule-based classification system. This harmonic model-based approach has the advantage of not needing the acquisition of satellite images at optimal conditions (i.e., low tide status) to avoid underestimating coastal vegetation caused by the tidal fluctuation. At the same time, DECODE can also characterize different kinds of changes including land cover change and condition change (i.e., land cover modification without conversion). We used DECODE to track status of coastal tidal wetlands in the northeastern United States from 1986 to 2020. The overall accuracy of land cover classification and change detection is approximately 95.8% and 99.8%, respectively. The vegetated wetlands and open water were mapped with user\'s accuracy of 94.6% and 99.0%, and producer\'s accuracy of 98.1% and 93.5%, respectively.

Approximately 3283 km(2) of the coastal landscape within our study area in the northeastern United States changed at least once (12% of the study area), and condition changes were the dominant change type (84.3%). Vegetated coastal tidal wetland decreased consistently (similar to 2.6 km(2) per year) in the past 35 years, largely due to conversion to open water in the context of sea-level rise.', '[Yang, Xiucheng; Zhu, Zhe; Qiu, Shi] Univ Connecticut, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Storrs, CT 06229 USA.

Many algo-rithms measuring SUHI across varying spatial or temporal scales are developed rapidly with the availability of thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing data from satellites. However, the trade-off between the spatial and temporal resolution of TIR sensors limits the study of SUHI on both spatial and temporal domains. Therefore, this study aims to improve the characterization of SUHI using spatiotemporally enhanced land surface temperature (LST) derived from the synergistic use of coarse-and fine-spatial-resolution TIR data. Combining the spatial downscaling and temporal interpolation techniques, we generated daily 100 m-resolution LST in both daytime and nighttime to analyze the SUHI in different local climate zones (LCZs) in Beijing. LCZ is a manifestation of the urban form on the thermal environment, covering hundreds of meters to several kilometers in horizontal scale. The results indicate the spatiotemporally enhanced LST is reliable in capturing the LCZ-based SUHI magnitude compared with original observations, and providing a more accurate time range when the SUHI reaches to its maximum compared with those time-discontinuous original observations. Compared with temporally interpo-lated coarse-resolution LST, the spatiotemporally enhanced LST shows a larger annual variation of SUHI (especially in LCZ 2 with a mean absolute SUHI difference of 0.8 K and 1.3 K for daytime and nighttime, respectively) and provides larger SUHI difference between compact building and open building (especially when there is a significant SUHI effect). The superiority of the spatiotemporally enhanced LSTs in analyzing LCZ-based SUHI is more evident in daily and monthly SUHI analysis than in single-day analysis or annual analysis, espe-cially in compact building types (LCZ 1 and 2). These findings are valuable information for better and healthier urban planning for SUHI mitigation and public health care.', '[Xia, Haiping; Zhou, Guomo] Zhejiang A&F Univ, State Key Lab Subtrop Silviculture, Hangzhou 311300, Peoples R China.

Considering the significant impact of clouds on the spatial properties of optical products, no study to our knowledge has focused on the multifractal analysis of a series of images. Images with minimal cloud cover were identified for the whole year 2016 based on the MACCS-ATCOR Joint Algorithm (MAJA) cloud and shadow detection process. This allowed us to access the dynamics of the scaling properties of surface reflectances, contributing to demonstrate the potential of multifractals for spatial characterization. Different scaling regimes, separated by significant scale breaks, were evident in these data. Through simulations from the Universal Multifractal model, we could explain the scaling properties and especially the position of scale breaks observed in the images studied by two types of phenomena. First, a transition scale located between hundreds of meters and one kilometre was detected on power spectra, structure functions and statistical moments. This specific scale was related to the average size of the agricultural plots of the studied region, revealing the direct link between the scaling behaviour observed and the physical properties of the surface. Second, an instrumental phenomenon was detected on the power spectra, resulting in a systematic transition scale observed near the resolution of the sensor and revealing the impact of the acquisition system on the high frequencies of optical images.

Sweden is one of the major forested countries on Earth with a carbon pool of approximately 1 PgC. Statistics on forest resources are regularly quantified by data collected at field inventory plots by the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI). Nonetheless, the sampling by the inventory does not provide detailed spatial knowledge of carbon stored in forests. Thanks to one of the worldwide densest datasets of L-band satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images collected over the years, we assessed the estimation of carbon density on two years, i.e., 2010 and 2015, at pixel (25 m), landscape, county and national level, and investigated the reliability of changes over five years. While the maps of carbon density were obtained with a well-established approach, the uncertainty of the estimates were obtained with a novel procedure that accounted for observational variances and co-variances. The high spatial resolution of the maps revealed the small-scale patterns of carbon density in Swedish forests. However, the substantial uncertainties at the pixel level (25%-62% of the estimated value) prevented from a reliable estimate of carbon density difference at the pixel level. Average values at landscape and county scale were instead unbiased and in strong agreement with corresponding numbers from the Swedish NFI. The uncertainty at county level was between 3% and 12% of the reference mean value. Overall, the net carbon balance for Sweden was positive, with a magnitude comparable to estimates derived from data collected by the NFI. Between 2010 and 2015, Swedish forests acted as a carbon sink, with a net increase of carbon stocks by 2.5%. The high level of confidence in our results indicate that satellite L-band observations are potentially suitable for tracking large-scale forest carbon dynamics in boreal forests provided that multiple observations are available per year and that they are acquired with the same viewing geometry.', '[Santoro, Maurizio; Cartus, Oliver] GAMMA Remote Sensing, CH-3073 Gumlingen, Switzerland.

These dynamics of land, water, and ice have a significant impact on climate and often are critical to natural ecosystem functioning. However, global seasonal dynamics of both water and ice extent have not been well quantified. Here, we present the quantification of monthly surface water and ice areas for 2019 with associated uncertainties. Time-series reference data were created for a probability sample of 10 m grid cells by interpreting the entire 2019 time-series of 10 m Sentinel-2 data and a subset of 3 m PlanetScope data in selected places with a mix of land and water. From the probability sample reference data, we estimate that 4.86 +/- 0.16 million km(2) had inland water presence at some point during the year. Globally, only 23% of the total area with water was permanent water that remained open year-round (1.13 +/- 0.19 million km(2)). Permanent water with seasonal ice cover extended 1.97 +/- 0.21 million km(2), comprising 41% of the total area with water. Seasonal water-land transitions (both with and without ice/snow cover) covered the remaining 36% of the total area with water (1.76 +/- 0.19 million km(2)). February had the maximum extent of ice over areas of inland permanent and seasonal water, totaling 2.49 +/- 0.25 million km(2), and January - March had a larger global extent of ice cover than of open water. To investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of ice cover and the suitability of Landsat, prototype maps of surface water ice cover phenology were created by integrating the ice/snow and no data labels from the quality assurance layer of the GLAD ARD of Potapov et al. (2020) with the monthly surface water layers of Pickens et al. (2020), both of which are Landsat- based. While limited by data availability, these maps reveal the high spatiotemporal variability of ice phenology. The near-daily observations near the poles and the 10 m resolution bands of Sentinel-2 provide unprecedented potential to examine surface water and ice dynamics for 2016 forward and to investigate the drivers and impacts of this variability.', '[Pickens, Amy H.; Hansen, Matthew C.; Tyukavina, Alexandra; Potapov, Peter; Zalles, Viviana] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.

They are widespread in the global ocean. Amplitude is an essential IW parameter and is difficult to derive from the IW surface signatures in satellite images. A laboratory experiment and combined satellite/in-situ measurements were carried out to build two internal wave datasets (888 pairs of lab data and 121 pairs of synchronous in-situ data and satellite images). To efficiently use the lab data, we implemented a transfer learning model to retrieve IW amplitude from satellite images. The model is a purely data-driven model pre-trained with lab data and re-trained with satellite/in-situ data. A short connection was incorporated into the transfer learning framework to reduce information loss. Bias correction was adopted to improve the model performance. After the correction, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimated IW amplitude decreased from 12.09 m (17.84 m) to 9.59 m (11.59 m), the mean relative error decreased from 21% (27%) to 18% (16%), and the correlation coefficients improved from 0.81 (0.72) to 0.89 (0.90) on the test (training) dataset. For IWs with amplitude exceeding 100 m, the model can be expected to get an absolute error of 10 m. The mean relative error decreased with the increase in IW amplitudes. Comparisons with other algorithms demonstrate that the proposed model is efficient for IW studies. We applied the model to 156 satellite images containing IW signatures in the Andaman Sea, finding that large-amplitude IWs were mainly located at the water depth between 200 m and 1000 m on the continental slope. When considering one-pixel input errors for the peak-to-peak (PP) distance, the model shows large tolerance with the errors.

The main advantage of the proposed approach, based on radiative transfer calculations, is to provide a dataset totally independent of any in-situ measurement or model. The SSTs are retrieved at the IASI spot resolution (clear sky) for the three Metop platforms, today leading to a continuous record over more than 13 years, which is planned to be extended for at least another decade. Five atmospheric transparency windows centered at 3.8, 4.0, 4.7, 9.0 and 11 mu m have been used in the retrieval. Results are compared with in-situ temperatures provided by the buoys network as well as with other satellite datasets. This first analysis enables to draw the following three main conclusions. First, we confirm the interest of using short wavelengths around 4 mu m which enables accurate estimates characterized by a reduced bias with respect to those around 9 and 11 mu m, thanks to significantly weaker sensitivities to errors in the modeling of the water vapor contribution to the atmospheric absorption and emission. Second, we show that the observed dependences of the skin-depth temperature difference on various observed-scene parameters (wind speed, air-sea temperature difference, humidity) are consistent with predictions of theoretical and empirical models, as well as with those from other SST products. Finally, the overall averaged bias between our retrieved values converted to depth temperatures and those provided by in-situ measurements is -0.04 K (median: -0.024 K), with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.38 K (Robust SD = 0.25 K). The bias is thus well below the 0.1 K required for a SST product usable for climate studies and extremely stable over more than a decade. Then, we investigate the consistency between the three generations of IASI on-board Metop-A, -B, and -C over their overlap periods (2013-2020 for Metop-A and Metop-B, and 2019-2020 for Metop-C) by comparing the associated retrieved monthly-averaged SSTs over 1 degrees x1 degrees grids. The mean differences obtained are lower than 0.02 K, with a SD of 0.3 K consistent with the natural variation of the SST within a month. This demonstrates the high stability of the SSTs retrieved using spectra recorded from the IASI suite and opens the possibility to generate long time series for climate studies.

A semi-analytical scheme based on inherent optical properties (IOPs), termed IOPs-alpha w, is proposed in this study to estimate spectral alpha w(lambda) from ocean color measurements. Evaluations with numerical simulations of radiative transfer show that IOPs-alpha w outperforms the conventional scheme based on chlorophyll-a (Chl) concentration. The median absolute percentage difference (MAPD) of derived alpha w(lambda) from IOPs-alpha w is generally less than 3% in the blue-green spectral domain, in comparison to MAPD of over 40% for estimated alpha w(lambda) from the Chl-based scheme. IOPs-alpha w is later implemented to monthly composite data of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), where reasonable spatial distributions and seasonal patterns of alpha w(lambda) are obtained. In particular, broadband alpha w in the visible domain, termed alpha w_VIS, obtained via IOPs-alpha w is over 50% higher than the previous estimation by the Chl-based scheme in most oceanic waters. Furthermore, this study concludes that alpha w_VIS could contribute up to 20% to alpha in oceanic waters under low solar-zenith angles. Thus, we suggest that neither the spatial variability of alpha w_VIS nor the contribution of alpha w_VIS to alpha shall be neglected, and it is necessary to incorporate IOPs-alpha w into current parameterizations of alpha in coupled ocean-atmosphere and climate models.', '[Yu, Xiaolong; Shang, Shaoling] Xiamen Univ, Coll Ocean & Earth Sci, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Xiamen 361101, Peoples R China.

Large-scale and long-term studies of O3 pollution in China are few due to highly limited direct ground and satellite measurements. This study offers a new perspective to estimate ground-level O3 from solar radiation intensity and surface temperature by employing an extended ensemble learning of the space-time extremely randomized trees (STET) model, together with ground-based observations, remote sensing products, atmospheric reanalysis, and an emission inventory. A full-coverage (100%), high-resolution (10 km) and high-quality daily maximum 8-h average (MDA8) ground-level O3 dataset covering China (called ChinaHighO3) from 2013 to 2020 was generated. Our MDA8 O3 estimates (predictions) are reliable, with an average out-of-sample (out-of-station) coefficient of determination of 0.87 (0.80) and root-mean-square error of 17.10 (21.10) mu g/m3 in China. The unique advantage of the full coverage of our dataset allowed us to accurately capture a short-term severe O3 pollution exposure event that took place from 23 April to 8 May in 2020. Also, a rapid increase and recovery of O3 concentrations associated with variations in anthropogenic emissions were seen during and after the COVID-19 lockdown, respectively. Trends in O3 concentration showed an average growth rate of 2.49 mu g/m3/yr (p < 0.001) from 2013 to 2020, along with the continuous expansion of polluted areas exceeding the daily O3 standard (i.e., MDA8 O3 = 160 mu g/m3). Summertime O3 concentrations and the probability of occurrence of daily O3 pollution have significantly increased since 2015, especially in the North China Plain and the main air pollution transmission belt (i.e., the \"2 + 26\" cities). However, a decline in both was seen in 2020, mainly due to the coordinated control of air pollution and ongoing COVID-19 effects.

Burn severity maps obtained by thresholding bi-temporal indices based on pre- and post-fire Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) can vary substantially depending on temporal constraints such as matched acquisition and optimal seasonal timing. Satisfying temporal requirements is crucial to effectively disentangle fire and non-fire induced spectral changes and can be particularly challenging when only a few cloud-free images are available. Our study focuses on 10 wildfires that occurred in mountainous areas of the Piedmont Region (Italy) during autumn 2017 following a severe and prolonged drought period. Our objectives were to: (i) generate reflectance composites using Sentinel-2 imagery that were optimised for seasonal timing by embedding spatial patterns of long-term land surface phenology (LSP); (ii) produce and validate burn severity maps based on the modelled relationship between bi-temporal indices and field data; (iii) compare burn severity maps obtained using either a pair of cloud-free Sentinel-2 images, i.e. paired images, or reflectance composites. We proposed a pixel-based compositing algorithm coupling the weighted geometric median and thematic spatial information, e.g. long-term LSP metrics derived from the MODIS Collection 6 Land Cover Dynamics Product, to rank all the clear observations available in the growing season. Composite Burn Index data and bi-temporal indices exhibited a strong nonlinear relationship (R-2 > 0.85) using paired images or reflectance composites. Burn severity maps attained overall classification accuracy ranging from 76.9% to 83.7% (Kappa between 0.61 and 0.72) and the Relative differenced NBR (RdNBR) achieved the best results compared to other bi-temporal indices (differenced NBR and Relativized Burn Ratio). Improvements in overall classification accuracy offered by the calibration of bi-temporal indices with the dNBR offset were limited to burn severity maps derived from paired images. Reflectance composites provided the highest overall classification accuracy and differences with paired images were significant using uncalibrated bi-temporal indices (4.4% to 5.2%) while they decreased (2.8% to 3.2%) when we calibrated bi-temporal indices derived from paired images. The extent of the high severity category increased by similar to 19% in burn severity maps derived from reflectance composites (uncalibrated RdNBR) compared to those from paired images (calibrated RdNBR). The reduced contrast between healthy and burnt conditions associated with suboptimal seasonal timing caused an underestimation of burnt areas. By embedding spatial patterns of long-term LSP metrics, our approach provided consistent reflectance composites targeted at a specific phenological stage and minimising non-fire induced inter-annual changes. Being independent from the multispectral dataset employed, the proposed pixel-based compositing approach offers new opportunities for operational change detection applications in geographic areas characterised by persistent cloud cover.', '[Morresi, Donato; Marzano, Raffaella; Motta, Renzo; Garbarino, Matteo] Univ Torino, Dept Agr Forest & Food Sci, Largo Paolo Braccini 2, IT-10095 Grugliasco, TO, Italy.

Ideally, investigation of the energy response at the tree level may promote tailored irrigation strategies and, thus, maximize crop biomass productivity. However, data availability is limited and planning experimental campaigns in the field can be highly operationally complex. To this end, a multi-platform multi-sensor observational approach is herein developed to dissect the MET signature of a black poplar (Populus nigra) breeding population (\"POP6\") at the canopy level. POP6 comprised more than 4600 trees representing 503 replicated genotypes, whose parents were derived from contrasting environmental conditions. Trees were trialed in two adjacent plots where different irrigation treatments (moderate drought [mDr] and well-watered [WW]) were applied. Data collected from satellite and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) remote sensing as well as from ground-based proximal sensors were integrated at consistent spatial aggregation and combined to compute the surface energy balance of the trees through a modified Priestley-Taylor method. Here, we demonstrated that MET response was significantly different between WW and mDr trees, whereby genotypes in mDr conditions exhibited larger standard deviations. Importantly, genotypes classified as drought tolerant based on the stress susceptibility index (SSI) presented MET values significantly higher than the rest of the population. This study confirmed that water limitation in mDr settings led to reduced soil moisture in the tree root zone and, thus, to lower MET. These results pave the way to breeding poplar and other bioenergy crops with this underexploited trait for higher MET.

Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) from remote sensing observations have been widely used to detect changes in polar glaciers. DEMs from Terrestrial Radar Interferometer (TRI) have recently been used for high frequency glacier change and glacier-ocean interaction studies. However, it is unclear whether TRI DEM over a large study area can be combined directly with remote sensing observations to investigate glacier changes as well as the accuracy of TRI DEM at far range. In this study, we deployed a TRI close to Helheim Glacier, East Greenland and generated DEMs using TRI and satellite laser altimetry. We analyzed the accuracy of the TRI DEM using theoretical calculations, comparisons based on repeat observations, and comparisons with a high accurate ArcticDEM. The validation results suggest that for stable ground surfaces, the uncertainty (standard deviation) is <5 m at range < 9.8 km. Averaging across time (e.g. one hour) decreases the uncertainty almost linearly with range, over 0.5 m to 1.2 m when the range increases from 7.0 km to 10.0 km. Increasing the correlation coefficient threshold for phase unwrapping does not significantly reduce uncertainty. TRI DEMs are influenced by systematic error at far range primarily due to coarse azimuth resolution and phase unwrapping difficulties in discontinuous interferograms. As the absolute accuracy of TRI DEMs is not uniformly distributed in the range direction (farther points have worse uncertainty), our findings indicate that TRI DEMs within range of 10 km can reach <5 m uncertainty, which can be compared with DEMs obtained from remote sensing satellites to detect glacier thinning.', '[Wang, Xianwei; Holland, David M.] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Ctr Global Sea Level Change, Abu Dhabi 129188, U Arab Emirates.

Extensive forest die-off due to drought can impair the ecological functioning of forests, impacting habitat, water yield and quality from forested lands, and altering forest fire dynamics and intensity. Satellite remote sensing provides an effective means for detecting and monitoring spatial patterns of forest mortality over large areas, exploiting free and open long-term image archives available at a range in spatial and temporal resolutions. While remotely sensed surface reflectances and vegetation indices have been widely used to study optical response of forest canopies to drought events, retrievals of evapotranspiration (ET) derived from thermal satellite imagery - particularly at resolutions approaching crown scale can provide insights into cumulative tree stresses that can incite disease and trigger mortality. In this study, we applied a multi-sensor satellite data fusion approach to estimate daily 30-m resolution ET and an associated Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) to study drought-induced mortality in a temperate forest at the Missouri Ozark AmeriFlux (MOFLUX) site, located in the central United States. The study covered the period from 2010 to 2014, including an exceptional drought year of 2012. Modeled ET agreed well with eddy flux measurements from the MOFLUX tower, with average monthly relative errors of 15%. Plot-scale ESI, describing temporal anomalies in the ratio of actual-to-reference ET, was used as an index of relative forest health to investigate relationships between forest mortality and drought severity. ESI showed good agreement with observed predawn leaf water potential, especially during the drought year. Furthermore, plot scale ESI was also correlated with the subsequent year\'s tree mortality, suggesting the importance of considering the forest health condition prior to drought when studying drought-induced forest impacts. This study demonstrates the utility of multi-year ET remote sensing data at the stand or plot scale as an indicator of forest health and as a predictor of future mortality due to drought.', '[Yang, Yun] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

The revisit interval between successive overpasses varies in space and time in a complex manner because of a variety of factors and particularly because of the different sensor orbits. The temporal availability of PlanetScope imagery is quantified in this study considering all of the publicly available images acquired globally for a 12 month period from December 1st 2019 to November 30th 2020. A total of 175.8 million images were acquired by the constellation that was composed of between 100 and 133 unique PlanetScope sensors each month and three sensor generations. The local morning overpass times of the three sensor generations were quantified and the most frequently occurring times were 10:16, 10:29, and 10:03 (to the nearest minute) with 90% of the images acquired with a range of morning overpass times of 2 h and 13 min, 1 h and 30 min, and 1 h and 50 min, for PlanetScope-0, PlanetScope-1, and PlanetScope-2, respectively. Maps, histograms and summary statistics of the total number of observations and revisit intervals are derived with respect to a global grid of 4.7 million land points spaced 5.6 km apart in the equal area sinusoidal projection. The annual and monthly number of PlanetScope observations and average revisit intervals did not vary in a geographically uniform manner. This is due to several factors including the different PlanetScope orbits, seasonal high latitude darkness at the time of sensor overpass, and because of the changing number of sensors on orbit as PlanetScope sensors were decommissioned and later generations became operational over the 12 month study period. In addition, the images in each frame of sensed data are not made available if they cannot be geolocated due to cloud and/or featureless or unstructured terrain precluding ground control matching. The PlanetScope constellation provided higher temporal resolution than provided by sensors such as Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2 although 9% of the global land grid locations, predominantly in the interior of Greenland and non coastal Antarctica, had no observations. Considering the 12 months of global observations, the median average revisit interval was only 30.3 h, and 9.6%, 71.8%, and 88.4% of the land points had average revisit intervals <24 h, <36 h, and < 48 h, respectively. Globally, the median minimum revisit interval was 25 s and the median maximum revisit interval was 9.15 days; 95.4% of the land grid points had a minimum revisit <180 s, and 89.1% had a maximum revisit <480 h (20 days). The PlanetScope images are labelled as \"standard\" or as \"test\" quality based on solar geometry, saturated pixel, and geolocation accuracy criteria. The median annual proportion of observations labelled as \"standard\" at each land grid point over the 12 months was 78.14%. A global cloud analysis was undertaken to quantify the probability of there being at least one and at least two cloud-free PlanetScope observations within 5, 7 and 10 day consecutive periods. Lower probabilities occurred in cloudy regions and where there were fewer observations. The global mean average probability of there being at least one cloud-free observation over the 12 study months was 0.84, 0.88 and 0.92 for the 5, 7 and 10 day periods respectively. The global mean average probability of there being at least two cloud-free observations was 0.65, 0.76 and 0.84 for the 5, 7 and 10 day periods respectively.   The probabilities varied seasonally and the northern hemisphere winter (December-February) and spring (March-May) had lower and higher global mean average seasonal probabilities, respectively, than those derived over the 12 months. The high temporal global coverage provided by the PlanetScope constellation will benefit new applications in particular those concerned with assessment of rapidly changing phenomena and assessment of phenomena that cannot be resolved at moderate and coarse resolution.', '[Roy, David P.; Huang, Haiyan; Martins, Vitor S.] Michigan State Univ, Ctr Global Change & Earth Observat, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA.

This three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer effect is caused by spatial inhomogeneities of the surface reflectivity and the atmospheric properties. Based on the recently published 3D radiative transfer code LEIPSIC (Light Estimator Including Polarization, Surface Inhomogeneities, and Clouds), a new atmospheric correction (AC) algorithm is proposed to consider for the atmospheric adjacency effect when estimating the surface reflectivity from satellite or airborne imagery. The effectiveness of the new AC algorithm is quantified and compared to the results based on the independent pixel approximation (IPA) radiative transfer approach. It is shown that the image blurring caused by the atmospheric adjacency effect and the error of reflectivity retrievals are reduced by 80% using the new AC algorithm.

Understanding the spatiotemporal variations of land surface temperature (LST) and the thermal impacts of heterogeneous urban forms is crucial for informing mitigation strategies to improve the urban thermal environment. However, the diurnal thermal dynamics over urban areas has been rarely studied due to the polarorbiting nature of conventional satellite platforms (e.g., Landsat Series, Terra, Aqua). The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\'s (NASA) latest Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) provides LST observations at a 70 m resolution for different times of day and night, and thereby offers unprecedented opportunities for exploring the LST diurnal dynamics. We used ECOSTRESS data to explore the diurnal cycling of LST and variations among local climate zones (LCZs) in Xi\'an, a megacity in Northwest China. The urban area was segmented into 2733 community units that were classified into seven LCZs. We examined the intra-LCZ variation of LST at different times of day and night to investigate the thermal impact of urban landscapes. Distinct thermal patterns across LCZs were observed during the day: urban landscapes of compact buildings tended to heat up faster than open buildings, and low-rise zones generally had higher LST than high-rise LCZs in both compact and open urban forms. At night, compact buildings had higher LST than the open buildings, but the LST difference was insignificant. Meanwhile, building heights had little effects on LST at night. We also found that vegetation cover, percentage of impervious surface, and population size were related to LST, while the strength of the relationship varied for different times of day and night. Our study demonstrates the great potential of the new ECOSTRESS LST observations in studying the diurnal variations of urban thermal environments with fine spatial resolution. Our findings can provide insight into the impacts of urban form on local climate and can inform municipalities on the development of targeted heat mitigation strategies.', '[Chang, Yue; Li, Xuxiang; Zhang, Yunwei; Gu, Zhaolin; Wu, Yiping] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Human Settlements & Civil Engn, Inst Global Environm Change, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.

Although many efforts in remote sensing field have been made to map UFZs, largescale and fine-grained UFZ maps required by a broad range of urban applications are still unavailable. Existing methods generally rely on pre-determined mapping units, such as image tiles and road blocks, which significantly limit the mapping quality and the automation degree of mapping UFZs. Given that UFZs are composed of diverse geographic objects, this study proposes a novel object-based UFZ mapping method using very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images. First, a multi-scale semantic segmentation network that achieves pixel-wised predictions is proposed to predict urban-functions for geographic objects by capturing multi-scale contextual information. Afterwards, a conditional random field (CRF) framework is designed to regroup objects into UFZs to produce the final UFZ map, wherein road vectors are incorporated to restrict the procedure. The presented object-as-analysis-unit scheme conquers the drawbacks of mapping-unit pre-determination and the semantic segmentation model provides accurate function information for objects, thus they can be applied for producing large-scale and fine-grained UFZ maps. In the experiment, the proposed method is evaluated by producing UFZ maps for Beijing and Shanghai, China, and competitive results with overall accuracy of 91.6% and 89.1% are achieved, respectively.

Because LTS algorithms can be easily applied across broad areas, they are commonly used to map changes in forest structure due to wildfire, insect attack, and other important drivers of tree mortality. But factors such as initial forest density, tree mortality agent, and disturbance severity (i.e., percent tree mortality) influence patterns of surface reflectance and may influence the accuracy of LTS algorithms. And while LTS algorithms are widely used in areas with a history of multiple disturbance events during the Landsat record, the effectiveness of LTS algorithms in these conditions is not well understood. We compared products from the LTS algorithm LandTrendr (Landsat-based Detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery) with a unique field dataset from a landscape heavily influenced by both wildfire and spruce beetles (Dendroctonus rufipennis) since c. 2000. We also compared LandTrendr to other common methods of mapping fire- and spruce beetle-affected areas. We found that LandTrendr more accurately detected wildfire than spruce beetle-induced tree mortality, and both mortality agents were more easily detected when they occurred at high severity. Surprisingly, prior spruce beetle outbreaks did not influence the detectability of subsequent wildfire. Compared to alternative disturbance mapping approaches, LandTrendr predicted a c. 40% lower area affected by wildfire or spruce beetle outbreaks. Our findings indicate that disturbance type- and severity-specific differences in omission error may have broad implications for disturbance mapping efforts that utilize Landsat data. Gradual, low-severity disturbances (e.g., background tree mortality and non-stand replacing disturbance) are pervasive in forest ecosystems, yet they can be difficult to detect using automated LTS algorithms. Whenever possible, methods to account for these biases should be incorporated in LTS-based mapping efforts, including the use of multispectral ensembles and ancillary spatial data to refine predictions. However, our findings also indicate that LTS algorithms appear to be robust in areas with multiple disturbance events, which is important because these areas will increase as new acquisitions extend the length of the Landsat record.', '[Rodman, Kyle C.; Hart, Sarah J.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53705 USA.

This is performed using in situ measurements from an autonomous pan-and-tilt hyperspectral radiometer system (PANTHYR). The PANTHYR provides validation data for any satellite band between 400 and 900 nm, with the deployment in the BCZ of particular interest due to the wide range of observed Near-InfraRed (NIR) reflectance. The Dark Spectrum Fitting (DSF) atmospheric correction algorithm is adapted for S3/OLCI processing in ACO-LITE, and its performance and that of 5 other processing algorithms (L2-WFR, POLYMER, C2RCC, SeaDAS, and SeaDAS-ALT) is compared to the in situ measured reflectances. Water turbidities across the matchups in the Belgian Coastal Zone are about 20?100 FNU, and the overall performance is best for ACOLITE and L2-WFR, with the former providing lowest relative (Mean Absolute Relative Difference, MARD 7?27%) and absolute errors (Mean Average Difference, MAD-0.002, Root Mean Squared Difference, RMSD 0.01?0.016) in the bands between 442 and 681 nm. L2-WFR provides the lowest errors at longer NIR wavelengths (754?885 nm). The algorithms that assume a water reflectance model, i.e. POLYMER and C2RCC, are at present not very suitable for processing imagery over the turbid Belgian coastal waters, with especially the latter introducing problems in the 665 and 709 nm bands, and hence the chlorophyll-a and turbidity retrievals. This may be caused by their internal model and/or training dataset not being well adapted to the waters encountered in the BCZ. The 1020 nm band is used most frequently by ACOLITE/DSF for the estimation of the atmospheric path reflectance (67% of matchups), indicating its usefulness for turbid water atmospheric correction. Turbidity retrieval using a single band algo-rithm showed good performance for L2-WFR and ACOLITE compared to PANTHYR for e.g. the 709 nm band (MARD 15 and 17%), where their reflectances were also very close to the in situ observations (MARD 11%). For the retrieval of chlorophyll-a, all methods except C2RCC gave similar performance, due to the RedEdge band-ratio algorithm being robust to typical spectrally flat atmospheric correction errors. C2RCC does not retain the spectral relationship in the Red and RedEdge bands, and hence its chlorophyll-a concentration retrieval is not at all reliable in Belgian coastal waters. L2-WFR and ACOLITE show similar performance compared to in situ radiometry, but due to the assumption of spatially consistent aerosols, ACOLITE provides less noisy products. With the superior performance of ACOLITE in the 490?681 nm wavelength range, and smoother output products, it can be recommended for processing of S3/OLCI data in turbid waters similar to those encountered in the BCZ.

Spatial heterogeneity of vegetation strongly affects species diversity patterns, and measures of vegetation structure derived from lidar and satellite image texture analysis correlate well with species richness. Our goal here was to gain a better understanding of why image texture explains bird richness, by linking field-based measures of vegetation structure directly with both image texture and bird richness. In addition, we asked how image texture compares with lidar-based canopy height variability, and how sensor resolution affects the explanatory power of image texture. We generated texture metrics from 30 m (Landsat 8) and 10 m (Sentinel-2) resolution Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) imagery from 2017 to 2019. We compared textures with vegetation metrics and bird richness data from 27 National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) terrestrial field sites across the continental US. Both 30 and 10 m resolution texture metrics were strongly correlated with lidar-based canopy height variability (vertical bar r vertical bar = 0.64 and 0.80, respectively). Texture was moderately correlated with field-based metrics, including variability of vegetation height and tree stem diameter, and foliage height diversity (range vertical bar r vertical bar = 0.31-0.52). Generally, 10 m resolution texture had stronger correlations with lidar and field-based metrics than 30 m resolution texture. In univariate linear models of total bird richness, 10 m resolution texture metrics also had higher explanatory power (up to R-adj(2) = 0.45), than 30 m texture metrics (up to R-adj(2) = 0.31). Among all metrics evaluated, the 10 m homogeneity texture was the best univariate predictor of total bird richness. In multivariate bird richness models that combined texture with lidar-based canopy height variability and field-based metrics, both 30 m and 10 m resolution texture metrics were selected in top-ranked models and independently contributed explanatory power (up to R-adj(2) = 46%). Lidar-based canopy height variability was also selected in a top-ranked model of total bird richness, but independently contributed only 15% of the variance explained. Our results show satellite image texture characterized multiple features of structural and compositional vegetation heterogeneity, complemented more commonly used metrics in models of bird richness and for some guilds outperformed both lidar-based canopy height variability and field-based vegetation measurements. Ours is the first study to directly link image texture both to specific components of vegetation heterogeneity and to bird richness across multiple ecoregions and spatial resolutions, thereby shedding light on habitat features underlying the strong correlation between image texture and biodiversity.', '[Farwell, Laura S.; Gudex-Cross, David; Olah, Ashley M.; Radeloff, Volker C.; Razenkova, Elena; Rogova, Natalia; Silveira, Eduarda M.

The dataset comprises 20 Landsat 8 - MODIS image pairs that belong to European Alps acquired from Apr 2013 to Dec 2016. The fifteen image pairs are used to generate the training dataset necessary to build the models, whereas the remaining five are employed as a separate test dataset. The reference FSC maps are derived from the binary classified Landsat 8 snow/no snow maps at 30 m resolution. In order to assess the effect of sampling type and sample size, nine different training datasets are generated. The RF and SVR models are trained accordingly by using various settings of model tuning parameters. During the training of the models, MODIS top-of-atmosphere reflectance values of bands 1-7, NDSI, NDVI and land cover class are input as independent variables (i.e., predictors) to estimate the dependent variable (i.e., response), i.e., FSC value. The resolution of the generated FSC maps is 500 m. The results indicate that the ANN, MARS, RF and SVR models exhibit high consistency with reference FSC values as indicated by low RMSE (similar to 0.14) and high R (similar to 0.93) values.

Although many ITC segmentation methods have been developed to derive tree crown information from airborne LiDAR data, these algorithms contain uncertainty in processing false treetops because of foliage clumps and lateral branches, overlapping canopies without clear valley-shape areas, and sub-canopy crowns with neighbouring trees that obscure their shapes from an aerial perspective. Here, we propose an approach to crown segmentation using computer vision theories applied in different forest types. First, a dual Gaussian filter was designed with automated adaptive parameter assignment and a screening strategy for false treetops. This preserved the geometric characteristics of sub-canopy trees while eliminating false treetops. Second, anisotropic water expansion controlled by the energy function was applied for accurate crown segmentation. This utilized gradient information from the digital surface model and explored the morphological structures of tree crown boundaries as analogous to the maximal valley height difference from surrounding treetops. We demonstrate the generality of our approach in the subtropical forests within China. Our approach enhanced the detection rate of treetops and ITC segmentation relative to the marker-controlled watershed method, especially in complicated intersections of multiple crowns. A high performance was demonstrated for three pure Eucalyptus plots (a treetop detection rate r = 0.95 and crown width estimation R-2 = 0.90 for canopy trees; r = 0.85 and R-2 = 0.88 for sub-canopy trees) and three plots dominated by Chinese fir (r = 0.95 and R-2 = 0.87 for canopy trees; r = 0.79 and R-2 = 0.83 for sub-canopy trees). Finally, in a relatively complex forest park containing a wide range of tree species and sizes, a high performance was also achieved (r = 0.93 and R-2 = 0.85 for canopy trees; r = 0.70 and R-2 = 0.80 for sub-canopy trees). Our method demonstrates that methods inspired by the computer vision theory can improve on existing approaches, providing the potential for accurate crown segmentation even in mixed forests with complex structures', '[Yun, Ting; Jiang, Kang; Li, Guangchao; Cao, Lin] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Nanjing 210037, Peoples R China.

Starting with a summary of satellite altimeter missions since 1991 and corresponding relevant characteristics for DTC and WTC estimation, the tropospheric PD are discussed in the more general context of the atmospheric corrections. Then, for each of the tropospheric PD, the following topics are inspected and discussed: relevant background theory required to estimate each of the PD; methods used in the PD retrievals either from observations or from atmospheric models; specific problems encountered in the retrieval of each PD in coastal and inland water regions; errors still present in some altimeter products and proposed approaches to mitigate them.

However, quantifying plant traits and FD consistently and costeffectively across large and heterogeneous forest areas is challenging with traditional field sampling. Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and imaging spectroscopy provide spatially explicit data, which allow mapping of selected forest traits and FD at different spatial scales. We develop an individual tree-based method to measure forest FD from tree neighborhoods to whole forests, and demonstrate the approach by mapping functional traits of over one million trees in a subtropical forest in China. We retrieved canopy morphological traits (95th quantile height, leaf area index and foliage height diversity) and physiological traits (proxies of nitrogen, carotenoids and specific leaf area) for each individual canopy tree crown from LiDAR and imaging spectroscopy data, respectively. Based on the multivariate trait space spanned by the six trait axes and filled by measured tree individuals, we mapped forest FD as richness, divergence and evenness, and explored spatial patterns of FD as well as FD-area and FD-tree number relationships. The results show that LiDAR-derived morphological traits and spectral indices of physiological traits are consistent with field measurements and show weak correlations between each other at individual tree level. Morphological functional richness follows a hump-shaped pattern along the elevational gradient of 984-1805 m, with maximum values at elevations around 1450 m, while high physiological functional richness occurs at medium and high elevations. At an ecosystem scale of 30 x 30 m, morphological richness increases continuously with tree density, but physiological richness decreases again at very high densities. Moreover, functional richness shows a logarithmic relationship with increasing area or number of individual trees, and local trait convergence is predominant in our study area. We demonstrate the ability to quantify FD using morphological and physiological traits by remote sensing, which provides a pathway to conduct individual-level trait-based ecology with wall-to-wall data.', '[Zheng, Zhaoju; Schmid, Bernhard; Schaepman, Michael E.; Morsdorf, Felix] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Remote Sensing Labs, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.

This paper addresses the challenge of using Landsat data, particularly its 30 m spatial resolution, for monitoring three-dimensional urban densification. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for scene recognition resulting in resolution loss, the proposed semantic segmentation framework provides a pixel-wise classification and improves the accuracy of urban form mapping. We compare temporal and spatial transferability of an adapted DeepLab model with a simple fully convolutional network (FCN) and a texture-based random forest (RF) model to map urban density in the two morphological dimensions: horizontal (compact, open, sparse) and vertical (high rise, low rise). We test whether a model trained on the 2014 data can be applied to 2006 and 1995 for Denmark, and examine whether we could use the model trained on the Danish data to accurately map ten other European cities. Our results show that an implementation of deep networks and the inclusion of multi-scale contextual information greatly improve the classification and the model\'s ability to generalize across space and time. Between the two semantic segmentation models, DeepLab provides more accurate horizontal and vertical classifications than FCN when sufficient training data is available. By using DeepLab, the F1 score can be increased by 4 and 10 percentage points for detecting vertical urban growth compared to FCN and RF for Denmark. For mapping the ten other European cities with training data from Denmark, DeepLab also shows an advantage of 6 percentage points over RF for both horizontal and vertical dimensions. The resulting maps across the years 1985 to 2018 reveal different patterns of urban growth between Copenhagen and Aarhus, the two largest cities in Denmark, illustrating that those cities have used various planning policies in addressing population growth and housing supply challenges. In summary, we propose a transferable deep learning approach for automated, long-term mapping of urban form from Landsat images that is effective in areas experiencing a slow pace of urban growth or with small-scale changes.', '[Chen, Tzu-Hsin Karen; Sabel, Clive E.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.

Since 2005, Fujian Province of Mainland China and Taiwan across the Taiwan Strait have both implemented aggressive air pollution control policies designed based on different principles, but a comprehensive evaluation of these control policies on PM(2.5)pollution levels is still lacking. In the current study, we assessed the effects of these policies in the Taiwan Strait Region from 2005 to 2018 using full-coverage, high-resolution PM(2.5)generated by a satellite-driven machine learning model. A ten-fold cross-validation for our prediction model showed an R(2)value of 0.89, demonstrating that these predictions can be used for policy evaluation. During the 14-year period, PM(2.5)levels in all areas of Fujian and Taiwan underwent a significant decrease. Separate regression models for policy evaluation in Taiwan and Fujian showed that all considered policies have mitigated PM(2.5)pollution to various degrees. The Clean Air Action Plans (CAAP) is the most effective control policy in Taiwan, while the Action Plan of Air Pollution Prevention and Control (APPC-AP) and Three-year Action Plan for Blue Skies (3YAP-BS) as well as their provincial implementation plans are the most successful in Fujian.

Although state-of-the-art algorithms to estimate Chla in lakes from satellite-borne sensors have improved, there are no robust and reliable algorithms to generate Chla time series from OLI imageries in turbid lakes due to the absence of a red-edge band and issues with atmospheric correction. Here, a machine learning approach termed the extreme gradient boosting tree (BST) was employed to develop an algorithm for Chla estimation from OLI in turbid lakes. This model was developed and validated by linking Rayleigh-corrected reflectance to near-synchronous in situ Chla data available from eight lakes in eastern China (N = 225) and three coastal and inland waters in SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System (N = 97). The BST model performed well on a subset of data (N = 102, R-2 = 0.79, root mean squared difference = 7.1 mu g L-1, mean absolute percentage error = 24%, mean absolute error = 1.4, Bias = 0.9), and had better Chla retrievals than several band-ratio algorithms and a random forest approach. The performance of BST model was judged as appropriate only for the range of conditions in the training data. Given these limitations, spatial and temporal variations of Chla in hundreds of lakes larger than 1 km(2) in eastern China for the period of 2013-2018 were mapped using the BST model. OLI-derived Chla indicated that small lakes (<50 km(2)) had greater Chla than the larger lakes.

Remote monitoring of crop phenological dynamics in a consistent and systematic manner is vitally crucial for optimizing the farm management activities and evaluating the agricultural resilience to extreme weather conditions and future climate change. Yet our ability to retrieve crop growing stages with satellite time series is limited. The remotely sensed phenological transition dates may not be characteristic of crop physiological growing stages. The objective of this study is to develop a remote sensing phenological monitoring framework that can reconcile satellite-based phenological measures with ground-based crop growing observations, with corn and soybean in Illinois as a case study. The framework comprises three key components: time series phenological pre-processing, time series phenological modeling, and time series phenological characterization. As an exploratory prototype, the framework retrieved a total of 56 phenological transition dates that were subsequently evaluated with the district-level ground phenological observations. The results indicated that the devised framework can adequately retrieve a wide range of physiological growing stages for corn and soybean in Illinois, with R square greater than 0.6 and RMSE less than 1 week for most stages. The devised framework largely extends the limited satellite phenological measures to a range of phenological transition dates that are characteristic of essential crop growing stages. It paves the way for formulating standard crop phenological monitoring protocols via remote sensing. The wealth of retrieved phenological characteristics open up unique opportunities to enhance our understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying the crop growth in response to varying environmental stresses, and to make more adaptive farm management strategies towards sustained agricultural development.', '[Diao, Chunyuan] Univ Illinois, Dept Geog & Geog Informat Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.', 'University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-ChampaignRP Diao, CY (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Geog & Geog Informat Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.', 'chunyuan@illinois.eduRI Diao, Chunyuan/AAI-5625-2021', 'Diao, Chunyuan/0000-0002-1480-8444', 'National Science Foundation [1849821]; Office of Advanced   Cyberinfrastructure (OAC); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr   [1849821] Funding Source: National Science Foundation', 'This work is partially supported by the National Science Foundation   under grant 1849821.

However, the development of spatiotemporal fusion algorithms has not yet reached maturity, and existing methods still face many challenges, e.g., accurately retrieving land cover changes and improving the robustness of fusion algorithms. The Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) method proposed by Zhu a al. in 2016 solved the abovementioned problems to some extent. However, FSDAF has two shortcomings that can be further improved: (1) FSDAF is prone to losing spatial details and predicting a \"blurrier\" image due to the input of coarse pixels containing type change information and a large amount of boundary information for unmixing calculation, and (2) FSDAF does not optimize the areas of land cover change. In this paper, an improved FSDAF method incorporating change detection technology and an optimized model for changed-type areas (FSDAF 2.0) was proposed to improve the aforementioned problems. Based on the existing FSDAF algorithm, FSDAF 2.0 excludes changed pixels and boundary pixels for unmixing calculation, and establishes a model to optimize the changed pixels. Its performance was compared with that of the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), the original FSDAF, and the enhanced FSDAF that incorporates sub-pixel class fraction change information (SFSDAF). Two sites consisting of landscapes with heterogeneous and large-scale abrupt land cover changes were employed for testing. The results of the experiments demonstrate that FSDAF 2.0 effectively improves the shortcomings of FSDAF, blends synthetic fine-resolution images with higher accuracy than that of the other three methods at two different sites, and strengthens the robustness of the fusion algorithm. More importantly, FSDAF 2.0 has a powerful ability to retrieve land cover changes and provides a feasible way to improve the performance of retrieving land cover changes. Consequently, FSDAF 2.0 has great potential for monitoring complex dynamic changes in the Earth\'s surface.', '[Guo, Dizhou; Hao, Ming] China Univ Min & Technol, NASG Key Lab Land Environm & Disaster Monitoring, Xuzhou 221116, Peoples R China.

Most of previous studies on salt marsh extent assessment used Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), being limited the current knowledge about the performance of other Vegetation Indices (VI). Based on Landsat imagery this study proposes a new methodology to map salt marsh extent in estuarine systems by combining Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and VI, exploring their performance when using different VI. Moreover, it aims to assess the extent and condition changes between 1984 and 2018 in two salt marshes (Pancas and Corroios) located within Tagus Estuary. The VI best-performing salt marsh extent was determined and the methodology applied to assess salt marsh extent changes. Condition change was investigated by statistically analyzing spatially averaged VI over salt marsh extent change regions. Results demonstrated that NDWI and VI combined can be used to efficiently map the marsh extent and NDVI was the VI with the best performance. Corroios revealed mostly stable without noticeable changes in its extent and condition. Oppositely, Pancas registered a continuous seaward progression at a mean rate of 3 ha/year since 1984, while restricted upper regions dieback after 2004-2005, likely due to high soil salinity conditions. In general, NDVI performs better salt marsh extent, but others VI corrected to minimize soil effects perform better when tidal flats are entirely, or almost entirely, exposed, opening perspectives to the development of new methods combining the use of different VI to optimize salt marsh extent detection.', '[Lopes, Carina L.; Mendes, Renato; Dias, Joao M.] Univ Aveiro, CESAM Ctr Environm & Marine Studies, Phys Dept, Campus Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.

We assessed a suite of five spectral metrics derived from Landsat 5 TM imagery spanning a decade (1996-2007) to quantify ecosystem condition in the ridge-slough mosaic of the Everglades (South Florida, USA). These included the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the same index using green instead of red band as the visible reference (NDVIg), the normalized difference water index (NDWI), the simple ratio of NIR and red bands (SR) and the moisture stress index (MSI). Mean and variance from pure ridge or slough pixels (i.e., those >30 m from a mapped patch edge) were quantified for twentyfour 2 x 5 km blocks across a gradient of hydrologic and ecological condition. Metrics were compared with field measures of landscape condition from block-scale soil elevation surveys, which capture dramatic spatial gradients between conserved and degraded locations. Elevationbased measures of landscape condition, validated as diagnostic in previous work, included soil elevation bi-modality (BISE), a binary measure of ecosystem condition, and the soil elevation standard deviation (SDSE), a continuous measure of condition. Spectral metric performance was assessed based on the strength (sensitivity) and shape (leading vs.lagging) of the relationship with elevation-based measures. We observed significant logistic regression slopes with BISE for only 3 metrics (mean ridge NDVI and NDVIg, mean ridge SR). In prediction of variance SDSE, the standard deviation of our VIs was more informative than the mean, and measures from sloughs more informative than ridges. The strongest predictions are variance in slough NDVIg and SR, suggesting that spatial heterogeneity in slough biomass is most informative for predicting the status of soil elevation variance. None of the vegetation metrics were leading indicators of change; a multivariate model using three VIs selected based on consistent performance across years (variance in Slough SR, slough NDVIg, and ridge NDWI) substantially improve predictions of SDSE and yielded more plausible prediction maps. These findings suggest that soil elevation changes from altered peat accretion dynamics precede visible changes in vegetation reflectance. While this constrains predictions of incipient ecosystem change, the reasonable performance of spectral metrics indicates that efficient monitoring of ridge-slough landscape health is possible as part of the ongoing Everglades restoration effort.', '[Yuan, Jing] Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.

Here we report on the correlations between Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra albedo measurements (Version 6) and net annual mass balance for five glaciers in the Canadian Arctic over the period 2002-2016. Three glacier albedo aggregation methods are tested for the melt season (June, July and August): minimum, raw average, and interpolated average. These are evaluated in terms of a 53-71% reduction in observations due to cloud cover in the raw albedo time series. For the minimum method, the whole glacier albedo is calculated from the average of the minimum melt season albedo of each grid cell, irrespective of the day on which they occurred, resulting in R-2 values between 0.20 and 0.87. In the raw average method, averaging all albedo values within a glacier outline over the melt season improves the correlation to mass balance to a range of 0.61-0.95. In the interpolated average method, linear interpolation of the raw average albedo values to fill cloud gaps, then averaging them, improves the raw average correlations for all ice masses by similar to 5% (R-2 range 0.68-0.97). Overall, the interpolated average albedo method performs substantially better for the smallest glacier than the minimum or the raw average methods. The most negative net mass balance occurs at Grise Fiord Glacier, which is the smallest (<4.0 km(2)), but not the lowest elevation, glacier analysed. For this glacier, the interpolated average albedo improves the correlation with mass balance to an R-2 = 0.68 (p-value < .05), compared to an R-2 = 0.17 for the minimum albedo method (p-value > .05). When the five glaciers\' interpolated average albedo is correlated to their ensemble mass balance, an R-2 = 0.82 is achieved. These results show that interpolated MODIS Terra melt season albedo measurements can realistically approximate net annual glacier mass balance for Arctic glaciers and ice caps, without additional information about precipitation or temperature, and in the absence of a melt model.', '[Williamson, Scott N.; Copland, Luke] Univ Ottawa, Dept Geog Environm & Geomat, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.

While a few studies have demonstrated the potential of optical and SAR data for crop lodging assessment, large-scale crop lodging assessment has been hampered by the unavailability of dense satellite time series data. The unprecedented availability of free Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data may provide a basis for operational detection and monitoring of crop lodging. In this context, this study aims to understand the effect of lodging on backscatter/coherence and spectral reflectance derived from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data and to detect lodging incidence in wheat using time-series analysis. Crop biophysical parameters were measured in the field for both healthy and lodged plots from March to June 2018 in a study site in Ferrara, Italy, and the corresponding Sentinel images were downloaded and processed. The lodged plots were further categorised into different lodging severity classes (moderate, severe and very severe). Temporal profiles of backscatter, coherence, reflectance and continuum removed spectra were studied for healthy and lodging severity classes throughout the stem elongation to ripening growth stages. The Kruskal Wallis and posthoc Tukey tests were used to test for significant differences between different classes. Our results for Sentinel-2 showed that red edge (740 nm) and NIR (865 nm) bands could best distinguish healthy from lodged wheat (particularly healthy and very severe). For Sentinel-1, the analysis revealed the potential of VH backscatter and the complementarily of 1/V and VH/VV backscatter in distinguishing a maximum number of classes. Our findings demonstrate the potential of Sentinel data for near real-time detection of the incidence and severity of lodging in wheat.

After the subsidence waterlogging, the land faces many problems, such as insufficient land development and difficult and costly land restoration. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the spatial range and temporal trajectory pattern of surface subsidence in a timely manner. When information about underground mining is lacking, it is difficult by using remote sensing alone to identify and distinguish (i) natural water, (ii) engineering water, and (iii) subsidence waterlogging. In this study, we used the Google Earth Engine platform to develop a method to detect subsidence waterlogging area and the disturbance year. The method includes pixel-based trajectory extraction and object-based water type recognition. First, LandTrendr is used to extract the change water (engineering water and subsidence waterlogging) pixels and its disturbance year. Then, the morphological method to further eliminate engineering water patches, so as to extract subsidence waterlogging. We selected the Panxie mining area in Huainan, China as the study area. Using 33 years of Landsat timeseries data to generate values of the annual water frequency index, maps of the year of water accumulation caused by underground coal mining and the year of restoration during 1989-2016 are drawn with accuracies of 86.5% and 80.7%, respectively. The results show that from 1989 to 2016, the accumulated area of subsidence waterlogging was 7715.25 ha, accounting for 14.5% of the total area of the study area, of which 75.8% occurred from 2008 to 2016. Furthermore, the accumulated area of restoration was 207.18 ha, which occurred after 2007 and accounts for 2.7% of the total area of subsidence waterlogging. Based on the analysis results of the changes of waterlogging types, the best time window for restoration of the waterlogging area is 3y after water accumulation. The main innovation of this paper is to make use of the temporal heterogeneity (Number of year in patches, Y_num) and morphological index (Landscape shape index in patches, LSI) of the change water to distinguish engineering water and subsidence waterlogging.', '[He, Tingting; Zhao, YanLing; Hu, Zhenqi] China Univ Min & Technol, Inst Land Reclamat & Ecol Restorat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.

The dataset was produced based on the improved net gradient difference algorithm using 2470 SAR scenes from ENVISAT and Sentinel-1A/B as well as manual analysis of MODIS imagery to fill in SAR data gaps.

Quantifying urbanization impacts on ambient air temperatures (Tair) has relevance for human health risk, building energy use efficiency, vector-borne disease control and urban biodiversity. Remote sensing of urban climate has been focused on land surface temperature (LST) due to a scarcity of data on Tair which is usually interpolated at 1 km resolution. We assessed the efficacy of mapping hyperlocal Tair (spatial resolutions of 10-30 m) over Oslo, Norway, by integrating Sentinel, Landsat and LiDAR data with crowd-sourced Tair measurements from 1310 private weather stations during 2018. Using Random Forest regression modelling, we found that annual mean, daily maximum and minimum Tair can be mapped with an average RMSE of 0.52 degrees C (R-2 = 0.5), 1.85 degrees C (R-2 = 0.05) and 1.46 degrees C (R-2 = 0.33), respectively. Mapping accuracy decreased sharply with < 250 weather stations (approx. 1 station km(-2)) and remote sensing data averaged within a 100-500 m buffer zone around each station maximized accuracy. Further, models performed best outside of summer months when the spatial variation in temperatures were low and wind velocities were high. Finally, accuracies were not evenly distributed over space and we found the lowest mapping errors in the local climate zone characterized by compact lowrise buildings which are most relevant to city residents. We conclude that this method is transferable to other cities given there was little difference (0.02 degrees C RMSE) between models trained on open- (satellite and terrain) vs closed-source (LiDAR) remote sensing data.

Many operational tools rely on continuous streams of remote sensing data, and when a satellite sensor reaches the end of its designed lifespan, these tools must be transferred to a more reliable data stream. Transferring between data streams can produce discontinuities in tool products, and it is important to quantify these downstream impacts and understand the mechanisms that cause discontinuity. To illustrate the complexities of tool transfer, we compare five products for ocean chlorophyll-a, which is a proxy for phytoplankton biomass and an important input for tools that monitor marine biophysical processes. The five chlorophyll-a products included three blended products and two single sensor products from MODIS and VIIRS. We explored the downstream impacts of tool transfer using EcoCast: an operational dynamic ocean management tool that combines real-time predictions from target and bycatch species distribution models to produce integrated surfaces of fishing suitability. EcoCast was operationalized using MODIS chlorophyll-a, and we quantify the impacts of transferring to the intended replacement of MODIS, VIIRS, and test if impacts can be minimized by using a blended chlorophyll-a product instead. Differences between chlorophyll products did not linearly propagate through to the species model predictions and the integrated fishing suitability surfaces. Instead, differences in species model predictions were determined by the shape of chlorophyll-a response curves in the species models relative to chlorophyll-a differences between sensors. However, differences in the integrated fishing suitability surfaces were reduced by canceling of differences from individual species model predictions. Differences in the integrated fishing suitability surfaces were not reduced by transferring to a blended product, highlighting the complexity of transferring operational tools between different remote sensing data products. These results contribute to our general understanding of the mechanisms by which transferring between data streams impacts downstream products. To aid decision-making regarding tool transfer, we developed an interactive web application that allows end-users to explore differences in chlorophyll products within times period and regions of interest.', '[Welch, H.; Brodie, S.; Jacox, M.

The airborne LiDAR has emerged as an effective tool for mapping plant area index (PAI) in a landscape consisting of both woody and leaf materials. However, the discrimination between woody and leaf materials and the estimation of effective LAI (eLAI) have, to date, rarely been studied at landscape scale. We applied a voxel matching algorithm to estimate eLAI of deciduous forests using simulated and field LiDAR data under leaf-on and leaf-off conditions. We classified LiDAR points as either a leaf or a woody hit on leaf-on LiDAR data by matching the point with leaf-off data. We compared the eLAI result of our voxel matching algorithm against the subtraction method, where the leaf-off effective woody area index (eWAI) is subtracted from the effective leaf-on PAI (ePAI). Our results, which were validated against terrestrial LiDAR derived eLAI, showed that the voxel matching method, with an optimal voxel size of 0.1 m, produced an unbiased estimation of terrestrial LiDAR derived eLAI with an R-2 of 0.70 and an RMSE of 0.41 (RRMSE: 20.1%). The subtraction method, however, yielded an R-2 of 0.62 and an RMSE of 1.02 (RRMSE: 50.1%) with a significant underestimation of 0.94. Reassuringly, the same outcome was observed using a simulated dataset. In addition, we evaluated the performance of 96 LiDAR metrics under leaf-on conditions for eLAI prediction using a statistical model. Based on the importance scores derived from the random forest regression, nine of the 96 leaf-on LiDAR metrics were selected. Cross-validation showed that eLAI could be predicted using these metrics under leaf-on conditions with an R-2 of 0.73 and an RMSE of 0.27 (RRMSE: 17.4%). The voxel matching method yielded a slightly lower accuracy (R-2: 0.70, RMSE:0.41, RRMSE: 20.1%) than the statistical model. We, therefore, suggest that the voxel matching method offers a new opportunity for the estimating eLAI and other ecological applications that require the classification between leaf and woody materials using airborne LiDAR data.

Satellite imagery provides a tool to identify and understand the processes that control coral reef degradation, however due to the dynamic nature of seawater constituents, current spaceborne multispectral sensors cannot reliably discriminate between the many coral reef benthic classes necessary to detect change. Hyperspectral imagers may provide sufficient spectral resolution to estimate water column properties and differentiate benthic classes, however, the effects of depth, seawater constituents, and classification algorithm on the accuracy of benthic classifications have not been systematically assessed. Here, we simulate the ability of a spaceborne hyperspectral imager to accurately map fractional cover of coral reef benthic classes under a variety of conditions. Benthic reflectance is simulated by combining pure reflectance spectra of coral, algae, and sand and projecting these mixed spectra through a fully crossed set of water columns. We then use a semi-analytical optimization procedure to estimate the water column properties and multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis to estimate the fractional cover of the benthic classes using many independent endmember spectra. We compare our estimated benthic class fractions to the original, actual fractions used to produce the mixed coral reef spectra to quantify several measures of error. We found that multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis decreases fractional retrieval error, which is also reduced when the first derivative of the mixed and endmember spectra is used prior to unmixing. The estimation of fractional benthic class cover is most accurate for depths <= 3 m for most water conditions. Depths >= 5 m should be classified only if chlorophyll and sediment concentration are <0.1 mg m(-3) and <0.1 g m(-3), respectively. Our results indicate that the fractional cover of coral and algae should be at least 25% for accurate benthic class estimates (mean relative error < 50%), however there will be many ways to leverage the repeat measurements of a hyperspectral satellite sensor, such as a stable depth retrievals and benthic cover estimates, to produce more accurate and useful fractional cover data. We show how this simulation analysis can be used to generate maps of predicted benthic cover fractional retrieval uncertainty across a coral reef system using aerial hyperspectral imagery acquired over Hawaii, USA, although reef-specific, within pixel variations in depth and benthic class complexity should be considered.', '[Bel, Tom W.; Okin, Gregory S.; Cavanaugh, Kyle C.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.

The use of time series phenology can help overcome limitations of conventional classification-based mapping approaches encountered when, for example, attempting to characterize grassland use intensity. In Europe, permanent grasslands account for more than one third of all agricultural land and a considerable share of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) budget is devoted to grasslands. The frequency and timing of mowing events is an important proxy for grassland use intensity and methods that allow characterizing grassland use intensity at the parcel level and over large areas are urgently needed. Here we present a novel algorithm that allows detecting and quantifying the number and timing of mowing events in central European grasslands. The algorithm utilizes all imagery acquired by Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI for one entire year as available from the NASA Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel dataset. Cloud-free observations from both sensors are first synthesized through compositing at 10-day interval. Machine learning algorithms are then used to derive a grassland stratum. The intra-annual growing season profiles of NDVI values are subsequently assessed and compared to an idealized growing season trajectory. Residuals between the idealized trajectory and a polynomial model fit to the observed NDVI values are then evaluated to detect potential mowing events. We demonstrate and evaluate the performance of our algorithm and utilize its large area analysis capabilities by mapping the frequency and timing of grassland mowing events in 2016 on the national-scale across Germany. Our results suggest that 25% of the grassland area is not used for mowing. Validation results however suggest a relatively high omission error of the algorithm for areas that only experienced a single mowing event. The date ranges of detected mowing events compare overall well to a sample of interpreted time series points and to farm level reports on mowing dates. The mapped mowing patterns depict typical management regimes across Germany. Overall, our results exemplify the value of multi-sensor time series applications for characterizing land use intensity across large areas.', '[Griffiths, Patrick; Hostert, Patrick] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery spanning over almost two decades of daily observations at a resolution of up to 250 in provides a good resource for deriving long-term ocean kinematics from sea ice dynamics. In this paper, we present a newly developed automatic algorithm to retrieve dynamic measurements of sea ice from these images. We describe the methodology by presenting results acquired along the East Greenland Current (ECG) for 6.5 weeks in the spring of 2017. During this period, our ice floe tracker was used to identify and track ice floes with length scales ranging from 8 to 65 km. By effectively filtering atmospheric conditions from MODIS images, ice floes were tracked for up to ten consecutive days, and a total of 1061 trajectories were retrieved. A southward mean sea ice flow associated with the ECG was observed along with deviations in both direction and magnitude, suggesting the effect of an underlying turbulent eddy field. The absolute position and tracking errors associated with our method are 255 m and 0.65 cm/s, respectively, each derived from a comparison between manually and automatically identified ice floes. Going forward, our methodology will be employed to process longer time sequences to analyze nonlinear interactions between drifting ice floes and the upper ocean turbulent eddy field in the ECG as well as to investigate other prominent regions of the Arctic Ocean.', '[Lopez-Acosta, R.; Wilhelmus, M.

This makes it a unique asset for many geophysical applications. Initially designed for the measurement of directional ocean wave spectra, Sentinel-1 SAR wave mode (WV) vignettes are small 20 km scenes that have been collected globally since 2014. Recent WV data exploration reveals that many important oceanic and atmospheric phenomena are also well captured, but not yet employed by the scientific community. However, expanding applications of this whole massive dataset beyond ocean waves requires a strategy to automatically identify these geophysical phenomena. In this study, we propose to apply the emerging deep learning approach in ocean SAR scenes classification. The training is performed using a hand-curated dataset that describes ten commonly-occurring atmospheric or oceanic processes. Our model evaluation relies on an independent assessment dataset and shows satisfactory and robust classification results. To further illustrate the model performance, regional patterns of rain and sea ice are qualitatively analyzed and found to be very consistent with independent remote sensing datasets. In addition, these high-resolution WV SAR data can resolve fine, sub-km scale, spatial structure of rain events and sea ice that complement other satellite measurements. Overall, such automated SAR vignettes classification may open paths for broader geophysical application of maritime Sentinel-1 acquisitions.', '[Wang, Chen; Mouche, Alexis; Gressani, Victor; Chapron, Bertrand] Univ Brest, CNRS, IFREMER, IRD,LOPS, Brest, France.

Vegetation optical depth (VOD) based on microwave radiative transfer inversion has recently been used to assess plant water use strategy. However, VOD is sensitive to both total aboveground biomass (AGB) and leaf water content, with only the latter being a proxy of leaf water potential whose diurnal variation can be used to characterize vegetation iso/anisohydricity. In this study, by using a network of soil water measurements (used as a proxy for predawn leaf water potential), satellite retrieved normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, as a proxy for AGB), and two satellite VOD products from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) sensor, we compare three linear models and one machine learning model to investigate to what extent can VOD be used to represent leaf water potential changes during soil moisture dry-down periods. Linear models with both NDVI and leaf water potential, on average, can explain 33% and 51% of VOD variations of each product respectively. Models using only NDVI explain 27% and 46% of the VOD variance, compared to less than 10% by models using leaf water potential only. With the NDVI and leaf water potential (full) model, leaf water potential contributes around 17% of the VOD variance, which is smaller than NDVI (33%). The machine learning model has overall better performance than the linear models, and also highlight the dominant contribution of AGB to VOD signals. After the AGB contribution to VOD is eliminated by normalizing daytime VOD with nighttime VOD, the residuals carry the information of diurnal variations of leaf water potential and calculations from both VOD datasets are consistent with each other (r = 0.42 +/- 0.17, P < 0.01 for 88 out of 94 sites). The response of VODdaytime/VODnighttime to soil water potential can also be used as a new metric for ecosystem iso/anisohydricity. Our study demonstrates that a large proportion of variations in VOD are caused by AGB for temperate ecosystems, and higher accuracy VOD products with additional root-zone soil water potential are needed for ecosystem iso/anisohydricity estimations.', '[Zhang, Yao; Xiao, Xiangming] Univ Oklahoma, Ctr Spatial Anal, Dept Microbiol & Plant Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA.

Instead of using a raster format to fuse DEMs generated from different data sets with different resolutions, we developed a methodology based on 3-D point clouds: 1) re-georeference the 5-m TRI and similar to 1-m SfM DEMs to the 10-m TDX DEM using the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm to minimize the horizontal and vertical discrepancy between DEMs; then 2) merge the multiple point clouds to generate a final DEM without data gaps using an adaptive algorithm that uses two search distances to smooth the transition at the edges of different data sets. We assess the new 10-m DEM by comparing simulated inundation zones obtained with two volcano flow models, LaharZ (for lahars) and VolcFlow (for pyroclastic flows), and find significant differences with respect to the 30-m SRTM DEM. Our LaharZ simulation over the new DEM shows a longer lahar run-out distance. For pyroclastic flows, the VolcFlow simulation over the new DEM produces highly channelized flows over the steep portions of a river channel and gives a larger extent of thicker deposits compared to those obtained with the 30-m SRTM DEM. Quantitative and qualitative geomorphic analysis suggests that up-to-date DEMs with high spatial resolution (similar to 10 m or even better) need to be generated to improve volcano hazard assessment for active volcanoes.', '[Deng, Fanghui; Rodgers, Mel; Xie, Surui; Dixon, Timothy H.; Charbonnier, Sylvain; Gallant, Elisabeth A.; Malservisi, Rocco; Voss, Nicholas K.] Univ S Florida, Sch Geosci, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.

Recently, TanDEM-X 90 has been released with a global coverage at 3?arc sec resolution. Its release is sure to generate keen interest as it provides an alternative to the widely used Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM, especially for flood risk management as for low slope floodplains height errors can become particularly significant. Here, we provide a first accuracy assessment of TanDEM-X 90 for selected floodplain sites and compare it to other popular global DEMs - the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and the error-reduced version of SRTM called Multi-Error-Removed-Improved-Terrain (MERIT) DEM. We characterize vertical height errors by comparing against high resolution LiDAR DEMs for 32 floodplain locations in 6 continents. Results indicate that the average vertical accuracy of TanDEM-X 90 and MERIT are similar and are both a significant improvement on SRTM. We further our analysis by assessing vertical accuracy by landcover, with our results suggesting that TanDEM-X 90 is the most accurate global DEM in all landcover categories tested except short vegetation and tree-covered areas where MERIT is demonstrably more accurate. Lastly, we present the first characterization of the spatial error structure of any TanDEM-X DEM product, and find the spatial error structure is similar to MERIT, with MERIT generally having lower sill values and larger ranges than TanDEM-X 90 and SRTM. Our findings suggest that TanDEM-X 90 has the potential to become the benchmark global DEM in floodplains with careful removal of errors from vegetation, and at this stage should be used alongside MERIT in any flood risk application.', '[Hawker, Laurence; Neal, Jeffrey; Bates, Paul] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England.', 'University of BristolRP Hawker, L (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England.', 'Laurence.hawker@bristol.ac.ukRI Bates, Paul D/C-8026-2012; Neal, Jeffrey/AAQ-6893-2020', 'Bates, Paul D/0000-0001-9192-9963; Neal, Jeffrey/0000-0001-5793-9594;   Hawker, Laurence/0000-0002-8317-7084', 'Water Informatics Science and Engineering Centre for Doctoral Training   (WISE CDT) under a grant from the Engineering and Physical Sciences   Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/L016214/1]; NERC SHEAR catalyst grant   [NE/5006079/1]; Leverhulme Research Fellowship; Royal Society Wolfson   Research Merit award; NERC [NE/S003061/1, NE/S006079/1] Funding Source:   UKRI', 'This work is funded as part of the Water Informatics Science and   Engineering Centre for Doctoral Training (WISE CDT) under a grant from   the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), grant   EP/L016214/1, and a NERC SHEAR catalyst grant (NE/5006079/1).

ESA\'s Sentinel-2 (S2) mission with its decametric resolution enables to derive fAPAR information at single forest stand. Validation studies on previously existing satellite-derived fAPAR products have found considerable discrepancies, especially in forest ecosystems that exceed relative discrepancies of 10% (i.e. 0.05 for absolute values) set as target accuracy by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS).   This study presents the validation of S2 fAPAR products using direct radiation measurements of 2017 at three different forests, located in Central Europe (mixed-coniferous forest in temperate mid-latitude), North America (boreal-deciduous forest) and Central America (tropical dry forest, TDF). We measured incoming and transmitted PAR every 10 min synchronously using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and calculated a two-flux fAPAR estimate. We validated the S2 fAPAR product with different instantaneous ground fAPAR estimates (e.g. instantaneous fAPAR at 10:00 and 14:00 local solar time) and daily average fAPAR. We considered uncertainties of ground data, i.e. bias related to the presence of colored autumn leaves and influences of solar zenith angle.   Overall, we found high discrepancies between the S2 fAPAR product and ground measurements, indicating that the S2 fAPAR product systematically underestimated (negative values for bias in percent) the ground observations. The highest agreement was observed at the boreal-deciduous forest stand with a bias of -13% (R-2 = 0.67). The Central American and European sites reported deviations of -20% (R-2 = 0.68) and -25% (R-2 = 0.26), respectively. At all sites, we found evidence that particularly the influence of colored leaves during the senescence periods lead to bias of the ground data. Further, the choice of temporal fAPAR estimate, i.e. daily average fAPAR or a certain instantaneous fAPAR estimate, lead to partly different results in the correlation analysis with the S2 fAPAR product. However, considering sources of uncertainties of ground data, we emphasize that only the boreal-deciduous site in Canada fulfilled the accuracy requirements set by the GCOS.   In contrast to absolute values, we found strong agreement on phenological changes at all three sites. Specifically, the influence of species composition on seasonal variability of fAPAR across the European mixed coniferous site was well-represented in the S2 fAPAR product. As for the representation of spatial variability, we found highest agreement at the boreal-deciduous forest stand (BIAS = -22%, R-2 = 0.93), whereas spatial variability was least represented at the TDF site (BIAS = 125%, R-2 = 0.97). We conclude that the S2 fAPAR product has strong capabilities for assessing temporal variability of fAPAR, but due to low accuracy of absolute values currently limited options to feed global production efficiency models and assess global carbon balances.', '[Putzenlechner, Birgitta; Ludwig, Ralf; Marzahn, Philip] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany.

The objective of this study is to monitor crop phenology using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) polarimetric decompositions and a random forest algorithm applied to a multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 dataset, acquired during the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Validation Experiment 2016 in Manitoba (SMAPVEX16-MB). The model-based and eigen-based polarimetric parameters are used to separate the vegetation and soil scattering contributions in the total radar signal. As the crop morphological shape and structure vary with phenological growth, our study assumes that the polarimetric parameters related to the volume scattering mechanism have the potential to track the crop phenology. The sensitivity of the polarimetric parameters to the ground identified crop phenology is analyzed for different crop types. For canola, a single polarimetric parameter is sufficient to characterize the crop phenology, due to the high volume scattering power and large temporal dynamic. For corn, soybean and wheat, combinations of multiple polarimetric parameters are required. For each crop type, the Random Forest algorithm trained using 60% of the data is used to retrieve the, crop phenology. Performances are compared to Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine Regression and k-Nearest neighborhood algorithms. The Random Forest algorithm provides the best phenology retrieval with significant (p-value < 0.01) spearman correlation coefficients (between the retrieved and ground identified phenology) of 0.93, 0.90, 0.85 and 0.91 for canola, corn, soybean and wheat, respectively. While a single polarimetric parameter demonstrates limited sensitivity to corn phenology, the retrieved phenology from the Random Forest algorithm using multiple polarimetric parameters agrees well with the ground measurements. Furthermore, the importance of different polarimetric parameters for phenology retrieval using the Random Forest algorithm is quantified for different crop types.

Despite great achievements in developing practical algorithms to estimate LSTs from thermal infrared (TIR) data, the retrieval of LSTs for overcast conditions has received much less attention. Existing techniques, such as passive microwave (PMW) approaches, surface energy balance (SEB) models, and reconstruction algorithms relying on spatial/temporal information, for estimating LSTs under cloudy skies cannot fulfill the need for a spatially and temporally consistent LST dataset. Inspired by recent advancements in physically-based urban canopy models (UCMs), this study synergistically used the coupled Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF)/UCM system and the random forest (RF) regression technique (hereafter named as WRFF) to effectively estimate LSTs under cloudy conditions. Taking the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan region as a test site, the WRF/UCM simulations (LSTs) were performed from April 28 to May 20, 2011. The MODIS LST images of the same period were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the method introduced in this study. LSTs under cloudy conditions for a partially cloudy image were retrieved using the RF model calibrated by clear-sky pixels from the same image. For a fully cloud-contaminated image, clear-sky pixels from its temporally adjacent images were used to calibrate the RF model to estimate LSTs under cloudy conditions. Results showed that the modeling system could well capture diurnal air temperature variations but tended to underestimate temperature values. The correlation coefficient between MODIS LSTs and simulated LSTs exhibited a wide range from 0.5 to 0.9 with the RMSE (root mean square error) value varying from 1.0 to 9.0 K across different land covers. The utilization of the RF regression technique for estimating LSTs under cloudy conditions from a partially cloud-contaminated LST image greatly reduced the RMSE to similar to 1.8 K with an improved correlation coefficient. For fully cloud-contaminated LST images, LSTs were estimated with the correlation coefficient and RMSE values of similar to 0.75 and similar to 2.0 K, respectively. Overall, the WRFF method has potential to generate a consistent and reliable LST dataset for various applications such as quantification of urban heat island intensity and vulnerability analysis of humans to vector-borne diseases.

For this study, we used data obtained from the United Kingdom (UK) TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) satellite mission. The main objective of the TDS-1 mission is to provide L-band radar reflections of the ocean surface in order to infer wind speed through an estimation of the ocean surface roughness. Given the orbit inclination of TDS-1, polar coverage is obtained providing datasets over the Arctic sea ice cover. Recent studies demonstrated the use of TDS-1 data for accurately deriving ocean-ice detection using the shape of the bistatic radar waveforms derived from delay-Doppler maps. We aim to advance this previous research by demonstrating the sensitivity of GNSS bistatic radar signals to sea ice types. The originality of the study presented in this manuscript is the classification of sea ice types, never implemented before with any GNSS-R mission. For this study, we examined the fall period of October 2015 in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas region, when considerable expanses of young ice, first-year ice (FYI), and multi-year ice (MYI) were present. We developed a sea ice multi-step classification approach based on bistatic radar reflections to generate not only an ocean-ice classification but to classify between the three dominant ice types present. The classification was done in multiple steps based on GNSS bistatic radar observations only and includes checks for spatio-temporal consistency with each dominant class. Validation results are based on the comparison of the GNSS classification against SAR-derived sea ice type maps produced at the US National Ice Center. First, we derived classifications of sea ice-open water samples with a success rate of 97%, comparable to previous studies. Next, the sea ice type classification results identified FYI, MYI and young ice with success rates of 70%, 82% and 81%, respectively, indicating a strong sensitivity of the L-band GNSS bistatic radar signals to the different surface scattering properties of these primary ice types.   With this manuscript we demonstrate the potential of the GNSS bistatic radar signals to classify ice types during the sea ice formation period. GNSS bistatic radar signals provide unique forward scattered measurements at L-band, potentially on a daily temporal revisit, that can be used to produce enhanced information on sea ice characteristics, such as those currently generated by other sensors. In order to determine the use of GNSS-R measurements on an operational basis, further studies are needed over a year-long period of sea ice growth and melt to determine the full benefit of GNSS for improving and providing complementary information to that generated by both microwave and optical sensors.', '[Rodriguez-Alvarez, Nereida; Holt, Benjamin; Jaruwatanadilok, Sermsak; Podest, Erika; Cavanaugh, Katherine C.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.', 'National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion   Laboratory (JPL); California Institute of TechnologyRP Rodriguez-Alvarez, N (通讯作者)，CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.', 'nereida.rodriguez.alvarez@jpl.nasa.gov', 'Rodriguez-Alvarez, Nereida/0000-0002-9382-0686', 'National Aeronautics and Space Administration; California Institute of   Technology', 'This research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,   California Institute of Technology, under contract with the National   Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Access to information on the internal structure of these volume scatterers is a key factor for a better understanding of ecosystem dynamics and climate change. Because of this, several concepts are nowadays examined to implement SAR tomography in a spaceborne framework.   In order to do that, it is necessary to gather different observations of the area of interest. Unfortunately, a consequence of the time that elapses between acquisitions is that the electromagnetic properties of the medium may vary. This implies that, there may be inconsistencies in the acquired data, leading to errors in the final inversion. A solution to partially cope with this temporal decorrelation, is to acquire data employing two or more sensors operating with a reduced (or even absent) temporal gap and then to collect several acquisitions at different time instants. By means of this imaging concept, the required line-of-sight diversity is granted and the desired resolution in the height direction ensured. In this way, sets of temporal decorrelation-free interferometric coherences can be built and the vertical scattering profile can be retrieved via coherence-based tomography.   This contribution analyzes a two-sensor system like TanDEM-X (Krieger et al., 2007), Tandem-L (Moreira et al., 2015), or SAOCOM-CS (Davidson et al., 2014).

Mapping of flood risk requires quantification of the error in DEM elevations and its effect on delineation of flood zones. The ASTER, SRTM, ALOS, and TanDEM-X (TDX) DEMs for the island of Hispaniola were examined by comparing them with GPS and LiDAR measurements. The comparisons were based on a series of error measures including root mean square error (RMSE) and absolute error at 90% quantile (LE90). When compared with > 2000 GPS measurements with elevations below 7 m, RMSE and LE90 values for ASTER, SRTM, ALOS, TDX DEMs were 8.44 and 14.29, 3.82 and 5.85, 2.08 and 3.64, and 1.74 and 3.20 m, respectively.

The expanded area with LiDAR coverage included additional types of land surface, resulting in differences in error measures. Comparison of RMSEs indicated that the filtering of TDX DEMs using four methods improved the accuracy of the estimates of ground elevation by 20-43%. DTMs generated by interpolating the ground pixels from a progressive morphological filter, using an empirical Bayesian kriging method, produced an RMSE of 1.06 m and LE90 of 1.73 m when compared to GPS measurements, and an RMSE of 1.30 m and LE90 of 2.02 m when compared to LiDAR data. Differences in inundation areas based on TDX and LiDAR DTMs were between - 13% and - 4% for scenarios of 3, 5, 10, and 15 m water level rise, a much narrower range than inundation differences between ASTER, SRTM, ALOS and LiDAR. The TDX DEMs deliver high resolution global DEMs with unprecedented elevation accuracy, hence, it is recommended for mapping coastal flood risk zones on a global scale, as well as at a local scale in developing countries where data with higher accuracy are unavailable.', '[Zhang, Keqi; Ross, Michael] Florida Int Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Miami, FL 33199 USA.

Airborne imaging spectroscopy data have been successfully used to identify urban surface materials mainly based on unmixing algorithms. Upcoming spaceborne Imaging Spectrometers (IS), such as the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP), will reduce the time and cost-critical limitations of airborne systems for Earth Observation (EO). However, the spatial resolution of all operated and planned IS in space will not be higher than 20 to 30 m and, thus, the detection of pure Endmember (EM) candidates in urban areas, a requirement for spectral unmixing, is very limited. Gradient analysis could be an alternative method for retrieving urban surface material compositions in pixels from spaceborne IS. The gradient concept is well known in ecology to identify plant species assemblages formed by similar environmental conditions but has never been tested for urban materials. However, urban areas also contain neighbourhoods with similar physical, compositional and structural characteristics. Based on this assumption, this study investigated (1) whether cover fractions of surface materials change gradually in urban areas and (2) whether these gradients can be adequately mapped and interpreted using imaging spectroscopy data (e.g. EnMAP) with 30 m spatial resolution.   Similarities of material compositions were analysed on the basis of 153 systematically distributed samples on a detailed surface material map using Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA). Determined gradient scores for the first two gradients were regressed against the corresponding mean reflectance of simulated EnMAP spectra using Partial Least Square regression models. Results show strong correlations with R-2 = 0.85 and R-2 = 0.71 and an RMSE of 0.24 and 0.21 for the first and second axis, respectively. The subsequent mapping of the first gradient reveals patterns that correspond to the transition from predominantly vegetation classes to the dominance of artificial materials. Patterns resulting from the second gradient are associated with surface material compositions that are related to finer structural differences in urban structures. The composite gradient map shows patterns of common surface material compositions that can be related to urban land use classes such as Urban Structure Types (UST). By linking the knowledge of typical material compositions with urban structures, gradient analysis seems to be a powerful tool to map characteristic material compositions in 30 m imaging spectroscopy data of urban areas.', '[Jilge, Marianne] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Geomat Remote Sensing Grp, Dept Geog, Univ Str 150, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.

Satellite infrared imaging radiometers passively measure the radiance emitted and reflected by the surface of the Earth and atmosphere. Tropospheric aerosols increase the signal attenuation at the satellite height, degrading the accuracy of SST retrievals. In this study to assess the infrared radiative effects of aerosols on satellite-derived skin SSTs (SSTskin), MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) SSTskin retrievals are compared with quality-controlled, collocated SSTskin, measurements from the Marine-Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (M-AERI) deployed on research cruises during the Aerosols and Ocean Science Expeditions (AEROSE), and sub-surface temperatures measured by thermistors on drifting buoys. In this region, SSTskin retrievals from the MODIS on the Aqua satellite are generally much cooler than the in-situ measurements. In the Saharan outflow area between 90 W to 90 degrees E and 20 degrees S to 35 degrees N where aerosol optical depths may be > 0.5, satellite SSTskin are often > 1 K cooler than the in situ data. The goal of this research is to determine the characteristics of aerosol effects on satellite retrieved infrared SST, and to derive formulae for improving accuracies of infrared-derived SSTs in aerosol-contaminated regions. A new method to derive a night-time Dust-induced SST Difference Index (DSDI) algorithm based on simulated brightness temperatures and Principal component (PC) analysis (PCA) at infrared wavelengths of 3.8, 8.9, 10.8 and 12.0 mu m, was developed using radiative transfer simulations. The satellite SSTskin biases and standard deviations, derive by comparisons with coincident and collocated surface and in situ measurements, are reduced by 0.263 K and 0.166 K after the DSDI correction.

Satellite Remote Sensing images, in particular Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), have been used to produce a directional wave spectrum by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), from which the wavelength and wave direction of the ocean surface waves can be retrieved. These wave properties can be directly used in the linear dispersion relation to estimate the water depth.   The present work takes advantages from the very short revisit times of the Sentinel-1A with C-band (5.405 GHz) SAR images with 10 m of spatial resolution to study the repeatability of this methodology for deriving the nearshore sea-bottom morphology, using a case study in the Aveiro region, located in the Portuguese West Coast. This site is exposed to high energetic wave climate of the North Atlantic Ocean. Overall, a set of four images were selected for the analysis.   The robustness of the FFT methodology to calculate the wavelength and wave direction from SAR images was analysed through calculating their standard deviations. The errors of estimating the local bathymetry from these quantities was accessed which allowed to quantify the water depth limits of application of this methodology.   The set of images was used to establish a bathymetric estimation that merges the derived bathymetry of each image. The computed bathymetry was quantitatively compared with the measurements made in 2013 and available at RATA Observatory. The relative error of the water depth ranges between 6% and 10%, but increases for the higher depths and depends on the accuracy of the computed wavelength at deep-waters. The merged derived bathymetry also provides a better approximation for the measured bathymetry than those derived from the individual images.', '[Pereira, Patricia] Univ Aveiro, Dept Fis, Campus Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.

These events are the first earthquakes in the state exceeding M(w)5.0 since the 2011 M(w)5.7 Prague earthquake and likely result from wide scale deep fluid-injection. We use interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations to quantify the magnitude and location of surface deformation associated with these three events, determine the depth ranges of fault slip, and assess the spatial relationship between fault slip and well-calibrated mainshock and aftershock locations. We also include newly reported, calibrated event locations for the Cushing earthquake. We find that the Pawnee earthquake ruptured within the crystalline basement with the shallowest slip occurring at depths of 3.1-4.3 km. We find a similar, though shallower, crystalline basement source for the Cushing earthquake with a minimum depth to slip of 1.6-2.3 km. Despite the smaller magnitude of the Cushing earthquake, it generated anomalously high ground motions and damage compared to the larger Pawnee and Fairview earthquakes. We postulate that the shallow source of the Cushing earthquakes provides one explanation for the higher than expected ground motions. The Fairview earthquake generated no detectable co-seismic displacements, which is consistent with a relatively deep earthquake source (similar to 8.5 km). We do, however, identify a 16 km stretch of floodplain where widespread liquefaction occurred in response to the Fairview earthquake, and where 30 gas production wells were exposed to surface displacements exceeding 5 cm. Consequently, the depth to crystalline basement, which limits the depth of injection-induced earthquakes in Oklahoma, and the potential for liquefaction are important factors in assessing shaking risk in the central United States.', '[Barnhart, William D.] Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.

The velocities from a total of 1041 drifters are compared and evaluated to the synthetic particle-derived velocities for the period 1993-2015. On average the GlobCurrent underestimates the velocity in the Greater Agulhas Current by approximately 27%. The underestimation ranges from 4 to 64% in different regions, with the smallest error found in the Agulhas retroflection region, and the highest in the Benguela Upwelling System. Furthermore, we compare the time taken for the separation between the virtual and real drifters to reach 35 km. The mean separation time was found to be 78 h, with the shortest time (35 h) found in the Agulhas Current and the longest time (116 h) located in the Agulhas Return Current. Deploying 10,000 virtual drifters in a 1 degrees x 1 degrees box within the southern Agulhas Current shows a convergence of trajectories towards the core of the current, while higher divergence is evident in the Agulhas retroflection. To evaluate the utility of this synthetic particle tracking tool coupled with GlobCurrent in open ocean search and rescue operations, two test cases are examined: (1) a capsized catamaran spotted south of Cape Recife and recovered 5 days later south of Cape Agulhas; and (2) a drifter trajectory in the same region. The comparison suggests that the GlobCurrent forced synthetic particle tracking tool is not appropriate for predicting the trajectory of a capsized catamaran that does not have the same drift characteristics as a surface drifting buoy drogued to 15 m.', '[Hart-Davis, Michael G.; Halo, Issufo] Cape Peninsula Univ Technol, Dept Conservat & Marine Sci, Cape Town, South Africa.

However, there are still challenges in deriving the change information of urbanization in timing and location over a long period. In this study, we developed a framework to map urban expansion at an annual interval from 1985 to 2015 by using the time series of Landsat data. First, the time series of Landsat data (1985-2015) were grouped into three periods, i.e., 1985-2001, 2001-2011, and 2011-2015, according to the available National Land Cover Database (NLCD). Then, a temporal segmentation approach was implemented for each period using three indicators representing changes from vegetation, water, and bare land to urban. Turning years of the start and end of change were identified. Three temporal segments representing phases of prior change, change, and post change, were generated accordingly. Thereafter, urban extents before 2001 and after 2011 were classified using a change vector analysis (CVA) based approach aided by the NLCD and identified temporal segments. Finally, urbanized pixels in each period were determined according to the identified turning years. Our approach of temporal segmentation is reliable for detecting changes caused by urban growth, with an overall accuracy of 90% in identifying turning years (+/- 1 year). Using an independent validation sample set, the CVA based approach reaches an overall accuracy of 87%. The derived product of urban dynamics shows a relatively stable increment of urban growth in Des Moines and Ames, Iowa, US, and most urbanized areas were converted from vegetated lands within 2-3 years. The proposed framework is capable of mapping long-term dynamics of urban extents at an annual interval and the outcome is useful in effectively updating current products of urban extents and improving urban growth modeling.', '[Li, Xuecao; Zhou, Yuyu; Cao, Wenting] Iowa State Univ, Dept Geol & Atmospher Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA.

Therefore, topographic correction is a prerequisite for many remote sensing applications. In this study, we proposed a semi-physically based and simple topographic correction method for vegetation canopies based on path length correction (PLC). The PLC method was derived from the solution to the classic radiative transfer equation, and the influence of terrain on the radiative transfer process within the canopy is explicitly considered, making PLC physically sound. The radiative transfer equation was simplified to make PLC mathematically simple. Near-nadir observations derived from a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image covering a mountainous region and wide field-of-view observations derived from simulation using a canopy reflectance model were combined to test the PLC correction method. Multi-criteria were used to provide objective evaluation results. The performances were compared to that of five other methods: CC, SCS + C, and SE, which are empirical parameter-based methods, and SCS and DS, which are semi-physical methods without empirical parameter. All the six methods could significantly reduce the topographic effects. However, SCS showed obvious overcorrection for near-nadir observations. The correction results from D-S showed an obvious positive bias. For near-nadir observations, the performance of PLC was comparable to the well-validated parameter-based methods. For wide field-of-view observations, PLC obviously outperformed all other methods. Because of the physical soundness and mathematical simplicity, PLC provides an efficient approach to correct the terrain-induced canopy BRDF distortion and will facilitate the exploitation of multi-angular information for biophysical parameter retrieval over mountainous regions.', '[Yin, Gaofei; Li, Ainong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Res Ctr Digital Mt & Remote Sensing Applicat, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.

Many efforts have been made to develop algorithms that derive q(a) and T-a from multisensor microwave and/or infrared observations using in situ measurements as training datasets. However, uncertainty remains large in the resultant q(a) and T-a retrievals. In this study, 147 moored surface buoys are used to examine how buoy measured q(a) and T-a are related to satellite microwave brightness temperature (Tb) on the spatial scale from the warm/humid tropics to the cold/dry high latitudes. It is found that the Tb - q(a) and Tb - T-a relations are structured along two distinct, near-linear bands, with the primary band in the warm/humid regime and a secondary (weaker) band in the cold/dry regime. The step-like transition (or separation) between the two regimes occurs at 8-10 g kg(-1) for q(a) and 14-17 degrees C for T-a. The evidence suggests that one algorithm may not be sufficient to extract q(a) and T-a from Tb in all regimes. Therefore, a high-latitude enhancement is added to the global algorithm so that the q(a) and T-a retrievals in the dry/cold regime can be specifically addressed. The new algorithms are applied to 11 microwave sensors, including SSM/I, SSMIS, and AMSU-A, from 1988 to 2016. Based on the 475,717 buoy collocations during the 29-year period, the retrieved q(a) and T-a have root-mean-square differences of 0.82 g kg(-1) and 0.51 degrees C, respectively.', '[Yu, Lisan; Jin, Xiangze] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.', 'Woods Hole Oceanographic InstitutionRP Yu, LS (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Mail Stop 21, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.', 'lyu@whoi.eduRI Yu, Lisan/AIB-2264-2022', 'Yu, Lisan/0000-0003-4157-9154', 'NOAA Ocean Observation and Monitoring Division (OOMD) [NA14OAR4320158]', 'The project is sponsored by the NOAA Ocean Observation and Monitoring   Division (OOMD) under grant NA14OAR4320158.

Although a global DEM can be considerably enhanced using additional reference information such as higher resolution DEMs or ground truth points, improving accuracy in areas without reference data remains a challenge. This paper develops an approach to improve the accuracy of the estimated topography by combining two complementary DEMs (ASTER GDEM 1 arc-second and SRTM DEM 1 arc-second) in regions missing reference data. The combination approach is based on formulating relationships between slopes and weights in sites with reference data. Then the developed relationships are applied to sites with similar geomorphology to determine the combination weight for each DEM without using reference data. The results indicate that combined DEMs offer significant improvements of 47% and 20% in mean bias over a mountainous site, and 16% and 58% at a low-relief site when compared with the SRTM and ASTER GDEM products, respectively.

Deeper marine environments devoid of sunlight cannot be imaged by conventional hyperspectral imagers. Instead, a close-range, sunlight-independent hyper spectral survey approach is required. In this study, we present the first hyperspectral image data from the deep seafloor. The data were acquired in approximately 4200 m water depth using a new Underwater Hyperspectral Imager (UHI) mounted on a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). UHI data were recorded for 112 spectral bands between 378 nm and 805 nm, with a high spectral (4 nm) and spatial resolution (1 mm per image pixel). The study area was located in a manganese nodule field in the Peru Basin (SE Pacific), close to the DISCOL (DISturbance and reCOLonization) experimental area. To test whether underwater hyperspectral imaging can be used for detection and mapping of mineral deposits in potential deep-sea mining areas, we compared two supervised classification methods, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM). The results show that SVM is superior to SAM and is able to accurately detect nodule surfaces.

When MIT exceeds maximum water depth, lakes freeze to the bottom with bedfast ice (BI) and when MIT is less than maximum water depth lakes have floating ice (El). Both airborne radar and space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery (Ku-, X-, C-, and L-band) have been used previously to determine whether lakes have a BI or El regime in a given year, across a number of years, or across large regions. In this study, we use a combination of ERS-1/2, RADARSAT-2, Envisat, and Sentinel-1 SAR imagery for seven lake-rich regions in Arctic Alaska to analyze lake ice regime extents and dynamics over a 25-year period (1992-2016). Our interactive threshold classification method determines a unique statistic-based intensity threshold for each SAR scene, allowing for the comparison of classification results from C-band SAR data acquired with different polarizations and incidence angles. Additionally, our novel method accommodates declining signal strength in aging extended-mission satellite SAR instruments. Comparison of SAR ice regime classifications with extensive field measurements from six years yielded a 93% accuracy. Significant declines in BI regimes were only observed in the Fish Creek area with 3% of lakes exhibiting transitional ice regimes lakes that switch from BI to FI during this 25-year period. This analysis suggests that the potential conversion from BI to FI regimes is primarily a function of lake depth distributions in addition to regional differences in climate variability. Remote sensing of lake ice regimes with C-band SAR is a useful tool to monitor the associated thermal impacts on permafrost, since lake ice regimes can be used as a proxy for of sub-lake permafrost thaw, considered by the Global Climate Observing System as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV). Continued winter warming and variable snow conditions in the Arctic are expected and our long-term analysis provides a valuable baseline for predicting where potential future lake ice regimes shifts will be most pronounced.', '[Engram, Melanie; Arp, Christopher D.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Water & Environm Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK USA.

Results for three virtual dual-view sensors constructed from Himawari-8/AHI (one of the next generation of geostationary sensors) paired with MODIS (Aqua and Terra) and VIIRS are reported. Over 1270 representative Hyperion passes were used to reproduce, by spectral band integration, \"simultaneous\" observations by the three pairs of sensors, and linear relationships between AHI-MODIS and AHI-VIIRS were established, allowing the conversion of MODIS bands and VIIRS bands to AHI bands. For 95% of the sample pixels, a maximum reflectance conversion error < 0.004 was achieved. Following band conversion, inter-calibration was conducted using a ray-matching technique, involving up to 2100 matchup areas from 20 months of imagery. Overall the final calibration accuracy is high as indicated by high correlation r(2) (similar to 0.98), small estimated parameter errors, small regression errors and negligible regression biases. The temporal drifting of the paired sensors over a 20 month period was also analysed. It shows that all the involved sensors are very stable. Accurate inter-calibration not only provides an economical solution for the calibration an Fd validation of remote sensors, it is also essential for synergetic multi-sensor applications. Lack of sufficient information from single-view sensors has been a common bottleneck in many remote sensing applications. Constructing virtual dual-view sensors using the presented method provides an effective way to overcome the limitations of single-view sensors, without incurring extra costs. The method can be applied to other next generation geostationary sensors leading to near global coverage and enhanced products.

The AOD retrievals from the latest level-2 data collections (C5.1 and C6.0) of MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Aqua and Terra satellites and Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) versions (4.10 and 3) are subjected for quantitative analysis to assess the level of agreement with the quality assured level-2 ground based AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) measurements over Manora peak (29.36 degrees N, 79.46 E), a high altitude site in the Himalayas. Analysis revealed that the AOD from the latest MODIS Terra C6.0 deep blue (DB) 30 km x 30 km and CALIPSO ver. 4.10 (overpass within similar to 100 km distance) are in a very good agreement (R >= 0.9) with that from coincident AERONET measurements averaged over the span of 30 min. About 77% of the AOD retrieved using MODIS and similar to 87% from CALIPSO were found to be within the expected error (EE) limits. The AOD comparison between MODIS Terra C6.0 DB and CALIPSO ver. 4.10, suggested their synergic use for aerosol characterization over Himalayas. In comparison to the ver. 3, CALIPSO ver. 4.10 is found to have undergone substantial changes, and their long term inter-comparison in the grid 28.86 degrees-29.86 degrees N and 78.96 degrees-79.96 degrees E revealed that their vertical feature and aerosol sub-types are in agreement of similar to 94.6% and similar to 68.6%, respectively. Utilizing the AOD retrievals from AERONET and MODIS collections, the iteratively computed LR for three LiDAR systems was found to be lower (< 16) during winter and higher (> 43) during summer.

We hypothesize that in geothermal areas the LSM time series will underestimate the LST as compared to the remote sensing data, since the former does not account for the geothermal component in its model.   In order to extract LSTgt, two approaches of different nature (physical based and data mining) were developed and tested in an area of about 560 x 560 km(2) centered at the Kenyan Rift. Pre-dawn data in the study area during the first 45 days of 2012 were analyzed.   The results show consistent spatial and temporal LSTgt patterns between the two approaches, and systematic differences of about 2 K. A geothermal area map from surface studies was used to assess LSTgt inside and outside the geothermal boundaries. Spatial means were found to be higher inside the geothermal limits, as well as the relative frequency of occurrence of high LSTgt. Results further show that areas with strong topography can result in anomalously high LSTgt values (false positives), which suggests the need for a slope and aspect correction in the inputs to achieve realistic results in those areas. The uncertainty analysis indicates that large uncertainties of the input parameters may limit detection of LSTgt anomalies. To validate the approaches, higher spatial resolution images from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data over the Olkaria geothermal field were used. An established method to estimate radiant geothermal flux was applied providing values between 9 and 24 W/m(2) in the geothermal area, which coincides with the LSTgt flux rates obtained with the proposed approaches.   The proposed approaches are a first step in estimating LSTgt at large spatial coverage from remote sensing and LSM data series, and provide an innovative framework for future improvements.', '[Romaguera, M.; Ettema, J.; Izquierdo-Verdiguier, E.; Hecker, C.

Models are therefore required to provide full spatial coverage, and through data assimilation can be combined with observations to create a reanalysis. This can then be used to investigate both observed and non observed variables, including those relating to the carbon cycle. As part of the Climate Modelling User Group (CMUG) within the European Space Agency\'s Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project, two global marine biogeochemical reanalyses have been produced by assimilating ocean colour-derived chlorophyll data into a coupled physical-biogeochemical ocean model over the period September 1997 to July 2012. One reanalysis assimilated CCI products, the other assimilated GlobColour products, with a non-assimilative hindcast run for comparison. Each has been validated against independent in situ observations of chlorophyll, nutrients and carbon cycle variables. The assimilation of either source of ocean colour data was found to improve the model\'s representation of chlorophyll concentration throughout the water column, including the frequency and positioning of deep chlorophyll maxima. The assimilation also resulted in a slight improvement in nutrient concentrations and surface fugacity of carbon dioxide compared with in situ observations, although the overall impact on mean fields was small. This was found to be due in part to cancelling errors within the model, with the assimilation providing information on model biases, which can be used to inform future climate model development. The reanalyses were also able to reproduce expected seasonal cycles, as well as inter-annual variability related to major climate drivers. This study concludes that both CCI and GlobColour products are suitable for assimilation purposes, and that assimilating ocean colour data is of clear benefit.

The new generation of high spatial resolution satellite (HSR) sensors is suitable for monitoring trees in arid regions because of the distinct and separate objects that trees represent in these environments. The main limitation of modern HSR sensors is the lack of a historical archive that would Otherwise enable meaningful landscape change detection, especially in arid regions where tree population dynamics are naturally very slow. This study uses spatial analysis to gain information regarding the long- and short-term dynamic processes affecting the acacia tree population in Wadi Ktora, in the southern Arava Valley, Israel. The data is extracted from a single HSR aerial photograph composed of three spectral bands in the visible and infrared spectrum (green, red, and near infrared).   A map of individual acacia trees that is extracted from a colour infrared aerial photograph of Wadi Ktora from 2010 enables the examination of spatial distribution patterns for both tree size and foliage health. Tree size distribution is used as an indicator of long-term (decades) hydrologic spatial processes affecting the acacia population. The tree health distribution is used as an indicator for short-term (months to a few years) hydrologic spatial processes, such as the paths of recent flash floods events. Comparing the distributions of tree size and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) enables differentiation between the long-term and short-term processes that brought the population to its present state.   Using spatial statistic grouping, the distribution of the trees in the wadi (ephemeral stream) is divided into three distinct categories: (1) large trees with high NDVI values, (2) large trees with low NDVI values, and (3) small trees with medium NDVI values. Using the resulting classification, we divided the wadi into three sections, each representing a unique combination of long- and short-term hydrologic processes affecting the acacia trees. We suggest that the lack of spatial correlation between tree size and health status is a result of spatio-temporal changes in the water supply. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Attenuation, as represented by vegetation optical depth (VOD), is a potentially useful ecological indicator. The NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission carries significant potential for VOD estimates because of its radio frequency interference mitigation efforts and because the L-band signal penetrates deeper into the vegetation canopy than the higher frequency bands used for many previous VOD retrievals. In this study, we apply the multi-temporal dual-channel retrieval algorithm (MT-DCA) to derive global VOD, soil moisture, and effective scattering albedo estimates from SMAP Backus-Gilbert enhanced brightness temperatures posted on a 9 km grid and with three day revisit time. SMAP VOD values from the MT-DCA follow expected global distributions and are shown to be highly correlated with canopy height. They are also broadly similar in magnitude (though not always in seasonal amplitude) to European Space Agency Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) VOD. The SMOS VOD values are based on angular brightness temperature information while the SMAP measurements are at a constant incidence angle, requiring an alternate approach to VOD retrieval presented in this study.   Globally, albedo values tend to be high over regions with heterogeneous land cover types. The estimated effective scattering albedo values are generally higher than those used in previous soil moisture estimation algorithms and linked to biome classifications. MT-DCA retrievals of soil moisture show only small random differences with soil moisture retrievals from the Baseline SMAP algorithm, which uses a prior estimate of VOD based on land cover and optical data.

We found that the 3D changes occur mostly to low clouds, whose fraction and geometrical depth decrease by approximately 4.2% and 130 m, respectively. These changes result in the increase of the surface shortwave radiation (SSR) by approximately 29.7 W/m(2), which is one magnitude larger than that of anthropogenic CO2.

Wavemill is a squinted along-track interferometric SAR system optimized for ocean surface current vector retrieval that operates at moderate incidence angles (similar to 30 degrees) and is compatible with spaceborne implementation. This paper represents the first comprehensive validation of the current retrieval capabilities of squinted along-track SAR interferometry in support of its development as a future European Space Agency Earth Explorer mission.   Wavemill airborne data were acquired in October 2011 in Liverpool Bay off the west coast of Great Britain in light southerly wind (5.5 m/s) and maximum tidal ebbing flow (0.7 m/s) conditions. Contributions to the measured SAR interferometric phase by surface gravity waves, known as the Wind-wave induced Artefact Surface Velocity (WASV), were removed using our best estimate of wind conditions and the (Mouche et al., 2012) empirical correction derived from Envisat ASAR. Validation of the 1.5 km resolution Wavemill current vectors against independent current measurements from HF radar gives very encouraging results, with Wavemill biases and precisions typically better than 0.05 m/s and 0.1 m/s for surface current speed, and better than 10 degrees and 7 degrees for current direction.   The sensitivity of the current retrieval to the wind vector used to compute the WASV is estimated. A +/- 1 m/s error (bias) in wind speed has minimal impact on the quality of the retrieved currents. In contrast, the choice of wind direction is critical: a bias of +/- 15 degrees in the direction of the wind vector degrades the accuracy of the airborne current speed against the HF radar by about +/- 0.2 m/s. This highlights the need for future instruments to provide calibrated SAR Normalised Radar Cross Section data to support retrieval of wind and current vectors simultaneously.   Comparisons of POLCOMS surface currents with HF radar data indicate that the model reproduces well the overall temporal evolution of the tidal current (correlation of spatial fields against HF radar over two tidal cycles of 0.9) but that the model features a systematic 1-h delay in the timing of the maximum ebbing flow in eastern parts of the domain near the Mersey Bar Light buoy. At the maximum ebb flow, the model underestimates the current speed (bias of -0.2m/s) with respect to the HF radar and Wavemill data at the time of the flights. Both the HF radar and Wavemill data reflect much greater snapshot spatial variability of the ocean surface current field than is present in the model, resulting in poor correlation of instantaneous spatial fields (< 0.5) between POLCOMS and the HF radar data. The Wavemill data reveal high spatial variability of ocean surface currents at fine scales, which are not visible in the 4km resolution HF radar data. Wavemill detects several strong (1-1.5m/s) localized current jets associated with deeper bathymetry channels in shallow waters (< 10 m) that are too narrow or too close to land to be observed by the HF radar. The study confirms the value of synoptic wide-swath maps of high-resolution ocean surface current vectors for coastal applications and to validate and develop high-resolution ocean circulation models.

The main goals of the experiment were to address issues regarding the spatial disaggregation methodologies for improvement of soil moisture products and validation of the in situ measurement upscaling techniques. To support these objectives high-resolution soil moisture maps were acquired with the airborne PALS (Passive Active L-band Sensor) instrument over an area in southeast Arizona that includes the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW), and intensive ground sampling was carried out to augment the permanent in situ instrumentation. The objective of the paper was to establish the correspondence and relationship between the highly heterogeneous spatial distribution of soil moisture on the ground and the coarse resolution radiometer-based soil moisture retrievals of SMAP. The high-resolution mapping conducted with PALS provided the required connection between the in situ measurements and SMAP retrievals. The in situ measurements were used to validate the PALS soil moisture acquired at 1-km resolution. Based on the information from a dense network of rain gauges in the study area, the in situ soil moisture measurements did not capture all the precipitation events accurately. That is, the PALS and SMAP soil moisture estimates responded to precipitation events detected by rain gauges, which were in some cases not detected by the in situ soil moisture sensors. It was also concluded that the spatial distribution of the soil moisture resulted from the relatively small spatial extents of the typical convective storms in this region was not completely captured with the in situ stations. After removing those cases (approximately 10% of the observations) the following metrics were obtained: RMSD (root mean square difference) of 0.016 m(3)/m(3) and correlation of 0.83. The PALS soil moisture was also compared to SMAP and in situ soil moisture at the 36-km scale, which is the SMAP grid size for the standard product. PALS and SMAP soil moistures were found to be very similar owing to the close match of the brightness temperature measurements and the use of a common soil moisture retrieval algorithm. Spatial heterogeneity, which was identified using the high-resolution PALS soilmoisture and the intensive ground sampling, also contributed to differences between the soilmoisture estimates. In general, discrepancies found between the L-band soilmoisture estimates and the 5-cm depth in situ measurements require methodologies to mitigate the impact on their interpretations in soilmoisture validation and algorithm development. Specifically, the metrics computed for the SMAP radiometer-based soil moisture product over WGEW will include errors resulting from rainfall, particularly during the monsoon season when the spatial distribution of soil moisture is especially heterogeneous.

The lack of adequate monitoring networks, especially in developing countries prevents near real-time flood prediction that could help to reduce the loss of lives and economic damages. In the last few years, increasing availability of multi-satellite sensors induced to develop new techniques for retrieving river discharge and especially in supporting discharge nowcasting and forecasting activities. Recently, the potential of radar altimetry to estimate water levels and discharge in ungauged river sites with good accuracy has been demonstrated. However, the considerable benefit derived from this technique is attenuated by the low revisit time of the satellite (10 or 35 days, depending on the satellite mission) causing delays on the predicting operations. For this reason, sensors with a higher temporal resolution such as the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), working in visible/Infra-Red bands, can support flood forecasting.   In this study, we performed the forecast of river discharge by using MODIS and we compared it with the radar altimetry and in-situ data along the Niger-Benue River in Nigeria to develop an operational flood forecasting scheme that could help in rapid emergency response and decision making processes. In the first step, four MODIS products (daily and, 8-day from the TERRA and AQUA satellites) at two gauged sites were used for discharge estimation. Secondly, the capability of remote sensing sensors to forecast discharge a few days (similar to 4 days) in advance at a downstream section using MODIS is analyzed and also compared with the one obtained by the use of radar altimetry by ENVISAT and Jason-2.   The results confirmed the capability of the MODIS data to estimate river discharge with performance indices >0.97 and 0.95 in terms of coefficient of correlation and Nash Sutcliffe efficiency. In particular, RMSE does not exceed 1300 m(3)/s and the fractional RMSE ranges between 0.15 and 0.23. For the forecasting exercise, both altimetry and MODIS provide satisfactory results with positive coefficient of persistence considering 4 days of lead time (>0.34). Although altimetry was found to be more accurate in the forecasting of river discharge (RMSE similar to 350 m(3)/s), the much higher temporal resolution of MODIS guarantees a continuity that is more suitable to address operational activities.

Resulting snow profiles were validated with manual in situ measurements. Mean agreement scores (for a winter) were 0.85-0.91 for traditional grain size, 0.74-0.75 for optical grain size, 0.65-0.80 for density, and 0.71-0.83 for temperature. Grain sizes modeled with SNOW-PACK were compared to effective grain size retrieved from tower-based microwave radiometer measurements.

SNOWPACK snow profiles were used as input to the HUT snow emission model for calculation of TB, which was compared to microwave radiometer measurements. TB calculated with SNOWPACK optical grain size exhibited lower biases (from -12.5 k to 16.2 K, depending on year and frequency) and RMS errors (from 33 K to 18.5 K) than TB calculated with SNOW-PACK traditional grain size (bias from -42.2 K to -9.9 K, RMS error from 12.0 K to 44.7 K). Grain sizes, temperature, and density modeled with SNOWPACK were used as a priori snow data in the retrieval of SWE from tower based microwave radiometer observations.

Other states of protection like the UNESCO world heritage sites, for example, are created for maintaining culturally important places or lifestyles. In the Matobo Hills (Zimbabwe) both states of protection are present, a national park and a world heritage site. In addition, the land outside the National Park belongs to two different systems of ownership, namely \"common\" (i.e. community-owned) and \"not-common\" (privately or governmentally owned) land.   In this paper, we investigated how the state of protection and the ownership affected the land use and land cover. We derived maps using Landsat images from 1989, 1998 and 2014 by supervised classification with Random Forests. To compensate for the lack of ground data we inferred past land use and land cover from recent observations combining photographs, Google Earth images and change detection. We could identify four classes, namely shrub land, forest, patchy vegetation and agricultural area.   The Matobo National Park showed a stable composition of land cover during the study period and the main changes were observable in the surroundings. Outside the national park, forest increased by about 7%. The common lands have changed substantially and their agricultural area decreased.

In this paper, we evaluated biomass estimation from L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) and the improvement of accuracy by adding canopy height information derived from stereo imagery acquired by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Panchromatic Remote Sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM) on-board the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS). Various models for prediction of forest biomass from UAVSAR data were investigated at pixel sizes of 1/4 ha (50 m x 50 m) and 1 ha. The variance inflation factor (VIF) was calculated for each of the explanatory variables in multivariable regression models to assess the multi-collinearity between explanatory variables. In addition, the t- and p-values were used to interpret the significance of the coefficients of each explanatory variables. The R-2, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), bias and Akaike information criterion (AIC), and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and bootstrapping were used to validate models. At 1/4-ha scale, the R-2 and RMSE of biomass estimation from a model using a single track of polarimetric UAVSAR data were 0.59 and 52.08 Mg/ha. With canopy height from PRISM as additional independent variable, R-2 increased to 0.76 and RMSE decreased to 39.74 Mg/ha (28.24%). At 1-ha scale, the RMSE of biomass estimation based on UAVSAR data of a single track was 39.42 Mg/ha with a R-2 of 0.77. With the canopy height from PRISM, R-2 increased to 0.86 and RMSE decreased to 29.47 Mg/ha (20.18%). The models using UAVSAR data alone underestimated biomass at levels above similar to 150 Mg/ha showing the saturation phenomenon. Adding canopy height from PRISM stereo imagery significantly improved the biomass estimation and elevated the saturation level in estimating biomass. Combined use of UAVSAR data acquired from opposite directions (odd and even tracks) slightly improved the biomass estimation. Combined use of UAVSAR data acquired from opposite directions (odd and even tracks) slightly improved the biomass estimation at 1/4-ha scale, R-2 increased from 0.59 to 0.66 and RMSE reduced from 52.08 to 48.57 Mg/ha. Averaging multiple acquisitions of UAVSAR data from the same look azimuth direction did not improve biomass estimation. A biomass map derived from NASA\'s LVIS (Laser Vegetation Imaging System) waveform data was used as a reference for evaluation of the biomass maps from these models. The study has also shown that the errors decreased when deciduous, evergreen, and mixed forests were modeled separately but the improvement was not significant.

In this study, we used a multilinear regression approach to retrieve SM from SMAP data to create a global dataset of SM, which is consistent with SM data retrieved from SMOS. This was achieved by calibrating coefficients of the regression model using the CATDS (Centre Aval de Traitement des Donnees) SMOS Level 3 SM and the horizontally and vertically polarized brightness temperatures (TB) at 40 degrees incidence angle, over the 2013-2014 period. Next, this model was applied to SMAP L3 TB data from Apr 2015 to Jul 2016. The retrieved SM from SMAP (referred to here as SMAP_Reg) was compared to: (i) the operational SMAP L3 SM (SMAP_SCA), retrieved using the baseline Single Channel retrieval Algorithm (SCA); and (ii) the operational SMOSL3 SM, derived from the multiangular inversion of the L-MEB model (L-MEB algorithm) (SMOSL3). This inter-comparison was made against in situ soil moisture measurements from >400 sites spread over the globe, which are used here as a reference soil moisture dataset. The in situ observations were obtained from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN; https://ismn.geo.tuwien.ac.at/) in North of America (PBO_H2O, SCAN, SNOTEL, iRON, and USCRN), in Australia (Oznet), Africa (DAHRA), and in Europe (REMEDHUS, SMOSMANIA, FMI, and RSMN). The agreement was analyzed in terms of four classical statistical criteria: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Bias, Unbiased RMSE (UnbRMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). Results of the comparison of these various products with in situ observations show that the performance of both SMAP products i.e. SMAP_SCA and SMAP_Reg is similar and marginally better to that of the SMOSL3 product particularly over the PBO_H2O, SCAN, and USCRN sites. However, SMOSL3 SM was closer to the in situ observations over the DAHRA and Oznet sites. We found that the correlation between all three datasets and in situ measurements is best (R > 0.80) over the Oznet sites and worst (R = 0.58) over the SNOTEL sites for SMAP_SCA and over the DAHRA and SMOSMANIA sites (R = 0.51 and R = 0.45 for SMAP_Reg and SMOSL3, respectively). The Bias values showed that all products are generally dry, except over RSMN, DAHRA, and Oznet (and FMI for SMAP_SCA). Finally, our analysis provided interesting insights that can be useful to improve the consistency between SMAP and SMOS datasets. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The prediction of crop output requires collecting accurate crop data throughout the growing season, in locations with a wide range of climatic conditions. Repeat observations from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) have been shown to be a reliable way of gathering frequent crop measurements, even in perpetually cloudy regions.   In this work, repeat coverage of an area in California\'s San Joaquin Valley, with images taken by NASA\'s L-band Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) system approximately once a month during 2010 and 2012, was used to examine a time-history of backscatter signatures and polarimetric H/A/alpha (Entropy, Anisotropy, and Polarization angle) decomposition values of alfalfa, corn, and winter wheat with the objective of improving classification of individual crops. Distinguishable signatures were observed for all three crops. The signature was dominated by the growth stage and physical structure of the crops during the mature part of the growing season, and by weather events, planting practices, and harvesting procedures during other parts of the year. These data support previous findings that multiple images throughout the year capture the full growth pattern, allowing for more accurate identification of agricultural crops than what can be determined by a single image. The overall accuracies for this time-series classification were 75% using HV-polarized backscatter, 79% using the alpha decomposition, and 83% using the entropy decomposition, which were the three polarizations or decompositions with greatest separability between crops. It is shown that the full-year time series of images builds a more comprehensive model for crop backscatter than previous works. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The importance of discharge observation has increased due to its potential extreme variation resulting from the projected climate change and stronger variability of precipitation and temperature in some large basins. However, inherent difficulties in ground-based observations and decreasing number of gauge stations hinder accurate measurement of global river discharge and its spatio-temporal variations. Various remote sensing methods have been examined as alternatives, however, they require ground measurements to convert their proxy measurements into the actual river discharge. In this study, we estimate the discharge at the Obidos station and the mouth of the Amazon basin using the water storage variations derived from GRACE gravity data without relying on any auxiliary ground observations. We extract the water mass signal along the main stem of the river by applying the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) for water storage variations over the basin. The relative water storage variations along the main stem derived from the EOF decomposition are highly correlated with in-situ discharge at the Obidos. However, in high water season, the GRACE-based discharge is estimated larger than the in-situ observations, and the difference is particularly significant during the 2009 extreme flood season. We argue that the in-situ river discharge in 2009 was underestimated due to the missed water volume for the flow detouring around the Obidos gauge station during the high-flow event. Net river discharge of the Amazon Basin to Atlantic Ocean is also estimated, and its annual discharge is about 23% larger than that of the Obidos. In particular, 2009 river discharge to Atlantic Oceans is estimated as 1050 Gton. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Early expeditions produced maps using ground or ship-based observations followed later by vertical and/or oblique aerial photography from aircraft. In the modern era, extensive digital satellite imagery is available which has also been supplemented by the resurrection and scanning of some historic U.S., now \'declassified\', film-based satellite images. Much of the MGT became detached and drifted away following the collision by the B-9B iceberg in February 2010 and a similar sequence, or extension-detachment cycle, must have occurred some-time after Mawson\'s 1911-1914 observations. All the available information on the position, shape or appearance of the MGT has been re-examined in an attempt to comprehensively study its past, present and possible future motion. Feature tracking cross correlation methods have been applied for suitably detailed image pairs to accurately measure the MGT advance velocity. The derived mean rate for 1947-2010 is 1180 +/- 14 m y(-1) with an accompanying ice-front loss rate of similar to 190 m y(-1). A simple model for the MGT exhibits a similar to 73 year quasi-periodic cycle of rebirth, growth and demise which will affect the volume of bottom water produced in the nearby polynya. Some evidence for this cyclic oceanographic change has recently been reported from regional sediment data. Somewhat speculatively, the model suggests a date of similar to 1937 for the previous MGT break-off and around or before similar to 2083 for the next. With the MGT being primed to brealc-off every similar to 73 years, the precise date being governed by unpredictable external events such as collisions by large icebergs, such cycles have probably occurred for many thousands of years.

Values of L-W from marine regions characterized by oligotrophic/mesotrophic waters and maritime aerosols, high environmental stability and spatial homogeneity, low cloudiness and absence of any source of land contamination, are essential to determine g-factors applicable to the creation of Climate Data Records (CDRs) from multiple ocean color missions. Accounting for the location of existing and potential new SVC fixed sites, marine regions satisfying SVC requirements for the generation of CDRs have been identified through the analysis of satellite data from recent ocean color missions.

The objective of this work is to estimate the surface residence time of the oil slick and to determine the importance of wind and surface currents on the trajectory and fate of the released oil. Oil slicks released from natural hydrocarbon seeps located in Green Canyon 600 lease block and its surrounding region in the Gulf of Mexico were analyzed. A Texture Classifying Neural Network Algorithm was used to delineate georectified polygons for oil slicks from 41 synthetic aperture radar images. Trajectories of the oil slicks were investigated by employing a Lagrangian particle-tracking surface oil drift model. A set of numerical simulations was performed by increasing hindcast interval in reverse time order from the image collection time in order to obtain the closest resemblance between the simulated oil pathways and the length and shape of the oil slicks observed in synthetic aperture radar images. The average surface residence-time predicted from the hindcast modeling was 6.4 h (+/- 5.7 h). Analysis of a linear regression model, including observed oil slick lengths and variables of wind, surface current, and their relative direction, indicated a statistically significant negative effect of wind speed on the surface oil drift. Higher wind speed (>7 m s(-1)) reduced length of the oil slicks. When wind and surface currents were driving forces of the surface oil drift model, a good agreement between simulated trajectories and subsequent satellite observations (R-2 = 0.9) suggested that a wind scaling coefficient of 0.035 and a wind deflection angle of 20 to the right of the wind direction were acceptable approximations for modeling wind effects in this study. Results from the numerical experimentation were supported by in situ observations conducted by a wind-powered autonomous surface vehicle (SailDrone). Results indicated that the surface currents are, indeed, responsible for stretching oil slicks and that surface winds are largely responsible for the disappearance of the oil slicks from the sea surface. Under conditions of low wind and strong current, natural seeps can produce oil slicks that are longer than 20 km and persist for up to 48 h.

Changes in satellite vegetation indices (VIs) over time can be used to understand historical changes to vegetation in the PKNP provided images are calibrated to surface reflectance. Relative radiometric normalization (RRN) is one method to achieve this while the Landsat Climate Data Record (CDR) surface reflectance product provides an alternative. The objectives of this study are to: (1) determine the magnitude of differences between VIs produced using the CDR product and RRN images; (2) determine whether any differences in the VIs produced using the RRN and CDR images will impact on the areal extent of change in vegetation detected; and (3) determine the spatial and temporal extent of historical changes to vegetation in the PKNP. The choice of RRN or CDR had subtle but important impacts on the areal extent of detected changes to vegetation. The RRN images reduced inter-annual variations in vegetation response. The EVI was more resilient to residual atmospheric effects in the RRN and CDR images. Two relatively large regions of the PKNP were found to be relatively undisturbed. Recent changes to vegetation were found in areas that were previously undisturbed, and the proportion of the PKNP where changes were detected was increasing. Future work will include images from other sensors to reduce spatial and temporal gaps, and improve the temporal range of the methodology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Coherent and incoherent crop height estimation methods are discussed for the first time with a unique TanDEM-X dataset acquired over rice cultivation areas. Indeed, with its polarimetric and interferometric capabilities, the TanDEM-X mission enables the tracking of crop height through interferometric SAR (InSAR), polarimetric interferometric SAR (PoIInSAR) and the inversion of radiative transfer-based backscattering model. The paper evaluates the three aforementioned techniques simultaneously with a data set acquired in September 2014 and 2015 over rice fields in Turkey during their reproductive stage. The assessment of the absolute height accuracy and the limitations of the approaches are provided. In-situ measurements conducted in the same cultivation periods are used for validation purposes. The PoIInSAR and morphological backscattering model results showed better performance with low RMSEs (12 and 13 cm) compared to the differential InSAR result having RMSE of 18 cm.   The spatial baseline, i.e. the distance between satellites, is a key parameter for coherent methods such as InSAR and PoIInSAR. Its effect on the absolute height accuracy is discussed using TanDEM-X pairs separated by a baseline of 101.7m and 932m. Although the InSAR based approach is demonstrated to provide sufficient crop height accuracy, the availability of a precise vegetation-free digital elevation model and a structurally dense crop are basic requirements for achieving high accuracy. The PoIInSAR approach provides reliable crop height estimation if the spatial baseline is large enough for the inversion. The impact of increasing spatial baseline on the absolute accuracy of the crop height estimation is evident for both methods. However, PoIInSAR is more cost-efficient, e.g. there is no need for phase unwrapping and any external vegetation free surface elevation data. Instead, the usage of radiative transfer based backscattering models provides not only crop height but also other biophysical properties of the crops with consistent accuracy. The efficient retrieval of crop height with backscattering model is achieved by metamodelling, which makes the computational cost of backscattering inversion comparable to the ones of the coherent methods. However, effectiveness depends on not only the backscattering model, but also the integration of agronomic crop growth rules. Motivated by these results, a combination of backscattering and PoIInSAR inversion models would provide a successful method of future precision farming studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, it is recognized that measurements that include the polarimetric characteristics of light provide more intrinsic information about particulate scattering. To take advantage of this, we used vector radiative transfer (VRT) simulations and developed an analytical relationship to retrieve the macro and micro-physical properties of the oceanic hydrosols. Specifically, we investigated the relationship between the observed degree of linear polarization (DoLP) and the ratio of attenuation to-absorption coefficients (c/a) in water, from which the scattering coefficient can be readily computed (b = c - a), after retrieving a. This relationship was parameterized for various scattering geometries, including sensor zenith/azimuth angles relative to the Sun\'s principal plane, and for varying Sun zenith angles. An inversion method was also developed for the retrieval of the microphysical properties of hydrosols, such as the bulk refractive index and the particle size distribution. The DoLP vs c/a relationship was tested and validated against in-situ measurements of underwater light polarization obtained by a custom-built polarimeter and measurements of the coefficients a and c, obtained using an in-water WET Labs ac-s instrument package. These measurements confirmed the validity of the approach, with retrievals of attenuation coefficients showing a high coefficient of determination depending on the wavelength. We also performed a sensitivity analysis of the DoLP at the Top of Atmosphere (TOA) over coastal waters showing the possibility of polarimetric remote sensing application for ocean color.

Spatially heterogeneous melt patterns caused by the development and evolution of ice cliffs and supraglacial pond systems result in substantial mass losses over time. However, mechanisms controlling the formation and survival of cliffs and ponds remain largely unknown. To study the distribution and characteristics of these surface features we deploy an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) over a stretch of the debris-covered Langtang Glacier, Nepal. Acquired images are processed into high-resolution orthomosaics and elevation models with the Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry algorithm. Ice cliffs and ponds are classified using object-based image analysis (OBIA) and their morphology and spatial distribution are analysed and evaluated using object, pixel and point cloud approaches. Results show that ice cliffs are predominantly north-facing, and larger ice cliffs are generally coupled with supraglacial ponds, which may affect their evolution considerably. The spatial distribution of ice cliffs indicates that they are more likely to form in areas where high strain rates are expected. The spatial configuration of ponds over the entire tongue reveals high pond density near confluences, possibly due to closure of conduits via transverse compression. We conclude that the combination of OBIA and UAV imagery is a valuable tool in the semi-automatic and objective analysis of surface features on debris-covered glaciers. The technique may also have potential for upscaling to the use of spaceborne imagery, and the use of UAV-derived point clouds to analyse ice cliff undercuts is promising. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

To date, most spectroscopic studies have utilized data from the Visible Short Wave Infrared spectrum (VSWIR) or, occasionally, the Thermal Infrared spectrum (TIR), but not in combination. This study focuses on VSWIR and TIR synergy to evaluate the ability to predict leaf level cellulose, lignin, leaf mass per area (LMA), nitrogen, and water content across seasons. We used fresh leaves from sixteen common California shrub and tree species collected in the 2013 spring, summer, and fall seasons. The 284 samples exhibited a wide range of leaf traits as determined by standard analytical procedures: 4.2-27.3% for cellulose, 2.6-22.5% for lignin, 34.7-388.9 g/m(2) for LMA, 0.45-3.81% for nitrogen, and 20.2-76.9% for water content. For each leaf trait, partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were fit using different portions of the spectrum: VSWIR (0.35-2.5 mu m), TIR (2.5-15.4 mu m), and Full spectrum (0.35-15.4 mu m). We also fit PLSR models using spectra resampled to simulate three airborne sensors: the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS; 0.4-2.5 mu m), the Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES; 7.5-12 mu m), and the Hyperspectral InfraRed Imager (HyspIRl; 0.4-12 mu m). The majority of best performing models used the Full spectrum, demonstrating the value of combining TIR and VSWIR spectra for leaf trait prediction. Sensor simulated PLSR models created with the entire data set yielded validation R-2 and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) values as follows: R-2 = 0.70 and RMSEP = 13.1% for cellulose, R-2 = 0.50 and RMSEP = 17.7% for lignin, R-2 = 0.56 and RMSEP = 18.3% for LMA, R-2 = 0.56 and RMSEP = 18.1% for nitrogen, and R-2 = 0.89 and RMSEP = 5.7% for water content. General models successfully captured the variability among all seasons and leaf forms for cellulose and water content, while the other leaf traits were better modeled with season or leaf form -specific models. This study successfully captured the large seasonal and geographical variation in leaf traits across California\'s diverse ecosystems, supporting the possibility of using HyspIRl\'s imagery for global mapping efforts of these traits.

These systems are receiving more attention with rising air temperature, prolonged drought, and where groundwater pumping captures natural groundwater discharge for anthropogenic use. Phreatophyte shrublands, meadows, and riparian areas are GDEs that provide critical habitat for many sensitive species, especially in arid and semi-arid environments. While GDEs are vital for ecosystem services and function, their long-term (i.e. similar to 30 years) spatial and temporal variability is poorly understood with respect to local and regional scale climate, groundwater, and rangeland management. In this work, we compute time series of NDVI derived from sensors of the Landsat TM, ETM +, and OLI lineage for assessing GDEs in a variety of land and water management contexts. Changes in vegetation vigor based on climate, groundwater availability, and land management in arid landscapes are detectable with Landsat. However, the effective quantification of these ecosystem changes can be undermined if changes in spectral bandwidths between different Landsat sensors introduce biases in derived vegetation indices, and if climate, and land and water management histories are not well understood. The objective of this work is to 1) use the Landsat 8 under-fly dataset to quantify differences in spectral reflectance and NDVI between Landsat 7 ETM + and Landsat 8 OLI for a range of vegetation communities in arid and semiarid regions of the southwestern United States, and 2) demonstrate the value of 30-year historical vegetation index and climate datasets for assessing GDEs. Specific study areas were chosen to represent a range of GDEs and environmental conditions important for three scenarios: baseline monitoring of vegetation and climate, riparian restoration, and groundwater level changes. Google\'s Earth Engine cloud computing and environmental monitoring platform is used to rapidly access and analyze the Landsat archive along with downscaled North American Land Data Assimilation System gridded meteorological data, which are used for both atmospheric correction and correlation analysis. Results from the cross-sensor comparison indicate a benefit from the application of a consistent atmospheric correction method, and that NDVI derived from Landsat 7 and 8 are very similar within the study area. Results from continuous Landsat time series analysis clearly illustrate that there are strong correlations between changes in vegetation vigor, precipitation, evaporative demand, depth to groundwater, and riparian restoration. Trends in summer NDVI associated with riparian restoration and groundwater level changes were found to be statistically significant, and interannual summer NDVI was found to be moderately correlated to interannual water-year precipitation for baseline study sites. Results clearly highlight the complementary relationship between water-year PPT, NDVI, and evaporative demand, and are consistent with regional vegetation index and complementary relationship studies. This work is supporting land and water managers for evaluation of GDEs with respect to climate, groundwater, and resource management. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This process is currently overlooked by standard operational ocean colour algorithms used to retrieve information about both the phytoplankton standing stock and production. Here, we describe the photoacclimation effect on the phytoplankton seasonal cycle through the chlorophyll to carbon ratio (Chl:C) over the Mediterranean Sea, using SeaWiFS (1998-2007) monthly data. Chlorophyll was calculated through a regionalized empirical algorithm and Carbon was estimated from the particle backscattering, after subtraction of the non-algal contribution (b(bpNAP)). Historically, b(bpNAP) has been neglected or assumed constant, and only recently its space-time variability started to be taken into account. Here, bootstrapping simulations are used to compute the monthly b(bpNAP)s over a former bio-regionalization map of the Mediterranean Sea, all highlighting significant space-time variability. Resulting Chl:C varies within a factor of three, demonstrating the important role that photoacclimation plays at seasonal and basin scales. Lowest Chl:C values (similar to 0.0013) are observed during summer; this is due to the combined effect of high irradiation, shallow mixing and low nutrient concentration. Maximum values (similar to 0.031) are observed in winter and spring dominated by both low solar radiation, deeper mixing and high nutrient availability. It emerges that a better view of the phytoplankton space and time variability can be achieved through the joint use of Chl and C. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Amongst various contributing elements (e.g., instrument calibration, atmospheric correction, inversion algorithms) in the uncertainty of an OC observation, less attention has been paid to uncertainties associated with spatial sampling. In this paper, we simulate MODIS (aboard both Aqua and Terra) and VIIRS OC products using 30 m resolution OC products derived from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard Landsat-8, to examine impacts of spatial sampling on both cross-sensor product intercomparisons and in-situ validations of R-rs products in coastal waters. Various OLI OC products representing different productivity levels and in-water spatial features were scanned for one full orbital-repeat cycle of each ocean color satellite. While some view-angle dependent differences in simulated Aqua-MODIS and VIIRS were observed, the average uncertainties (absolute) in product intercomparisons (due to differences in spatial sampling) at regional scales are found to be 1.8%, 1.9%, 2.4%, 4.3%, 2.7%, 1.8%, and 4% for the R-rs(443), R-rs(482), R-rs(561), R-rs(655), Chla, K-d (482), and b(bp)(655) products, respectively. It is also found that, depending on in-water spatial variability and the sensor\'s footprint size, the errors for an in-situ validation station in coastal areas can reach as high as +/- 18%. We conclude that a) expected biases induced by the spatial sampling in product intercomparisons are mitigated when products are averaged over at least 7 km x 7 km areas, b) VIIRS observations, with improved consistency in cross-track spatial sampling, yield more precise calibration/validation statistics than that of MODIS, and c) use of a single pixel centered on in situ coastal stations provides an optimal sampling size for validation efforts. These findings will have implications for enhancing our understanding of uncertainties in ocean color retrievals and for planning of future ocean color missions and the associated calibration/validation exercises.

Lithological mapping using visible and shortwave infrared hyperspectral data is well developed and established processing chains are available, however there is a paucity of such methodologies for hyperspectral thermal infrared data. Here we present a new fully automated processing chain for deriving lithological maps from hyperspectral thermal infrared data and test its applicability using the first ever airborne hyperspectral thermal data collected in the Antarctic. A combined airborne hyperspectral survey, targeted geological field mapping campaign and detailed mineralogical and geochemical datasets are applied to small test site in West Antarctica where the geological relationships are representative of continental margin arcs. The challenging environmental conditions and cold temperatures in the Antarctic meant that the data have a significantly lower signal to noise ratio than is usually attained from airborne hyperspectral sensors. We applied preprocessing techniques to improve the signal to noise ratio and convert the radiance images to ground leaving emissivity. Following preprocessing we developed and applied a fully automated processing chain to the hyperspectral imagery, which consists of the following six steps: (1) superpixel segmentation, (2) determine the number of endmembers, (3) extract endmembers from superpixels, (4) apply fully constrained linear unmixing, (5) generate a predictive classification map, and (6) automatically label the predictive classes to generate a lithological map. The results show that the image processing chain was successful, despite the low signal to noise ratio of the imagery; reconstruction of the hyperspectral image from the endmembers and their fractional abundances yielded a root mean square error of 0.58%. The results are encouraging with the thermal imagery allowing clear distinction between granitoid types. However, the distinction of fine grained, intermediate composition dykes is not possible due to the close geochemical similarity with the country rock. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Our analysis indicated that 29.4% and 2.9% of the land area of Canada and Alaska showed statistically significant positive (greening) and negative (browning) trends respectively, at significance level p < 0.01, after burned forest areas were masked out. The area with greening trend dominated over that with browning trend for all land cover types. The greening occurred primarily in the tundra of western Alaska, along the north coast of Canada and in northeastern Canada; the most intensive and extensive greening occurred in Quebec and Labrador. The browning occurred mostly in the boreal forests of eastern Alaska. The Landsat-based greenness trend is broadly similar to the 8-km GIMMS AVHRR-based trend for all vegetation zones. However, for tundra, the Landsat data indicated much less extensive greening in Alaska North Slope and much more extensive greening in Quebec and Labrador, and substantially less extensive browning trend in the boreal forests that were free of fire disturbances. These differences call for further validation of the Landsat reflectance and the AVHRR NDVI datasets. Correlation study with local environmental factors, such as topography, glacial history and soil condition, will be needed to understand the heterogeneous greenness change at the Landsat scale.

The data processing is applied twice: (i) first, globally at the whole image and, (ii) second, at the significant subsets identified by global analysis, in order to refine the previously obtained categorization. Object oriented approaches are usually based on two main steps: i) first the segmentation, ii) then the classification. Herein, we first performed the unsupervised classification step and, then, the segmentation. This choice is given by the specificity of archaeological issue, in particular: (i) the subtle features/targets to be identified are partially or totally unknown and characterized by a very small spectral separability from the background, and therefore (ii) the discrimination between archaeological class and substrates likely suffers significant confusion. To cope with these issues, the first step is based on an unsupervised classification, which provides a first \'rough\' categorization of pixels; the second step, based on the segmentation, enables us to extract the geometric shape, and, in turn, to only categorize as archaeological class those pixels belonging to geometrically (rectangular and linear) shaped clusters. Outputs from this classification identify rectangular and linear features of archaeological interest whose size suggested that they may be a farm and some sectors of an aqueduct, respectively. Results from satellite based analysis were successfully evaluated by georadar and geomagnetic prospection along with field survey. From georadar and geomagnetic prospection we were able i) to confirm the presence of buried remains and ii) to detail and characterize these archaeological features at the subsoil level as well as to define the local stratigraphy. From field survey we dated the detected buried remains to a period spanning from Imperial Roman to early Byzantine historical times. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The comparison methodology is first established over the REMEDHUS (Red de Estaciones de MEDicion de la Humedad def Suelo) soil moisture measurement network, a 30 by 40 km catchment located in the central part of the Duero basin, then extended to the whole Iberian Peninsula (IP). The temporal correlation between the in-situ, remotely sensed and modelled SSM are satisfactory (r>0.8). The correlation between remotely sensed and modelled SSM also holds when computed over the IP. Still, by using spectral analysis techniques, important disagreements in the effective inertia of the corresponding moisture reservoir are found. This is reflected in the spatial correlation over the IP between SMOS and ORCHIDEE SSM estimates, which is poor (p similar to 0.3). A single value decomposition (SVD) analysis of rainfall and SSM shows that the co-varying patterns of these variables are in reasonable agreement between both products. Moreover the first three SVD soil moisture patterns explain over 80% of the SSM variance simulated by the model while the explained fraction is only 52% of the remotely sensed values. These results suggest that the rainfall-driven soil moisture variability may not account for the poor spatial correlation between SMOS and ORCHIDEE products. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The original contributions of this study include the following: (1) The wavelet method was applied to complement the GLA14 product to identify the ground peak and the top-canopy peak. We found that it was useful for dealing with waveforms with low reconstruction accuracy. (2) GLAS data from the leafless season were not used for non evergreen forest because the height retrieval results exhibited underestimation and strong variations. (3) The an isotropic factor (ANIF), an indicator related to surface structure, was included as an ancillary variable for the first time and was determined to be important for height modeling in the Asian and North American regions. (4) The balanced random forest (BRF) algorithm was applied to register GLAS mean forest canopy height to a 500 m grid considering the small proportion of extreme height classes (tall and short trees), and it achieved good performance in terms of modeling accuracy (RMSE = 2.75 to 4.45 m) and preserving data variation.   An inter-comparison among three global forest height maps [the present study, Lefsky (2010), and Simard et al. (2011)] was implemented in a pixel-by-pixel manner. High agreement (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 4.49 m) was determined between the present study and Simard et al., whereas the result from Lefsky was notably different from the other two results (R-2 = 0.14, RMSE = 8.92 m, compared with the present study; R-2 = 0.11, RMSE 11.19 m, compared with Simard et al.). Large disparities were generally associated with evergreen broadleaf forests in South America, deciduous needleleaf forests in Europe and Russian North Asia, and evergreen needleleaf forests on the West Coast of North America. Differences in the height metric were a main factor affecting the disparities among the three results. Validation against field survey data acquired from the Distributed Active Archive Center indicated the accuracy of our mean forest canopy height map (R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 4.68 m, n = 59).

Savanna ecosystems are significant components of the global C cycle, covering about one fifth of the global land mass, but they have received less attention in C monitoring protocols. Our goal was to estimate C storage across a broad savanna ecosystem using field surveys and freely available satellite images. We first mapped tree canopies at 2.5 m resolution with a spatial subset of high resolution panchromatic images to then predict regional wall-to-wall tree percent cover using 30-m Landsat imagery and the Random Forests algorithms. We found that a model with summer and winter spectral indices from Landsat, climate and topography performed best. Using a linear relationship between C and % tree cover, we then predicted tree C stocks across the gradient of tree cover, explaining 87% of the variability. The spatially explicit validation of the tree C model with field-measured C-stocks revealed an RMSE of 8.2 tC/ha which represented similar to 30% of the mean C stock for areas with tree cover, comparable with studies based on more advanced remote sensing methods, such as LiDAR and RADAR. Sample spatial distribution highly affected the performance of the RF models in predicting tree cover, raising concerns regarding the predictive capabilities of the model in areas for which training data is not present. The 50,000 km(2) has similar to 41 Tg C, which could be released to the atmosphere if agricultural pressure intensifies in this semiarid savanna. In this study, we demonstrated the benefit of using high resolution imagery for regional tree cover and C analysis, increasing available training data when there is paucity of field data.

This article evaluates the spatial and spectral requirements for quick and accurate detection of LW. Spectral data from healthy (H), Phytophthora root rot (PPR) and LW leaves were analyzed using ANOVA and two neural networks, multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF). The most effective wavelengths were identified and the filters were updated to a MCA-6 Tetracam camera (580-10 nm, 650-10 nm, 740-10 nm, 750-10 nm, 760-10 nm and 850-40 nm). Then, the MCA camera was used to take multispectral aerial images from a helicopter at three altitudes (180,250 and 300 m) in an avocado field with trees at different stages of LW development, early, intermediate and late. The analyses were conducted based upon 2-class and 4-class systems. The 2-class system was designed to differentiate H and LW trees sufficient to identify trees for removal and the 4-class system was used to differentiate H plants and the three stages of LW development. Aerial image analysis proved the utility of the selected filters for successful identification of LW, even for trees in early stage of disease development with minimal symptoms. The ideal flight altitude of 250 m (153 cm pixel size) was selected according to the M-values and biological parameters such as canopy size and orchard size. The optimum VIs determined by higher M-values were TCARI(760-650) as well as GNDVI, NIR/G, Redge/G and VIGreen using any of the bands related to Redge (740 and 750 nm) or NIR regions (760 and 850 nm). Results reported on the utility of the 2-class and 4-class systems using the above Vls to discriminate LW; however it would be more convenient to develop the algorithm based on the 4-class system (H, early, intermediate and late). The early detection of LW through the methodology proposed in this research could allow farmers to control the movement of this disease through proper management strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

An accurate and robust method to extract water bodies is critical to effectively manage these irreplaceable resources. Conventional methods are frequently limited in terms of the uncertainty related to the coarse resolution and regional reflectance heterogeneity of satellite images. The fuzzy clustering method (FCM) considering local spatial information has a proven capability to compensate for these limitations. Nevertheless, this technique is highly sensitive to immense false signals in original satellite images. Therefore, a systematic surface water extraction method by taking advantage of the complementarity between a water index (WI) and a modified FCM (WIMFCM) was designed in this study to improve the water extraction accuracy, the rationale of which is a background reflectance bias correction. Applications were performed to sixteen test sites varying from coasts to inland waters to comprehensively evaluate the reliability of the WIMFCM using the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. Results showed the WIMFCM improved the accuracy of water extraction in comparison to alternative methods in terms of kappa coefficients (KCs) and total classification errors (TEs). Overall, the mean KC of the WIMFCM was 0.94 and its mean TE was 1139%, compared with original WI (KC = 0.89, TE = 19.84%) and a support vector machine (SVM) method (KC = 0.89, TE = 22.39%). In addition, a seasonal analysis revealed the WIMFCM could maintain consistent reliability throughout the year, demonstrating its potential for accurate dynamic water monitoring associated with seasonal water probability mask. Additional tests using Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data revealed the WIMFCM could be extended to large-scale regions, as well as be used in near-real time surface water body extraction. The findings of this study offer a new method to improve target detection accuracy under reflectance heterogeneous environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Although species composition is an important biodiversity feature, forest structure may be even more relevant for biodiversity assessments because a diversified structure is likely to have more niches, which in turn, host more species and contribute to a more efficient use of available resources. Structure plays a major role as a diversity indicator for management purposes where maps of forest structural diversity are of great utility when planning conservation strategies. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data have been demonstrated to be a reliable and valid source of information for describing the three-dimensional structure of forests. Using ALS metrics as predictor variables, we developed regression models for predicting indices of forest structural diversity for a study area in Molise, Italy. The study had two primary objectives: (i) to estimate indices of structural diversity for the entire study area, and (ii) to construct maps depicting the spatial pattern of the structural diversity indices. Our results demonstrate the utility of simple linear models using ALS data for improving areal estimates of mean structural diversity, and the resulting maps capture the patterns of structural diversity in the study area.

The effects of SMC on the reflectance anisotropy, however, have not received much attention. In this paper the effects of SMC on the anisotropic reflectance behaviour of soils were studied. Biconical reflectance factors (BCRFs) of five different soil samples were acquired at 60 positions covering the full hemisphere in the optical domain at different SMC levels using Wageningen University\'s laboratory goniometer facility. In addition, we inverted the Rahman-Pinty-Verstraete (RPV) model against the measured BCRFs in the principal plane. The results show that the anisotropic reflectance behaviour of soils is strongly influenced by the SMC. Dry soils displayed strong backward scattering behaviour, with a maximum reflectance close to the hotspot position. An increase of the SMC level up to the soil\'s saturation point caused the soils to scatter more in the forward direction and induced a weakening of the hotspot effect. Oversaturated soils displayed a strong sun-glint-like reflectance peak in the anti-solar direction. The RPV model fitted the measured BCRFs in the principal plane up to saturated SMC levels in general with an R-2>0.9. It was not possible to fit the model through observations of oversaturated soils, since the RPV model is not capable of simulating specular reflectance. The asymmetry parameter (0) of the RPV model, which controls the proportion of forward and backward scattering, showed a strong correlation to SMC for individual samples. This correlation remained significant when we considered all samples together with a maximum R-2 of 0.797 at 2123 nm, indicating that reflectance anisotropy contained information on the water content of soils. The amplitude parameter (rho(0)), which is closely related to the reflectance intensity, only had a maximum R-2 of 0.622 at 1921 nm. This indicated that reflectance anisotropy contained more information on SMC than the level of spectral reflectance as such. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Roosjen, P. P.

The objective of this study was to propose and assess the use of a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework that accommodates both residual spatial dependence and non-stationarity of model covariates through the introduction of spatial random effects. We explored this objective using four forest inventory datasets that are part of the North American Carbon Program, each comprising point-referenced measures of above-ground forest biomass and discrete LiDAR. For each dataset, we considered at least five regression model specifications of varying complexity. Models were assessed based on goodness of fit criteria and predictive performance using a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. Results showed that the addition of spatial random effects to the regression model intercept improved fit and predictive performance in the presence of substantial residual spatial dependence. Additionally, in some cases, allowing either some or all regression slope parameters to vary spatially, via the addition of spatial random effects, further improved model fit and predictive performance. In other instances, models showed improved fit but decreased predictive performance indicating over-fitting and underscoring the need for cross-validation to assess predictive ability. The proposed Bayesian modeling framework provided access to pixel-level posterior predictive distributions that were useful for uncertainty mapping, diagnosing spatial extrapolation issues, revealing missing model covariates, and discovering locally significant parameters.

Rather than focusing solely on seasonal changes, the authors consider other harmonic changes using Least Squares Harmonic Estimation (LS-HE), which reduces uncertainty in trends by 5-15%. Tropospheric NO2 observed from OMI demonstrated a downward trend in Austin (-0.06 +/- 0.02 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), Dallas (-0.21 +/- 0.04 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), Fort Worth (-0.16 +/- 0.04 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), Houston (-0.14 +/- 0.05 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), and San Antonio (-0.07 +/- 0.02 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)). These decreasing trends could be attributed to efficient emission control policies. The OMI HCHO observations exhibited both negative and positive annual trends in Austin (+0.09 +/- 0.05 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), Dallas (-0.01 +/- 0.04 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), Fort Worth (-0.04 +/- 0.04 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), Houston (-0.06 +/- 0.05 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), and San Antonio (+0.01 +/- 0.03 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)) mainly resulting from differences in decreases in anthropogenic emissions, the impact of climatic variations and biogenic emissions. The discrepancy between the annual trends of HCHO and NO2 provides strong evidence that all of the cities gradually became more NOx-sensitive. We obtained the slope of HCHO/NO2 ratios (a proxy for chemical condition) from OMI for Austin (0.10 +/- 0.04 yr(-1)), Dallas (0.08 +/- 0.03 yr(-1)), Fort Worth (0.07 +/- 0.03 yr(-1)), Houston (0.06 +/- 0.03 yr(-1)), and San Antonio (0.08 +/- 0.03 yr(-1)) and investigate the 1-2 pm local time surface ozone patterns along with maximum, annual, and minimum trends in relation to changes in their precursors and prevailing chemical conditions. The surface levels of wintertime ozone measured by the CAMS network were seen to increase in Austin (0.90 +/- 0.53 ppbv yr(-1)), Dallas (0.62 +/- 0.53 ppbv yr(-1)), Fort Worth (0.59 +/- 0.40 ppbv yr(-1)), Houston (0.56 +/- 0.55 ppbv yr(-1)), and San Antonio (0.64 +/- 0.54 ppbv yr(-1)) because of the reduction in the amount of ozone quenched through NO titration. Summertime ozone surface mixing ratio trends are mainly governed by NO2 annual trends as Well as climatic influences. We obtained the downward annual trend of the ozone mixing ratio from CAMS observations for Austin (-0.27 +/- 0.17 ppbv yr(-1)), Dallas (-0.41 +/- 0.18 ppbv yr(-1)), Fort Worth (-0.55 +/- 0.18 ppbv yr(-1)), Houston (-0.53 +/- 0.18 ppbv yr(-1)), and San Antonio (-0.03 +/- 0.16 ppbv yr(-1)). The results show that prevailing chemical conditions control the annual trends of surface ozone.   While Austin and San Antonio exhibited similar declines in OMI NO2 levels, a more prevailing NOx-sensitive regime over Austin resulted in its greater sensitivity to NO2 changes. The dominant NOx-saturated regime over Dallas, however, led to its lower sensitivity to high annual downward trends of OMI NO2. To investigate the impact of reductions in ozone precursors on surface ozone, we employ the WRF-Chem regional model to simulate NO2, HCHO, and O-3 levels in September 2013 in two scenarios using National Emissions Inventory 2005 (NEI-2005) and NEI-2011 anthropogenic emissions. The model describes a decrease in ozone levels from the first to second scenario in Dallas (3%) and Forth Worth (0.5%) but an increase in Austin, San Antonio, and Houston (0.7%, 0.8%, and 7%, respectively), which may be attributed to uncertainty in VOC concentrations and overestimation of NO in the NEI-2005 inventory that led to inaccurate HCHO/NO2 ratios. The results indicate that the emission uncertainties should be constrained to better inform emissions control policy based on air quality modeling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study was based on reviews of the literature, together with case studies of airborne and satellite-based data acquired over high-temperature targets. The spatial resolution of MIR radiance measurements is an important consideration in the remote sensing of high-temperature phenomena, due to the presence of materials at different temperatures within the area covered by an image pixel. The HyspIRI MIR channel will provide a spatial resolution of 60 m, which is similar to 40 times finer (in terms of area) than the finest spatial resolution provided by heritage instruments (370 m). This fine spatial resolution will increase the probability that high-temperature targets fill an image pixel and, therefore, the HyspIRI MIR channel will require a saturation temperature 2 to 4 times higher than the saturation limits of heritage instruments. Based on our study, we recommend a saturation temperature of 1200 K (927 degrees C). This recommendation accounts for the high temperatures expected for natural phenomena, expected performance of the MIR channel, and overlap in sensitivity between the MIR and thermal infrared (7.5-12 mu m) HyspIRI channels.

Despite its ecological and economic importance, its biological environment is relatively unexplored. Satellite ocean-colour estimates of chlorophyll concentration (an index of phytoplankton biomass) offer an observational platform to monitor the health of the Red Sea. However, little is known about the optical properties of the region. In this paper, we investigate the optical properties of the Red Sea in the context of satellite ocean-colour estimates of chlorophyll concentration. Making use of a new merged ocean-colour product, from the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative, and in situ data in the region, we test the performance of a series of ocean-colour chlorophyll algorithms. We find that standard algorithms systematically overestimate chlorophyll when compared with the in situ data. To investigate this bias we develop an ocean-colour model for the Red Sea, parameterised to data collected during the Tara Oceans expedition, that estimates remote-sensing reflectance as a function of chlorophyll concentration. We used the Red Sea model to tune the standard chlorophyll algorithms and the overestimation in chlorophyll originally observed was corrected. Results suggest that the overestimation was likely due to an excess of CDOM absorption per unit chlorophyll in the Red Sea when compared with average global conditions. However, we recognise that additional information is required to test the influence of other potential sources of the overestimation, such as aeolian dust, and we discuss uncertainties in the datasets used. We present a series of regional chlorophyll algorithms for the Red Sea, designed for a suite of ocean-colour sensors, that may be used for further testing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

While the current state-of-the-art mostly focuses on the exploitation of optical imagery and airborne LiDAR data, modern SAR sensors have not yet met the interest of the research community in that regard. This paper presents a prototypical processing chain for the reconstruction of individual deciduous trees: First, single-pass multi-baseline InSAR data acquired from multiple aspect angles are used for the generation of a layover- and shadow-free 3D point cloud by tomographic SAR processing. The resulting point cloud is then segmented by unsupervised mean shift clustering, before ellipsoid models are fitted to the points of each cluster. From these 3D ellipsoids the relevant geometrical tree parameters are extracted. Evaluation with respect to a manually derived reference dataset prove that almost 74% of all trees are successfully segmented and reconstructed, thus providing a promising perspective for further research toward individual tree recognition from SAR data.

Unauthorized urban land developments have caused considerable damage to the environment in many developing countries because they are difficult to be controlled using conventional long-term (annual or multi-year) monitoring with optical remote sensing images. This paper presents the results of a novel study that detects land developments monthly using RADARSAT-2 polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PoISAR) data. A sequence of seven RADARSAT-2 PoISAR images acquired at intervals of 24 days was obtained for this study. Land cover classification of each image was performed independently to investigate the ability of RADARSAT-2 PoISAR data in classifying land cover types under the influence of environmental change and vegetation growth. On the basis of the investigation, land cover types that are easily confused with each other were aggregated into the same category to form a new classification system that leads to the categorization of land cover changes induced by land development into types which can be accurately detected by RADARSAT-2 PoISAR images. Wishart maximum likelihood ratio (MLR) was combined with post-classification comparison (PCC) to detect land developments from each pair of successive images based on object-oriented image analysis (OOIA). The combination of Wishart MLR and PCC attempted to detect different change types and decrease the effect of classification errors on the change detection. OOIA was used to reduce the effect of speckle noise in PoISAR images, as well as extract textural and spatial features to support PoISAR image classification. The average detection accuracy and false alarm rate for monthly land development detection were 85.20% and 0.39%, respectively. The errors were mainly caused by the seasonal paddy growth, which resulted in changes that were easily confused with land developments. The results show that land developments can be effectively detected from RADARSAT-2 PoISAR images on a monthly time step. Land development is typically a gradual expansion process. By the time that it is detected using long-term detection methods, the small development may have already been developed into a large site, causing irreversible damage to the environment. Monthly short-term detection of land developments can enable the authorities to locate the sites which just start the development. This can allow the government to prevent unauthorized land developments and stop their resulting damage to the environment at an early stage.

In contrast to other algorithms this algorithm does not use a priori values of the spectral albedo of the sea-ice constituents (such as melt ponds, white ice etc.). Instead, it is based on an analytical solution for the reflection from sea ice surface. The algorithm includes the correction of the sought-for ice and ponds characteristics with the iterative procedure based on the Newton-Raphson method. Also, it accounts for the bi-directional reflection from the ice/snow surface, which is particularly important for Arctic regions where the sun is low. The algorithm includes an original procedure for the atmospheric correction, as well. This algorithm is implemented as computer code called Melt Pond Detector (MPD). The input to the current version of the MPD algorithm is the MERIS Level 1B data, including the radiance coefficients at ten wavelengths and the solar and observation angles (zenith and azimuth). Also, specific parameters describing surface and atmospheric state can be set in a configuration input file. The software output is the map of the melt ponds area fraction and the spectral albedo of sea-ice in HDF5 format. The numerical verification shows that the MPD algorithm provides more accurate results for the light ponds than for the dark ones. The spectral albedo is retrieved with high accuracy for any type of ice and ponds. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This algorithm is capable of predicting Landsat surface reflectance for any desired date. It first excludes cloud, cloud shadow, and snow observations, and then uses the remaining clear observations to estimate time series models for each Landsat pixel. Three time series models (a simple model, advanced model, and full model) are used for estimating surface reflectance for each pixel, and the selection of a time series model is dependent on the number of clear observations available: the more clear observations, the more complex the model will be that is used. For each time series model there are three components (seasonality, trend, and breaks), that are used for modeling intra-annual and inter-annual differences and abrupt surface change. Abrupt surface changes are detected by differencing predicted and observed Landsat observations, and if the difference is larger than twice the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for six consecutive observations, it will be detected as a \"break\" in the time series model. The RMSE values are temporally adjusted to provide better threshold range. For each \"synthetic\" image, a Quality Assessment (QA) Band is provided that contains information on how the time series model was estimated and used for generating the synthetic data. We have applied this approach to six Landsat scenes within the United States. We visually compared the synthetic images with real Landsat images for different kinds of environments and they are similar for all image pairs. We also quantitatively assessed the accuracy of the synthetic data by calculating the RMSE value for all clear Landsat observations. The RMSE values for the three visible bands are the lowest (approximately 0.01), and the Short-wave Infrared (SWIR) bands are slightly higher in magnitude (between 0.01 and 0.02). The Near Infrared (NIR) band has the highest RMSE values (between 0.02 and 0.03). The goal of this paper is to provide Landsat images that are free of cloud, cloud shadow, snow, and Scan Line Corrector (SLC)-off gaps that can be used to derive land cover and bio-physical products.

Monitoring vegetation fractional cover continuously across large areas needs good remote sensing techniques underpinned by high quality field data to calibrate and validate algorithms. Here Landsat and MODIS surface reflectance data together with 1171 field observations across Australia were used to estimate vegetation fractional cover using a linear unmixing technique. The aim was to estimate the fractions of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic vegetation (PV and NPV, respectively) and the remaining fraction of bare soil (BS). Landsat surface reflectance was averaged over a 3 x 3 pixel window representing the field area measured and also \"degraded\" using a 17 x 17 pixel window (similar to 0.26 km(2)) to approximate the coarser MODIS sensor\'s response. These two Landsat surface reflectances were used to calculate a site heterogeneity metric. Data from two MODIS-derived surface reflectance products with a pixel size of similar to 0.25 km(2) were used: (i) the 16-day nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance product (MCD43A4); and (ii) the MODIS 8-day surface reflectance (MODO9A1). Log transforms and band interaction terms were added to account for non-linearities in the spectral mixing. A cross-validation step was also included to select the optimal number of singular values to avoid over-fitting. For each surface reflectance source we investigated the residuals\' correlation with site heterogeneity, soil colour and soil moisture. The best model was obtained when Landsat data for a small region around each observation were used. Root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.112, 0.162 and 0.130 for PV, NPV and BS, respectively, were obtained. As expected, degrading the Landsat data to similar to 0.26 km2 around each site decreased model goodness of fit to RMSE of 0.119, 0.174 and 0.150, respectively, for the three fractions. Using MODIS surface reflectance data gave worse results than the \"degraded\" Landsat surface reflectance, with MODO9A1 performing slightly better than MCD43A4. No strong evidence of soil colour or soil moisture influence on model performance was found, suggesting that the unmixing models are insensitive to soil colour and/or that the soil moisture in the top few millimetres of soil, which influence surface reflectance in optical sensors, is decoupled from the soil moisture in the top layer (Le., a few centimetres) as measured by passive microwave sensors or estimated by models. This study outlines an operational combined Landsat/MODIS product to benefit users with varying requirements of spatial resolution and temporal frequency and latency that could be applied to other regions in the world.

What the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors see on the ocean surface is primarily the variation of the Bragg resonant waves providing signatures of local wind changes and imprints of atmospheric phenomena, and the areas of enhanced wave breaking associated with wave-current interaction for oceanographic processes like currents, fronts and eddies. SAR images contain information about the processes in the marine-atmosphere boundary layer (MABL), in particular when variation of wind speed and direction is significant. Several publications are available in the literature modeling and explaining each phenomenon separately. However, only a few focus on the identification of each phenomenon in an automatic or semi-automatic way. The objective of the present paper is to detect and to classify five atmospheric phenomena in SAR images: low wind areas; katabatic wind, island wakes, atmospheric gravity waves and atmospheric convective cells. An object-based environment was used to identify the phenomena and fuzzy logic used to classify them. Several features extracted for each phenomenon were used for feeding the classifier. The proposed method used 16 SAR images and accuracy was examined in another 16 SAR images using 457 object samples. The method proved to be successful with an overall accuracy of 80% and Kappa index of 0.75. The class of low wind areas negatively affected the overall accuracy due to overlapping feature values with the rest of the categories. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This is achieved through the application of gain-factors, g-factors, to pre-launch absolute radiometric calibration coefficients of the satellite sensor corrected for temporal changes in radiometric sensitivity. The g-factors are determined by the ratio of simulated to measured spectral L-T values where the former are computed using: i. highly accurate in situ Lw reference measurements; and ii. the same atmospheric models and algorithms applied for the atmospheric correction of satellite data. By analyzing basic relations between relative uncertainties of L-w and L-T, and g-factors consistently determined for the same satellite mission using different in situ data sources, this work suggests that the creation of ocean color Climate Data Records (CDRs) should ideally rely on: i. one main long-term in situ calibration system (site and radiometry) established and sustained with the objective to maximize accuracy and precision over time of g-factors and thus minimize possible biases among satellite data products from different missions; and additionally ii. unique (i.e., standardized) atmospheric model and algorithms for atmospheric correction to maximize cross-mission consistency of data products at locations different from that supporting SVC Finally, accounting for results from the study and elements already provided in literature, requirements and recommendations for SVC sites and field radiometric measurements are streamlined.

Hence, total SIP is represented by the sum of the upward and downward emission components. Nevertheless, the downward component of leaf SIF is often not considered despite that downward fluorescence yield (down arrow FY) can amount up to 40% of the total fluorescence yield (FYtot). Downward SIF is mainly emitted in the far-red, since this part of fluoresced light is highly scattered within leaves, unlike red Chl fluorescence, which is mostly reabsorbed. While total FY can be quite different among distinct species, the relative partitioning between upward and downward fluorescence shows more similarities among different leaf types, especially in the far-red. It is shown that bidirectional SIF emission properties in the far-red can be attributed to the scattering properties of the leaf, whereby an equifadal leaf follows a different trend compared to bifacial leaves. This was done by comparing SIF data with simultaneously measured reflectance, transmittance and fluorescence data by means of the FluoWat leaf dip coupled with an ASD hyperspectral spectroradiometer. These results could further improve Chl fluorescence modeling at leaf level, and help to advance the interpretation of SIF at the canopy level.

However, most of the existing algorithms are not capable of distinguishing cyanobacterial blooms and aquatic macrophytes due to their similar spectral characteristics in the red and near infrared (NIR) wavelengths. In this study, we conducted in situ spectral measurements and satellite data analyses for cyanobacterial blooms and aquatic macrophytes to find an effective method to distinguish them using medium-resolution Landsat satellite images. The reflectance spectra were measured for lake waters and cyanobacterial blooms with 13 different chlorophyll-a concentration levels (from 54 to 21,736 mu g L-1) and four types of aquatic macrophytes (two emerged and two floating-leaved macrophytes) in the wavelength range from 350 to 2500 nm. In addition, seven Landsat images were collected for nine lakes in Japan or Indonesia. We calculated several selected indices, i.e., the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), five types of normalized difference water index (NDWI), and the floating algal index (FAI) to find an appropriate index for distinguishing cyanobacterial blooms and aquatic macrophytes.   The results showed that the spectral characteristics of cyanobacterial blooms were significantly different from those of aquatic macrophytes in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region, indicating that the SWIR bands are important for distinguishing cyanobacterial blooms and aquatic macrophytes. The results also showed that the combination of FAI and NDWI4,5 was an effective method for classifying lake areas. We first used the FAI for extracting lake waters, and we then used the NDWI4,5 to classify the remaining areas as cyanobacterial blooms or aquatic macrophytes. The results also showed that the threshold of NDWI4,5 was less sensitive to the effects of both the atmosphere and mixed pixels compared to the other indices. Our application of the FAI threshold of 0.05 and the NDWI4,5 threshold of 0.63 to six lakes in Japan and Indonesia showed that the proposed method could successfully distinguish lake water, cyanobacterial blooms, and aquatic macrophytes.

However, due to the significant seasonality of the lake\'s inundation area, no systematic study has assessed the wetland changes over the past few decades. We addressed this challenge by using four decades of Landsat observations ranging from 1973 to 2013. The images were acquired in the same season to ensure similar phenological and hydrological conditions during each year. Extensive training and validation samples were collected from high-resolution Quickbird imagery to develop a Support Vector Machines (SVM) method for wetland classification of Poyang Lake. To obtain consistent results from different Landsat instruments, an empirical line correction approach was introduced to adjust the sensor-associated differences in band configurations and spectral responses. Significant changes in the major wetland cover types in Poyang Lake were revealed from long-term classification maps. The vegetation coverage of Poyang wetland showed a statistically significant increasing trend during the overall period (15.9 km(2) year(-1)), and the vegetation tended to spread into the lake center in the Nanjishan Wetland National Nature Reserve (NWNNR) in recent years. At the same time, out-of-phase variability was observed for the mudflats since 1984, with a significant shrinking trend of -12.1 km(2) year(-1) (p < 0.05). Although sand coverage experienced a rapid decrease from 1973 to 1990 (from 544.3 km(2) to 62.9 km(2)), it remained at a relative stable low level (<100 km(2)) in the following period. The two national reserves in Poyang Lake shared change patterns similar to those of the entire lake. Although -70% of the long-term changes in the wetland vegetation area appeared to be explained by local temperature, there was rapid increase after 2002 possibly could be due to the impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) in 2003. The large sand area in 1973 was potentially linked to previous human activities in China between the 1950s and the 1970s. The method used in this study could be easily extended to other places in the world to assess the decadal wetland changes, and the information provided in this work is critical for future restoration efforts of the Poyang Lake wetland ecosystem.

The traditional method for assessment of the wind resource for wind energy application is through analysis of wind speed and wind direction observed during one or more years at a meteorological mast equipped with well-calibrated anemometers at several levels. The cost of such measurements is very high and therefore they are only sparsely available. An alternative method is the application of satellite remote sensing. Comparison of wind resource statistics from satellite products is presented and discussed including the uncertainty on the wind resource. The diurnal wind variability is found to be negligible at some location but up to 0.5 m s(-1) at two sites. Synergetic use of observations from multiple satellites in different orbits provides wind observations at six times in the diurnal cycle and increases the number of observations. At Horns Rev M2, FINO1 and Greater Gabbard satellite and in situ collocated samples show differences in mean wind speed of -2%, -1% and 3%, respectively. At Egmond aan Zee the difference is 10%. It is most likely due to scatterometer data sampled further offshore than at the meteorological mast. Comparing energy density with all samples at Horns Rev M2 shows overestimation 7-19% and at FINO1 underestimation 2-5% but no clear conclusion can be drawn as the comparison data are not collocated. At eight new offshore wind farm areas in Denmark, the variability in mean energy density observed by SAR ranges from 347 W m(-2) in Sejerobugten to 514 W m(-2) at Horns Rev 3. The spatial variability in the near-shore areas is much higher than at areas located further offshore. (C) 2014 DTU Wind Energy.

In this study, a novel combination of full-waveform light detection and ranging (lidar) and field techniques for assessing the distribution of aboveground biomass throughout its height and its light blocking properties were investigated. Using new field methods, strong correlations were observed (r > 0.9) between subsamples\' vertical biomass (VB), the distribution of vegetation biomass by height, and vertical obscuration (VO), the measure of the vertical distribution of the ratio of vegetation to airspace, for Spartina alterniflora. Also, it was found that simple metrics derived from the lidar waveforms, such as waveform width, can provide new information to estimate salt marsh vegetation parameters. The strong correlations between field-collected biophysical parameters and metrics derived from lidar data suggest that remote sensing methods can be used to estimate some vegetation biophysical parameters such as plant height and proportion of vegetation area (PVA) using smaller, more targeted field surveys. Future work will be needed to verify the extensibility of the methods to other sites and vegetation types.

Little is known about the structural and functional variation between these floristic units, however, and Landsat and SRTM data lack the spectral and spatial resolution needed to provide this information. Imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) have been used to measure canopy structure and function in a variety of ecosystems, but the ability of these technologies to measure differences between compositionally-distinct but otherwise uniform tropical forest types remains unknown. We combined 16 tree inventories from central Panama with imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR elevation data from the Carnegie Airborne Observatory to test our ability to identify patterns in plant species composition, and to measure the spectral and structural differences between adjacent closed-canopy tropical forest types. We found that variations in spectroscopic imagery and LiDAR data were strong predictors of spatial turnover in plant species composition. We also found that these compositional, chemical, and structural patterns corresponded to underlying geological formations and their geomorphological properties. We conclude that imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR data can be used to interpret patterns identified in lower resolution sensors, to provide new information on forest function and structure, and to identify underlying determinants of these patterns.

The comparison was based on a brightness temperature (T-B) data set acquired since 2010 by the L-band radiometer ELBARA-II over a vineyard field at the Valencia Anchor Station (VAS) site. ELBARA-II, provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) within the scientific program of the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) mission, measures multiangular T-B data at horizontal and vertical polarization for a range of incidence angles (30 degrees-60 degrees). Based on a three year data set (2010-2012), several SM retrieval approaches developed for spaceborne missions including AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS), SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) and SMOS were compared. The approaches include: the Single Channel Algorithm (SCA) for horizontal (SCA-H) and vertical (SCA-V) polarizations, the Dual Channel Algorithm (DCA), the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) and two simplified approaches based on statistical regressions (referred to as \'Mattar\' and \'Saleh\').

The SM retrievals were evaluated against reference SM values estimated from a multiangular 2-Parameter inversion approach. As no in situ SM data was used, the evaluation made here is relative to the use of this specific reference data set. The results obtained with the current base line algorithms developed for SMAP (SCA-H and -V) are in very good agreement with the \'reference\' SM data set derived from the multi-angular observations (R-2 approximate to 0.90, RMSE varying between 0.035 and 0.056 m(3)/m(3) for several retrieval configurations). This result showed that provided the relationship between vegetation optical depth and a remotely-sensed vegetation index can be calibrated, the SCA algorithms can provide results very close to those obtained from multi-angular observations in this study area. The approaches based on statistical regressions provided similar results and the best accuracy was obtained with the \'Saleh\' methods based on either bi-angular or bipolarization observations (R-2 approximate to 0.93, RMSE 0.035 m(3)/m(3)). The LPRM and DCA algorithms were found to be slightly less successful in retrieving the \'reference\' SM time series (R-2 approximate to 0.75, RMSE 0.055 m(3)/m(3)). However, the two above approaches have the great advantage of not requiring any model calibrations previous to the SM retrievals. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

While traditional field mapping techniques, such as towed video and diver surveys, are still commonly employed for generating highly detailed maps of seafloor habitat, acoustic and satellite remote sensing have proven to be efficient alternatives for generating habitat maps. To date remote sensing using satellite imagery has dominated mapping efforts over coral reefs and other tropical ecosystems with fewer studies applied in temperate marine regions where acoustic studies are more common. Few studies exist that have assessed the performance of high resolution satellite imagery in mapping seafloor habitat in temperate regions. This paper compares the efficacy of high resolution satellite imagery (WorldView-2) and a single-beam acoustic ground discrimination system (QTC View V) for mapping the distribution of submerged aquatic vegetation at a site within the Gwaii Haanas National Marine Conservation Area (GHNMCA) off the north coast of British Columbia, Canada. Ground-truth data for training and validation were collected using a towed underwater video camera. Prior to classification the WorldView-2 image (8 bands, 2 m resolution) was processed following orthorectification, atmospheric correction, glint correction, land and optically deep water masking. An acoustic survey was conducted using a 200 kHz echosounder and data were processed and interpolated using QTC IMPACT software. The WorldView-2 imagery performed best in mapping habitat in regions shallower than 3 m, obtaining a total accuracy 75%, where it could identify the distribution of green algae (Ulva spp.), brown algae (Fucus spp.) and eelgrass (Zostera marina). The 200 kHz data were unable to detect the distribution of brown and green algae but were able to map the distribution of eelgrass as well as a subtidal red algae (Chondrocanthus exasperatus) (total accuracy 80%). A final habitat map containing all habitat types present at the study site was produced using the output from both datasets. The study resulted in recommendations for remote mapping of submerged vegetation in temperate coastal area. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The surface microwave effective emissivities used in this study are derived from SSM/I passive microwave observations by removing the contributions of the cloud and atmosphere and then separating out the surface temperature variations using ancillary atmospheric, cloud and surface data. The sensitivity of the effective emissivity to the presence/absence of snow is evaluated for the Northern Hemisphere. The effect of the presence of snow, the variation of land types, and temperature on the emissivities have been examined by observing the temporal and spatial variability of these measurements between 19 and 85 GHz over the Northern Hemisphere. The time-anomaly of differences between effective emissivity at 19 V and 85 V enabled the constant effects of land surface vegetation properties to be removed to isolate the snow signature. The resulting 12-year snow signal combined with skin temperature data can detect the existence of snow cover over the Northern Hemisphere on daily basis. The results of this method compared with the operational NOAA weekly snow cover maps agree at 90% of locations and times. Most of the disagreements could be explained by rapid evolution of snow emissivities associated with freeze-melt-refreeze cydes and precipitation (snowfall), and some of them by the space-time resolution differences of the microwave and operational snow cover determinations. These results compared with the NISE, NOAA IMS, CMC, and MODIS, and snow products agree within 78% to 92%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Given that climate projections for the region suggest widespread conifer mortality is likely to continue into the next century, it is critical to better understand how this climate-induced change in vegetation structure alters ecosystem function (e.g., productivity, biogeochemical cycling, energy partitioning) in PJ woodlands. Data from satellite remote sensing could potentially help to gain some of this understanding. However, relatively little is known about the suitability of satellite remote sensing for monitoring mortality induced structural and functional changes in PJ woodlands, a semi-arid biome characterized by sparse vegetation that complicates remote sensing of vegetation properties. Here we examined the potential role of satellite remote sensing to better understand structural and functional changes that take place in PJ woodlands as they respond to and recover from climate induced mortality events. We used time series medium (30 x 30 m) and high (<= 5 x 5 m) spatial resolution satellite data in concert with eddy covariance-based gross primary productivity (GPP) data collected in a PJ woodland mortality manipulation near Mountainair, NM. Our results showed that both high and medium resolution satellite remote sensing data can provide ecosystem level assessments of overall canopy mortality and subsequent regrowth in these semiarid woodlands. However, high spatial resolution data allowed detecting the disturbance almost a full year earlier and enabled us to describe the spatially heterogeneous patterns of recovery typical for such complex. The ability of satellite remote sensing to be used to provide information about changes in ecosystem function was conditional on the presence of sufficient soil moisture; when soil moisture was present the strength of the linear relationship between GPP and spectral vegetation indices improved at the manipulated site (e.g. for high resolution NDVI data R-2 = 0.13 during drought conditions, R-2 = 0.46 when wet, P < .05) and less so at a nearby control site (R-2 = 0.09 during drought conditions, compared to R-2 = 0.22 during growing conditions, P < .05). Thus, although satellite time series can be used to monitor and improve our understanding of canopy function in both disturbed and undisturbed semi-arid coniferous biomes, combining in situ eddy covariance data with satellite time series demonstrated that the utility of these datasets is highest during periods of peak growing conditions. This study therefore provides a benchmark for understanding how spatial and temporal variation in vegetation structure and function can be best studied as semi-arid coniferous biomes respond to future climate variability.

We investigated the sensitivity of five VIs calculated from spectral reflectance: the photochemical reflectance index (PRI), the canopy chlorophyll index (CCI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and the water index (WI).   During the monitoring period, clear seasonal variations were not found in LUE, the observed Vls or the phenological timing (particularly new leaf flush) of dominant dipterocarp trees. Although leaf phenology tended to correlate with variations in the CCI, the highest correlation coefficient among the relationships between WE and the VIs was observed in PRI (R = 0.341, n = 699). Among the relationships between LUE and meteorological factors, the strongest correlation was found between LUE and vapor pressure deficit (VPD; R = -0580). These results suggest that unseasonal variation in LUE would be more affected by water conditions than leaf phenology or green leaf mass, and that the PRI has lower sensitivity for direct estimation of LUE compared to VPD in this evergreen tropical rainforest.   To improve the accuracy in estimating LUE, we examined the potential of combinational use of Vls and meteorological factors. Variable selection by stepwise multiple regression showed that the best variable combination for LUE estimation was the PR! and VPD (R = 0.612). The relative root mean square error (rRMSE) in the simple regression models using PR!, VPD and PRI x VPD, and the multiple regression model using PR! and VPD, was 22.5%, 19.4%, 19.0% and 18.7%, respectively. Based on these results, we concluded that (1) the estimation method solely based on the PRI as in the case of other temperate deciduous forests is not suitable in the tropical evergreen rainforest, and (2) the combinational use of the PRI and VPD offers one of the better models for estimating LUE in tropical evergreen rainforests.

Detecting change in the NDVI, however, can be confounded by time-dependent patterns (e.g., seasonal effects) and variation associated with climate factors. In the present study we provide a method to address these confounding factors by evaluating the NDVI change using autoregression techniques that compare results from univariate (i.e., the NDVI vs. time) and multivariate analyses (the NDVI vs. time and climate variables) for similar to 314,000 1-km(2) pixels comprising the state of New Mexico over an 18-year period (1989-2006).   The ability to detect NDVI trend was greatly improved by including climate variables in the multivariate analyses of the NDVI over time. Specifically, the fraction of pixels with a significant NDVI trend (mostly increasing) doubled from 5.2% of the pixels for the univariate autoregression analyses to 11.9% for the multivariate autoregression analyses. The comparisons of univariate and multivariate analyses also revealed that for most of the pixels with a significant NDVI trend in either analysis, the trend was consistent with changes in local factors rather than to broad-scale, slow changes (e.g., climate change); only 0.8% of the pixels had a significant NDVI trend associated with change in the climate variables. This latter finding is somewhat surprising given that several climate variables changed significantly over much of the state during the 18-year period, and the NDVI was significantly related to these variables in the multivariate autoregressions for much of the area. Close examination of several areas suggested that NDVI change in these areas was attributable to wildfires, agriculture, habitat restoration, and tree mortality associated with insect infestation.

In this study, we present a new automated approach to classifying burnt areas across the state of Queensland, Australia. The method is applied to complete time series of Landsat TM/ETM + imagery rather than single images and considers spectral (band 4, B4, and bands 4 + 5, B45), thermal, temporal and contextual information within a hierarchical framework. To maximise the available observations and the burnt area detected, we used imagery containing up to 60% cloud that was screened during pre-processing. Median filters were applied to smooth the time series and multi-date change detection used to locate negative outliers (large declines in reflectance relative to the median-smoothed time series). Watershed region growing was used to segment and map a larger spatial extent of the change while minimising commission errors. These segmented change objects were attributed as either burnt or unburnt using their thermal, reflective and contextual characteristics in a classification tree. Thermal information was found to be more important than reflective indices in the change attribution. Algorithm calibration used training data from ten Path/Rows located strategically across Queensland with four images sampled per path row (n = 40). Thresholds were optimised to maximise the burnt area detected while limiting under/over-growing of burnt area. Validation data covered a range of burnt areas from ten independent Path/Rows with ten images sampled across a range of burnt area fractions per Path/Row (n = 100). The results for burnt area mapping demonstrated an average producer\'s accuracy of 85% (range of 28 to 100% for individual images) and average user\'s accuracy of 71% (range of 4 to 99% for individual images). A morphological dilation of one pixel restricted to locations exhibiting a decline in B45 over time, increased the producer\'s accuracy by 4% but reduced the user\'s accuracy by 8%. The total accuracy for the burnt area classification was greater than 99%, however this is more a reflection of the small fraction of landscape represented by burnt area rather than the ability to detect burnt area. Areas frequently misdassified were related to areas of high spectral/land use change which included areas of cropping, frequently inundated land, and moisture/ground cover variations over dark soils. In this study, we applied a crop and water mask to minimise commission errors. Significantly, the results of this study demonstrate that an automated time series method for mapping burnt areas can be successfully applied across a diversity of land cover types. The method may be applied in similar savanna dominated environments but is likely to require modification to be applicable in other landscapes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Statistical methods and assimilation in numerical models had been so far the main ways to perform this type of blending, but these are relatively complicated methods that usually introduce other sources of error and uncertainty. In this paper, the existence of a multifractal hierarchy pervading the structure of all ocean scalars is exploited to introduce a new blending method. This method is not parametric and requires no knowledge about the physics governing the evolution of the scalars, provided that both scalars have the same multifractal structure. We have applied this methodology to SMOS SSS maps, using OI SST maps as template variables, observing not only a qualitative but also a significant quantitative improvement.

Data gaps and spatial and temporal inconsistencies exist in most of the existing global LAI products derived from single-satellite data because of their limited information content. Furthermore, the accuracy of current LAI products may not meet the requirements of certain applications. Therefore, LAI retrieval from multiple satellite data is becoming popular. An existing LAI inversion scheme using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique is further extended in this study to integrate temporal, spectral, and angular information from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), SPOT/VEGETATION, and Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) data. The recursive update of LAI climatology with the retrieved LAI and the coupling of a canopy radiative-transfer model and a dynamic process model using the EnKF technique can fill in missing data and produce a consistent accurate time-series LA! product. During each iteration, we defined a 5 * 1 sliding window and compared the RMSEs in the selected window to determine the minimum. Validation results at six sites demonstrate that the combination of temporal information from multiple sensors, spectral information provided by red and near-infrared (NIR) bands, and angular information from MISR bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) data can provide a more accurate estimate of LAI than previously available.

A key to modeling photochemical processes in these optically complex waters is an accurate description of the vertical distribution of UVR in the water column which can be obtained using the diffuse attenuation coefficients of downwelling irradiance (K-d(lambda)). The SeaUV/SeaUVc algorithms (Fichot et al., 2008) can accurately retrieve K-d (lambda = 320, 340, 380, 412, 443 and 490 nm) in oceanic and coastal waters using multispectral remote sensing reflectances (R-rs(lambda), SeaWiFS bands). However, SeaUV/SeaUVc algorithms are currently not optimized for use in optically complex, inshore waters, where they tend to severely underestimate K-d(lambda). Here, a new training data set of optical properties collected in optically complex, inshore waters was used to re-parameterize the original SeaUV/SeaUVc algorithms, resulting in improved K-d(lambda) retrievals for turbid, estuarine waters. Although the updated SeaUV/SeaUVc algorithms perform best in optically complex waters, the original SeaUV/SeaUVc models still perform well in most coastal and oceanic waters. Therefore, we propose a composite set of SeaUV/SeaUVc algorithms, optimized for K-d(lambda) retrieval in almost all marine systems, ranging from oceanic to inshore waters. The composite algorithm set can retrieve K-d from ocean color with good accuracy across this wide range of water types (e.g., within a mean relative error of 13% for K-d(340)). A validation step using three independent, in situ data sets indicates that the composite SeaUV/SeaUVc can generate accurate K-d(lambda) values at lambda = 320-490 nm from ocean color on a global scale. Taking advantage of the inherent benefits of our statistical methods, we pooled the validation data with the training set, obtaining an optimized composite model for estimating K-d(lambda) in UV wavelengths for almost all marine waters. This \"optimized composite\" set of SeaUV/SeaUVc algorithms will provide the optical community with improved ability to quantify the role of solar UV radiation in photochemical and photobiological processes in the ocean.

Local absorption and scattering properties were used to derive surface SPM maps from 84 cloud-free ENVISAT MERIS FR reflectance images of the Westerschelde estuary (51 degrees 30\' N, 3 degrees 30\' E) for the period 2006-2008, and validated with in situ SPM at fixed stations (r = 0.89 for geometric means). The distinctly different SPM maps were categorized for different tidal and seasonal conditions. Resulting composites reveal spatial patterns in SPM as a function of semi-diurnal tidal phase, fortnightly tidal phase, or season. For the estuary proper, tidal and seasonal effects on the variation of SPM are similar in magnitude. Observed controls for surface SPM are distance to shallow source area, tidal current velocity, and advection of North Sea and estuarine surface waters. Turbidity maxima appear only during favourable tidal and meteorological conditions. For the Westerschelde, the bias introduced by sun-synchronous sampling causes low water image acquisitions to uniquely coincide with spring tides, and high water images with neap tides. Cloud-free images were associated with low wind velocities. Simulations from a mud transport model confirmed the overestimation of geometric mean SPM from the tidal aliasing, and underestimation from fair weather. This resulted in a net relative error of -8% at the wave-exposed mouth, but biases cancelled out in the upper estuary. We argue that local biases should be considered when interpreting water quality products for estuaries and coasts around the world.

The wet year also had more medium inundated areas (SIP between 25% and 50%) than the average and dry years, but low inundated areas (SIP < 25%) did not have any particular trend. The mapped inundation changes were found correlated with local drought conditions and stream flow, with the near complete inundated and highly inundated areas having the highest correlations. Given the fact that Landsat are globally available and LiDAR data are becoming increasingly more affordable and available, the approach developed in this study has potential for deriving historical inundation changes over the past decades and for monitoring ongoing changes over much larger areas than demonstrated in this study.

The accuracy of the information however, is still not well established. This paper uses a stack of RADARSAT-2 D-InSAR data to map seasonal ground displacement at the Iqaluit Airport, Baffin Island, Canada. The accuracy and information content of the D-InSAR products are evaluated with a variety of ground truth data. The D-InSAR derived seasonal ground displacement patterns align well with surficial geology units and reflect the thaw settlement characteristics of the sediments; they also identify localised displacement patterns in the vicinity of features such as ice wedges and frost cracks. Comparisons with ground settlement measurements from in-situ thaw tubes indicate sub-centimetre agreement in dry areas. In low lying wet areas however, subject to saturation and flooding, the D-InSAR stack significantly underestimates the true settlement, detecting only 3.7 cm of the 8.5 cm thaw tube measurement The combination of high phase gradients and poor coherence over intermittently flooded surfaces makes it challenging to preserve reliable phase measurements in these areas. Information from electromagnetic surveys shows that some surface displacement is related to sub-surface conditions (<6 m depth), possibly conditions related to the presence and movement of water in the active layer and to a lesser extent, unfrozen water content within the permafrost.

These sensors will enable the use of compact polarimetry (CP) data in wide swath imagery. We investigate the sea ice type and open water classification potential of CP parameters for future RCM image modes. We simulate twenty three CP parameters for three RCM modes with different resolutions and noise floors, using RADARSAT-2 quad-polarized data. A case study is used encompassing multi-year sea ice, first-year sea ice and open water, in the Canadian Arctic. We use a methodology for quantitatively selecting the optimum CF parameter subset for classification. Preliminary CF parameter selection is based on Jeffries-Matusita separability. A batch-mode Maximum Likelihood classification approach is then used to iterate through all possible combinations of CP parameter subsets, in order to select the optimum subset, the one with the highest accuracy. Combinations between two and ten CP parameters, depending on RCM mode, are found to provide the highest accuracy. The effects of an increased noise level and higher resolution on different CP parameters are found to vary. However, the impact on classification accuracy is small. High classification accuracies support methodology for the selection of the working subset of the CP parameters and their classification potential. Multi-year sea ice, first-year sea ice and open water can be successfully classified with an overall classification accuracy of 99.92% using two simulated compact polarimetric parameters from the RCM LN25 mode: the circular cross polarization ratio and the volume scattering parameters of the m-chi and m-delta decompositions. In the same mode, the ice and the open water can be successfully discriminated with an overall accuracy of 100% using the sigma nought back-scattering coefficients sigma(RH)degrees and sigma(RR)degrees in addition to the two previous compact polarimetric parameters.

Waveform (WF) -recording sensors can provide a more detailed description of the vegetation than discrete return (DR) systems through accurate characterization of the backscattered signal. Furthermore, knowing the signal shape facilitates comparisons between real data and those obtained with simulation tools. We performed calibration and quantitative validation of a Monte Carlo ray tracing (MCRT) -based LiDAR simulator against real data, and used simulations and real data to study small-footprint WF-recording LiDAR for the classification of juvenile boreal forest vegetation. The simulations were based on geometric-optical models of three species: birch (Betula pendula Roth), raspberry (Rubus idaeus L), and fireweed (Chamerion angustifolium (L) Holub). Simulated WF features were in good agreement with the real data (differences of -19% to 11% in radiometric features, -0.23 m to 0.45 m in mean height), and relative interspecies differences were preserved. We used simulated data to study the effects of sensor parameters on the classification among the three species. An increase in footprint size improved the classification accuracy up to 0.30-036 m in diameter, while the emitted pulse width and the WF sampling rate showed minor effects. Finally, we used real data to classify four silviculturally important vegetation functional groups (conifers, broad-leaved trees, low vegetation (green), low vegetation (barren) + abiotic material). Classification accuracies of 68.1-86.7% (kappa 0.50-0.80) showed slight improvement compared with existing studies on DR LiDAR and passive optical data. The results of simulator validation serve as a basis for the future use of simulation models, e.g. in LiDAR survey planning or in the simulation of synthetic training data, while the other findings clarify the potential of small-footprint WF data for characterizing vegetation in intensively managed forest stands at seedling and sapling stages in the boreal region.

Point measurements are often not sufficient to capture the strong spatial variability particularly in mountain regions. Satellite remote sensing allows capturing the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation, yet it is generally characterized by significant bias. Rainfall satellite products such as those coming from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) are being continuously improved and an increasing amount of high- and medium-resolution remote sensing data on biophysical surface properties is becoming available. Here we present a methodology that blends two TRMM products with remote sensing data on vegetation and topography to quantify the spatial distribution of precipitation in areas where direct observations are lacking. The approach assumes that vegetation cover, the topography and satellite-derived estimates of rainfall are reasonable indirect measures of ground-based precipitation. The methodology is evaluated for an area in the Andes of Ecuador. The results show that around 40% of the variance in weekly precipitation is explained by these proxies. During the drier periods of the year, vegetation is the strongest proxy. In the very wet areas and during the wet periods vegetation is usually in a climax development phase with no development trends to correlate with rain, and the other proxies dominate precipitation estimation. A cross-validation procedure in which each one of the weather stations is sequentially excluded from the analysis, was applied to test the performance of the methodology. The performance was satisfactory, and as expected it is related to the density of the weather station network and temporal rainfall variability. Overall we conclude that the methodology is useful for areas with very high variable conditions, where sufficient ground-data is available to establish the relationships with the different remote sensing datasets.

Remote sensing of the sea ice albedo has hitherto been carried out using optical satellite instruments. However, the measured data is often insufficient in late summer and fall because of clouds and low solar elevations. Therefore, new methods are a prerequisite for realistic estimations for the global sea ice albedo over the whole melting-refreezing period. Here, we show that a new microwave based sea ice albedo estimation method alleviates problems of optical instruments, offering new albedo data especially during the refreezing periods even on a daily basis.

Cropland, grassland, deciduous and coniferous forests are considered. Using an integrated validation strategy, analyses of the representativeness of the surface heterogeneity under both dormant and snow-covered situations are performed to decide whether direct comparisons between ground measurements and 500-m satellite observations can be made or whether finer spatial resolution airborne or spaceborne data are required to scale the results at each location. Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data are used to generate finer scale representations of albedo at each location to fully link ground data with satellite data. In general, results indicate the root mean square errors (RMSEs) are less than 0.030 over spatially representative sites of agriculture/grassland during the dormant periods and less than 0.050 during the snow-covered periods for MCD43A albedo products. For forest, the RMSEs are less than 0.020 during the dormant period and 0.025 during the snow-covered periods. However, a daily retrieval strategy is necessary to capture ephemeral snow events or rapidly changing situations such as the spring snow melt. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We demonstrate that tidal variation in the lower Chesapeake Bay is one of the important ocean processes that drive significant changes of the ocean\'s optical and biogeochemical properties. Normalized water-leaving radiance spectra (nL(w)(lambda)), water diffuse attenuation coefficient at the wavelength of 490 nm (K-d(490)), and total suspended sediment (TSS) concentration show significant tidal variations in the lower Chesapeake Bay. Indeed, in the lower Bay region, K-d(490) increases from 0.9 m(-1) under low tidal current conditions at 0.10-0.15 m/s to 1.35 m(-1) under high tidal current conditions at 0.45-0.50 m/s, while chlorophyll-a concentration in the lower Bay region decreases slightly with an increase of the tidal current. Tide-driven variability in K-d(490) and TSS in the lower Bay is similar to and slightly larger than the seasonal variability in the region. On the other hand, different from the variability in the lower Bay, the tidal effects on the ecosystem are small and negligible in the middle and a large part of upper Chesapeake Bay regions.

The radiometric measurements were performed by a module of four NaI(Tl) crystals of 16 L mounted on an autogyro. We applied the collocated cokriging (CCoK) as a multivariate estimation method for interpolating the primary under-sampled airborne gamma-ray data considering the well-sampled geological information as ancillary variables. A random number has been assigned to each of 73 geological formations identified in the geological map at scale 1:10,000. The non-dependency of the estimated results from the random numbering process has been tested for three distinct models. The experimental cross-semivariograms constructed for radioelement-geology couples show well-defined co-variability structures for both direct and crossed variograms. The high statistical correlations among K, eU, and eTh measurements are confirmed also by the same maximum distance of spatial autocorrelation. Combining the smoothing effects of probabilistic interpolator and the abrupt discontinuities of the geological map, the results show a distinct correlation between the geological formation and radioactivity content. The contour of Mt. Capanne pluton can be distinguished by high K, eU and eTh abundances, while different degrees of radioactivity content identify the tectonic units. A clear anomaly of high K content in the Mt. Calamita promontory confirms the presence of felsic dykes and hydrothermal veins not reported in our geological map. Although we assign a unique number to each geological formation, the method shows that the internal variability of the radiometric data is not biased by the multivariate interpolation.

Conventional in-situ methods for quantifying hot spring heat flux may not always be feasible if there are low rates of flow or thermal waters are not confined to well-defined drainage channels. This paper describes the use of high spatial resolution airborne thermal infrared (TIR) imagery for quantifying the heat flux and corresponding outflow rate of hot springs using a case study of the Pilgrim Hot Springs geothermal system in western Alaska. The approach is based upon the use of a simplified, steady-state, heat budget model that describes the heat gains and losses from areas of thermal water to calculate the hot spring heat flux required to maintain the temperature of these waters above ambient conditions. Inputs to the model include calibrated surface temperature maps for areas of thermal water derived from processing of airborne TIR imagery acquired using a broadband forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera as well various atmospheric variables relevant to the thermodynamics of water bodies. The model is applied on a per-pixel basis to provide maps of the hot spring heat flux for the thermal waters. The total hot spring heat flux, representing the sum of the per-pixel heat fluxes, is used to calculate a corresponding hot spring outflow rate assuming a fixed hot spring temperature. This approach has been applied to TIR imagery acquired during two surveys over Pilgrim Hot Springs in Fall 2010 and Spring 2011. Although the heat budget model is particularly sensitive to wind speed, the results provide conservative estimates of the hot spring heat flux and outflow rates (at 81.3 degrees C) of similar to 4.7-6.7 MW thermal energy, and similar to 976-1400 1/min, respectively. These results are 2-3 times higher than field-based estimates of the hot spring heat flux derived using direct measurements of the flow rate in streams draining part of the thermal catchment at the site. This result is consistent with the synoptic capabilities of the airborne TIR data that map all areas of thermal water. This approach has significant potential as a rapid and repeatable method for quantitative investigations of spring-dominated geothermal systems in support of resource assessment, and long-term monitoring.

In this study, the Chesapeake Bay estuary was used as a model \"test bed\" to which we applied the power of near real-time satellite-derived observations to the issue of water quality monitoring. To use remote sensing in support of spatially complete estimates of salinity and temperature in the Bay, we tested geospatial interpolation techniques as a method for filling gaps and minimizing errors in the satellite record. These interpolated values were then compared to the output of a regional hydrodynamic model in order to assess the relative value of each method for generating inputs into various modeling applications. Results show that MODIS-derived salinity and temperature can be interpolated with acceptable accuracy in the Bay, with a mean absolute error of 1.88 psu and 0.60 degrees C. These errors differed systematically from ChesROMS errors both spatially and seasonally, with higher errors for salinity and lower errors for temperature at most sampling stations throughout the year. This suggests that the two techniques offer complementary information that can be applied to ecological monitoring systems in complex estuaries like Chesapeake Bay. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The SMC product, which is to be generated from Sentinel-1 data, requires an algorithm capable of processing operationally in near-real-time and delivering the product to the GMES services within 3 h from observation. An approach based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been proposed that represents a good compromise between retrieval accuracy and processing time, thus enabling compliance with the timeliness requirements. The algorithm has been tested and subsequently validated in several test areas in Italy, Australia, and Spain.   In all cases the validation results were very much in line with GMES requirements (with RMSE generally <4%SMC - between 1.67%SMC and 6.68%SMC - and very low bias), except for the case of the test area in Spain, where the validation results were penalized by the availability of only VV polarized SAR images and MODIS low-resolution NDVI.

Urban impervious surfaces affect hydrological and energy balances, as well as biological composition and functioning of ecosystems. Although datasets have been produced documenting urban growth at multiple time periods in coarse intervals, there remains an unmet need for observations spanning multiple decades at high frequency. We have developed an empirical method for retrieving annual, long-term continuous fields of impervious surface cover from the Landsat archive and applied it to the Washington, D.C.-Baltimore, MD megalopolis from 1984 to 2010. Fitting and applying a single regression model over time, the method relies on a multi-annual training sample of high-resolution impervious cover layers tied to coincident intra- and inter-annual Landsat image composites. These predictor images are composited and normalized to maximize discrimination of impervious surfaces from intermittently bare agricultural fields and minimize inter-annual variation due to phenology, solar illumination, and atmospheric noise. Excluding the year 2009 due to lack of data availability resulting from nearly continual winter snow cover, the resulting dataset is a continuous-field representation of impervious surface cover at 30-m horizontal and annual temporal resolution from 1984 to 2010. Average error was approximately +/- 6% cover, with outliers due to shadows from large buildings in winter images. The region\'s impervious surface cover grew from 881 to 1176 +/- 11 km(2) over the 27-year span-an average annual gain of approximately 11 +/- 2 km(2)/year-with great variability among local municipalities in terms of rate of development. Patterns including intensification (i.e., \"infill\") and expansion (i.e., exurban or \"sprawl\") of development, as well as fragmentation and isolation of natural areas were clearly visible in the data at various places and times. Neither impervious surface loss nor deceleration of growth were observed in any of the cities or counties over the study span. These findings show that empirical retrieval of impervious coverage at the spatial and temporal scale of the Landsat archive is possible using dense time-stacks of calibrated Landsat images, and that long-term records such as this can provide new opportunities for analyzing land-use patterns and their underlying causes to improve understanding of socio-economic processes and human-environment interactions.

The aim was to assess optimal approaches in using optical remote sensing to estimate ET. The first two approaches directly regressed various MODIS vegetation indices (VIs) and products such as leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) with ET and evaporative fraction (EF). In the third approach, the Penman-Monteith (PM) equation was inverted to obtain surface conductance (G(s)), for dry plant canopies. The G(s) values were then regressed against the MODIS data products and used to parameterize the PM equation for retrievals of ET. Jack-Knife cross-validation was used to evaluate the various regression models against observed ET. The PM-G(s) approach provided the lowest root mean square error (RMSE), and highest determination coefficients (R-2) across all sites, with an average RMSE = 38 W m(-2) and R-2=0.72. Direct regressions of observed ET against the VIs resulted in an average RMSE = 60 W m(-2) and R-2=0.22, while the EF regressions an average RMSE = 42 W m(-2) and R-2=0.64. The MODIS LAI and fPAR product produced the poorest estimates of ET (RMSE> 44 W m(-2) and R-2<0.6); while the VIs each performed best for some of the land cover types. The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) produced the best Er estimates for evergreen needleleaf forest (RMSE = 28.4W m(-2), R-2=0.66). The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) best estimated ET in grassland (RMSE = 23.8 W m(-2) and R-2=0.68), cropland (RMSE = 29.2 W m(-2) and R-2=0.86) and woody savannas (RMSE = 25.4 W m(-2) and R-2=0.82), while the VI-based crop coefficient (K-c) yielded the best estimates for evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forests (RMSE = 27 W m(-2) and R-2=0.7 in both cases). Using the ensemble-average of ET as estimated using NDVI, EVI and K-c we computed global grids of dry canopy conductance (G(c)) from which annual statistics were extracted to characterise different functional types. The resulting G(c) values can be used to parameterize land surface models. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

As a result, monitoring of the vegetation status over regions such as Amazonia has been a long standing interest of Earth scientists trying to determine the effect of climate change and anthropogenic disturbance on the tropical ecosystems and its feedback on the Earth\'s climate. Satellite-based remote sensing is the only practical approach for observing the vegetation dynamics of regions like the Amazon over useful spatial and temporal scales, but recent years have seen much controversy over satellite-derived vegetation states in Amazonia, with studies predicting opposite feedbacks depending on data processing technique and interpretation. Recent results suggest that some of this uncertainty could stem from a lack of quality in atmospheric correction and cloud screening. In this paper, we assess these uncertainties by comparing the current standard surface reflectance products (MYD09, MYD09GA) and derived composites (MYD09A1, MCD43A4 and MYD13A2 - Vegetation Index) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua satellite to results obtained from the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm. MAIAC uses a new cloud screening technique, and novel aerosol retrieval and atmospheric correction procedures which are based on time-series and spatial analyses. Our results show considerable improvements of MAIAC processed surface reflectance compared to MYD09/MYD13 with noise levels reduced by a factor of up to 10. Uncertainties in the current MODIS surface reflectance product were mainly due to residual cloud and aerosol contamination which affected the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): During the wet season, with cloud cover ranging between 90% and 99%, conventionally processed NDVI was significantly depressed due to undetected clouds. A smaller reduction in NDVI due to increased aerosol levels was observed during the dry season, with an inverse dependence of NDVI on aerosol optical thickness (AOT). NDVI observations processed with MAIAC showed highly-reproducible and stable inter-annual patterns with little or no dependence on cloud cover, and no significant dependence on AOT (p < 0.05). In addition to a better detection of cloudy pixels, MAIAC obtained about 20-80% more cloud free pixels, depending on season, a considerable amount for land analysis given the very high cloud cover (75-99%) observed at any given time in the area. We conclude that a new generation of atmospheric correction algorithms, such as MAIAC, can help to dramatically improve vegetation estimates over tropical rain forest, ultimately leading to reduced uncertainties in satellite-derived vegetation products globally.

Meteorological data used for model-based predictions of mosquito abundance and life cycle dynamics are typically acquired from ground-based weather stations: however, data availability and completeness are often limited by sparse networks and resource availability. In contrast, environmental measurements from satellite remote sensing are more spatially continuous and can be retrieved automatically. This study compared environmental measurements from the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on EOS (AMSR-E) and in situ weather station data to examine their ability to predict the abundance of two important mosquito species (Aedes vexans and Culex tarsalis) in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, USA from 2005 to 2010. The AMSR-E land parameters included daily surface water inundation fraction, surface air temperature, soil moisture, and microwave vegetation opacity. The AMSR-E derived models had better fits and higher forecasting accuracy than models based on weather station data despite the relatively coarse (25-km) spatial resolution of the satellite data. In the AMSR-E models, air temperature and surface water fraction were the best predictors of Aedes vexans, whereas air temperature and vegetation opacity were the best predictors of Cx. tarsalis abundance. The models were used to extrapolate spatial, seasonal, and interannual patterns of climatic suitability for mosquitoes across eastern South Dakota. Our findings demonstrate that environmental metrics derived from satellite passive microwave radiometry are suitable for predicting mosquito population dynamics and can potentially improve the effectiveness of mosquito-borne disease early warning systems.

High resolution multispectral satellite imagery is used to identify active landslides, to investigate their close association with seasonally wet zones (areas covered by free surface-water including ponds, migrating surface-water, seeps), as well as to guide subsurface hydrogeological investigations. By combining the remotely sensed surface information and the extensive subsurface dataset from over 40 monitoring piezometer bore-holes we demonstrate that many wet zones initially mapped from the IKONOS imagery are indicative of sites with seasonally persistent very high groundwater levels within landslide-prone slopes and on intermittently active landslides. Where such surface-subsurface water linkage can be established, the appearance of the wet zones (fully saturated ground/soil) resulting from groundwater discharge or seepage can be used as a forewarning signal of the increased susceptibility to landsliding, since the hillslopes with shallow groundwater tables are generally more prone to failure. The information about changing surface-water conditions retrieved from high resolution satellite data timely acquired during rainy seasons can thus provide crucial input for temporal and spatial landslide hazard assessments. We anticipate that in the near future high resolution optical space-borne remote sensing will become a commonly used tool for monitoring landslide activity and for providing temporal series of spatial data necessary to improve our understanding of causative and triggering processes leading to slope failures.

Airborne laser scanner (ALS) data were acquired to augment data from a systematic sample of National Forest Inventory (NFI) ground plots in Hedmark County, Norway (27,390 km(2)). Approximately 50% of the NFI field plots were covered by the systematic ALS sample of 53 parallel flight lines spaced 6 km apart. The area was stratified into eight cover classes and independent log-transformed regression models were developed for each class to predict total above-ground dry biomass (AGB). The two laser-ground estimation strategies tested were a model-dependent (MD), two-phase approach that rests on the assumption that the predictive models are correctly specified, and a model-assisted (MA) approach with a two-stage probability sampling design which utilizes design-unbiased estimators. ALS AGB estimates were reported by land cover class and compared to the NH ground estimates. The ALS-based MA and MD mean estimates differed from the NFI AGB estimates by about 2% and 8%, respectively, for the entire County. At the county level the smallest estimated standard error (SE) for the estimates was obtained using the field data alone. However, the SEs calculated from field and ALS data were based on unequal numbers of ground plots. When considering only the NFI plots in the ALS strips, the smallest SEs were obtained using the MD framework. However, we also illustrated the sensitivity of the estimates of applying different plausible models. All the applied estimators assumed simple random sampling while the selection of flight lines as well as ground plots followed a systematic design. Thus, the estimates of SE were most likely conservative. Simulated sampling undertaken in a parallel research effort suggests that the overestimation of the SEs was probably much larger for the ALS-based estimates compared to the NEI estimates. ALS-based estimates were also derived for sub-county political units and thereby demonstrated how limited sample sizes affect the standard error of the biomass estimates. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This offers the opportunity to generate a combined product that incorporates the advantages of both microwave techniques and spans the observation period starting 1979. However, there are several challenges in developing such a dataset, e.g., differences in instrument specifications result in different absolute soil moisture values, the global passive and active microwave retrieval methods produce conceptually different quantities, and products vary in their relative performances depending on vegetation density. This paper presents an approach for combining four passive microwave products from the VU University Amsterdam/National Aeronautics and Space Administration and two active microwave products from the Vienna University of Technology. First, passive microwave soil moisture retrievals from the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission microwave imager (TMI) instruments were scaled to the climatology of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) derived product and then all four were combined into a single merged passive microwave product. Second, active microwave soil moisture estimates from the European Remote Sensing (ERS) Scatterometer instrument were scaled to the climatology of the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) derived estimates. Both were combined into a merged active microwave product. Finally, the two merged products were rescaled to a common globally available reference soil moisture dataset provided by a land surface model (GLDAS-1-Noah) and then blended into a single passive/active product. Blending of the active and passive data sets was based on their respective sensitivity to vegetation density. While this three step approach imposes the absolute values of the land surface model dataset to the final product, it preserves the relative dynamics (e.g., seasonality and inter-annual variations) of the original satellite derived retrievals. More importantly, the long term changes evident in the original soil moisture products were also preserved. The method presented in this paper allows the long term product to be extended with data from other current and future operational satellites. The multi-decadal blended dataset is expected to enhance our basic understanding of soil moisture in the water, energy and carbon cycles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '[Liu, Y.

The Landsat differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) has become the standard spectral index for assessing fire severity. The dNBR is generally calculated using the first available cloud-free post-fire image and a pre-fire image. This bitemporal image differencing can be problematic due to image-to-image differences in illumination and phenology for example. We have developed an alternative index based on single date short-wave infrared (SWIR) and mid infrared (MIR) reflectance. In contrast with the (d)NBR, the SWIR-MIR index (SMI) is robust against scattering caused by smoke plumes over active fires allowing fire severity assessments to be generated when the area is still obscured by smoke. The SMI was generated using MODIS/ASTER (MASTER) airborne simulator data acquired over the recent 2011 Wallow fire in Arizona, USA. Simulation experiments showed that the SMI is more sensitive to char fractional cover than the NBR. We performed a regression analysis in which 92 Geo Composite Burn Index (GeoCBI) field plots of severity were randomly assigned to two equal halves, a training and a validation dataset, during ten separate trials. The SMI performed better to estimate GeoCBI values than the NBR (SMI R-2=0.69 +/- 0.06 and NBR R-2=0.60 +/- 0.06). The dNBR demonstrated slightly better performance than the SMI (dNBR R-2= 0.71 +/- 0.05), however this difference was not significant at the 95% confidence level. Although no spaceborne sensors with pixel sizes smaller than 100 m currently offer the possibility of a SWIR-MIR band combination, the airborne results illustrate the potential of this band combination for the remote sensing of post-fire effects. Such data will become available with the advent of the next generation satellite sensors, such as the planned spaceborne Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI).

We developed approaches to create disturbance and regrowth maps for forests within the area of the NWFP from the results of LandTrendr, a temporal segmentation algorithm described previously only at the pixel scale. Maps were developed from 674 Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper + images distributed across 22 separate scene areas, and were assessed for validity at 2360 points using TimeSync, a time-series validation and interpretation tool. Unlike maps derived using other techniques, maps derived from the segmentation approach were unique in providing simultaneous detection of abrupt disturbance, chronic disturbance, and ongoing vegetative growth with consistency across large areas and across time. Maps were then used to address six core monitoring questions focusing on the distribution of disturbance across time, ownership categories, and ecoregions. Forest was disturbed at rates that varied by ownership category and state, ranging from 9% to >39% of forest area over the period 1985 to 2008, with highest cumulative disturbed area on private and native lands in Washington and Oregon and lowest disturbed area on federal protected lands in Washington. Effects of court injunctions and subsequent implementation of the NWFP lowered forest disturbance rates, particularly in Oregon, and also caused decreases in the relative magnitude of disturbance on those lands relative to private lands. State-managed forests showed forest disturbance rates that varied considerably among the three states, with the highest rates in Washington state and lowest in California. Affected by large, stochastic fire events, protected lands in both Oregon and California showed disturbance rates similar to those found on actively managed federal lands. Protected lands also experienced high rates of chronic disturbance, often associated with insect-related mortality. As expected, moisture-limited ecoregions recovered vegetation more slowly than those where moisture was not limiting. Vegetative regrowth rates showed substantial variation among ownership categories. suggesting that differential forest policies may affect vegetative recovery rate. Taken together, these results emphasize that forest management policies do have manifestations at the landscape scale, but that detection of these manifestations is best achieved with mapping approaches that can detect both abrupt and longer-duration processes within the Landsat archive.

Wheat leaf BRF measurements were completed under 45 degrees zenith illumination angle in three visible broad spectral bands with a conoscope that provides very high angular resolution data over a large portion of the whole hemisphere, including around the illumination direction. The measurements show a clear anisotropy with a specular lobe in the forward scattering direction and a small but significant hotspot feature in the backward scattering direction. The BRF directional features further depend on the illumination orientation because of the leaf roughness created by longitudinal veins: the specular lobe was more pronounced when the illumination was perpendicular to the veins, while specular reflection was more spread over azimuths for longitudinal illumination. Moreover, a sharp hotspot feature was observed for transversal illumination where the apparent roughness is the largest. The scattering was tentatively decomposed into specular, hotspot and isotropic components. Results showed that the hotspot contribution to the directional hemispherical reflectance factor (DHRF) was marginal conversely to that of the specular component that ranges between 0.036 and 0.050 (absolute DHRF value). The specular component was almost the same in the three visible bands considered. The isotropic component originating from volume scattering was contributing the most to the DHRF and was depending on wavelength, ranging between 0.055 and 0.097 in absolute DHRF value. A simple model was proposed to estimate the volume scattering from the isotropic and the surface components. Consequences of these findings were drawn on the ability to estimate leaf biochemical composition independently from leaf surface scattering, as well as on the interpretation of remote sensing at the canopy level.

The analysis of Saharan dust outflow and Southwest African smoke outflow regions shows that the above-cloud AOD correlates positively with AI in an approximately linear manner, and that the AOD(532)/AI ratio decreases with increasing COD. The dependence of AOD(532)/AI ratio on COD doesn\'t depend on aerosol type when potential biases in the CALIOP AOD measurements are empirically accounted for. Our results may suggest the potential of combining OMI AI and MODIS cloud measurements to empirically derive above-cloud AOD with a spatial coverage much more extensive than CALIPSO measurements, which needs 10 be further explored in the future.

A method is presented that uses the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) flying on the Terra platform to fill in spatial gaps in the Aqua MODIS LST dataset over the conterminous United States (CONUS) and limited adjacent areas. Over this domain, data are available for only about 50% of all times and pixels for each of the two MODIS sensors. Coverage is highest in summer and lowest in winter, with major regional variations. The relative close temporal proximity (similar to 3 h) of the Aqua and Terra overpasses provides an opportunity to combine information from the two data sources, which can reduce the data loss, most of which we assume is cloud-related. We applied the approach to create a \'merged\' data set that supplements existing Aqua and Terra daytime and nighttime LST products. We used Terra LST data to fill gaps in Aqua data, resulting in a data set tied to the similar to 1:30 AM/PM overpass times, so that the resulting data closely approximate daily minimum and maximum LST values. In order to use Terra LST observations to supplement Aqua data, an adjustment was applied to account for the different overpass times of the two platforms. Terra\'s 10:30 AM overpass usually senses a cooler surface than does Aqua with its 1:30 PM overpass. Conversely, for nighttime overpasses, Terra typically measures a warmer surface at 10:30 PM than does Aqua at 1:30 AM. Our approach was to determine, by season, mean Aqua and Terra LST values on the CONUS grid, based on data from a multi-year (2003-2008) period. Adding the mean Aqua-Terra LST differences for the respective season and time of day to a daily gridded Terra LST field removes the mean offset related to overpass time, resulting in LST values that can then be used to fill Aqua LST data gaps. Using independent offsets for each grid cell and season provides a first-order accounting for factors such as land cover, elevation, terrain slope and aspect, latitude, season and snow cover, which control the diurnal cycle of LST. For the six-year period, the merged data set increases data coverage by 24% and 30% for daytime and nighttime overpasses, respectively, relative to the Aqua LST product alone. The CONUS data set is a potentially valuable tool for weather and climate studies in which high spatial and temporal coverage are desired. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

The majority of studies to date have used the coarse spatial resolution datasets of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). In this study, we hypothesize that night-time lights can serve as an indicator for demographic and socio-economic properties of built-up areas at a local scale. We used night-time light images acquired by the American DMSP (2003, 2.7 km), Argentinean SAC-C (2007, 300 m) and photographs taken by astronauts from the International Space Station (ISS; 2003. 60 m). We compared the night-time lights of built-up areas based on their geographical location (Israel and the West Bank) and their population (Jewish and Arab). Israeli localities were better lit than West Bank localities, corresponding to the difference in the gross domestic product of the two entities. No difference was found in the night-time lights brightness of Jewish and Arab localities within Israel. However, night-time lights of built-up areas with a Jewish population within Israel and the West Bank were positively correlated with population density and roads density. In contrast, built-up areas with an Arab population had weaker correlations. Differences in the urban structure of Jewish and Arab built-up areas, as well as economic and geopolitical differences between Israel and the West Bank led to the observed differences in night-time lights patterns. Demographic and infrastructure data were able to explain 60% of the spatial variation of the ISS night-time lights, compared with only 28% of the spatial variation of the DMSP night-time lights dataset. The results of this study demonstrate potential uses of night-time lights databases of high spatial resolution, and emphasize the need for a dedicated night-time lights observing satellite.

Current limited records on forest structure, composition, successional stage and disturbances contribute to large uncertainties in estimates of carbon stocks and fluxes in this zone. Our ability to monitor ongoing changes in forest cover has improved with the influx of remotely sensed data products since 2000 from multiple satellite platforms. Here we present a method aimed at reconstructing disturbance history from a known distribution of land cover. We developed and tested the method over a biologically and topographically diverse region of the Russian Far East. This method explores capabilities introduced through fusion of the long-term but spatially limited Landsat data archive and the spatially continuous but temporally limited 2000-present data record from the Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Landsat data from 1972 to 2002 were used to develop a reference disturbance dataset to train and validate a MODIS-based decision tree classification. The results showed a reliable differentiation of disturbed and mature forests with an overall accuracy of 88% (Kappa 0.73).

These four components are polarimetric decomposition. PolSAR interferometry, object-oriented image analysis, and decision tree algorithms. First, polarimetric decomposition can be used to support the classification of PoISAR data. It is aimed at extracting polarimetric parameters related to the physical scattering mechanisms of the observed objects. Second, PoISAR interferometry is used to extract polarimetric interferometric information to support LULC classification. Third, the main purposes of object-oriented image analysis are delineating image objects, as well as extracting various textural and spatial features from image objects to improve classification accuracy. Finally, a decision tree algorithm provides an efficient way to select features and implement classification. A comparison between the proposed method and the Wishart supervised classification which is based on the coherency matrix was made to test the performance of the proposed method. The overall accuracy of the proposed method was 86.64%, whereas that of the Wishart supervised classification was 69.66%. The kappa value of the proposed method was 0.84, much higher than that of the Wishart supervised classification, which exhibited a kappa value of 0.65. The results indicate that the proposed method exhibits much better performance than the Wishart supervised classification for LULC classification. Further investigation was carried out on the respective contribution of the four components to LULC classification using RADARSAT-2 PoISAR data, and it indicates that all the four components have important contribution to the classification. Polarimetric information has significant implications for identifying different vegetation types and distinguishing between vegetation and urban/built-up. The polarimetric interferometric information extracted from repeat-pass RADARSAT-2 images is important in reducing the confusion between urban/built-up and vegetation and that between barren/sparsely vegetated land and vegetation. Object-oriented image analysis is very helpful in reducing the effect of speckle in PoISAR images by implementing classification based on image objects, and the textural information extracted from image objects is helpful in distinguishing between water and lawn. The decision tree algorithm can achieve higher classification accuracy than the nearest neighbor classification implemented using Definiens Developer 7.0, and the accuracy of the decision tree algorithm is similar with that of the support vector classification which is implemented based on the features selected using genetic algorithms. Compared with the nearest neighbor and support vector classification, the decision tree algorithm is more efficient to select features and implement classification. Furthermore, the decision tree algorithm can provide clear classification rules that can be easily interpreted based on the physical meaning of the features used in the classification. This can provide physical insight for LULC classification using PoISAR data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The land surface temperature (LST) is accessible on the pan-arctic scale through a number of remote sensing platforms, such as the \"Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer\" (MODIS). This study compares remotely sensed LST from MODIS to ground-based point measurements of the snow surface temperature on Svalbard for seven consecutive winters, thus covering more than half of the winter seasons in the operation period of MODIS Terra and Aqua. We find a systematic negative bias of the average winter surface temperature computed from single LST measurements between 1.5 and 6 K, with a mean bias of 3 K. The bias consistently occurs both for the MODIS L2 and for the daily and eight-day MODIS L3 products, which is explained by two reasons: i) During winter on Svalbard, cold surface temperatures are associated with clear-sky conditions, while warm surface temperatures typically occur during overcast periods. This leads to an overrepresentation of cold temperature in averages computed from remotely sensed LST measurements. ii) The MODIS cloud detection scheme fails to recognize some cloud-covered or partially cloud-covered situations, thus leading to admixing of colder cloud top temperatures. Both effects contribute equally to the total average bias accumulated over the winter season, with effect (i) dominating in some winters, while the observed bias can be fully explained by (ii) in other winters.

Small inaccuracies in the height measurements result from the interaction among the different parts of the ALS system and differ within each strip. Therefore, some additional strips are flown perpendicular to the main flight direction and across the first set of strips. Strip adjustment is carried out by using information from the additional flight strips. Even if low density data are acquired for the main block, due to the double coverage, the return density under the additional strips flown may be high enough for the use of individual tree crown (ITC) approaches. The study analyzed how this kind of high and low density ALS data can be combined in order to improve k-nearest neighbor (kNN) predictions. An ITC approach was followed to predict tree attributes for automatically segmented tree crowns on more than 580 artificially created sample plots under high density flight strips. No field-measured trees were available for these artificial plots. The predicted tree attributes of the artificial plots and the measured tree attributes of 154 sample plots were then aggregated to the plot level. For all sample plots, plot-level metrics were derived from low density ALS data. The metrics were used as explanatory variables in a kNN model to predict above-ground biomass. The kNN model was validated on external data.   The combined use of artificial plots and sample plots resulted in smaller relative root mean squared differences (RRMSD) (26.7%) compared to the use of the sample plots alone (28.5%). It can be concluded that the use of artificial plots improves the accuracy of kNN predictions. This is especially the case if the data range of sample plots for which predictions are sought is not adequately covered by the sample plots used to fit the kNN model. To illustrate this, approximately 30% of the sample plots with the largest and smallest biomass values were omitted. In this case, the combined use of artificial plots and sample plots resulted in a RRMSD of 29.7%, whereas the use of the sample plots alone resulted in a RRMSD of 37.4%. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

New Zealand has three subcategories of forest, namely: Natural forest; Pre-1990 forest; and Post-1989 forest. The Post-1989 forest carbon inventory undertaken in 2008 used discrete return airborne LiDAR and ground-based measurements of 0.06 ha circular plots located on a 4-km x 4-km grid. The national carbon stock estimate was based on a double sampling scheme consisting of 246 plots from which both ground and LiDAR data were obtained, supplemented with 46 additional plots assessed using only LiDAR. This paper describes the relationships established between carbon stocks estimated using ground-based measurements and LiDAR metrics. A regression model explaining 74% of the variation in total carbon was developed using LiDAR 30th percentile height (P3Oht) and canopy cover (%Cover). The regression estimator improved the precision of the national carbon stock estimate in 2008 by 6% compared to the ground-based estimate. This inventory indicates that it is possible to reduce the cost of obtaining carbon stock estimates to a specified level of precision using a combination of ground-based and LiDAR measurements in a double sampling approach. The theoretical maximum improvement in precision expected in 2012, when additional LiDAR data are expected to be available, is 50-55%. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

However high amounts of aerosol in the atmosphere, such as after a major volcanic eruption, lead to a cool bias on the sea surface temperatures retrieved from single view sensors such as the AVHRR. The Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) series of instruments provide a better climate-quality SST data record but are only available from 1991. The purpose of the work presented in this paper was to develop and test a method of reducing the bias in AVHRR Pathfinder SST during periods of high stratospheric volcanic aerosol. In this paper we take the ATSR record to be the reference SST for calculating the bias on the AVHRR Pathfinder SSTs during the Pinatubo eruption aerosol period (1991-1992). The analysis gives a bias of approximately -0.1 K for AVHRR Pathfinder SSTs in periods with low atmospheric aerosol and a much larger bias (globally -0.44 K in September to November 1991) in periods affected by volcanic aerosol. This paper shows the bias can largely be corrected using a multi-linear regression with aerosol optical depths from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) during periods of high volcanic aerosol. The AVHRR Pathfinder minus ATSR SST bias, for grid-boxes where the correction with TOMS can be applied, is reduced from -0.53 K to -0.12 K in a three month period heavily affected by the stratospheric aerosol. This bias corrected value is close to the bias during low atmospheric aerosol loading periods. A three-way error analysis technique was used to evaluate the random retrieval uncertainty as measured by standard deviation on the SST datasets before and after bias correction. AVHRR Pathfinder SST error in the months after the Pinatubo eruption fell from 0.53 K uncorrected to 0.20 K after correction which shows the correction technique has value.

Reported LiDAR errors range from 17 to 40 Mg C ha(-1), but should be lower at coarser resolutions because relative errors are expected to scale with (plot area)(-1/2). We tested this prediction empirically using a 50-ha plot with mapped trees, allowing an assessment of LiDAR prediction errors at multiple spatial resolutions. We found that errors scaled approximately as expected, declining by 38% (compared to 40% predicted from theory) from 0.36- to 1-ha resolution. We further reduced errors at all spatial resolutions by accounting for tree crowns that are bisected by plot edges (not typically done in forestry), and collectively show that airborne LiDAR can map carbon stocks with 10% error at 1-ha resolution a level comparable to the use of field plots alone.

Published reports of positive results have been truly international in scope. However, for these techniques to be more useful, they must be able to contribute to scientific inference which, for sample-based methods, requires estimates of uncertainty in the form of variances or standard errors. Several parametric approaches to estimating uncertainty for nearest neighbors techniques have been proposed, but they are complex and computationally intensive. For this study, two resampling estimators, the bootstrap and the jackknife, were investigated and compared to a parametric estimator for estimating uncertainty using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) technique with forest inventory and Landsat data from Finland, Italy, and the USA. The technical objectives of the study were threefold: (1) to evaluate the assumptions underlying a parametric approach to estimating k-NN variances: (2) to assess the utility of the bootstrap and jackknife methods with respect to the quality of variance estimates, ease of implementation, and computational intensity; and (3) to investigate adaptation of resampling methods to accommodate cluster sampling. The general conclusions were that support was provided for the assumptions underlying the parametric approach, the parametric and resampling estimators produced comparable variance estimates, care must be taken to ensure that bootstrap resampling mimics the original sampling, and the bootstrap procedure is a viable approach to variance estimation for nearest neighbor techniques that use very small numbers of neighbors to calculate predictions.

While such approaches provide valuable results, some still lack the required level of robustness and all lack the ability to fully automate the detection and mapping of landfast ice over large areas and long time spans. This paper introduces an alternative approach to mapping landfast ice extent that is based on coherent processing of interferometric L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The approach is based on a combined interpretation of interferometric phase pattern and interferometric coherence images to extract the extent and stability of landfast ice. Due to the low complexity of the base imagery used for landfast ice extraction, significant improvements in automation and reduction of required manual interactions by operators can be achieved. A performance analysis shows that L-band interferometric SAR (InSAR) data enable the mapping of landfast ice with high robustness and accuracy for a wide range of environmental conditions.
